MR Filippo Maria Pandolfi, EC commissioner for research and development,
yesterday proposed a big increase in research spending by the Community from
Ecu2.4bn (Pounds 1.7bn) this year to Ecu4.2bn in 1997, writes Andrew Hill in
Brussels.
Mr Pandolfi will present his R&amp;D strategy to fellow commissioners in
Strasbourg next week. Speaking during a conference on the future of
cross-border Community research, Mr Pandolfi said the EC had to combine
funding for traditional small projects with 'more focused activities -
technological priority projects, related to some key technologies on which
the competitiveness of European industry depends'.

<TEXT>
MR Pierre Beregovoy, France's new prime minister, has until the March 1993
general election to transform the fortunes of the embattled Socialist
government.
He will have to get to grips with sensitive social problems, requiring the
prime minister to extend his skills well beyond the efficient economic
management on which he has built his reputation.
The main issues include:
Unemployment. This has crept up, during the past two years, to 2.88m, or 9.9
per cent of the workforce and well above the European average. It will soon
pass the psychologically and politically important 3m level.
Some blame Mr Beregovoy's economic polices for this. He said cutting
unemployment would be 'the priority' for his government, though he added: 'I
will not promise a miracle or a magic solution.'
Immigration. This is seen as a factor in the sporadic outbursts of urban
violence which fuel demands from the extreme right-wing National Front for a
clampdown on disorder. Mr Beregovoy needs to show that the government has an
answer, while not upsetting Socialist supporters' conscience over human
rights.
Environment. Mr Beregovoy will have to woo the two green parties, the Greens
and Generation Ecologie, which emerged as potential partners for the
government last month when they won a combined 14 per cent of the vote. Yet
both waver over whether or not, and at what price, they will support the
Socialists. The Greens said yesterday they would not support them.
Among the two parties' demands are an end to France's experimental
fast-breeder nuclear power programme, a ban on nuclear tests in the south
Pacific, a freeze on some motorway projects, and proportional representation
in the general election. Any deal with the environmentalists will need to
respect Socialist loyalty to France's nuclear energy programme.
Corruption. Mr Beregovoy will need to clean up the Socialists' image,
tarnished by a police inquiry into corrupt methods of raising party funds
and by a misjudged attempt to give an amnesty to some of those involved.
Also at stake is the independence of the judiciary, jeopardised by
government interference in its investigations of corrupt political funding.
Economy. This is the least of Mr Beregovoy's worries. With inflation at 3
per cent and a growth forecast of 2 per cent this year, France is better off
than most of its European partners. The slight worry is that Mr Beregovoy
appears to be losing some of his old budgetary rigour. Due to lower than
expected tax revenues, the budget deficit last year overshot its target by
63 per cent to come out at FFr131.7bn (Pounds 13.6bn). This year, it could
exceed FFr150bn, unless the government takes corrective action. Mr Beregovoy
will want to curb the deficit to defend the franc, but this might not be
politically feasible.
Industrial policy. He is unlikely to follow the habit of his predecessor,
Mrs Edith Cresson, of interfering whenever a state-owned company seeks a
foreign partner, as she did with computer group Bull's links with NEC of
Japan and IBM of the US. Also, this market liberal is expected to continue
the programme of partial privatisations.
France's public deficits must be brought under control and domestic savings
encouraged in order to avoid tensions arising from the mounting debt service
burden, Mr Jacques de Larosiere, governor of the Bank of France, has told
President Francois Mitterrand, AP-DJ reports from Paris.
In a letter accompanying the Bank of France's annual report, Mr de Larosiere
said monetary policy should remain directed at reducing inflation and
stabilising the franc inside the European Monetary System. Interest rates
should aim to encourage savings 'in an economy that continues to be marked
by an excessive dependence on foreign capital'. This was needed to cover the
current account deficit and to finance foreign investment.

FT  03 APR 92 / Beregovoy replaces Cresson as French PM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR PIERRE BEREGOVOY was yesterday named France's new prime minister by
President Francois Mitterrand in an attempt to reverse the declining
fortunes of the Socialist party.
After a week of intense speculation, Mr Beregovoy succeeded Mrs Edith
Cresson, whose 10-month tenure was the shortest in the history of the Fifth
Republic and who broke all records for unpopularity. She resigned following
the Socialists' catastrophic defeats in regional and local elections last
month.
Mr Beregovoy, 66, a self-taught economist and long-serving finance minister,
was quick to announce new policy initiatives. 'The first big priority is the
fight against all forms of unemployment with new and bold initiatives,' he
said.
A slimmer and younger cabinet was announced last night, though some
ministerial posts were unchanged. Mr Michel Sapin, 39, former junior justice
minister, was a surprise appointment as finance minister - an indication Mr
Beregovoy wants to retain strong influence in his old domain. Mr Roland
Dumas remains foreign minister and Mr Pierre Joxe defence minister.
Mr Bernard Tapie, 49, the millionaire businessman who fought a pugnacious
Socialist-backed campaign in the regional elections, entered the government
as urban affairs minister.
Few expect Mr Beregovoy to give dramatic new directions to policy. He is an
economic liberal, while his predecessor was an enthusiastic interventionist.
He can be expected to steer clear of government activism in industrial
policy experiments.
Much of his time is likely to be taken up in trying to reverse the decline
in the Socialists' standing in opinion polls. It has had an uninterrupted
fall ever since Mrs Cresson was appointed little more than 10 months ago. He
also has to prepare for general elections due inside a year. His most
immediate practical problem is to get legislation through parliament. The
Socialist government does not command an absolute majority, and Communists
and centrists are likely to be more awkward than before.
As the first woman to become prime minister in France, Mrs Cresson's
appointment in May last year created a shortlived media sensation. Almost
immediately she began to sink in the opinion polls. Her poor standing was
attributed by many to her contentious and combative attitude, and her
tendency to make crude and graceless political remarks.
In one celebrated interview she characterised the Japanese as 'ants' and a
quarter of British men as 'homosexuals'.
Mr Beregovoy, by contrast, is a model of self-control and moderation and can
be counted on to avoid any public faux pas. He has long been a close
associate of Mr Mitterrand, serving as his secretary-general in the Elysee
Palace during the first years of his presidency.
Though Mrs Cresson's resignation became inevitable after the regional
elections, it was delayed by four days of consultations by Mr Mitterrand. He
is reported to have considered other candidates, including Mr Jacques
Delors, president of the European Commission.
Mr Beregovoy's long tenure of the finance ministry and his achievements both
in bringing down inflation and in liberating financial markets are bound to
be reassuring in business circles.
He told a party meeting yesterday his priorities were economic recovery and
the fight against unemployment, the maintenance of law and order, European
integration and protection of the environment.

FT  03 APR 92 / Heron seeks rescheduling as asset values fall by Pounds 400m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HERON International, Mr Gerald Ronson's property group, will this morning
tell a crisis meeting of its banks that the property market slump has wiped
more than Pounds 400m off the value of its net assets.
The gravity of the group's financial difficulties will be brought home to
banks and holders of Heron's bonds when they are asked to defer principal
repayments on debt until the late 1990s. Heron, which owes Pounds 450m on
bonds and a further Pounds 850m in bank borrowings, will also ask for some
interest to be deferred.
The company will stress that it still has more than Pounds 100m of cash  -
but the property market collapse has reduced its capacity to generate
additional cash for repayments.
It hopes to be able to repay everything in full, but not on the original
schedule, which required substantial principal payments over the next few
years. Heron will ask for these to be deferred to the late 1990s.
More than 80 banks will attend today's meeting. They will be told that
Heron's net assets at the end of March 1992 were worth an estimated Pounds
150m, compared with Pounds 585m a year earlier.
The collapse in the net asset figure means Heron expects to be in breach of
covenants on its bank loans. Since one of the covenants stipulates that
Heron's assets should be worth more than Pounds 350m, the company is being
forced to renegotiate the terms of its loans. Its principal banks, led by
Barclays of the UK, have been told of its restructuring plans, though
smaller bank lenders are likely to be shocked by the proposals.
However, the company is most nervous about the reaction of bondholders.
Heron has 11 bonds in issue. Companies in financial difficulties often have
trouble persuading bondholders to support restructuring plans.
Heron believes the new terms will ultimately give banks and bondholders
returns equivalent to what they would have earned,
but is not offering any incentives such as increased interest rates or
promises of equity in the business to persuade them to back the plan.

FT  03 APR 92 / Labour hints at deal on PR
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday signalled a willingness to strike a deal with other parties
on electoral reform as Mr John Major closed off the option of an accord with
the Liberal Democrats to save his prime ministership.
With the looming prospect of a hung parliament next Thursday's general
election, Mr Major said the Liberal Democrats' calls for electoral reform
would lead to damaging uncertainty and indecision.
'There are no circumstances in which I would introduce proportional
representation,' he pledged.
However, Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, shifted in the opposite
direction, with a pledge - if elected - to open membership of the party's
inquiry on electoral reform, the 'Plant committee', to other political
parties.
Senior Labour officials denied it was a deliberate response to the Liberal
Democrats' surge in opinion polls, describing the move as part of a
pre-agreed strategy to broaden the appeal of Labour policies. The move was
swiftly derided by the Liberal Democrats.
However, senior colleagues of Mr Kinnock indicated that the stance Labour
was formulating on constitutional reform - including its pledge to Scottish
devolution - might be enough to split off some Liberal Democrat MPs in the
event of a hung parliament.
To the annoyance of Liberal Democrats, Mr Kinnock again refused to make
public his own views on proportional representation. Liberal Democrat
strategists, however, are delighted to have set constitutional reform on the
election agenda.
During a tour of the west country, Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat
leader, said Mr Kinnock was 'wobbling on the fence'. His principal term for
working with another party in government is a commitment to legislation on
proportional representation in the first Queen's speech.
Mr Ashdown believes the system of proportional representation could then be
decided in time for legislation to be passed within a year, followed by a
referendum prior to enactment.
However, Mr Major said yesterday that proportional representation was being
rejected by political leaders in other countries.
'Some countries would like to get rid of it. . . They cannot get
governments, with clear majorities, to take difficult decisions', he said.
'You are in a perpetual state of campaigning, backstairs deals and trying to
cobble together deals for individual policies. That is no way to run this
country at all.'
Meanwhile, Mr Kinnock told journalists that he wanted a broad consensus for
Labour's programme. In government, he would extend membership of the Plant
committee, chaired by Professor Raymond Plant, to other political parties
and representatives of churches, trade unions and business.
'It would be extremely dog-in-the-manger if parties like the Conservatives
and the Liberal (Democrats) were not to take full advantage of the
invitation,' Mr Kinnock said.
Labour remains publicly confident of winning an overall majority and
dismissed the suggestion that it might enter a coalition. It will today
publish a 'Queen's speech' outlining its legislative programme for a first
parliamentary session, including measures on training and on a Scottish
parliament .
With the Tories confident that economic competence remains one of their
strongest cards, Mr Major warned that Labour would prevent the recovery that
he insisted had begun.
Speaking in south London, Mr Major used the example of Tuesday's Pounds
1.3bn fall in share prices after polls showed a clear Labour lead, to warn
of the disastrous economic consequences of a Labour administration. 'One
rogue poll, a glimmer of thought that there might be a Labour government,'
and Pounds 1.3bn was wiped off share prices, he said.
Mr Kinnock last night admitted to making errors of judgment in supporting
unilateral nuclear disarmament and in failing to campaign to change Labour's
policy on the European Community after the 1975 referendum.

FT  03 APR 92 / UN hits at embassy attacks in Libya
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MOB ATTACKS on foreign embassies in Libya were condemned by the United
Nations last night, as the international confrontation with the North
African state intensified.
Angry demonstrators assailed the embassies of countries that voted for
sanctions against Libya. They ransacked and torched the Venezuelan mission,
destroyed diplomatic cars and hurled stones through Russian and Austrian
embassy windows.
Jana, Libya's state news agency, said dozens were injured as demonstrators
clashed with riot police who, it claimed, were called in to protect the
diplomatic missions.
The protests yesterday were against the UN decision on Tuesday to cut
Libya's air links and impose other sanctions unless it surrenders for trial
two suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie in Scotland
with the loss of 270 lives.
Diplomats in Tripoli said the protests, the first since western pressure was
applied on Libya over Lockerbie, appeared carefully orchestrated.
In New York, the UN Security Council denounced the 'intolerable and
extremely grave events'. It directed Libya to ensure the safety of all
diplomatic premises and their staff, implicitly rejecting the government's
denial of involvement in the rampage.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, summoned and strongly
rebuked Mr Ali Elhouderi, the Libyan envoy, in what officials termed a tense
meeting. The UN said Mr Elhouderi offered apologies to the UN and to
Venezuela.
Mr Thomas Pickering, the US delegate, dismissed Libya's 'profuse apologies
with crocodile tears', warning that stronger measures than verbal
condemnation might follow if the Libyan authorities failed to restrain
violence against foreigners.
The UN statement protesting at the Libyan violence was described by some
diplomats as just the opening burst in a confrontation with Colonel Muammer
Gadaffi, the Libyan leader.
Mr Vladimir Petrovsky, a senior UN envoy, is to be despatched to Tripoli
after the three-day Eid al-Fitr Islamic holiday this weekend to discuss the
sanctions vote with Libya.
In Tripoli, Mr Miguel Raidi, Venezuela's ambassador, said about 300 people
had broken into the embassy compound. Petrol bombs were thrown into the
building, furniture was wrecked and bottles of drink smashed.
Venezuela protested last night at the destruction of its embassy and
demanded an explanation from the Libyan government.
Windows were broken at the Austrian embassy and there were peaceful protests
near the French, Hungarian and Italian missions - the latter representing
British interests in Libya.
The Belgian embassy, which houses the US interests section, is located in a
tower block in Tripoli and could not easily be reached by protesters.
More than 1m foreigners live and work in Libya, including 10,000 Europeans.
Britain and the US have advised their nationals to leave Libya before the
imposition of sanctions.
Jana said Col Gadaffi had urged restraint among Libyans but he was quoted as
threatening to expropriate foreign assets in retaliation at UN sanctions. He
told L'Europeo, an Italian magazine: 'The countries that have got
satisfaction out of provoking us will find themselves quickly expropriated
of many billions.'

FT  03 APR 92 / Survey of Milton Keynes (7): Residents determined to have
last laugh - Lifestyle
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
JUST as Cambridge may be a romantic dream in the minds of those who never
studied there, Milton Keynes has become a nightmare in the minds of those
who have never lived there.
The British, who will label anything a white elephant unless it is an
overnight success, have come to sneer at Milton Keynes, seeing only concrete
cows, 15m trees three feet high, and roundabouts with one entry and one
exit.
But the residents refer conspiratorially to 'MK', conjuring up images of
more exotic initials such as LA, and bask in another annoyingly British
emotion: smug self-satisfaction. But after 25 years of being a stand-up joke
the residents of Milton Keynes appear determined to have the last laugh.
It is difficult to find any coherent argument against the proposition that
MK is a success as a lifestyle. What kind of lifestyle is another matter
entirely.
The Queen recently disappointed MK, prefering to give another contender,
Sunderland, the honour of cityhood in celebration of the 40th anniversary of
her accession.
If Milton Keynes was a racehorse it would be out of Letchworth by Hampstead
Garden Suburb. It may be doing itself a disservice by trying to run in the
city stakes.
Much of the derision aimed at MK comes from efforts to attain the status
accorded cities. But while many who would agree that MK is not a city:
should the citizens care? What's wrong with living in an immaculately
planned garden suburb last seen wandering across the Buckinghamshire
countryside?
What is more this garden suburb has been adapted, rather brilliantly by
Walter Bor and Lord Llewelyn-Davies, for the car. The average worker has to
travel 10 minutes to get to work. The lifestyle of Milton Keynes is home-
and sports-based and glued together by the motor car.
More than 70 per cent of households have cars, compared to a national
average of 63 per cent. With six sets of traffic lights and a unique grid
system of vehicle-only roads, transport is swift and largely stress-free.
(The road plan was originally referred to as a 'rationalised Los Angeles').
The home in MK is an electronic playground: 53 per cent of households have
cable television (one of the highest percentages in Britain), while 65 per
cent have a video recorder, compared to 47 per cent nationally. The city's
famous linear parks and lakes are sporting havens, and the Redway grid
system of cycle paths and footpaths promotes a healthy alternative to the
road grid.
The community is a young one. Ten per cent of MK's population is aged
between 25 and 29, compared to 8 per cent nationally, while just 12 per cent
of the population is over 60, compared to 21 per cent nationally.
Many of Milton Keynes residents came from London in the 1970s.
The clean-cut outdoor life which has been realised in the city can be seen
as a reaction to the comparative squalor of many of the capital's
traditional inner-city areas.
The 'green pull' of Milton Keynes is an increasingly strong location factor,
especially in the development corporation advertising, and the city is proud
that street pollution is two-thirds of that in traditional UK cities.
But the population mix has changed, and the 1988 household survey of the MK
region found that only 35 per cent of the residents had come from London.
Significantly about 3 per cent of the 1988 population came from neighbouring
Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, or Northamptonshire. About a fifth of
households in the region moved to their present home from addresses in
Milton Keynes.
Satisfaction with the lifestyle is common. Four out of five residents
profess to be satisfied with the way the city has been planned while 75 per
cent are happy with the housing on offer. The proportion of owner-occupiers
has increased over time, as has the number of shared owners, a local trend
of increasing significance. In the past 22 years, some 44,000 homes have
been built in Milton Keynes, most of them with gardens.
Traditional city entertainment in Milton Keynes has not had such a success
rate. The opening of The Point, the UK's first 10-screen multiplex cinema,
has done something to redress the balance but the city centre still lacks
magnetism. The Leisure Plaza, opened in 1990, provides an ice-rink, room for
2,500 spectators and a 36-lane bowling alley.
The new ecumenical church of Christ the Cornerstone may provide the city
with a soul, and its 120ft dome a much-needed landmark, but the city centre
still resembles a ghost town.
The city does have social problems. There is little single-person housing.
Both the divorce figures and repossession rate are above the national
average. There are 2,000 homeless people in the region.
But none of that should be allowed to disfigure MK's achievement. The city
has a growing number of radical supporters, among them Mr Tim Mars,
popularly known as 'the guru of Milton Keynes', and the author of privately
produced tour brochure on the region.
'I liked the city so much I lived there,' says Mr Mars, who now describes
himself as 'an enforced exile'. He believes the city's lifestyle is closest
to that of California, but with parks and lakes replacing the beach, and
while agreeing that 'cityhood' is a mistaken aspiration for MK finds
'suburban' equally misplaced.
Mr Mars found that Milton Keynes was unlike other new towns: it wasn't
shabby and it was not built as a romantic fantasy of a worker's playground.
He insists that 'from the inside out' MK is not dominated by the car, but by
the Redway, cycle paths, and well-lit footpaths.
In Milton Keynes he finds a definition of the aspirations of many of its
residents: life is private, mobile, rural, and close to the city. It is
certainly true that for the people who live in this gentle garden suburb,
life is less stressful, healthier, and more efficient than for the vast
majority of Britain's citizens.

FT  03 APR 92 / Survey of Milton Keynes (8): Evidence of a special
attachment - Open University and Polytechnic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOT many towns in Britain have gained a higher education institution in the
past 23 years. Milton Keynes must be unique in landing not one but two - the
Open University, and a campus of Leicester Polytechnic, opened by the Queen
earlier this month, whose title has just been upgraded to De Montfort
University, Milton Keynes.
It also boasts a six-year-old further education college which is expanding
rapidly.
The Open University (OU) is ancient by comparison. Opened in 1969 as a novel
experiment in distance learning, it is now one of the largest universities
in the world.
It has more than 125,000 registered students. Including purchasers of study
packs, a total of about 210,000 people come within its ambit.
Few of them ever see Milton Keynes, however. No teaching takes place on the
campus, which is strictly an administrative and broadcasting headquarters.
Summer schools and the face-to-face parts of courses take place in hotels
and the campuses of other higher education institutions.
The locals evidently feel a special attachment to the OU: about 1,200 of its
students come from the Milton Keynes postal district. But according to Mr
John Daniel, the university's vice-chancellor: 'Although we have those
students, they are invisible, and the town does not consider us it's
university.'
Nonetheless, with more than 2,500 academic and back-up staff, the OU is one
of Milton Keynes's largest local employers after Abbey National. Mr Daniel,
who took the top job two years ago after 20 years in Canada, is enthusiastic
about his base: 'The transition was easy: if you have lived in North
America, Milton Keynes is just the place to return to. You can park, there's
lots of greenery, and communications are excellent.'
The OU's future is assured. At present, Pounds 90m of its Pounds 154m annual
budget is in the form of a direct government grant. From next year, the OU
will forfeit its special earmarked grant and become dependant on the new
Higher Education Funding Council. But Mr Daniel is confident it won't lose
anything thereby: 'Our unit costs per undergraduate are 40 per cent lower
than in conventional universities, so even if the gradient is slightly
against us, we should do OK in the funding contest.'
Expanding overseas links is the OU's current priority. Within a few months,
students will be able to register from throughout the European Community and
Mr Daniel is expecting an influx.
The Open Business School, started in 1982 and now generating an annual
turnover of Pounds 17m, already markets itself actively in eastern Europe
and Russia. It has also joined the Master of Business Administration
bandwagon, with a course particularly tailored for public sector employees.
The first 211 MBAs graduated this year.
De Montfort's 50-acre campus is a stone's throw away - symbolically as well
as geographically, since the OU helped to get the new polytechnic-university
off the ground.
It took off with lightening speed. It is just two years since the Milton
Keynes Development Corporation invited higher education institutions to
tender to operate a new campus in the town. The winner was Leicester
Polytechnic (now styled De Montfort University), whose governors appointed
Professor Peter Thewlis, dean of its school of computing, to oversee the new
project.
'When I arrived last January', he recalls, 'I had a car, a phone, a
dictaphone and a temporary office in the Citizens' Advice Bureau.' He also
had a large field, which now boasts three large warehouse-style buildings -
the first of a projected dozen or so - only one of which is yet open. Inside
is a plushness most polys only dream of: wall-to-wall carpets, spacious
lecture theatres, every other room replete with word processors or
computers.
The first 400 students and 30 lecturers - a third of them transfers from
Leicester - arrived last October. Student numbers are planned to rise to at
least 5,000 by the turn of the century, with the lecturing staff expanding
accordingly.
More than a fifth of the first intake of students come from the locality - a
higher proportion than typical for a poly - and De Montfort is pioneering
'compact' schemes and the like with local schools to strengthen links. But
it is also building accommodation blocks (on a different site) and the
proportion of students from beyond the town is likely to increase once it
becomes fully part of the Polytechnics and Universities Central Council on
Admissions system next year.
'You wouldn't, perhaps, expect to do archaeology at Milton Keynes', says
Professor Thewlis. 'We chose our disciplines to match people's expectations
and imagery for a Milton Keynes university.'
The emphasis is resolutely applied and high-tech: schools of computing,
business, engineering and the built environment are up and running; social
work and 'modular arts' - whose plans include a broadcast journalism degree,
subject to validation - follow.
Some of the courses are offered on collaborative and franchising agreements
with Milton Keynes Further Education College, which is keen to offer a
seamless route from A-level through to degree. The college - a merger of FE
colleges at Bletchley and Wolverton with a new and expanding campus in the
town centre - has nearly 7,000 students, and is building a Pounds 5m
extension at its town-centre site at Chaffron Way.
The concept of a 'distributed university' lies at the heart of De Montfort's
plans for its offspring. Constrained on its home site at Leicester, the
poly-university was eager to expand, and is doing so through a network of
colleges, each intended to have its own specialisms and 'centres of
excellence.'
Milton Keynes is the first of the outposts. Bedford College of Higher
Education - which has a strong emphasis on education, sport and the
performing arts - is likely to join; the Lincoln Colleges of Agriculture and
Art and Design have also expressed strong interest. The end-product will be
a 30,000-strong university on four sites within a 50-mile radius of
Leicester, with many students moving between campuses for different parts of
their courses.
'The whole structure will be complementary, not just in disciplines, but in
locations - a truly distributed system,' enthuses Professor Thewlis. Taking
it to heart, he lives half way between Milton Keynes and Leicester.

FT  03 APR 92 / Survey of Milton Keynes (5): A competitive destination -
Company Relocations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AN important difference between Milton Keynes and other towns and cities
looking for new investment and relocating companies in the past decade was
that there was not much industry in Milton Keynes in the first place.
Swindon and Peterborough - towns similar to Milton Keynes in that they grew
rapidly in the 1980s - were both railway towns with a pool of skilled labour
that new companies could utilise and build on. Similarly, south Wales and
the north-east of England had declining industries such as steel, coal and
shipbuilding, all of which shed labour in recent years.
But Milton Keynes' lack of an indigenous labour force did not act as a
deterrent to new investors. At first the development corporation and later
the private sector made sure that enough houses (about 45,000 ) across a
wide price range were built to accommodate the workers and managers that
relocating companies would need.
The absence of an industrial past, so to speak, had three effects. Milton
Keynes has a smaller-than-average manufacturing sector for somewhere so
close to the Midlands. It has comparatively few large companies. And it has
a relatively young workforce.
There are few very large manufacturing concerns, although there are a
considerable number of medium-size light manufacturing companies involved in
component manufacturing. The manufacturing sector employs 21 per cent of the
workforce, below the national average.
A recent employment survey undertaken by the Milton Keynes Development
Corporation showed that the two largest categories of companies were those
which employed less than 20 people and less than 100. Only 160 companies
have more than 100 employees. Sixty companies employ more than 200 people
and only 15 employ more than 500.
Service and distribution companies dominate among the largest concerns and
the smallest.
The biggest employer is now the bank, Abbey National, which has 3,500
workers on the payroll, but it has only grown to this size in the past four
years. In 1987 it employed 800. At that time the largest employer was the
Open University which employed 2,300, similar to the number it employs
today.
Other large companies are the Argos group, the catalogue showroom retailer,
and motor car distributors such as Volkswagen.
Companies in the service sector and manufacturing have flocked to Milton
Keynes because of its strategic location, because there is plenty of space
for working, living and parking and because its costs remain low compared
with London, the south-east and Birmingham. Of the 3,300 registered
companies or parts of companies, 2,500 have established themselves in Milton
Keynes in the past 20 years.
In the early 1980s, when Abbey National found itself bursting at the seams
in its headquarters in London's Baker Street, it wanted somewhere cheaper
but close enough to London so that an important number of staff would move
either by commuting or by physically relocating. It also wanted a location
where there were no larger employers, particularly in the service sector.
Milton Keynes fitted the bill.
Mr David Woollcott, group personnel manager, says: 'We wanted somewhere
which was close enough to London for executives to come and go to the London
headquarters. We still operate management, treasury and corporate functions
from there. But we also wanted a place where other key staff would work.'
More than half the 800 employees of the early 1980s came from the London
office. As the company has expanded, staff either commute in or have been
taken on locally.
Mr Woollcott says: 'There are trains every 20 minutes to London's Euston
which is just up the road from Baker Street. The fastest trains take just 35
minutes.'
Mr Woollcott also says the company likes the space and lack of congestion in
Milton Keynes. Parking is easy, although Abbey employees have to pay a small
fee because their office buildings are near the station and their car parks
were apt to be invaded by commuters. Parking used to be free.
BRS, formerly British Road Services, is in the process of moving 200
employees into newly acquired offices in Milton Keynes. The company says the
space and good communications were important considerations in selection of
the city.
Ms Sue Simpson, marketing manager of the transport group, says: 'We looked
at Bedford, where our parent company NFC (formerly the National Freight
Corporation) is based. But Bedford is basically a market town with parking
problems and congestion.
'We also looked at various business parks. The trouble with these are that
they are usually on the outskirts of town, and you either have to build your
own amenities, canteens, gyms and leisure facilities or see the staff
travelling into the nearest town for lunch. Here in Milton Keynes, you can
have the best of both worlds. You are right in the middle of town, so there
are pubs, restaurants and shops close by. But it is also easy to get in and
out and park.'
The space and lack of congestion was also attractive to Mr Kyoshi Watano,
managing director of Alps Electric (UK), one of the 43 Japanese concerns in
Milton Keynes.
The Milton Keynes Development Corporation was never able to offer grants and
other incentives of the kind offered by areas such as south Wales and the
north-east. But it was able to offer land and factories which would enable
expansion. Alps started up five years ago with 80 employees. It makes
electrical components for VCRs and televisions.
Mr Watano says: 'We wanted to be in England for our European operation
because of the English language, and to be near other Japanese companies -
particularly our customers. I looked at south Wales, and also Telford, but I
chose Milton Keynes because this was the best for distribution for all our
customers. One of our customers is Philips which is in Holland. They might
not have liked it if we had gone to Wales because Sony is there.'
Asked whether the company did not mind going without the incentives
available in Wales or Scotland, Mr Watano says: 'Grants do not make a
company; it is the quality of the people. Here, there are good, well-trained
people.'
Even without subsidies, Milton Keynes remains a competitive relocation
destination. Wages are between 10 and 20 per cent below those in London.
With the recession throwing people who commuted to London or Birmingham on
to the local market, fears of skills shortages have receded.
Office rents at Pounds 15 a sq ft are a third of those in central London.
There is plenty of land left for offices, factories and houses.
Milton Keynes is an hour's drive from Heathrow airport and just over half an
hour on the train from London. Once the economy improves, Milton Keynes
should again see an inflow of investment on a substantial scale.

FT  03 APR 92 / Survey of Milton Keynes (6): Taking pride in successes -
Foreign Investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MILTON KEYNES takes pride in a conspicuously high level of foreign
investment as proof of its success over the past 25 years in attracting
diverse businesses from far and wide.
Almost 10 per cent of the companies which have set up in Milton Keynes are
internationally based, giving the city well over 200 foreign corporate
citizens.
Altogether, Milton Keynes boasts 19 countries from continental Europe and
further afield in its international community. While the US dominates the
scene, with 90 American companies represented, the Japanese also have a
considerable presence, with 44 companies at the last count.
According to the Milton Keynes Development Corporation, which was wound up
at the end of March, although incoming investment has slowed, it has not
dried up, even in the recession. For multinational companies looking to the
single European market and ahead, Milton Keynes apparently offers many
advantages despite its location in one of the more remote regions of the
enlarged European stage.
The English language already gives Britain an advantage over other EC
countries in the eyes of both American and Japanese companies looking to
locate their European operations.
What makes Milton Keynes more attractive than other British cities is its
central location within the UK. Its proximity to key international airports,
such as Luton and Heathrow, is a natural advantage.
Alps Electric, the world's largest independent manufacturer of
electromechanical components, looked at sites throughout Europe before
settling on Milton Keynes as the ideal location from which to service its
customers throughout the European market.
The company, which supplies big name consumer electronics manufacturers,
such as Sony and Panasonic, with electromechanical components and other
products, found Milton Keynes provided it with the central location it
needed to meet its customers' requirements.
'We need to be within two hours of our customers to give them maximum
support,' says Mr Peter Woodland, business planning manager of Alps (UK).
From Milton Keynes, Alps can also reach most parts of continental Europe
within two to three hours and there are also excellent road links to the
ports.
Since 1984, the Japanese manufacturer has invested Pounds 19m in its plant
where it makes television and video cassette recorder tuners and remote
control handsets for televisions and VCRs, among other products.
Unisys, the American network information systems and services group, is
another company that found Milton Keynes attractive for the access it
provides to other parts of the UK and continental Europe.
The group acquired 420,000 sq ft of property adjacent to one of the city's
attractive man-made lakes and has invested Pounds 40m so far to set up a UK
customer services centre and a European education and training centre,
complete with a 250-room hotel. The site also houses its European node of
the group's worldwide data communications network.
One of the key functions of the customer services centre is to ensure rapid
supply of any parts that are needed at a customer's site within the UK.
'In a service-oriented business, the complete solution (to information
systems) and fast response time differentiates us from other companies,'
says Mr Phil Baker, personnel manager.
Being in Milton Keynes, where Unisys also has an enormous warehouse
containing thousands of hardware products and parts for its various systems,
and where it is also is within easy reach of one of Unisys's big parts
distribution centres in the Netherlands, means that it is able to respond
quickly to customer problems that come into the customer services centre.
In addition to being centrally located between London and Birmingham, its
proximity to London is another obvious advantage enjoyed by Milton Keynes.
For Alps, this was a key point that helped it to recruit talented engineers
and technical staff. 'It is not so easy to attract good engineers to remoter
areas,' Mr Woodland says.
The other side of the coin, however, is that proximity to London means pay
rates are influenced by London's high levels.
Location, although important, is only one of several factors that have
attracted international companies to Milton Keynes. The availability of land
and housing at reasonable prices turned both Alps and Unisys in favour of
Milton Keynes.
Unisys, in particular, needed to find a site where it could consolidate
seven different training and service locations. 'Having an environment in
which we could grow was a key consideration,' says Mr Martin Sexton,
director of company communications.
Milton Keynes has been much maligned by the British public - to which the
city, laid out on a grid, appears as an urban sprawl, lacking in character.
But the quality of life offered by the city was actually instrumental in
attracting many foreign companies.
Housing was available at reasonable prices, although prices have risen in
recent years. The safe and comfortable environment was an important factor
in easing concerns about living in a foreign country among Alps's Japanese
managers. 'The golf courses were just a coincidence,' Mr Woodland says.
Contrary to the cold and uninviting image Milton Keynes has among many
Britons, the city is seen by many Japanese and Americans - who are perhaps
more accustomed to the modern urban landscape - and, indeed, the Britons who
live there, as outward-looking and dynamic.
'It had a very modern image, which is the image Alps wanted to portray,'
according to Mr Woodland.
And in spite of some initial resistance among Unisys's 60 or so instructors
who had to be relocated to Milton Keynes from various parts of the country,
Mr Sexton is confident that 'to a man, everybody who lives in Milton Keynes
enjoys being here.'
Unisys is also happy to find more reliable administrative and support staff
in Milton Keynes than it had in London. The stability among staff at Milton
Keynes is a contrast to the very high turnover rate it experienced in London
and the community spirit is better, it says.
This may also have to do with the community spirit being fostered in Milton
Keynes by the companies that locate there. Mr Kyoshi Watano, managing
director of Alps (UK) is a director of the local Training and Enterprise
Council, a previous director of the Milton Keynes Chamber of Commerce and
chairman of the local Japan club. Alps and Unisys are both patrons of the
Milton Keynes Community Trust.
Foreign investment in Milton Keynes is likely to remain subdued until there
are stronger signs of economic recovery in leading industrialised countries.
But the closing of the Development Corporation is also a growing concern for
businesses already in Milton Keynes. 'There is a strong body of opinion
among businesses that wants Milton Keynes to develop as it has. Now that the
Development Corporation is handing over to the council, there is obviously a
concern that the priorities might change,' says Mr Sexton.

FT  03 APR 92 / Survey of Milton Keynes (4): Council seeks fresh
responsibilities - Local Authorities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR a time last month it looked as if the Milton Keynes Development
Corporation would end its life on a discordant note. It was involved in a
row with the borough council about the takeover of certain community-related
assets.
Before it was wound up on March 31, the corporation had been disposing of
its outstanding assets in various ways.
The 3,500 acres of land still scheduled for factories, houses, offices and
shops has been taken over by the Commission for New Towns. This is the
government 'realisation agency' which is responsible for liquidating all the
remaining assets of the 21 new towns in England and Wales. The development
corporation is leaving little in the form of buildings to the CNT. There is
a mixture of about 500,000 sq ft of offices and factories to be disposed of.
Nearly all the other factories, offices and shops have been sold either to
tenants or to institutions. The houses which were built by the development
corporation until the early 1980s, and which were not sold to tenants under
the government's right-to-buy scheme, have largely gone to the Milton Keynes
Borough Council. There are about 13,000 tenants and shared owners. In a
recent ballot, 84 per cent of these opted to be taken over by the borough
council, while the remainder will go to housing trusts. The outstanding
community-related assets are going in five directions - to the county
council, the borough council, parish councils, the voluntary sector and
various community trusts.
The borough council estimates that there are 350 community assets, including
playing fields, meeting places, allotments, parkland and works of art.
Buckingham County Council will take over responsibility for libraries,
schools and other educational establishments plus roads.
Public sector housing has usually been the bailiwick of district or borough
councils. Apart from the houses, the Milton Keynes Borough Council - which
covers an area larger than the corporation's designated area - is
inheriting, allotments, playing fields, children's centres and playgrounds,
and some district parks and community centres.
With these assets usually comes a balancing income package. The development
corporation also hands over commercial premises, shops, public houses and
factories which it owned so that recipients of the community-related assets
(CRAs) have an income and the means to run them. These income packages run
to several million pounds a year. The row between the council and the
development corporation involved some of the last of the CRAs, the so-called
linear parks, which run along watercourses such as the Loughton Valley park,
the Ouzel and Ouse Valley Parks, and make up one fifth of the city area .
The development corporation wanted to set up a trust board to take control
of the linear parks and other spaces.
Mr Frank Henshaw, the last general manager of the development corporation,
says: 'The linear parks are such a unique feature of Milton Keynes we wanted
to set up trusts that would be exclusively involved in maintaining them as
they are.'
The borough council wanted local residents to choose who would be
responsible for the parks and how they should be run.
The council went to court where a judge ruled that the corporation could not
simply transfer the parks to the Milton Keynes Parks Trust and said it was
up to Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, to decide their
future.
At the eleventh hour, a compromise was reached between the borough council,
the county council, the development corporation and the Parks Trust. It was
agreed that the freehold of the parks would be transferred to the borough
council. The parks trust will be given a very long lease and a balancing
package of about Pounds 2m a year to run the parks.
Behind the row about the linear parks is the much larger issue of relations
between local authorities and the central government.
Most local authorities, but especially those of a different political
persuasion to the Conservative party governments of the past 12 years, have
chafed under the progressive emasculation of local councils' spending
rights.
In particular, many local authorities resented the fact that it became
difficult to build public sector housing. In places where government quangos
such as development corporations were imposed, local councils became doubly
frustrated because not only funds were channelled through the quangos, but
also planning rights for both housing and industrial and commercial
property.
In the 1970s, the development corporation built lots of houses, some of
which it sold, others which it let. The corporation was a pioneer in shared
ownership and low-cost social housing. By 1984, the government decreed it
could build no more. The 13,000 houses which had tenants were transferred to
the borough council to manage.
Mr Gifford says: 'We were very pleased when in the ballot last year 84 per
cent of the tenants decided they wanted us as landlords.
'Our stock is now 18,000 so we have more flexibility in dealing with the
homeless and needy.'
Taking over the houses is one way that the borough council sees itself
increasing its responsibilities and emerging from the sidelines.
It would also like to have taken over the land which has gone to the CNT.
Mr Gifford says: 'Much of the land has already received planning consent
anyway, and we are satisfied that the land will be developed in accordance
with the masterplan under which most of Milton Keynes has already been
built.'
After 25 years with a development corporation standing over it, the borough
council wants to emerge in its own right and run as many areas of Milton
Keynes as it can.

FT  03 APR 92 / Survey of Milton Keynes (3): Pioneering efficiency - Energy
Conservation

MILTON KEYNES is mercifully free of energy-related eyesores such as coal
mines, power stations or large gas-holders. But the city has steadily
acquired a reputation as the place where buildings - homes, offices and
light industry - use energy more efficiently and cleanly than anywhere else
in Britain.
It has also pioneered a system for measuring and comparing the energy
efficiency of buildings which is being adopted in many other parts of
Britain and is being recommended by central government.
The city's energy reputation will take another step forward this year when
work starts on the construction of a National Energy Centre alongside the A5
main road.
The 60-acre centre, to be called Odyssey, will contain exhibition halls,
conference facilities and a theme park which is expected to draw at least
500,000 visitors a year, many of them schoolchildren. It will explain energy
with some of the techniques associated with the much bigger Epcot centre,
the scientific Disneyland, at Orlando, Florida.
The Energy Experience will have a strong environmental theme, showing the
link between energy use and global warming.
Mr Richard Tinson, director of the Milton Keynes-based National Energy
Foundation, which is in charge of the project, says work on the Pounds 25m
complex will start this summer.
Support is being canvassed from national and regional power utilities and
collaboration is being explored with the Science Museum in London.
The conference and business facilities will be completed in 55 weeks -
Wimpey is the main contractor - and the theme park is due to open in 1994.
It will also become the permanent address of the National Energy Foundation,
a non-governmental charitable foundation which has assisted the energy work
of the Milton Keynes Development Corporation.
Mr Tinson joined the foundation in January from Shell UK where he had been
chairman and managing director of Emstar, one of the country's biggest
energy management contractors, recently sold to Associated Heat Services.
The foundation's chairman is Mrs Mary Archer, the Cambridge university solar
energy authority and wife of novelist Jeffery Archer.
The site is part of the Energy Park, a 300-acre area, where most of Milton
Keyens's pioneering buildings have been established. The Park contains 1,200
energy-efficient homes and several commercial and light industrial
buildings.
The Odyssey project will set the seal on Milton Keynes's emergence as a
centre of excellence for energy-efficient housing.
The city's prestige stems not only from its buildings but from the system
developed there for rating their performance. Now officially known as the
National Home Energy Rating (NHER), it was based on a computer program
developed for the Development Corporation by the National Energy Foundation.
The foundation claims that if every home in the UK was improved by just one
point on the NHER scale, it would not only drastically cut the nation's
energy bill but reduce the output of harmful power station carbon dioxide
emissions by 4 per cent a year.
The system predicts the annual fuel costs per square metre of floor area,
including space and water heating, cooking and lighting. It measures a
house's efficiency on an index of 0 to 10. The higher the number the more
efficient the design.
The NHER is now subscribed to by 100 members, including a wide range of
organisations such as the National House Building Confederation,
housebuilders, local authorities and housing associations, as well as
architects, surveyors and energy consultants.
There are 10 facilities throughout the country to train people in its use
and about 300 people have qualified as assessors. In Leicester, it is being
used as part of a city-wide environmental improvement programme and in
Bristol it is being used to operate a 'green' mortgage scheme which favours
energy-efficient houses.
According to the National Energy Foundation, five big housing agencies are
modelling all their stock using one of the NHER computer programs. By this
month, more than 200,000 public sector homes should have been rated in this
way. This year alone, says the foundation, the NHER is likely to be used to
certify the energy rating of some 10,000 private new homes throughout
Britain and a further 50,000 run by local authorities.
Last month, the NHER, together with an alternative system devised by a
software company, was incorporated into a new government yardstick for
energy efficiency labelling.
Two years ago, in its amended Building Regulations, the government required
that new homes meet the equivalent of 6.5 to 7 on the Milton Keynes energy
scale. The latest homes in the Milton Keynes Energy Park are intended to
achieve a 9-point rating which is comparable with the best Scandinavian
efficiency levels. Several thousand new homes in other parts of Milton
Keynes are also expected to perform well above the proposed national level.
The NHER could have an even wider impact under a European Community draft
directive on the energy certification of buildings. It proposes that half
the new homes on the market in any year should comply with a
nationally-accepted energy rating label. In Britain, says Mr Tinson, that
could mean that 1.5m homes a year would have to face a rating test similar
to that devised at Milton Keynes.
Significant improvements are being made too in the 60-acre section of the
Energy Park earmarked for commercial buildings. The first two
privately-funded energy-efficient commercial developments were the 40,000 sq
ft Spectrum 7 building occupied by Leica, the German camera company, and the
66,500 sq ft Solaris Court, now used as the national headquarters of
Parcelforce, the Royal Mail parcel delivery company. Both buildings are said
to achieve an energy standard some 40 per cent better than the current
national average.
Even more eye-catching is the purpose-built UK headquarters of Kabi
Pharmacia, the Swedish pharmaceutical group, which supplies materials to
British hospitals, and which was opened in January 1991.
It was designed by Hobbs, a Milton Keynes firm of architects, on the lines
of Kabi Pharmacia's head offices at Uppsala in Sweden. Despite large
expanses of glass, the fan-shaped building enjoys low energy costs thanks
largely to the way warm air is controlled and recirculated with Swedish
ventilation equipment.

FT  03 APR 92 / Survey of Milton Keynes (2): Momentum is key question - The
Development Corporation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Milton Keynes Development Corporation has been the driving force behind
the establishment of the city. But the corporation has been wound up since
March 31, so where does Milton Keynes go from here?
In the early days - the corporation was set up in 1967 - the MKDC's
activities were all-embracing. It bought up all the land which was not being
used, about 18,000 acres. It serviced the land, putting in primary
infrastructure such as sewerage and water. It built roads on a grid pattern
and a parallel system of walkways and cycle paths, known as Redways.
It constructed houses, factories, offices and shops. It built parks, social
centres and sports facilities. In all, it is estimated 13m trees, plants and
shrubs have been planted throughout Milton Keynes.
Private developers became interested as commercial rates of return were
achievable on speculative building of offices and houses and the development
corporation latterly became more of a catalyst
Not only did the MKDC have government money at its disposal, it also had
planning rights. Land was sold on to developers. Offices were disposed of to
tenants where possible and shops and other commercial amenities to
institutions. Postel, a trade union pension fund, bought the half mile-long
covered shopping centre in central Milton Keynes, for example.
Mr Frank Henshaw, general manager of the corporation before it was wound up,
estimates that about Pounds 1bn of government money at historic cost has
been pumped into Milton Keynes over the the 25 years of the corporation's
life.
This money came in the form of loans from the government. Virtually all of
the Pounds 1bn has been paid back from the proceeds of asset sales. Mr
Henshaw estimates that if certain deals on land go through, then the money
paid to the government will exceed Pounds 1bn.
The figures are not strictly comparable since the outlay is at historic cost
and certain loans were written off in the mid-eighties. Receipts are more
recent and in some cases at current cost.
However, by the end of the century, total private and public sector
investment could exceed Pounds 5bn. This is because although the development
corporation has been wrapped up it is handing on considerable assets.
To date it is estimated that private sector investment in Milton Keynes has
been about Pounds 2bn at historic cost.
The key question is whether the momentum will continue after the recession
and without the development corporation to act as handmaiden to developers
and businesses.
Mr Henshaw has no doubt that Milton Keynes will be developed further along
the lines already established
He says: 'If you had asked me two years ago whether the outstanding land
would be developed in the same way as the rest of Milton Keynes, I would
have had my doubts. At that stage the local authorities had different ideas
to us about the way forward.
'Since then, we have serviced all the outstanding land and gained planning
consents for much of it. There is a tremendous commitment among the local
authorities and the business community that Milton Keynes should continue to
grow.'
The main commercial assets which the corporation is passing on are being
taken over by the Commission for New Towns (CNT). This is the government
agency charged with realising the outstanding assets of all the new towns:
there were 21 new towns in Britain excluding those in Scotland. Milton
Keynes is the last of the new towns to be wound up.
The CNT estimates that over the years the government invested some Pounds
4bn, at historic cost, in the new towns. It is a measure of the size of
Milton Keynes development that about one quarter of these funds has gone
into this single new town.
The outstanding assets are also on a grander scale than those of the other
new towns. There is relatively little built property to be disposed of,
either let or sold - about 500,000 sq ft of offices and factories. But there
is 2,000 acres of land which is serviced and has specific planning consents.
There is a further 1,500 acres which is serviced but does not have planning
agreements as yet.
This land, with the right mix of housing, offices and factories, could
accommodate another 50,000 people.
Sir Neil Shields, chairman of the CNT, is sure that Milton Keynes will
continue to grow once the recession is over.
He says: 'The development corporation has done a terrific job in developing
Milton Keynes, especially when you consider they were not able to offer
grants or other incentives. But there comes a time when a new town ceases to
be a new town and achieves a critical mass.
'You need government money to prime the pump at first, put the roads in and
so on. Developers generally won't do that. But then the private sector takes
over. The Milton Keynes Development Corporation has done such a good job it
has put itself out of a job.'
But Sir Neil says the government has accepted that there is still a lot that
could be done.
'There is an awful lot of land still left,' he says. 'There is ample scope
for the population to grow to 200,000 by the end of the century. The factors
which made Milton Keynes attractive still exist. Its position between London
and Birmingham and on the M1 is excellent. Housing is still cheap,
relatively speaking, and more houses will be built. It is a question of
waiting for this recession to end.'
The CNT has been given a specific brief for Milton Keynes. It will not just
be trying to realise the assets by disposing of them at the best market
price but actively developing the land in line with the master plan. It is
being given special funds for promotion which are being ring fenced. These
run to several million pounds a year, according to Sir Neil, and are in
addition to the money being spent by MK Marketing, the development agency
established to succeed the development corporation.
MK Marketing and the CNT are hoping to pick up where the corporation left
off. The CNT, unlike the corporation, will not have planning powers. These
go to the borough council. But since much of the land already has planning
consents, this hardly matters.

FT  03 APR 92 / Survey of Milton Keynes (1): Successes on many fronts -
Milton Keynes poses the question of whether in Britain a complete city can
ever be built from scratch. The experiment is unlikely to be repeated in the
1990s whichever political party or parties gain power. It may not be Venice
or even Bath, but by its own lights it has worked

IT was difficult not to feel a twinge of sympathy for the Milton Keynes
Development Corporation last month as its officers cleared their desks, put
their books and papers into packing cases, and decided which of the hundreds
of potted plants to take with them.
The development corporation was wound up on March 31 after 25 years. It has
achieved notable successes on many fronts in creating a city - a city in the
country as it has been termed - out of three small towns and 13 villages
spread over 33 sq miles of Buckinghamshire.
Yet, Milton Keynes continues to produce an ambivalent attitude in people who
visit and comment on it. One writer quoted Gertrude Stein's remark about
Oakland in California, saying that there is no there there.
Mr Colin Amery, the architecture critic, wrote recently in this newspaper
about the city and its new ecumenical church, saying: 'There is a brand new
ecumenical church with its dome at the centre. . . this dome ought to have
been bigger. The dome does not do what domes are meant to do and sail over
the lower buildings. Instead, it looks as though it tried to rise above its
surroundings but sighed so deeply that it sank down again. That somehow sums
up what I feel about Milton Keynes - it ought to have been wonderful but it
isn't'
Everyone feels obliged to mention the concrete cows. These are in a field
visible from the trains from London. They were a gift from a visiting US
sculptress, Liz Leyh. Somehow they have come to symbolise the absence of
life in central Milton Keynes.
In short, the lack of downtown bustle, busy street life, urban presence  -
or whatever it is that gives a city heart - is seen as meaning that Milton
Keynes has not become a truly three-dimensional city where people can
happily live, work and play.
Milton Keynes, more than any other new town started in the 1950s and 1960s,
poses the question of whether in Britain, where we traditionally view our
population centres as old organisms which evolve and expand naturally, a
completely new city can be built from scratch. Perhaps you inevitably end up
with a garden suburb which, although pretty, lacks soul.
Certainly, if you like a city to have a public house on every corner, and
its streets to be dirty and choked with traffic, then Milton Keynes is not
for you. Perhaps for the cognoscente the city is not architecturally what
they might wish it to be.
But to criticise the planners at the development corporation because they
have not created another Oxford or Bristol is to miss the point.
Milton Keynes was always going to be different. It was going to hark back to
the idealism of the first new towns early this century: towns like Welwyn
Garden City and Letchworth which envisaged low-density housing in rural or
garden settings. But, at the same time, it was going to be big and balanced
enough to reach a critical mass of its own.
Importantly, it was going to contrast with many of our other cities which
had grown haphazardly since the 19th century in that it could cope with that
20th century phenomenon the motor car.
The new town ideal underwent a perversion in the middle years of the
century. In order to accommodate overspill populations from the big cities
while they were cleared of slum housing, a large number of new towns were
created. Often they were old market towns with bits of housing and industry
bolted on in a higgledy-piggledy way.
Many people were decanted into the new housing unwillingly, creating a
single class of workers, while managers and owners lived in the surrounding
countryside. The anticipated population explosion of the 1950s, in the big
cities such as London, never materialised. Some of the new towns only
managed to grow to about 80,000. This was not enough to develop sufficient
support services or amenities. New town blues became a 1960s phenomenon.
Milton Keynes, which was the last of the new towns to be commissioned in
1967, would avoid all this by getting the size and balance right by means of
a comprehensive plan.
The city - Milton Keynes is, in fact, not officially a city although it has
always called itself one - would be built on an American-style system of
grid roads. Within the grids, there would be a balanced range of housing,
retailing and social amenities.
Workers would live alongside bosses. Nobody would need more than 10 minutes
to get to work. And everyone could go home for lunch, if they wanted to, or,
alternatively, go shopping. The original villages and towns were to be drawn
into this multicentred city. The central business district would be left
until last.
A parallel system of 'redways' or walkways, adjacent to and beneath the
roads, would mean that pedestrians and cyclists could move about the city
without interfering with motor traffic.
No buildings were to be above tree height, so when the 13m trees and shrubs
planted in the landscape grew up it would not feel like living in a city at
all. There is no overhead cabling.
All this was seen as possible because it was launched at a time when a
totally planned environment was believed desirable, massive public spending
was almost an article of faith and social engineering on an enormous scale
had not become discredited. It is difficult to see the experiment of Milton
Keynes being repeated in the 1990s whichever political party or parties gain
power.
On its own terms, Milton Keynes has not been a failure. The population has
grown from 40,000 to 152,000 over the 25 years, and nearly 70,000 jobs have
been created. More than 2,500 companies have been attracted. Because they
represent a wide spread and only 15 companies employ more than 500
employees, Milton Keynes has weathered the recession better than many
places. Unemployment, at 7 per cent, is below the average for the
south-east.
Traffic moves around at an average speed of 40mph. This compares with 11mph
in London.
Just about everyone you talk to likes being in Milton Keynes. Mr Simon
Cuthbertson, a partner in Coopers &amp; Lybrand, Deloitte says: 'I am very happy
with the lifestyle here. I live in a village in the country, but I am in the
office in 10 minutes.
'I can always park. I can drive to Heathrow in an hour and I am going to the
Festival Hall in London tonight. I will be there in just over an hour, door
to door.'
Mr Kyoshi Watano, managing director of Alps Electric, one of the 43 Japanese
companies in Milton Keynes, says: 'I like the transport situation here. It
is so easy to get around Milton Keynes and so easy to see my customers
elsewhere in the country.'
For many of those who have moved in there is little inclination to return to
their former home areas. 'I came here 14 years ago because the housing was
so cheap and there was work. I would never go back to Southall. This is
marvellous for the kids. I tried to persuade others in my family to move
out,' Mr Samsar Dhuynay, who has a young family and describes himself as a
railwayman, says.
Milton Keynes does have its minus points. You could not be without a car.
The city centre could do with more amenities, particularly a theatre or
concert hall, though it does have a large multiplex cinema, The Point.
It may not be Venice or even Bath, but by its own lights it has worked. A
more interesting question is whether without the development corporation to
drive it along it will continue to grow and become rounded out.
The government technically still owns 3,500 acres, an area in itself bigger
than some existing new towns.

<TEXT>
SHARE prices extended their losses on selling by arbitrageurs and
institutional investors, and the Nikkei average weakened to its lowest level
since December 1986, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei ended 295.76 down at 18,286.03 and has lost 7 per cent in the
past three days. Index-linked buying and light bargain hunting lifted the
Nikkei to the day's high of 18,804.40 in the morning. It fell to the
session's low of 18,023.53 in the afternoon, dragged down by a fall in bond
prices and a weaker yen.
Volume expanded to 350m shares from 300m. Declines led rises by 848 to 133,
with 72 issues unchanged. A total of 754 stocks hit new lows for this year.
The Topix index of all first section shares shed 37.79 to 1,321.88, but in
London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 4.82 to 1,050.44.
Rumours that a Middle Eastern investor had started to liquidate holdings in
Japanese stocks and bonds sent jitters through the markets. Additionally,
rumours that a middle-sized life assurer was in financial trouble also shook
confidence.
Banks, speculative stocks and high-priced small-capital issues led the
market's decline. Foreigners were seen selling bank stocks because they were
still regarded as expensive relative to the Nikkei average. Industrial Bank
of Japan plunged Y220 to Y1,780 and Sakura Bank lost Y60 to Y950. Analysts
also attributed the declines to companies selling off cross-holdings.
Short-term investors, who had invested in speculative issues on margin, sold
for a second day due to heavy falls in margin collateral values. Nippon
Carbon dropped by its daily limit of Y100 to Y750 and Clarion, the session's
most active issue, also fell the day's maximum of Y100 to Y740. But some
speculative favourites regained strength on bargain hunting. Meiji Milk
Products climbed Y34 to Y780 and Okamoto Industries Y45 to Y1,040.
Some investors in need of cash were seen liquidating high-priced issues.
Sega Enterprises fell Y300 to Y9,800 and Nintendo Y400 to Y9,000. Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone lost a net Y10,000, setting a closing all-time low
of Y605,000 after touching Y595,000.
Buying by US pension funds lifted some international blue chips. Sony
advanced Y50 to Y4,050 and Toshiba added Y15 at Y560. However, Hitachi
slipped Y9 to Y761 and Matsushita Electric Industrial eased Y10 to Y1,250 on
profit-taking.
Traders noted buying of low-liquidity Nikkei component stocks towards the
end of the session. Shimura Kako was up Y25 to Y645 and Nippon Piston Ring
gained Y30 to Y552.
In Osaka, the OSE average dropped 470.38 to 19,621.24 in volume of 27.1m
shares.
Roundup
THE Pacific Basin was mixed as the fall in Tokyo continued to weigh on the
region.
HONG KONG rose in late trading, with strong activity in HSBC following the
HKDollars 1 fall on Wednesday. It closed unchanged at HKDollars 38.75. The
Hang Seng index gained 14.31 to 4,924.27 but overall turnover was sharply
lower at HKDollars 1.72bn, after HKDollars 2.14bn.
SEOUL closed at the year's low. The composite index lost 13.33 to 585.67 in
turnover of Won462.9bn (Won329.7bn).
SINGAPORE recovered a little of the ground lost on Wednesday, the Straits
Times Industrial index improving 4.68 to 1,398.74 in volume of 31.4m shares,
against 42.9m.
KUALA LUMPUR finished on a mixed note with the composite index a marginal
0.25 off at 588.12 in volume of 33.5m shares, after 34.4m.
TAIWAN reversed Wednesday's downtrend, the weighted index gaining 57.48 or
1.2 per cent to 4,733.96. Turnover fell to TDollars 15.4bn from TDollars
24.5bn.
BOMBAY registered a record high, the BSE index appreciating 102.76 to
4,387.76.
AUSTRALIA closed at a six-month low. The All Ordinaries index relinquished
12.8 to 1,561.2 in turnover of ADollars 278.4m.

FT  03 APR 92 / World Stock Markets: Belgian ills laid at door of German
intransigence - Pessimism in Brussels sprouts from corporate fears of a
tightening in fiscal policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Political limbo is familiar territory for investors in Belgian equities, so
it is hardly surprising that the rally in the Brussels stock market ran out
of steam when a new centre-left coalition was formed at the beginning of
March, after 100 days of bargaining.
The Bel-20 index reached a 1992 high of 1,234.72 on March 3, three days
before Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Flemish Christian Democrat, was appointed to
head the new government. That represented a 13 per cent rise since the start
of the year. However, over March it has slipped back to close at 1,193.02
yesterday, 3.4 per cent down from the year's peak but still above the
1,070.05 reached on November 26, the day after the inconclusive election
results were announced.
Mr Dehaene's government has pledged to tackle Belgium's large public debt,
and companies fear that this strategy may include closing loopholes in the
country's corporate tax system.
Analysts say, however, that the recent fall in the stock market is not so
much a reaction to domestic politics but disappointment that Germany is
unlikely to cut its interest rates in the near future. Mr Philippe Maystadt,
who was reappointed as finance minister in the new government, pondered but
eventually rejected an independent Belgian rate reduction just after Mr
Dehaene was appointed.
Germany's intransigence on the interest rate front, and Belgium's steadfast
devotion to a parallel monetary policy, have prompted stockbrokers to adjust
their forecasts for corporate recovery by the end of the year. Once stocks
are deprived of the short-term support of promised dividends, brokers
believe economic pessimism will feed through into the bourse, particularly
as Germany is a key export market for many Belgian companies.
Luckily, Belgium's stock market stars have not been completely eclipsed by
economic gloom. Shares in Delhaize and GIB Group, the country's two largest
retailers, have performed strongly since the beginning of the year and last
week justified the market optimism, when both companies announced strong
increases in their 1991 figures.
Other outperformers include the more cyclical stocks such as Bekaert, the
steel cord and wire producer, which has undergone an extensive
restructuring, and CBR, the building materials company. But analysts think
few pearls will be discovered during the 1991 results season.
They are forecasting a general decline in Belgian companies' earnings for
1991 of between 3 and 8 per cent. 'It is the same old story across Europe,'
says one analyst, 'more disappointments than pleasant surprises.'
In fact, two of Belgium's largest industrial companies - Petrofina, the oil
group, and Solvay, the chemicals concern - have already produced
disappointing figures for last year. Petrofina announced early in February
that its consolidated profits had fallen by nearly 25 per cent, pushed down
by a 66 per cent drop in profits at Fina, the group's US affiliate. A cost
reduction programme is under way, as is the case at Solvay, which announced
a 40 per cent decrease in group profits, excluding extraordinary items, at
the end of January.
Another depressant is the perennial illiquidity of the Brussels stock
market. Last year's government initiatives on Sicavs (societes
d'investissement a capital variable) - which allow investors to roll up
dividend income, free of tax - have not helped as much as analysts had
hoped, and there is a dearth of new equity.
There is a faint hope that the new government may follow the example of
other European countries by privatising state companies. A recent report
published by Petercam, the Belgian broker, and Hill Samuel, of London - both
keen to be among the advisers on the Belgian privatisation bandwagon -
estimated that the government could raise as much as BFr318bn (Dollars
9.4bn) if it sold a range of industrial, commercial and financial state
companies. RTT, the Belgian telecommunications monopoly, could alone be
worth BFr161bn.
The government has not yet taken the hint, but as Petercam points out, a
stock market flotation would ease the public debt and the bourse's liquidity
problem in one go.

FT  03 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bond auction limits gains in
French equities
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
POLITICS and corporate results helped bourses recover from Wednesday's
losses, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS failed to capitalise fully on Mr Pierre Beregovoy's widely expected
appointment as prime minister yesterday because of volatility in the bond
market. Bond prices finally ended lower, following disappointing demand for
the Treasury's 10-year bond auction. The CAC-40 index closed only 13.88
higher at 1,941.95, below the day's high of 1,946.95, in moderate turnover
of FFr2.6bn. Perrier only accounted for FFr93.7m yesterday compared with
more than FFr1.0bn a day earlier this week.
Suez was active, rising FFr11.40 to FFr336.90 with 451,875 shares traded, on
renewed talk that Suez and UAP had reached an agreement on their subsidiary,
Victoire.
Lyonnaise-Dumez was up FFr12 at FFr522, buoyed up by good 1991 results from
its quoted waste management subsidiary, Sita. Shares in the latter rose by
FFr25 to FFr1,940.
Synthelabo, the small pharmaceutical company, jumped FFr79 or 6.6 per cent
to FFr1,278 following the announcement of an extremely good performance in
1991 and a positive analysts' meeting. L'Oreal, which holds 50.1 per cent of
Synthelabo, added FFr21 to FFr825.
FRANKFURT was slightly disappointed by Deutsche Bank's 1991 profits, which
although at a record high, came in below expectations. The bank also gave a
cautious outlook for earnings in 1992. Its shares closed up DM1.50 at
DM715.00, having been marked up in pre-bourse trading to DM717.90.
The DAX index rose 14.36 to 1,721.66, just below its intraday high of
1,721.73, and the FAZ index, calculated at midsession, gained 2.00 to
700.95. Turnover advanced to DM6.2bn from DM4.8bn.
The rift between the German cartel office and Allianz deepened yesterday,
with the insurer sticking by its cooperation plans with Dresdner Bank, in
which it has a 22 per cent stake. Meanwhile, Dresdner proposed Mr Wolfgang
Schieren of Allianz for its supervisory board. The cartel office has told
Allianz to reduce its holding in Dresdner, which it estimates to be 47 per
cent. Allianz recovered DM6 to DM2,124 and Dresdner put on DM1.50 to
DM351.50.
BMW advanced another DM10.50 or 1.8 per cent to DM583.00, lifted by its good
earnings outlook for 1992. Volkswagen rose DM5.20 to DM366.50.
News that Siemens had secured a DM1bn order from the German postal service
lifted its shares by DM7.30 to DM677.00, while Mannesmann added DM6.50 to
DM285.80 on reports that a number of brokers had upgraded the stock.
MILAN focused on the listing of San Paolo, and dealers crowded around the
trading pit to witness the launch. The shares in the bank officially closed
at L12,240, L40 above its issue price, but dealers suspected an active
support operation by Mediobanca. The price dropped to L12,100 after hours.
About 15 brokers were seen selling San Paolo shares on behalf of
institutional investors while only 3 brokers were detected on the buy side.
Reports about the number of San Paolo shares traded yesterday were
conflicting, with some saying about 1m-1.5m shares while others put the
figure at 3m.
The Comit index rose 4.67 to 508.77 in turnover estimated at L90bn after
L68.2bn. Dealers reported increased activity in call options, suggesting
that few traders wanted to go short, with the market just above the year's
low and in the event of better-than-expected results for the main parties in
this weekend's general election.
There was continued buying interest in stocks which reported good 1991
results in the past week. Benetton rose L99 to L13,450 while Sip added L28
to L1,473 with 5.5m shares traded, below the 8m mark reached earlier this
week.
ZURICH was stronger as foreigners actively sought insurance stocks. The SMI
index advanced 11.3 to 1,838.0.
Swiss Re registered shares rose SFr40 to SFr2,400 and Zurich Insurance
registered shares were SFr60 firmer at SFr4,060.
Roche bearers rose SFr10 to SFr4,300 ahead of its 1991 results today.
AMSTERDAM finished a dull day slightly higher as a lack of news kept
turnover to Fl 549.4m. The CBS Tendency Index rose 0.7 to 125.2.
Fokker was the highlight on persistent rumours that Deutsche Aerospace was
to make a bid. Fokker said that it would make an announcement on its
discussions with the German group by the end of the month. The shares hit an
intraday high of Fl 35.40 before closing 50 cents ahead at Fl 34.20.
Begemann, the industrial group, announced a 15.6 per cent increase in 1991
net profit and gained Fl 1.00 to Fl 120.00, while Heineken was Fl 1.30
stronger at Fl 189.30 ahead of the release of its annual report.
STOCKHOLM saw continued weakness in shares in the troubled banking group
Gota. Its A shares fell SKr3 to SKr18, down 25 per cent since Monday. The
Affarsvarlden general index fell 1.3 to 993.4 in steady turnover of SKr405m.
VIENNA closed at its lowest level since the end of January. The 18-share ATX
index declined 11.91 to 993.42.
ISTANBUL weakened after interest rates were raised. The 75-share index
closed down 74.41 or 1.8 per cent at 3,987.77.

FT  03 APR 92 / Money Markets: Trading calms again
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK money market was calmer yesterday after frenzied dealing on
Wednesday, as two new opinion polls contradicted those that had given the
opposition Labour party a clear lead.
Dealers said an inevitable mood of uncertainty hung over the market as it
entered the final week before the general election on April 9, but that
prices had already gone a long way towards discounting a Labour majority or
hung parliament.
The key three-month interbank rate eased slightly to 11 1/8 -11 per cent
from 11 1/4 -11 1/8 on Wednesday. The six-month and one-year rates were also
each down by  1/8 point to 11 1/4 -11 3/16 per cent and 11 5/16 -11 3/16 per
cent respectively. Rates still reflected expectations of at least a
half-point rise in the base rate, although analysts point out that
historically, rises have tended to be at least a full point.
June short sterling opened up eight basis points at 88.80, but later dropped
back to 88.71 in fairly slow trading.
Day-to-day funding was relatively cheap, despite a shortage forecast that
was nearly twice what the market was expecting, with the Bank of England
apparently seeking to foster comfortable credit conditions and alleviate
pressure on the shorter interbank rates.
The Bank forecast a shortage of around Pounds 800m, and acted early to plug
the gap, purchasing a total of Pounds 725m, comprising Pounds 405m of band 1
bank bills and Pounds 120m band 2 band bills, both at 10 3/8 per cent, as
well as Pounds 200m for resale on April 13 at 10 7/16 per cent.
Overnight rates dropped below 8 per cent as a result, and although the
forecast was revised upwards to Pounds 850m at midday, with no further
operations by the Bank, they firmed only to 9-8 1/2 per cent.
The Bank again did not act in the afternoon, until it provided late
assistance of Pounds 35m. This left around Pounds 90m of the shortage
uncovered, pushing up overnight money to 10 1/2 -10 per cent towards the
close.
German call money rates rose close to the Bundesbank's emergency Lombard
rate of 9.75 per cent, after the bank removed a hefty DM9.4bn from the
system with this week's securities repurchase transaction on Wednesday.
Dealers quoted call money at 9.70/75 per cent, compared with 9.65/70 per
cent the day before.

FT  03 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: US pork producers in export
subsidy row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN PORK producers and their supporters in Congress are up in arms
about the US Department of Agriculture's rejection of export subsidies for
the sale of pork to the Commonwealth of Independent States.
In a letter to President Bush, Congressman Jim Leach, an Iowa republican,
warned of political trouble ahead 'if the administration does not give
farmers a sense that they have the ear of and a stake in this
administration'.
Otherwise, he said: 'I have no doubt that rural America will look to
alternative leadership.'
The Bush administration on Wednesday called for an additional Dollars 1.1bn
worth of credit guarantees for the CIS. For years it provided the former
Soviet government with subsidies for grain - mostly wheat - and even
poultry. But it is resisting expanding the Export Enhancement subsidy
programme (EEP) to other meat, even though pork supplies are likely to be at
their highest point in recent history.
Officials of Prodintorg, the Russian buying agency, were in Washington this
week, to request subsidies for the proposed sale, of 30,000 tonnes of pork.
Congressmen Leach and 59 other members of the House of Representatives and
the Senate urged the administration to support the sale in order to help
develop new markets.
They contended that US subsidy funding would be better spent on value-added
exports, particularly those in which 'the Europeans are developing a virtual
monopoly'.
The USDA gave no reason for rejecting the offer and said it might be
considered later on.
There was speculation that the State Department did not want to interfere
with Poland and other Eastern European countries obtaining a share of the
market in a area where they are competitive.
The National Pork Producers Council issued a statement declaring its
disappointment. 'The NPPC cannot get a straight answer from the
administration officials as to why the use of EEP funds was rejected,' it
said. 'It clearly shows that the administration still does not have the
message when it comes to the need for value-added exports. It sounds like
business as usual.'

FT  03 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: New era for wine industry as
quotas end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SOUTH African wine industry received a tremendous boost this week with
the announcement that quota requirements in the industry are to be
abolished.
The announcement, made by the KWV, the co-operative body that supervises the
local industry, is the most important reform in the sector in decades. It
has been welcomed by producers as a long overdue step that will revitalise
the industry and stimulate the production of quality wines.
Introduced in 1956 in an effort to control production in the country, the
quota system meant that producers could not grow grapes and manufacture and
sell wine without first having a production quota. Quotas were attached to
existing vineyards, so, until the implementation of reforms in 1985, it was
not possible to become a wine farmer except by buying out an existing
producer. Quotas were also very expensive - as much as R800 (Pounds 131) a
tonne in some areas.
The system had an marked detrimental effect on the development of the
quality wine industry in South Africa. When quotas were first handed out in
the 1950s, the industry was very different from its present form. There was
a bias in favour of quantity production, associated with warm, fertile, high
yielding areas, and against cooler areas where slower maturation favoured
making quality wines. With quotas fixed in areas unsuitable for the
production of quality wines, and no new quotas handed out since 1975, the
regulations were an important inhibition to developing the cooler regions.
Mr Tim Hamilton Russell, one of the country's leading wine makers and a
leading opponent of the KWV, commented: 'The whole system was designed to
prevent the development of the quality end of the wine industry.'
He said it had allowed the less regulated Californian and Australian wine
industries to steal a march on South Africa. Looking ahead, he said the
abandonment of quotas would create a freer climate to invest in the wine
industry, encouraging especially the people, dedicated to quality, who come
to wine 'through the glass, not the soil'.
Mr Allan Mullins, who heads the wine division of the Woolworths store group,
described the announcement as 'a fantastic step, a very progressive move'.
He said it was a brave initiative on the part of the KWV because most of
their shareholders were commodity grape growers who were unlikely to gain,
and might well lose, from the initiative.
Probably the main factor which encouraged the KWV to initiate the quota
reform was the opening up of new markets to South African products, which
has reduced the prospect of significant oversupply.
Despite the latest announcement, the industry remains highly regulated, with
the guaranteed minimum price mechanism the most glaring reminder.

350 dismissals
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SOCIEDAD Minera y Metalurgica de Penarroya, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Franco-German multinational Metaleurop, said yesterday that it had dismissed
350 workers at the Santa Lucia smelter in Cartagena.
Penarroya is expected to shut the 90,000 tonne primary lead smelter, the
company's only industrial asset, within two months.
The lead works recently filed for temporary receivership. The company said
adverse economic and financial conditions as well as local political and
environmental factors had forced the smelter's closure.

study

NIPPON MINING, the Japanese resources group, has taken a 15 per cent stake
in a ADollars 10m (Pounds 4.5m) feasibility study being carried out by MIM,
the Australian mining group, into metals deposit at Macarthur River in the
Northern Territory.
MIM said Nippon had also taken an option on 15 per cent of the deposit if
development proceeded. The ore body, midway between Mount Isa and Darwin, is
thought to contain some 200m tonnes of zinc, lead and silver ore.
Macarthur River is the third joint venture between MIM and Nippon. The two
companies last week announced the go-ahead for a Y50bn (Pounds 215m) lead
and zinc smelter in Japan, to be built together with Mitsui Mining and
Smelting and Mitsubishi Materials.
MIM produces copper, lead, silver and zinc from its main mines at Mount Isa,
Queensland, and has extensive interests in coal and gold mines in Australia
and Papua New Guinea.
The group suffered a 76 per cent fall in interim net operating profits to
ADollars 16m in the six months to December, but says it will achieve a
reduction of ADollars 100m a year in Mount Isa operating costs this year.
Western Mining Corporation has asked the Western Australian Industrial
Relations Commission to order striking miners to return to work at its
Kambalda nickel operation.
Mr Phil Lockyer, general manager of state operations, said the strikers had
twice rejected a compromise agreement reached between the company and the
Australian Workers Union.
WMC says the strikers are seeking a general increase in piece rates of 18
per cent, and a specific increase of 30 per cent for part of the workforce,
but have rejected proposed productivity improvements.
The miners have been on indefinite strike since March 17, but the company
claims a total of 35 working days have been lost since the claim was made.
The IRC has the power to order the strikers to return to work while
negotiations take place.

FT  03 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Increase in Colombian coffee
production causing concern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BOGOTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COLOMBIAN coffee growers are, as always, hopeful that progress towards the
revival of the International Coffee Agreement will be made at negotiations
in London next week, but the country's high production level is causing
concern both among other producing nations and at home.
The 1991-92 harvest is estimated at 16m to 17m bags (of 60 kg), 3m to 4m
bags more than Colombia's traditional output level.
Although the extended dry season may affect the secondary harvest beginning
now, coffee stocks are likely to increase again this year, even if exports
can be kept at 13m bags.
Colombia's production problem is partly the result of the government's use
of the National Coffee Fund to cushion the effect of low international
prices.
From the collapse of the ICA's export quota system in July 1989 until the
beginning of this year, the government continued to raise the domestic price
paid to growers, though at a slightly slower rate than inflation.
In February, when the National Coffee Fund's reserves had dropped by over
USDollars 350m, the domestic price was reduced for the first time. 'The
lower price and the loss of the subsidy for fertiliser will have a big
effect, though it cannot be seen immediately,' said Ms Soraya Otero of the
Co-Operative's exporting group, Expocafe.
However, a financial incentive to take older coffee plantations out of
production for renewal could, in fact, raise output in the long term. Some
experts argue that only the most efficient producers, and those with no
alternative, will survive the present market. That means that the
medium-scale farmer, who has accounted for a big share of Colombia's
production, may be the most vulnerable.
Colombia has raised its share of world exports to about 16 per cent in the
last three years, by combining good quality with aggressive sales. But 'it's
been a very difficult, uncertain market', said Ms Otero. 'Nobody has liked
the way the business has gone and we all want an agreement'.
Despite bigger export volumes, the National Coffee Growers Federation
estimates that the country has lost over USDollars 540m in earnings, and
coffee now contributes less than a quarter of foreign income.

FT  03 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Most members fail to act on
cocoa pact repayments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWITZERLAND, Belgium/Luxembourg and Gabon were the only member countries of
the International Cocoa Organisation (ICCO) to meet the March 31 deadline
for partial payment of arrears to the pact's buffer stock fund, an ICCO
official said in London yesterday, reports Reuter.
Arrears on payments to the fund, set up to maintain the cocoa accumulated in
the ICCO's buffer stock under the last price-supporting International Cocoa
Agreement, amounted to just under Dollars 146m at the end of 1991.
Most of this was owed by the world's two largest producers, the Ivory Coast
and Brazil.
The Dollars 146m total was after 3.5 per cent of total arrears had been paid
by most debtors as agreed at the November meeting of the ICCO council.
The second tranche of 3.5 per cent was due to be paid by March 31, with two
further repayments of 1.5 per cent scheduled for the end of June and
September this year.
Repayment of arrears is seen as a crucial issue for consuming country
members, who have suggested that financing for a stock withholding scheme to
support prices under a new agreement should be provided out of the buffer
stock fund.
Negotiations of a new cocoa accord with economic clauses are scheduled to
begin on April 21 in Geneva.

PLATINUM led a sharp downturn in the precious metal market yesterday. The
white metal surrendered Dollars 7.25 of the Dollars 12 rise registered
earlier in the week to reach Dollars 355.25 a troy ounce at the afternoon
fixing. Dealers said the rally, based on reduced fears of heavy Soviet
shipments and more hopeful US economic indicators, had been overdone. They
also suggested that Japanese investors had sold platinum to cover equity
market losses. The London bullion market GOLD price touched Dollars 339.25
an ounce before closing Dollars 3.10 down on the day at Dollars 340.90 an
ounce. But traders were predicting that the market would soon be re-testing
support at Dollars 339 an ounce and might then move back towards the recent
six-year low. 'Gold doesn't look good and Comex has tried to push it, but if
they think Europe is short they are very, very wrong,' one dealer said. At
the London Metal Exchange COPPER prices fell back from early highs to finish
little changed on the day. Dealers said the run-up in copper prices was
halted by news that Zambian railway workers had called off their strike.
Three months NICKEL met selling and liquidation above the Dollars 7,500
level.

FT  03 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: S African farms face drought
costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA faces the prospect of a drop of up to 50 per cent in
agricultural output for the 1991-92 season as farmers experience perhaps the
worst drought this century.
Particularly affected are grain producers in summer rainfall areas, with the
maize crop, the country's largest, already devastated.
The official estimate, released in mid-March, is for a crop of 2.1m tonnes
and some economists believe this figure could still drop to 1.8m tonnes.
This compares to a crop last year of 7.8m tonnes.
Mr Peter Cownie, general manager of the maize board, which sets maize prices
in the country, says: 'This is undoubtedly one of the worst two droughts
this century. The farmers are not going to be able to get back on their feet
again without state intervention'.
To meet the country's needs, up to 5.5m tonnes of maize, at a cost of about
R580-R600 (Pounds 95-Pounds 98) a tonne once transport costs are taken into
account, will have to be imported. Thus, apart from the estimated R2bn-3bn
in lost earnings that farmers will suffer, there will probably be a cash
outflow from the country of R2bn-3bn to pay for the imports.
Maize prices will also rise. Mr Cownie says: 'The aim would be to keep the
price rise within range of the general inflation rate'.
The price will rise because of the added cost of transporting a large
portion of the maize from coastal ports to inland silos. The board, says Mr
Cownie, also has to try and pay for its infrastructural capacity, including
40m tonnes of silo capacity, on a crop effectively only 25 per cent of
normal volumes.
Mr Fanie Brink, economist at the National Association of Maize Producers
(Nampo), says the average national yield for this year's maize crop is 600
kg a hectare. The previous worst yield was 1 tonne a hectare in 1982-83. He
says none of the 8,000 to 10,000 maize farmers in the country will break
even. Depending on the geographical area in which they farm, they require
yields of 2.5 to 3.5 tonnes a hectare to do so.
The government set aside R1bn in the budget, delivered two weeks ago, for
drought relief. Committees are currently at work trying to decide how best
this money should be spent. Officials of agricultural organisations have
already said the money is insufficient.
Mr Barend du Plessis, the finance minister, described this sum in his budget
address as a 'ceiling', so it must be doubtful whether more will be spent,
especially given that the state is already budgeting for a 4.5 per cent
budget deficit. And many economists think it has been over-generous in its
revenue estimates.
Preliminary indications from the government suggest the aid will be
distributed on a merit basis - to farmers who appear to have the potential
to survive.
The knock-on effect of the drought will also be considerable. Most
economists believe that it will cut the country's growth rate by about 0.5
per cent, with the result that few expect the economy to record real growth
of more than 1 per cent this year. The cumulative farming debt - currently
about R17bn - will grow further, in the process driving many farmers, who
were under immense financial strain before the drought, off the land.
Some observers welcome this, saying it is time the state started encouraging
farmers in high-risk areas to face the consequences. They argue that these
farmers should be forced to take out more crop insurance, weighing this cost
against the possibility of a premium crop. Such farmers should not be able
to rely on automatic state aid when the elements turn against them.

<TEXT>
HUDSON BAY, whose Flin Flon metallurgical operations in Manitoba were
threatened with closure because they could not meet new environmental
regulations, is on course for a substantial expansion and cut in production
costs.
A CDollars 183m (Pounds 89m) modernisation scheme, primarily designed to
cope with environmental problems, would also boost annual zinc output from
about 80,000 to 100,000 tonnes and copper production from 70,000 to 80,000
tonnes, said Mr Tim Wadeson, technical director of Minorco, yesterday.
Minorco, part of the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa, took over
Hudson Bay for USDollars 85 in August. Canada's federal government has
provided a CDollars 25m loan and the provincial government one of CDollars
55m towards the modernisation project.
Mr Wadeson said at a presentation to the Association of Mining Analysts in
London that the scheme was likely to be finished ahead of schedule and under
budget in 1994.
Then Hudson's zinc production costs (including credits for by-product
metals) would be down from 50 cents a lb to 30 cents, making it one of the
world's most competitive producers.
Hudson Bay was spending CDollars 12m a year on exploration near its nine
mines in Manitoba and Saskatchewan and recently more ore had been found at
depth at the Trout Lake mine.
Mr Wadeson said recent exploration work by Minorco's Independence Mining
subsidiary might, 'if we're lucky', result in a new gold mine and associated
plant in Nevada. Independence had lifted annual exploration spending from
USDollars 11.7m to Dollars 15.2m.
Since Minorco acquired Independence for Dollars 705m from Freeport McMoRan
in 1990, total reserves and resources had increased by 40 per cent: to 2.9m
ounces of gold in reserves and 2.7m ounces in resources.
Independence expected to produce 317,218 ounces of gold at a cash cost of
Dollars 229 an ounce in the 1991-92 year to generate revenue of Dollars 357
an ounce. This compared with 304,682 ounces at a cost of Dollars 220 and
revenue per ounce of Dollars 374 in the previous 12 months.

FT  03 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Options market in bid to
expand retail business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EFFORTS to revive trading of individual UK stock options following the
merger of the London International Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe) and
the London Traded Options Market (LTOM) will centre on attracting more
retail business to the market.
'We have never had the heart and soul - or the portfolio, or the cheque book
 -of the private client,' said Mr Geoffrey Chamberlain, former chairman of
LTOM, speaking yesterday at a seminar on the future of the equity options
market, organised by Futures and Options World.
'There cannot be a successful stock options market without private client
business. We should not be afraid of using the word speculation to apply to
a certain part of the market.'
The business plan for equity options being prepared by Liffe will focus on
educating retail investors, according to Mr Michael Jenkins, chief executive
of the merged exchange. One reason for their desertion from the market -
apart from the crash of 1987 - was that many banks and brokers became
increasingly disinterested in serving retail clients.
But the focus on retail participation was disputed by some market
participants, who pointed to the broad trend away from retail investment
towards collective investment schemes. 'You need a bull market to attract
retail investors,' said one.
Nevertheless, the bid to attract retail business is already under way
elsewhere. Five US exchanges have agreed to commit Dollars 2m annually for
the next three years in an effort to rejuvenate equity options trading.
Traditionally high, the level of US participation has been slipping in the
past few years. The money will be spent on television and print advertising
and a system of seminars, according to Mr David Hall of the Chicago Board
Options Exchange.
Among the barriers to a successful market identified, traders and fund
managers were particularly concerned by the lack of transparency in the
underlying stock market. Currently, there is a 90 minute deadline for
marketmakers to report large trades. This is to be extended this year to 24
hours. As a result, marketmakers in equity options will suffer from the lack
of transparency, which will in turn have some impact on the potential
liquidity of the equity options market.
In a questionnaire completed by fund managers and traders attending the
conference, poor liquidity was cited as the main reason for not using the
market, followed by lack of support from trustees and wide dealing spreads.
'Fear of getting it wrong' was ranked lowest.
One advantage of the merger is already being demonstrated. According to
figures released by the London Clearing House, which clears all products
traded on the merged market, the total amount of margin for equity options
halved during the first week's trading from Pounds 220m to Pounds 100m. The
clearing house attributed the swing to the introduction of SPAN, Liffe's
portfolio-based method of margining, for equity options and to the change to
a principal-to-principal clearing system, which allows members to pay margin
net rather than gross.

FT  03 APR 92 / International Bonds: Volatility brings new issues almost to
a halt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE pace of new issue activity in the international bond market slowed
almost to a stop yesterday against a background of volatility in the
Japanese and many European government bond markets.
Traders said that US employment statistics due to be released today could
give a firmer indication of the future direction of US interest rates.
Uncertainty over the prospects for the US Treasury bond market has also
discouraged investors from committing funds to the primary Eurobond market.
Norway's Dollars 1bn five-year issue, launched on Tuesday to yield 25 basis
points more than US Treasury bonds, had widened yesterday to a yield spread
of around 28 basis points.
Syndicate officials said a fall in US Treasury bond yields since the deal
was launched had contributed to the widening yield spread, although some of
the paper remained on the books of underwriters.
Elsewhere, new issue activity was restricted to specialist equity-linked
issues. Jardine Strategic Holdings, the Hong Kong quoted holding company for
the Jardine agriculture to banking interests, launched a Dollars 200m issue
of undated convertible preference shares.
The issue, lead managed by Jardine Fleming, pays a fixed dividend of 7.5 per
cent and will be convertible into ordinary shares at a 16 to 18 per cent
premium to the share price when the deal is priced next week.
Unlike most convertible bonds, the preference shares do not have a
redemption date, although the paper can be bought back - or called - by the
company after five years. However, if the call is not exercised, the only
exit for investors is via conversion into ordinary shares.
The ordinary shares currently yield 3.9 per cent on the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange. Participants in the transaction said the paper appealed to equity
investors keen to pick up a high cash yield. Many of the buyers were
continental European and US equity fund managers with no specialist interest
in the Far East. The scope of JSH's interest make its shares an easy route
to exposure to many Asian markets.
SASIB, the Italian industrial group, priced its unusual L65bn five-year
convertible issue launched on Monday via Lehman Brothers International.
The paper carries a coupon of 9 1/4 per cent and converts into SASIB savings
shares at L5,100, a small 3 per cent premium over yesterday's share price.
Like the Jardine Strategic issue, the bonds were seen as a high-yielding
proxy for equity investment. SASIB's savings shares currently yield 5 per
cent. The paper is mandatorily convertible into equity after five years.

CBOT will launch its homeowners' insurance futures on September 25 following
the start of a homeowners' insurance pool index on June 15. The futures will
be based on a pool index reflecting gross profitability claims versus
premiums of a pool of at least 100,000 homeowners' insurance policies.
The exchange plans to begin publishing a health insurance pool index later

linked deal

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HEWLETT-Packard, the US computer and electronic instruments manufacturer,
has issued Dollars 100m of equity-linked notes (ELN), becoming the first US
company to raise financing via ELNs, a product that made its name last year
in the Euro-franc market, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
Societe Generale, the French bank, lead-managed the issue, which has a
maturity date of April 25 1995. The notes are linked to Hewlett equity to a
gearing of 1.34, with 90 per cent of the investor principal guaranteed on
maturity if the stock price drops more than 10 per cent.
Bankers behind the deal said Hewlett favoured the ELN issue because it would
not be dilutive of the company's stock. They also said interest in the paper
from both European and US institutions had been good, primarily because of
the scarcity of Hewlett debt - there are no convertibles or equity warrants,
and only a few straight bonds currently in the market.

FT  03 APR 92 / International Company News: Foreigners join the queue for
Shenzhen flotations - Why investors are braving the risks on China's fastest
growing stock exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last November the streets of Shenzhen City, the capital of the special
economic zone to the north of Hong Kong, were busier than usual.
The Shenzhen stock exchange was about to distribute application forms for
subscription to 11 company flotations, then planned for 1992. More than
100,000 Chinese investors from all over the country had come to Shenzhen and
camped outside the offices of financial institutions in an attempt to get in
early.
Since Beijing allowed foreigners to own shares in Chinese companies,
investors in Europe, North America and elsewhere have been following the
lead of local investors. They may not be camping on the kerbside but they
are doing the next best thing, contacting their brokers in Hong Kong and
trying to get on the list. Foreign investors are even calling journalists in
Hong Kong to find out the details of the latest offerings.
Mutual funds and unit trusts targeted at the Chinese have allocated at least
Dollars 150m to buy shares in quoted companies on the Shenzhen exchange and
Shanghai stock market - a figure equal to the total equity in Chinese stocks
so far issued.
Chinese companies, aware of the foreign interest and keen to exploit the tax
breaks which they get from having foreign investors, have been queueing up
to get their stock listed. A Chinese company located outside one of the
country's special economic zones only has to pay 15 per cent tax on profits
to the central government if it has foreign shareholders, compared with
around 50 per cent if it remains wholly owned by the state.
In Shenzhen, Mr Wang Jian, executive director of the exchange, said he had
received applications from 119 companies (both in Shenzhen and throughout
China) to have their shares listed. Few realised the amount of paper work
entailed in the 35 separate steps they had to take before they could have
their company's shares listed, he said.
There are currently seven companies listed on the Shenzhen exchange, with a
further five due for listing in the next two months and another 14 due for
listing in the second half of this year - quite an acceleration compared
with the 11 expected in November.
So far, four have issued 'B' shares, which only foreigners can buy. The 'B'
shares rank equally with 'A' shares, which are for domestic investors, but
they have to be paid for in US dollars and receive dividends in dollars.
Shanghai, although technically the first stock exchange to reopen in China,
has been slow to develop. Eight companies have shares listed on the Shanghai
exchange but only one - Shanghai Vacuum - has issued 'B' shares to
foreigners. Four more are in the queue to issue 'B' shares.
The city was recently admonished by Mr Zhu Rongji, China's industry minister
and the former mayor of Shanghai, for its slowness in developing the
exchange. He criticised local bureaucrats for being short-sighted and urged
them to allow more companies to issue stock.
Shenzhen has comprehensively stolen the march on Shanghai; its speed of
development and the activity on its exchange has made it the market of
choice for foreign investors. The four stocks which foreigners can own are
trading at premiums to their issue price of between 61 per cent and 96 per
cent. In contrast, Shanghai Vacuum, after an initial burst of enthusiasm, is
trading at a premium of about 4 per cent.
The attraction of the Shenzhen market is obvious, but the risks of investing
in 'B' shares are many.
Even though China appears to be on the verge of embracing another round of
economic reforms, the country's flirtation with capitalism is anything if
not pragmatic. And like share prices - which can fall as well as rise -
pragmatism also has a downside.
The country's most senior leader, the 87-year-old Mr Deng Xiaoping, is an
ardent supporter of the types of reforms being undertaken in Shenzhen and
southern China more generally, but he is also a communist. As he told the
Politburo recently, if stock markets in China did not work, then they could
be closed down.
The more serious political risk is the possibility of political instability
after the death of Mr Deng and the other seven octogenarians who comprise
the 'revolutionary' cohort of the leadership. The effect on prices could be
significant if the leadership transition were to go badly.
The more immediate risks are much more mundane but no less important for the
investor. There is no securities law in China; neither is there any
corporate law and accounting standards are rudimentary.
Indeed, the whole concept of law, as westerners may understand it, is
unknown in China, where what law there is applies to those who are governed,
not those who govern. This makes it potentially tricky for the foreign
investor because the companies being offered to foreigners are those which
are well connected politically.
However, Beijing does have a companies law on the drawing board, and its
experts are looking at the whole issue of accounting and adopting
international accounting standards. And Chinese companies do realise that to
get western capital they have to present information in a way westerners can
understand.
Equally positive is that exchange officials in Shenzhen are genuinely
concerned that their market operates fairly and transparently. But with all
things in China the proof the pudding lies in the eating.

shipyards

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GREECE'S state-owned Commercial Bank has agreed to sell Eleusis shipyards,
the country's second largest ship repair and construction facility, to a
group of London-based Greek shipowners for Dollars 60m.
The group, led by Mr Constantine Peratikos, will pay only Dollars 12m in
cash, but will assume some of the yard's liabilities, estimated to be more
than Dr60bn (Dollars 307m), according to the bank.
Commercial Bank holds a 63 per cent stake in Eleusis shipyards, with the
remainder held by other companies in the bank's holding group and the
state-owned Hellenic Industrial Development Bank.
Mr Peratikos, chairman of Pegasus Ocean Services, controls a fleet of 22
vessels, most of which are Greek-registered.
The shipyard sale marks the second major disposal under the government's
privatisation programme. It follows the sale last month of Heracles Cement
to a joint venture led by Calcestruzzi of Italy, part of the Ferruzzii
group, for Dollars 124m.
Despite having a strong order book, which included building landing craft
for the Greek navy and heavy cranes for Salonica Port Authority in northern
Greece, Eleusis shipyards posted operating losses of Dr6.4bn (Dollars 32.8m)
on turnover of Dr10.8bn in 1990.
However, Commercial Bank wrote off a large proportion of accumulated losses
at the end of 1991, with government approval, in preparation for selling the
yard.
Greece undertook to sell or close down its four shipyards, all state-owned,
by mid-1992 to comply with European Community regulations on ending
subsidies to the shipbuilding industry.
Eleusis is the first yard to be sold. Another, Halkis shipyards, has been
leased to an Athens-based Greek shipowner, while liquidation procedures are
underway at the Neorion and Scaramanga yards.

MR LI KA-SHING, Hong Kong's richest man, is to step down from the deputy
chairmanship of HSBC Holdings, the owner of Hongkong and Shanghai Bank.
Mr Li has been a member of Hongkong Bank's board since 1980 and its
non-executive deputy chairman since 1985.
The bank said he was retiring to devote more time to his other business and
personal interests.
It said that Mr Li had wanted to step down for the past two years, but it
prevailed upon him to stay. The bank said his advice had been greatly
valued.
Mr Li is one of the bank's biggest shareholders. He owns nearly 1 per cent
of the bank - the limit it places on individual shareholdings - and stands
to be a large shareholder of the bank that will emerge from the merger of
Hongkong Bank with Midland Bank of the UK.
Mr David Gledhill, the retiring chairman of the Swire group, will also
relinquish his Hongkong Bank board seat. The bank and Swire have a very
close relationship, and it would be no surprise if Mr Peter Sutch, chairman
designate of Swire, were to be appointed to the bank's board.
Also to step down from the bank's board is Mr FR Frame, an executive
director since 1985, but he will continue as an adviser to the board.
Husky Oil, the Canadian oil group controlled by Mr Li Ka-shing, is asking
its government partners to put up another CDollars 140m (USDollars 117.6m)
to get its USDollars 1.5bn heavy-oil upgrader on stream in November, Robert
Gibbens reports from Montreal.
Husky, with a 27 per cent stake in the upgrader on the border of Alberta and
Saskatchewan, would put up an extra CDollars 50m, said Mr Arthur Price,
Husky president.
The Alberta government, with a 24 per cent stake, and the federal
government, with 32 per cent, have given the company the nod, but
Saskatchewan, with 17 per cent, is questioning the project's viability.

MITSUBISHI KASEI, Japan's largest chemical company, yesterday indicated that
its pre-tax profit for the year just ended could be around Y13bn (Dollars
96.8m), down from Y28.5bn a year earlier, as demand for petrochemical
products has fallen in tandem with the slowing economy.
The company admitted it would be 'almost impossible' to reach a
previously-forecast profit of Y17bn.
Mitsubishi Kasei said falling demand for chemicals and continuing high costs
in the distribution sector, which is still affected by a labour shortage,
had lowered profits sharply.
However, it said investment in plant and equipment was likely to remain
unchanged this year, while research and development spending would rise from
Y41bn last year to Y42bn in the current period.

Paribas
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STANDARD &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, has downgraded the long-term debt
rating of Banque Paribas, the French commercial bank, to AA minus from AA,
AP-DJ reports.
S&amp;P said it had also removed Banque Paribas from its credit-watch
surveillance list, where the bank was placed on January 30 with negative
implications.
'The actions are based on the two-year deterioration in loan quality of the
consolidated Paribas group in the context of a longer term erosion of
operating profitability,' the agency said.
'The decline is most significant in Banque Paribas and its international
banking subsidiaries, which as a group have increased loss provisions
fourfold over the past two years.'
Almost FFr3bn (Dollars 538.5m) in provisions were taken in 1991 by the
group's Swiss subsidiary bank, Paribas Suisse, to cover problem commercial
real estate loans in Geneva and significant exposures to the troubled
Maxwell group, according to S&amp;P.
The agency said it had also downgraded the rating on Banque Paribas' Dollars
200m subordinated perpetual debt issue to A from A plus, and removed it from
credit watch.
In a related action, the long-term debt ratings of Compagnie Bancaire and
Compagnie Bancaire's guaranteed subsidiaries were also lowered to AA minus
from AA.
S&amp;P said it also downgraded its certificate of deposit ratings on Banque
Paribas and Compagnie Bancaire to AA minus/ A 1 plus from AA/A 1 plus.
The agency affirmed the A 1 plus ratings on the commercial paper programmes
of Paribas Finance and Paribas Bank of Canada, both guaranteed by Compagnie
Financiere de Paribas. Also affirmed was the A 1 plus rating on the CP
programmes of Compagnie Bancaire US Finance guaranteed by Compagnie
Bancaire.
About Dollars 1.2bn of Banque Paribas debt and Dollars 8bn of Compagnie
Bancaire debt is affected.
The agency added that Credit du Nord, the Paribas Group's wholly-owned
retail subsidiary bank, also made large 1991 loan loss provisions.

AN international air transport consortium is launching a commercial
telecommunications services company to provide value-added network services
to industries ranging from leisure to financial services.
The Socie'te' Internationale de Te'le'communications Aeronautiques (Sita), a
non-profit-making organisation of 460 member companies from the airline,
aerospace and related industries, is investing about Dollars 20m over the
next four to five years in Scitor, a wholly owned UK-based subsidiary.
Scitor, which will provide services, such as reservation systems for hotels
and sales systems for multinationals, aims for revenues of Dollars 100m by
1998. It has already won orders worth Dollars 40m from 250 companies
including Hilton International and Budget Rent A Car.
Value-added network services are the fastest growing sector of Europe's
information services industry with revenues forecast to increase from
Dollars 3.8bn last year to over Dollars 10bn in 1995, according to BIS
Strategic Decisions, the market research company.
PHILIPS, the Dutch electonics group, is launching Compact Disc Interactive
(CD-I), a multi-media home entertainment system, in the UK earlier than
planned in an effort to speed up the product's penetration of international
markets.
CD-I combines audio, video, text, animation and graphics on a compact disc.
It is one of three products which Philips is counting on to boost its
depressed consumer electronics business. The other two are digital compact
disc, scheduled to be launched in the autumn and high definition TV.
The Dutch group has invested a significant amount in developing CD-I and the
software for the system which allows the user to manipulate the material on
the televsion screen.
The difficulty in marketing CD-I is that, unlike compact discs, which have
easily recognisable advantages, CD-I is an entirely new concept so that
Philips needs to educate consumers about its merits. The UK launch has been
brought forward from September when it was initially scheduled to be
introduced into EC markets.

<TEXT>
ENGEN, the integrated energy arm of Gencor of South Africa, outperformed
market expectations to record a 21 per cent increase in earnings per share
in the six months to the end of February.
Although turnover was only 4 per cent higher at R3.23bn (Dollars 1.12bn),
operating income was 15.2 per cent higher at R190m.
Net income rose by a spectacular 68.9 per cent, to R206m, due to an enormous
leap in finance income - from R5m in 1991 to R67m in 1992 - which reflected
the interest receipts on the proceeds of last year's R1.1bn rights issue.
Mr Rob Angel, chief executive, said the recent affirmative vote in the
referendum on South Africa's political future would bring very valuable
benefits to the group. He predicted the vote would lead to an early
abolition of the UN oil embargo against South Africa. He also said the vote
would have a very positive impact on the company's activities in Africa and
enhanced the prospects of a strategic alliance with a leading world oil
company.
The increase in earnings per share was limited to 21 per cent - up to 134
cents from 111 cents - on account of a 40 per cent increase in the number of
shares in issue.
The dividend was lifted by 19 per cent to 50 cents a share.
Mr Angel said that the group had recorded an overall volume increase of
about 3 per cent, including a three-fold increase in exports over the
previous six months. Exports now constitute about 10 per cent of total
volumes. Most of these extra volumes were sent to the 15 African countries
with which Engen now trades.
Refining margins were Dollars 1.50 to Dollars 2 below the 1991 average, but
this was compensated for by a 15 per cent increase in drilling in Gabon and
the Congo.

P&amp;G-Finaf nappy venture

<TEXT>
PROCTER &amp; Gamble of the US and Finaf of Italy face further problems in their
nappy-making joint ventures in southern Europe after the European Commission
yesterday reversed its position that the enterprises would not cause undue
concentration in the nappy market.
The two companies modified their plans last autumn at Brussels' behest,
after which the Commission said it intended to give its approval to the
joint ventures, and invited public comment.
Such invitations usually stir little reaction. But in this case it brought
complaints from several governments, as well as from no fewer than 10 of the
two companies' competitors in the European nappy market.
Using more up-to-date figures on P&amp;G's recent market share, the Commission
has concluded that the joint ventures in Italy, Spain and Portugal would
give the two companies more than half the EC nappy market.
The Commission said it was hard to see how Brussels' new concerns could be
satisfied without some divestment.
P&amp;G said it was 'very ready' to negotiate further with the Commission.
However, the company, which makes Pampers, noted that nappies were 'a very
volatile market'. There was very little brand loyalty, it said, because new
mothers were moving into the market all the time. 'Today's share may be
quite different tomorrow,' P&amp;G claimed.
After receiving what they thought was final approval from Brussels in
January, P&amp;G and Finaf put the final touches to the management of their
southern European joint ventures.
The Commission's fresh concerns do not affect other products, such as adult
incontinence and female hygiene products.

THOMSON-CSF, the French state-controlled defence company, has joined forces
with two US partners to bid Dollars 400m for the aerospace and missile
businesses of LTV, the US steel and defence company under bankruptcy
protection for the past five years.
The Thomson-CSF bid, which features Hughes Aircraft and the Carlyle Group as
partners, tops a Dollars 355m bid LTV agreed in February with Vought, a
venture formed by US defence groups Lockheed and Martin Marietta.
The French company and Hughes are offering Dollars 280m in cash for LTV's
missile business, while the Carlyle Group, an investment firm run by Mr
Frank Carlucci, the former secretary of defence, is offering Dollars 90m in
cash and Dollars 30m in preferred stock for LTV's aircraft division.
As LTV is operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, any bid for its
assets would need the approval of the judge following its case.
Thomson and its partners claimed that their bid would not create any
anti-trust complications.
Following the acquisition, each division would be separately capitalised and
operated independently, Thomson-CSF said.
LTV's missiles division would remain an American company, it was claimed,
and would observe US Defence Department restrictions to prevent the
unauthorised disclosure of classified information or transfer of sensitive
technology.
Thomson-CSF said compliance with US laws and regulations would be ensured by
a Special Security Agreement (SSA) written to US Defence Department
specifications.
Security compliance would be overseen by an eight-member board of directors,
all but one of whom would be US citizens.
'LTV/MD would stay an American company. The management, employees and
suppliers would be retained,' said Mr Alain Gomez, the Thomson-CSF chairman.
He said LTV and Thomson-CSF have long-standing ties, notably joint work on
the VT1 missile.

FT  03 APR 92 / International Company News: Indonesian gas find boosts
shares of O&amp;Y offshoot
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPECULATION over a natural gas find in Indonesia has pushed up the market
value of one of the companies for which Olympia &amp; York, the debt-burdened
property developer, is seeking a buyer.
The share price of Gulf Canada Resources, a large oil and gas producer, that
is 75 per cent owned by O&amp;Y, has risen by more than 80 per cent in the past
week.
This is attributed mainly to Gulf's announcement last Monday that its
wholly-owned subsidiary, Asamera Oil, has discovered what it described as a
gas zone 'of significant thickness' on the Indonesian island of Sumatra.
The jump in the share price has lifted Gulf's market capitalisation in the
past week from CDollars 724m (USDollars 608.4m) to more than CDollars 1.3bn.
Gulf's shares stood at CDollars 8.25 in early trading on the Toronto stock
exchange yesterday. Uncertainty about O&amp;Y's financial condition pushed them
as low as CDollars 4.50 last month.
Gulf cautioned that initial data from its exploratory well has yet to be
confirmed by more detailed tests. However, the preliminary findings have
prompted speculation that the gas field could be as big as the nearby Arun
field, which is a large supplier of liquefied natural gas to Japan.
Asamera has a 50 per cent equity interest in the area being drilled. The
remainder is owned by Aceh Gas and Oil of Japan. Asamera's discovery has
also pushed up the share price of Encor, another Calgary oil and gas
producer, which has a 22.5 per cent interest in an exploration block in the
Malacca Strait of Sumatra.
O&amp;Y, which is owned by Canada's Reichmann family, has been seeking a buyer
for Gulf as part of efforts to raise cash to service its debt. But Mr Bill
Magee, analyst at Research Capital in Toronto, said yesterday that neither
buyers nor sellers are likely to commit themselves until there is greater
certainty about the value of the Sumatra gas discovery.
Another O&amp;Y subsidiary, GW Utilities, said yesterday that it has bought for
a discounted price the proceeds of a special dividend which it is due to pay
on April 14 to another company controlled by the Reichmann family. The deal
enables the Reichmanns to gain immediate access to the special dividend,
which it is using to meet overdue repayments on two O&amp;Y commercial paper
programmes.
The Reichmanns are entitled to special dividends from GWU of CDollars 158m
on April 14, but will immediately receive CDollars 147m.
O&amp;Y said yesterday that it was immediately using the proceeds of the GWU
special dividend to help retire one of its commercial paper programmes. The
company said it was redeeming about CDollars 78m in securities issued by O&amp;Y
Commercial Paper II. The remainder of the funds would be used to help retire
CDollars 153m in paper which had still to mature.
A run on O&amp;Y's commercial paper last month contributed to the liquidity
crisis which forced it to restructure its debt. Outstanding obligations in a
second CP programme are expected to be met from the sale of Exchange Tower,
a Toronto office building. The company expected this transaction to be
concluded within the next few days.

FT  03 APR 92 / International Company News: White raven turns rival
carmakers green - The ways BMW is planning to stay ahead of the competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BMW turns other car manufacturers green with envy. The Munich-based group's
cars are sleek, sporty, and popular; its sales and profits keep on rising;
and it looks assured of a smooth succession when Mr Eberhard von Kunheim
steps aside as chief executive after a period in the top job unequalled in
the world motor industry.
He gave no hints as to when that would be when speaking at the annual press
conference this week. But, at the age of 63, the time cannot be too far off
when the man who has steered BMW into a period of steadily-rising profits
decides to retire.
The obvious successor is Mr Wolfgang Reitzle, the development director who
recently turned down an offer from the family owners of Porsche, the
beleaguered maker of high-priced sports cars, to become its chief executive.
The snappily dressed Mr Reitzle, 20 years younger than Mr von Kunheim, shows
every sign of wanting to get more closely to grips with the problems ahead
for the German motor industry. 'We have to change the structure of our
company. The conventional cost-cutting approach will not be enough to enable
us to face the challenges of the next 10 years.'
At first sight, BMW would seem to face far fewer problems than other car
companies. It has suffered less than, say, Volkswagen, from the growing
difference between production costs in Germany and elsewhere. Last year,
BMW's turnover was 10 per cent higher at DM29.8bn (Dollars 18bn) and net
profits up by 12.5 per cent to DM783m.
These results set BMW apart from much of the rest of the world motor
industry - at least in Europe and the US - which is struggling to ward off
the impact of recession and to combat stiffer competition, notably from
Japan.
'We are almost like a white raven,' quips Mr Volker Doppelfeld, the finance
director. 'We don't mind if there are several white ravens, but we want to
be one of them.'
Staying up with the industry's elite will be expensive. Since 1988, BMW's
turnover has risen by 21 per cent but development spending has moved up by
35 per cent. 'BMW is healthy and BMW is strong,' Mr Doppelfeld asserts.
Cash-flow last year was DM2.8bn compared with capital spending of DM2.1bn
and its securities and cash holdings exceed DM4bn.
It made a flying start to 1992 with a 24 per cent jump in turnover. But the
comparison was with a period during which it was gearing up production of
the new 3-series, accounting for nearly 60 per cent of production. Even so,
it expects results to improve further this year.
BMW will have to use its financial and innovative strength with increasing
agility to keep matching the competition. Germany's labour costs are some of
the highest in the world, and wage claims this year have approached 10 per
cent. It is against this background that the gradual reduction of labour and
the consideration of sites for a possible US plant must be seen.
As outlined by Mr Reitzle, BMW's strategy is to go for market niches and
segments within those niches. Its touring (estate) version of the 3-series
is an example of this, as are its convertibles.
'If we streamline the whole company in all its activities so that we can
develop, produce, and sell more efficiently than others in certain market
segments and with low volumes and lots of variations, then we shall be in a
unique position,' he says.
At the end of this year, BMW will bring out the M3, the high-performance
sports version of the 3-series. By building on the company's strengths of
design, image, and technology, Mr Reitzle hopes BMW will be able in the
future to charge a price premium of some 15 per cent over comparable models.
This is much less than Mercedes-Benz charges for some of its cars.
BMW has long passed the critical size needed to finance such an approach, he
reckons. With modern and flexible manufacturing technology, much shorter
runs of cars and components are possible without operating at a loss. 'We
can make 30 or 40 12-cylinder engines a day and earn money'. Last year, BMW
made 553,000 cars, a rise of 6.5 per cent; this year will see a further
increase. Ten years ago, it produced 378,000.
BMW, in which most of the shares are owned by the wealthy Quandt family,
could well have a rougher ride ahead of it than in recent years. The US tax
on luxury goods above Dollars 30,000 certainly hurts sales of its more
expensive models in the US, and competition from Japanese cars such as the
Lexus and Infiniti will hot up. Currency swings can hurt sales.
Moreover, there are Germany's high costs, a problem for all of the country's
producers. More and more of the components it buys, whether or not from
German companies, are made abroad. The fuel injection valves BMW buys from
Robert Bosch are actually made in South Carolina. That just happens to be
one of the potential sites the car-maker has been looking at in the US.

CINCINNATI MILACRON, the US machine tool-maker, is beefing up its sales
effort in Germany through a tie-up with Stuttgart-based Hahn &amp; Kolb, one of
the biggest sales and service companies for the German metalworking
industry.
The two companies have signed a sales representation agreement described by
Milacron this week as one of the most significant in its history.
Under the deal, Hahn &amp; Kolb will be responsible for the sales of Milacron's
Sabre range of low-cost machining centres, which are designed and built at
the US company's Birmingham plant in the UK.
The Sabre range has been one of the most successful products of Milacron's
Wolfpack programme for concentrating manufacturing, reducing product
development times and increasing responsiveness to clients' needs to enable
it to recapture markets for standard products lost to the Japanese.
The German machine tool market is currently suffering from weak demand,
along with the rest of Europe, but is generally reckoned to have a lot of
long-term growth potential because of reunification.
However, for foreign machine tool-builders a comprehensive sales network is
essential to help overcome the German preference for buying domestic
equipment.
Mr Malcolm Scarlett, Milacron's UK sales director, said: 'We are excited and
confident that this agreement will lead to a significant increase in Sabre
sales in Germany.'

<TEXT>
WHIRLPOOL, the largest US white goods producer, is extending its expansion
into eastern Europe by creating a wholly-owned Hungarian subsidiary to sell
and service its products under the Bauknecht, Philips and Whirlpool brand
names.
The move comes four months after Whirlpool made its first significant foray
into eastern Europe by forming a joint company in Czechoslovakia to
manufacture and sell washing machines and market other domestic appliances.
Whirlpool, through its Whirlpool International unit, is keen to use its
European presence, acquired through the acquisition of the former Philips
domestic appliances businesses, to develop more markets in eastern Europe.
It also plans to manufacture for export to neighbouring countries and the
former Soviet Union - at least in the case of the Czech venture, with the
local Tatramat company.
The Hungarian subsidiary, Whirlpool Hungarian Trading, will launch early
this month an advertising campaign to promote Whirlpool as a global brand
name, featuring commercials drawn from the US company's pan-European
campaign.
Mr William Marohn, president and chief executive of Whirlpool International,
said Hungary's recent Association Agreement with the European Community
'reinforces our confidence in Hungary's future and our opportunity to
address the rising expectations of Hungarian consumers'.

<TEXT>
SNECMA, the French state-owned maker of aircraft engines, yesterday provided
the latest evidence of the aerospace industry's difficulties by announcing a
loss for 1991 and a 30 per cent decline in new orders.
The group swung into a consolidated FFr68m (Dollars 12m) net loss last year,
from profits of FFr208m in 1990, on a sales increase of 1.7 per cent over
the same period to FFr23.9bn.
Mr Louis Gallois, the chairman, predicted two months ago that Snecma had
roughly broken even in 1991.
Snecma attributed the loss to difficulties at three subsidiaries;
Messier-Bugatti, which makes aircraft brakes and landing gear; the Sochata
maintenance business; and FN Moteurs, its Belgian engine unit.
'All three companies were particularly affected by the recessionary economy
in 1991 and have implemented plans to adapt their industrial and human
resources to changing market conditions,' said Snecma.
The parent company, which embraces most of the engine-making business,
booked FFr7.3bn of new orders last year, down from FFr10.3bn.
However, all the commercial engine programmes in which it competes,
including the CFM-56, made with General Electric of the US, had increased
their market share in a 'fiercely competitive market'.
Net income at the parent company rose from FFr77m to FFr82m, after a FFr408m
extraordinary charge for job losses and depreciation of the value of Snecma
stakes in some subsidiaries.
The group shed 300 jobs last year and has submitted plans to its workforce
for losing another 500.

GROUPE Royale Belge, the Brussels-based insurer, yesterday announced a 12
per cent increase in its consolidated profit for 1991, but refused to
comment on plans to collaborate on insurance products with Banque Bruxelles
Lambert (BBL), the Belgian bank in which it owns a stake.
The company, 47 per cent of which is controlled by Union des Assurances de
Paris, reported a profit of BFr4.2bn (Dollars 123m), against BFr3.8bn in
1990, despite a BFr3.1bn drop in surpluses for the year.
The company said personal insurance business had improved in all sectors
after a poor 1990. The directors will propose an increase in the net
dividend to BFr140 from BFr130 per share.
Royale Belge and Winterthur of Switzerland - both BBL insurer-shareholders -
have been courting the bank about a joint deal in the field of
bancassurance, or selling insurance through banks.
BBL announced last month that it was open to collaboration with any of its
shareholders, thus dampening speculation that it was about to select a
partner.
Mr Jean-Pierre Gerard, Royale Belge's managing director, pointed out
yesterday that Royale Belge did most of its bancassurance business with
BBL's competitor, Generale de Banque.
Electrabel, the gas and electricity generator and distributor which is
Belgium's largest utility company, reported a BFr22.28bn profit for the
year, compared with BFr22.16bn in 1990.
The company is proposing to increase the net dividend to BFr290 per share
from BFr279 last time.

Sparbanken

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SWEDISH government announced a new SKr7.3bn (Dollars 1.2bn) rescue
package for Forsta Sparbanken, the troubled savings bank which was hit by
heavy credit losses in the property and construction sectors last year.
Bankers and Finance Ministry officials have spent the past week in meetings
in order to work out a way of saving Forsta after the bank announced its
credit losses for 1991 were even bigger than originally projected.
Credit losses reached SKr5.7bn instead of the SKr4.5bn which the bank had
forecast in October, and Forsta reported a SKr5.49bn operating loss for the
year.
Its troubles have been complicated by the fact that it is one of the 11
regional savings banks which planned to form a single large savings bank
group this year with the aim of seeking a stock market listing in 1993.
Complications arose because Forsta received an emergency SKr3.8bn loan from
Sparbanksgruppen, the savings bank group which will help form the new
banking group. The loan was guaranteed by government.
According to banking regulations, Forsta could not join the new savings bank
group while still keeping the loan from another part of the new group.
However, yesterday's package resolved Forsta's problems by proposing:
The parts of Forsta's loan portfolio expected to cause major losses will be
put into a separate subsidiary of Forsta and Sparbanken Sverige The
subsidiary will try to dispose of the loan portfolio.
The government has agreed to lend SKr3.8bn to Forsta's owner, a foundation,
which will transfer the loan to Forsta. The funds can later be used to pay
back Sparbanksgruppen's original SKr3.8bn loan. The government loan is
interest-free until the end of 1995, and thereafter carries an interest rate
of 4 per cent.
The 11 savings banks foundations which own Sparbanksgruppen will raise up to
SKr3.5bn in the market. The borrowing will be guaranteed by the government
and can take the form of a bond or loan. Forsta will receive this as an
injection of shareholders' capital.

<TEXT>
LA CINQ, the troubled television station, will today discover whether it is
to become the first national French TV channel to go off the air.
Mr Michel Rouger, president of the commercial court in Paris, has spent the
past two months analysing the financial situation at La Cinq, which filed
for bankruptcy at the beginning of this year.
He is expected today to deliver his judgment on whether it can continue
broadcasting or should close.
Until last week it looked as though Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the controversial
Italian businessman,might have rescued La Cinq. Fininvest, one of the
Berlusconi companies, had tabled a FFr1.5bn restructuring package intended
to keep the channel afloat.
Mr Berlusconi, a founding investor in La Cinq and still one of the largest
shareholders, alongside Hachette, the French media group, with a 25 per cent
stake, had hoped to persuade other investors to participate in the scheme.
However, he failed to attract enough support for his proposals and announced
his withdrawal on Tuesday last week.
Fininvest has since held further talks with other interested parties,
including the Union des Annonceurs, the body that represents France's
advertisers, in the hope of putting together a last-minute package. Last
night, they appeared to have come to nothing.
In the meantime, other companies have been putting together plans for
stations to broadcast on La Cinq's frequency. TF1, M6 and Canal Plus, three
other French TV stations, have been working on a project for a French
language version of CNN, the news channel.
There have also been reports that the French government favours relaying
Arte, a cultural channel, in La Cinq's place.
As La Cinq's 600 staff wait to hear their fate, the company's shareholders
are counting the cost of its problems.
Earlier this week, Hachette disclosed that it envisaged making a provision
of FFr1.8bn for its losses on La Cinq, which will take such a toll on its
balance sheet that it has been forced to ask its banks for an injection of
capital in a formal financial restructuring.

plan is to introduce strict rules designed to prevent the misuse of
sensitive financial information.
Speaking yesterday as the bank reported a 16.5 per cent increase in
operating profits to DM5.97bn (Dollars 3.61bn) last year, Mr Hilmar Kopper,
chief executive, exhorted rival German banks to follow suit. He said this
would help strengthen Frankfurt as a financial centre.
The new regime will introduce formal Chinese walls between bank departments
and will introduce a 'restricted list' of shares, designed 'to impose
rigorous limitations on own-account trading', both for the bank acting on
its own account and for employees' personal deals.
There will also be a 'watch list' for situations when the bank has access to
market-sensitive information not available to the public.
It will be modelled on best practice at Anglo-American securities houses, in
particular on Morgan Grenfell, Deutsche's UK merchant banking subsidiary,
and is to be policed by a new 55-strong compliance department headed by a
senior bank executive.
The move comes nearly three months after the Bonn government announced plans
to set-up a central regulatory body for the German securities industry and
to introduce tough penalties against insider dealing, which is still not
illegal in Germany.
Last year, Frankfurt was plagued with a succession of scandals which,
bankers fear, has made international investors wary of dealing via German
securities firms.
Buoyed by strong demand for credit in both the east and west of Germany,
interest income roes 17 per cent to DM10.62bn last year.
As previously announced, the bank is planning to raise its 1991 dividend, by
DM1 to DM15 per share, although Mr Kopper said this was no reason for the
bank to yield to bank unions' demands for a pay award of 10.5 per cent and
shorter working hours.
Mr Kopper said the group's balance sheet was so healthy - following growth
of DM49bn to DM449bn this year - that there would be no need to raise equity
capital this year, although the bank may take the opportunity to raise
secondary capital via an issue of profit-participating certificates.
Mr Kopper said the bank's uninsured exposure to the former Soviet Union
stood at under DM1bn, while the amount not covered by provisions was less
than DM100m.
The cover ratio for the group's problem loans to 60 countries stands at 84
per cent. Group commission income last year rose by 5.4 per cent to
DM3.77bn. The strongest contribution to profits on own-account trading came
from fixed income business.

FT  03 APR 92 / International Company News: Skis Rossignol in FFr35m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
SKIS ROSSIGNOL, the leading French producer of skis, tennis and golf
equipment, estimated yesterday it suffered a FFr35m (Dollars 6m) to FFr40m
loss in the year to the end of March, but predicted better times ahead.
This is a disappointment after last September's announcement by Mr Laurent
Boix-Vives, the chairman, that Rossignol would return to profit in
1991-1992.
However, it marks a partial recovery from last year's record FFr140.8m loss,
the effect of several years of poor snow and the recession in winter sports
generally.
This is the latest evidence of the start of a recovery for the ski industry,
following optimistic forecasts from Salomon, the world's leading maker of
bindings and number two in ski-boots.
Mr Boix-Vives, speaking at a conference in Austria, forecast that Rossignol
would make a FFr50m profit in the current year to March 1993, helped by the
success of its equipment in the winter Olympics, when 18 medal winners used
Rossignol skis.
Sales rose by an estimated 10 per cent to FFr1.5bn last year and should
reach FFr1.7bn in the current 12 months, he said.
The group managed to sell 1.5m pairs of skis last year, up from 1.45m in the
previous 12 months, in a stagnant market.

FT  03 APR 92 / International Company News: Penser seeks redress on Nobel
shareholding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ERIK PENSER, the Swedish financier and former majority shareholder in
Nobel Industries, will formally approach Sweden's centre-right government in
an effort to win back his stake in the chemicals group.
Mr Penser was forced to hand over his 70 per cent shareholding in Nobel, a
company which he had built up over many years, to state-controlled
Nordbanken late last year after the collapse of Gamlestaden, a finance
company controlled by Nobel.
His decision follows a recent independent report on the conduct of Swedish
banks towards Nobel and Gamlestaden. The report, by Mr Jan Ramberg, a
professor of law at Stockholm University, criticised Nordbanken for its
conduct in the affair.
In view of the report, Mr Penser said he wanted the government to show some
responsibility as a key shareholder in Nordbanken - and indirectly in Nobel
Industries - by helping to resolve the matter.
Mr Penser said he would settle his personal debts to the banks - just over
SKr3bn (Dollars 501.9m) - in exchange for his 70 per cent shareholding in
Nobel.
Although Mr Penser did not have the funds at his disposal, he said several
leading international banks had indicated they would lend him the necessary
money, providing he had the Nobel shares as collateral.
If Mr Penser does regain control of Nobel, it seems likely he would try to
buy the outstanding shares and take the company into private ownership.
He has already started legal proceedings against Nordbanken.

Pounds 4.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TELEMETRIX, the electronics and information systems group, reported a 21 per
cent boost in profits for 1991 and announced that it was looking for further
growth through acquisitions.
The pre-tax figure jumped from Pounds 3.69m to Pounds 4.48m on turnover
ahead at Pounds 83.7m (Pounds 72.5m). Earnings per share worked through at
2.1p (2p).
The annual dividend is held at 0.6p.
The company said it had managed to buck the recessionary trend in Europe,
Japan and the US - from where it generated more than half its turnover last
year - through Pounds 1.2m of cost cutting, debt reduction and the improved
performance of GTI, its US subsidiary.
Mr Tim Curtis, the new chief executive, said that the company was
considering potential additions in the Pounds 5m to Pounds 20m range but had
'nothing on the stocks at the moment'.
Having cut net debt from Pounds 7.6m to Pounds 4.8m it is expected to set
its sights on targets within its 'core business area', particularly those
involved in Local Area Networks, the linking of personal computers within
organisations as opposed to via a national database.

FT  03 APR 92 / UK Company News: Resilient Spirax-Sarco ahead 2%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPIRAX-SARCO Engineering, the international steam engineering company,
yesterday demonstrated the resilience of its international spread of markets
by reporting profits up 2 per cent last year.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 22m to Pounds 22.5m on sales up 6.8 per
cent at Pounds 158.3m (Pounds 148.2m). The 1990 figures have been restated
to take into account the re-emergence of hyper-inflation in South America.
Earnings per share rose 0.2p to 18p and the company surprised the market by
increasing the final dividend to 6.3p (6p) to give a total for the year of
9p, up 3 per cent.
Mr Chris Tappin, chairman, said the results were good in a demanding year
when the group lived up to its reputation for consistent performance.
Spirax had a particularly strong second half, partly due to the inclusion of
Watson-Marlow, the peristaltic pump maker, which it acquired in 1990, and
partly through cost savings.
Sales in the steam speciality business, which accounts for 85 per cent of
sales, were stable at last year's levels but the group increased margins.
The South American businesses improved, with Argentina contributing a
significantly increased profit.
Interest charges doubled to Pounds 2.2m, following the Watson-Marlow
acquisition. But debt was only marginally higher at the year-end at Pounds
17.4m after strong second-half cash flow and a lower dollar rate. Gearing
fell from 28 to 25 per cent.
COMMENT
In an uncertain world there is something reassuringly predictable, like
mother's cooking, about Spirax's performance. Behind this British
engineering company is a stranglehold on a world market and a conservative
approach that might have something to do with the Cheltenham air where the
company is based. Thus, it has chosen to recognise higher sales and lower
profits for its South American businesses because of a resurgence of
hyper-inflation and it is playing down the significance of surprisingly
strong recovery in the second half of last year. Like Weir Group, Spirax is
also blessed with a highly visible profits stream, more than half of
turnover coming from replacement sales for equipment already installed. The
corollary is that once recovery sets in, Spirax may appear relatively
unexciting. It remains, therefore, a stock for those cautious about the UK
market and economic recovery and those uncertain that now is the time to be
buying the cyclical recovery stocks. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 24m this
year, giving earnings per share of 20p, give an undemanding prospective
multiple of about 13.

Pre-tax profits at Home Counties Newspapers Holdings declined sharply, from
Pounds 2.89m to Pounds 1.06m, in the year to December 31, though turnover
expanded by Pounds 1m to Pounds 21.5m.
Following a proposed final dividend of 5.5p, the unchanged 8.25p total is
uncovered by earnings of 7.15p per share. Earnings in 1990 came to 18.5p.
Profits of this printer and publisher, already halved at the operating level
to Pounds 735,000 (Pounds 1.4m), were further affected by a fall in
investment income to Pounds 778,000 (Pounds 1.49m) and by exceptional
charges, mostly relating to redundancy costs, of Pounds 458,000.

Gowrings, which runs motor dealerships, park homes and restaurants, finished
1991 with a pre-tax loss of Pounds 953,000, including exceptional charges of
Pounds 342,000.
That compared with a deficit of Pounds 432,000 in 1990, which took in
exceptional credits of Pounds 80,000.
Mr John Fowles, chairman, said the second half trading loss fell to Pounds
230,000, against Pounds 381,000 in the opening period.
The final dividend is held at 1p, although that still leaves a cut in the
year's total, from 3.25p to 2p. Losses per share were 10.6p (4.5p).
Benefiting from reorganisation, the motor side made a trading profit of
Pounds 314,000, against a loss of Pounds 191,000 which included Pounds
156,000 attributable to the sold Fleetlease.
The leisure division incurred a trading loss of Pounds 236,000, compared
with a profit of Pounds 160,000.

William Sinclair, the garden products manufacturer, has acquired Secto for
an initial Pounds 5m and a contingent deferred consideration of Pounds 1.6m.
Approximately 70 per cent of Secto's business is in the pet care and
gardening markets with 30 per cent in household products.
The initial sum will be satisfied as to Pounds 4.25m by the issue of 1.63m
new shares to the vendors, which have been placed with institutional clients
of Hoare Govett. The balance will be satisfied by the issue of 273,523 new
Sinclair shares at 274.2p apiece.
In the year to September 30 pre-tax profits of Secto amounted to Pounds
169,000 on turnover of Pounds 2.83m, or Pounds 699,000 after taking account
of non-recurring directors emoluments and exceptional expenditure.

Holders of the 4.5 per cent convertible bond issued in 1987 by Storehouse,

Storehouse had bought in Pounds 41m of the Pounds 69m issue, and holders of
Pounds 27.8m nominal of the bonds have exercised their puts. A few of the
bonds are still outstanding.
The cost of redeeming these bonds is just under Pounds 36m, which the group

ungeared and analysts expect the balance sheet for the year just ended will

<TEXT>
SPENDING ON two players reduced pre-tax profit at Manchester United by 19
per cent, from Pounds 3.92m to Pounds 3.17m, in the six months to January 31
1992.
Before the Pounds 2.23m net outlay on Paul Parker (defender) and Peter
Schmeichel (goalkeeper), the football club - which floated last May -
increased profit by 39 per cent to Pounds 5.41m. Transfer spending in the
first half of last year was negligible.
The club, which heads the first division, had Pounds 12.8m cash in hand on
January 31. Only half of this was raised via last May's flotation.
Turnover increased to Pounds 12.4m (Pounds 10.4m) as prices were raised and
the average attendance at each league match moved up to 44,840 (43,242).
Gate receipts accounted for 53 per cent of sales. Next most important were
Pounds 1.76m of television fees and Pounds 1.64m in sponsorship and
royalties.
Mr Robin Launders, finance director, said that Pounds 522,000 was taken on
average at each home game, compared with Pounds 382,000 last season.
The estimated cost of building a new stand at the Old Trafford ground had
been cut from Pounds 12m to Pounds 10.5m through reducing the executive and
VIP accommodation. It is due to open next June.
Mr Launders said that although capacity would fall to 34,000 at the start of
next season, price rises of about 30 per cent would more than compensate for
the loss of volume.
Mr Martin Edwards, chief executive, said that most of the games and
television appearances had fallen in the first half of the year. The club
had no immediate plans to buy players.
To smooth out the impact of transfers on earnings, the club has set up a
reserve fund. After taking Pounds 750,000 from this, earnings per share fell
to 24p (28.6p). Before this movement, earnings were 17.9p.
The interim dividend is 6p and the board intends to pay a total of at least
17.4p.

black
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DAWSONGROUP, the com-mercial vehicle sales and hire and fleet truck rentals
concern, staged a recovery in the 12 months to December 31 with pre-tax
profits of Pounds 1.13m replacing a loss of Pounds 392,000.
Turnover was down from Pounds 48.3m to Pounds 43.7m, reflecting the closure
of Dawsoncar during the first half of 1991; turnover on continuing
activities was virtually unchanged.
Mr Peter Dawson, chairman, said the trading result represented a respectable
achievement in demanding circumstances. Businesses had been loath to invest
or enter into long-term commitments and that had resulted in a fall of 23
per cent in new commercial vehicle sales and in poor demand for contract
hire.
However, the rentals division virtually reversed its 1990 loss of Pounds
993,000 with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 982,000.
A 24 per cent cut in net interest costs from Pounds 6.72m to Pounds 5.13m
and increased rental margins had been factors in the performance.
Mr Dawson said that there were some signs that the short term hire fleet
utilisation was continuing to improve.
Earnings per share were 2.7p (losses of 1.1p. The dividend is unchanged at
1.5p.

HUNTER SAPHIR, the fresh produce and herbs and spices group, is selling
Matthew Walker, its Christmas pudding subsidiary, to Northern Foods, the
dairy, convenience foods, meat and grocery group, for Pounds 7.7m. The sale
is conditional on shareholders' approval and clearance by the competition
authorities.
Hunter said the disposal was part of its strategy of concentrating on its
core businesses. The cash raised will be used to reduce debt. Walker had
been bought in January 1987, and was in Hunter's February 1991 balance sheet
at Pounds 3.7m.
Northern, which makes own-label Christmas puddings at its Gunstones factory
in Sheffield, said that Walker would strengthen its market position.
In the 1990-91 year Walker made an operating profit of Pounds 918,000 on
sales of Pounds 9.3m.
Hunter's shares were unchanged at 48p; Northern's fell 3p to 527p.

<TEXT>
TRANS WORLD Communic-ations, the commercial radio group which used to own
Miss World, cut pre-tax losses to Pounds 1.15m last year compared with
Pounds 1.84m in 1990.
The group, which runs stations such as Piccadilly Radio in Manchester and
Red Rose in Preston, hopes to return to profit this year and begin paying
dividends again in 1993.
Mr John Whitney, recently appointed chairman of Trans World, said yesterday
that as a result of a successful Pounds 12m rights issue and a new
management structure he was confident 'the group is now on a firm base from
which steady progress will be made.'
Mr Whitney, a former director general of the Independent Broadcasting
Authority, believes that the creation of a Radio Advertising Bureau and the
arrival of new national commercial stations will raise radio's profile and
increase its share of national advertising.
Turnover fell by 12 per cent to Pounds 11.38m although the fall was only 8
per cent when the disposal of Miss World in December 1990 is taken into
account.
Market share for the company's four stations, broadcasting 8 services,
increased in the final quarter of 1991 by nearly 4 per cent to 25.9 per
cent.
Trans World also said that the first quarter this year showed an upward
trend in revenue with January and February sales up 46 per cent on the same
period in 1991.

FT  03 APR 92 / UK Company News: Great Southern up 45% despite static death
rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREAT SOUTHERN Group, the USM-quoted funeral director, achieved record
results in 1991 despite static mortality rates in the UK.
The 45 per cent rise in pre-tax profits - from Pounds 3.22m to Pounds 4.68m
 -exceeded analysts' estimates.
Mr James Smillie, chairman, said the outcome reflected tight control of
overheads and debtors, which in turn led to improved margins and cash flow.
Gearing was reduced from 123 per cent to 96 per cent.
The core funeral services side contributed operating profits of Pounds 4.34m
(Pounds 3.8m) on turnover ahead from Pounds 18.9m to Pounds 20.3m.
Higher overall volumes were behind a rise to Pounds 1.39m (Pounds 1.1m) in
crematoria and cemeteries operating profits. Turnover rose to Pounds 4.82m
(Pounds 4.23m).
Ancillary services put in operating profits of Pounds 575,000 (Pounds
288,000) on turnover of Pounds 2.59m (Pounds 2.03m), attributable mainly to
the continued growth of Chosen Heritage, the group's pre-paid funeral
scheme.
Fully diluted earnings per share jumped 47 per cent to 21.6p (14.7p). A
proposed final dividend of 6.7p lifts the total for the year to 10p (8.5p).

FT  03 APR 92 / UK Company News: Interest cut helps Scholl rise 13%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCHOLL, the supplier of foot and personal healthcare products, climbed 13
per cent to Pounds 16.1m at the pre-tax level last year on the back of
sharply lower interest rates.
The fall in interest charges, from Pounds 4m to Pounds 2.1m, had offset the
4 per cent decline in operating profits to Pounds 15.7m.
Mr Neil Franchino, chief executive, said interest charges had benefited from
the Pounds 24.5m rights issue in May. Excluding the rights, the company had
moved from debt of Pounds 12m at the end of 1990 to net cash of Pounds 2m.
With the proceeds, Scholl - formerly European Home Products - had net cash
of Pounds 26m, he said.
This had been achieved by cost-cutting, including the reduction of the
workforce by 4 per cent to 1,700. Stock levels had also been decreased by 18
per cent to Pounds 21.3m.
Turnover suffered from similar stock-cutting exercises by retailers in
northern Europe and adverse exchange rates. Sales fell by Pounds 1.4m to
Pounds 144.4m.
Margins were slightly higher during the year, said Mr Franchino, although
this was the result of depressed sales of Scholl footwear. Bad weather
between March and May had resulted in a 3.5 per cent decline in shoe sales
to Pounds 49.4m.
The higher margin corn and bunion plaster business had boosted sales by 5
per cent to Pounds 68m, while personal and healthcare sales fell from Pounds
30m to Pounds 27.3m.
Mr Franchino said the group aimed to expand in the therapeutic healthcare
sector, with products such as herbal remedies and over the counter pharmacy
products.
Spending on research and development would continue to rise, he said. New
products introduced last year, such as the insole deodorant, Odour Attacker,
had proved particularly successful in the UK and Italian markets.
Mr Gordon Stevens, chairman, warned that 1992 would continue to be
difficult, but said he expected further benefits from cost-cutting.
Earnings per share rose from 10.5p to 13.1p, amply covering the maintained
final dividend of 3.5p, which makes an unchanged total of 6p.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Walter Alexander, the Falkirk-based company which is Britain's biggest bus
body manufacturer, has been bought out by its management for Pounds 7.4m.
It was sold by Spotlaunch, a company formed by the finance house Granville
in 1990 to buy Walter Alexander, which was then quoted on the Stock
Exchange.
Spotlaunch took the group private in a Pounds 42m deal and its peripheral
activities were sold off, leaving only the bus manufacturer and Dominick
Hunter, a filtration business.
The buy-out was led by Mr Ian Galloway, chief executive, and is backed by
institutional investors including Standard Life, Dunedin Ventures,
Clydesdale Bank.

FT  03 APR 92 / UK Company News: Hewden Stuart's Pounds 15m beats City
forecasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEWDEN STUART, Britain's second largest independent plant hire company,
easily beat analysts' expectations with pre-tax profits of Pounds 15m for
the year to January 31.
The results, struck on turnover 16 per cent lower at Pounds 170.9m, showed a
40 per cent drop on the previous year's Pounds 25.2m compared to some
expectations of up to 50 per cent. Sir Matthew Goodwin, chairman, said the
achievement had been 'tremendous. We are very, very satisfied.'
He was optimistic that the group was facing the end of a recession which has
savaged the plant hire sector.
The first signs of recovery were being reported in the south of England, he
said. 'It's not enough to write home about, but there's a little
improvement.' There had been no upturn in the north and Scotland, however.
He was less than optimistic about the effects of a possible Labour
government after the election. 'It would set the whole thing extremely
back,' he said.
During 1991, conditions had been difficult and became even more competitive
as the year progressed. 'Prices are still abysmal,' he said.
Nevertheless, tight control of capital expenditure and costs, and
concentration on cash flow had helped the group to wipe out debt of Pounds
8m and end the year with Pounds 7m cash.
Thus, it could propose a token increase in the final dividend to 2.285p
(2.175p) for a total of 3.15p (3p). Earnings per share fell from 9.14p to
5.35p.
'We are sitting on a pile of assets and have no form of commitments,' Sir
Matthew said. This would allow the company to acquire new plant when the
upturn eventually arrived.
The biggest damper on profits was the decline in sales at the tower crane
hire division, from Pounds 12.7m to Pounds 6.5m. This was partly the result
of completing phase one at Canary Wharf, in London's Docklands.
Sir Matthew said Hewden had received all payments from Olympia &amp; York, the
heavily-indebted property group which owns the development.
The sale of new construction equipment also suffered a sharp decline,
profits falling from Pounds 1.9m to Pounds 660,000. Sales of second hand
plant contributed Pounds 3.5m, compared with Pounds 4.5m last time.
Bad debts totalled Pounds 1.7m (Pounds 2m). This was the result of a string
of small companies failing 'day after day', Sir Matthew said.
COMMENT
Yet again the worthy Hewden Stuart shines out in a ravaged sector. To report
profits at all would be considered by many to be good work; but to do so
after a Pounds 25m depreciation charge and a Pounds 500,000 writedown on an
investment at the same time as eliminating debt and building Pounds 7m cash
is commendable. Then look at the relatively modern fleet, allowing lower
repair and maintenance charges than competitors, and Hewden looks set to
clean up in an economic recovery . . . as long as one is within sight. The
only sting in the tail could be another drop in the construction sector.
Forecasts were revised upwards from Pounds 11m to about Pounds 15m for the
year, putting the shares on a multiple of about 17. Although this looks
high, considering the good cash management and future prospects it is still
good value for the medium to long-termers.

FT  03 APR 92 / UK Company News: Tilbury Douglas falls 25% but current year
starts well
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TILBURY DOUGLAS, the construction and property company formed last October
with the acquisition by Tilbury Group of Robert M Douglas Holdings,
yesterday announced a fall in profits, but said it started 1992 with work in
hand 12 per cent higher than a year ago.
Pre-tax profits fell 25 per cent to Pounds 15m (Pounds 20m) in the year to
December 31, helped by a two-month contribution, worth Pounds 2.4m, from
Douglas. The fall was due to weaker margins in construction and continuing
recession in housebuilding.
Mr Michael Bottjer, group managing director, said Tilbury Douglas' range of
businesses insulated it from some of the downturn. Scottish housebuilding,
which has been more resilient than in England, had another 'excellent year'.
Turnover increased 22 per cent to Pounds 239.6m, due to a sharp increase in
construction-related sales, which rose 26 per cent to Pounds 191.6m.
Construction business for the privatised water and electricity industries
remained buoyant, but pre-tax profits for the construction side fell
slightly to Pounds 11.1m (Pounds 11.4m).
Pre-tax property profits were cut in half to Pounds 3.05m (Pounds 8.6m).
House sales in Scotland increased to 446 (415) and prices were maintained at
Pounds 58,000. But Mr Bottjer said there were still no signs of any upturn
in the English housing market, where sales declined to 52 (85) and average
prices fell to Pounds 70,000 (Pounds 74,000). The company expects to
increase sales in Scotland and England to 740 units this year, predicting a
slight improvement in England towards the end of the year.
Interest earnings increased to Pounds 3.5m (Pounds 2.6m) and the company
held net cash of Pounds 13.7m at year end.
Earnings fell to 46.9p (70p). The directors recommend maintaining a 22.5p
final dividend, to make an unchanged total of 33p. Dividend cover fell
sharply to 1.1 times, reflecting the increased number of shares in issue
following the Douglas acquisition.
The maintained dividend and an upbeat presentation lifted the shares 3p to
538p.
COMMENT
Tilbury Douglas is an under-researched company, but City houses may now be
tempted to put the shares on their watch list. Despite difficult trading
conditions, margins in the construction division were held close to a
healthy 6 per cent and the slump in property profits is presumably
relatively easy to reverse once the English market improves. Investors have
the added attractions of the company's property developments, with the
Spanish industrial development due for completion this year, and the first
sizeable sales from the Phoenix development in Glasgow due next year.
Forecast 1992 profits of between Pounds 25m and Pounds 27m put the shares on
less than 10 times with a dividend yield of 7.9. The only problem for
enthusiasts is getting hold of the shares, which are very closely held by
German interests and UK institutions.

FT  03 APR 92 / UK Company News: Sharp recovery at Xtra-vision
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Xtra-vision, the Dublin-based video rental chain, made a strong return to
profitability in the year to January 31.
With all divisions now trading profitability, the company made a pre-tax
profit of IPounds 1.68m (Pounds 1.57m), against a IPounds 2.25m loss
previously.
Performance in the first two months of the current year had been in line
with budget.
Turnover was lower at IPounds 22.9m, against IPounds 26.4m, reflecting the
disposal of loss making subsidiaries. Extraordinary charges took IPounds
530,000 (IPounds 16.9m) and earnings per share were 1.13p (2.77p losses).

FT  03 APR 92 / UK Company News: London &amp; Manchester declines
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON AND Manchester Group, the life assurer, yesterday reported a decline
in pre-tax profits from Pounds 22.1m to Pounds 21.2m for 1991, after a
Pounds 1.3m exceptional charge against losses on commercial property.
The company also recorded a Pounds 15.9m extraordinary loss on commercial
mortgages and property development loans - businesses which it has already
withdrawn from. After tax relief Pounds 11.4m was provided in the accounts.
Earnings per share were 12.87p (13.95p). As expected, the final dividend is
unchanged at 9.144p for a total of 13.572p (13.32p).
The percentage of the life fund allocated from policyholders to shareholders
has been raised to 17.84 per cent.,
Mr Tom Pyne, group chief executive, said the results reflected a 15 per cent
rise in net insurance earnings, the company's core business, offset by
losses in commercial lending and other non-life businesses. Net new premiums
rose 11 per cent, with most growth occurring from the sale of single-premium
products, in line with the industry trend. However, annual premium business
also recorded a modest rise.
Reversionary and terminal bonuses have been cut by 3 percent on 10-year life
products and by 7.5 per cent on 25-year products. The value of the life
funds of London and Manchester Assurance Company, after paying bonuses to
with-profits policyholders, was some Pounds 100m pre-tax in 1990 - that had
grown by about 10 per cent this year.
In mortgage lending, loan loss provisions for 1991 totalled Pounds 5.7m, up
from Pounds 1.1m, and the operation incurred a small trading loss.

<TEXT>
OLIVER GROUP, the shoe retailer which tried unsuccessfully to diversify just
ahead of the recession, yesterday announced pre-tax losses sharply increased
from Pounds 2.68m to Pounds 10.7m due to weakening sales, losses on
disposals and re-organisation costs.
The results were expected and followed a profits warning in January. The
shares fell a further 4p to 55p, compared to last year's high of 126 1/2 p.
Turnover fell to Pounds 84.9m (Pounds 98m) in the year to December 31 as
consumer spending dried up.
There was an trading loss of Pounds 2.95m (profit Pounds 3.48m) as costs
continued to rise, mainly reflecting higher rent reviews.
Mr Ian Oliver, chairman, said that last year was the most difficult in
memory. He announced exceptional losses of Pounds 5.29m to cover falls in
the value of some short-lease shops, losses on property sales and
re-organisation costs.
Losses per share emerged at 39.43p (earnings 9.54p). The company is not
paying a final dividend, although the interim dividend was maintained at
1.07p. Last year's total was 5.82p.
The picture framing division, acquired in 1989, continued to lose money and
was sold last month. This incurred an extraordinary loss of Pounds 768,000
and took total losses for the year to Pounds 10.7m.
The company defended its reserves by revaluing freehold and long leasehold
properties, last valued in 1986. This led to a re-valuation surplus of
Pounds 11.6m, which lifted shareholders' funds slightly to Pounds 42.3m
(Pounds 41.7m).
Oliver also announced that it had bought 21 units from the receiver of
Tandem shoes. All these shops are forecast to trade profitably this year,
the company said.

FT  03 APR 92 / UK Company News: Wm Baird suffers setback to Pounds 25m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DEEPENING recession in clothing and engineering left William Baird's
pre-tax profits 25.7 per cent lower for the year to end-December at Pounds
25.1m.
The closure of several businesses, largely in the Darchem engineering
operation, were reflected in extraordinary charges of Pounds 3.89m (Pounds
428,000). 'We have no plans to announce further closures,' said Mr Donald
Parr, chairman, yesterday.
Earnings per share emerged sharply lower at 16.5p (24.1p). The dividend is
maintained at 8.9p with an unchanged final of 5.35p. This is the first time
dividend cover has been less than twice since the recession of 1981.
Current trading remained difficult. 'There is no evidence of any real
recovery in the UK,' said Mr Parr. 'The group is not anticipating an early
end to the recession.'
The proceeds from last year's Pounds 39m rights issue have not yet been
spent on the promised acquisitions and gearing fell 26.2 per cent to 3 per
cent.
Overall group turnover rose from Pounds 519.6m to Pounds 532.8m, but this
masked a sharp fall in sales by Darchem. Orders dried up especially in the
automotive and building services sectors. Turnover fell to Pounds 113.1m
(Pounds 120.2m) and operating profits were reduced to Pounds 7.9m (Pounds
12.8m).
Textiles held up relatively well, helped partly by a growing share of Marks
and Spencer's sales. The company cut costs by sourcing a greater proportion
of its garments outside the UK. Turnover rose to Pounds 419.8m (Pounds
399.4m), although operating profits slipped to Pounds 23.2m (Pounds 27.1m).
Clothing margins were additionally hit by the company having to absorb a
proportion of the increase in VAT imposed in the 1991 budget.
Within branded products, Dannimac rainwear increased both turnover and
profits because of 'a better balance between capacity and demand' and a move
towards higher unit prices.
COMMENT
Baird's businesses in textiles and engineering went into recession together
and late. They will be among the last to recover too because clothing and
insulation are downstream operations in their respective sectors. But while
business is bad, finances are good. The company could eliminate borrowings
entirely this year as cash flows into the business. Last year's harsh cost
cutting should be replaced this year by a judicious acquisition or two -
good timing from the point of view of the business cycle. Profits are set to
recover modestly to about Pounds 31m, putting the shares on a prospective
p/e of 11.5, about 10 per cent less than the market. Baird is being
cushioned from the worst of the recession by being one of Marks and
Spencer's favoured suppliers. But it remains the textile sector's biggest
play on a UK recovery and the shares are therefore good value only in the
long term.

FT  03 APR 92 / UK Company News: Exceptional forces DC Gardner to Pounds
3.8m loss
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DC GARDNER Group, the management consultancy and business services company,
incurred a loss of Pounds 3.76m, including an exceptional Pounds 3.34m, for
1991.
The previous year saw a profit of Pounds 2.11m.
However, ACT Chart, the accountancy training division, was sold at the end
of December for Pounds 7m, including related debt, and this, together with
Pounds 4.1m net from the July rights issue, cut group borrowings to Pounds
3.8m (Pounds 12.6m) by the year-end. This gave gearing of 40 per cent.
The restructuring helped continuing activities to show a turnround from a
loss before tax and exceptional items of Pounds 211,000 in the first half to
profits of Pounds 547,000 in the second six months.
Total turnover was Pounds 27.1m (Pounds 23.7m) with Pounds 9.04m
attributable to discontinued activities.
The company has insufficient distributable reserves to pay a dividend
(3.89p).
In order to facilitate the resumption of dividend payments in 1992, the
board is to apply to the court for approval of a reduction in the share
premium account.
Losses per share amounted to 18.3p (earnings of 8p).
The group has made a good start to the current year with Coutts, the
outplacement and career management subsidiary, achieving record results in
the first quarter.
Also the recent award of important new contracts are providing a stream of
profitable new business through the rest of 1992.

FT  03 APR 92 / UK Company News: Underwriting undermines Sun Alliance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AFTER POSTING its worst-ever pre-tax losses
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pounds 466.2m for 1991 compared with 1990's Pounds 180.9m - Sun Alliance is
shrinking parts of its business and cutting jobs in a bid to restore
profitability.
General insurance premium income rose to Pounds 2.68bn (Pounds 2.51bn) -
largely as a result of rate rises - and life insurance income to Pounds
1.1bn (Pounds 861.2m) in 1991.
But underwriting losses climbed to Pounds 833.5m (Pounds 550.8m), mainly
because of a sharp rise in insurance losses in the UK to Pounds 713m (Pounds
461.3m), where the bulk of recession-, weather- and crime-related losses
have been concentrated.
Life insurance profits rose to Pounds 54.3m (Pounds 47.7m) and investment
income was marginally down at Pounds 313m (Pounds 322.2m), largely as a
result of negative cash flow in the UK.
Losses per share were 59.2p (13.4p) and the total dividend is lifted to
14.25p (14p) with a proposed unchanged final of 9p.
In the UK the company has been more selective about the business it
underwrites, reducing its motor exposures from 1.8m at the end of 1990 to
about 1.5m at the end of last year. Another 100,000 policyholders could
leave the books over the next 12 months.
In the UK household sector, where Sun Alliance is market leader with a 25
per cent share, the company has introduced a system of differential rating,
whereby householders living in areas more prone to subsidence damage, such
as the south-east, will pay up to twice as much as those living in other
parts of the country.
Mr Scott Nelson, general manager, believes that relatively high levels of
subsidence loss will be a 'permanent feature of UK buildings insurance'.
Sun Alliance has also refused to accept commission terms offered to it for
block business by Abbey National on the grounds that these were
'unacceptable'.
On the jobs front, Sun Alliance announced the loss of 800 posts in January
and said that further cuts have been identified since then.

FT  03 APR 92 / UK Company News: Scottish Heritable makes sharp inroads into
losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH HERITABLE Trust, the mini-conglomerate, showed a substantial
recovery in 1991 cutting pre-tax losses from Pounds 15.9m to Pounds 792,000.
All but one division recorded sizeable improvements to produce an overall
trading profit of Pounds 6.59m, against a loss of Pounds 7m. This, however,
was swallowed up by interest charges, which fell from Pounds 8.48m to Pounds
6.79m.
Net borrowings were reduced by Pounds 25.4m to Pounds 41m. Gearing at the
end of 1991 was 270 per cent and Mr Stuart Macdonald, finance director, said
the aim was to cut it during 1992 to 100 per cent or below through the
current disposal programme.
A decline in oriental carpet sales and the disposal of Hearthstead Homes
(housebuilder), John Letters (golf club maker) and Nippasox (children's
clothing manufacturer) led to a drop in turnover to Pounds 95.5m (Pounds
116m).
Losses per share came to 1.5p (36.3p) before, and to 6.6p (59.7p) after
extraordinary charges of Pounds 1.85m (Pounds 8.4m). The charges covered
redundancy and closure overheads and the cost of the refinancing programme.
In the individual trading divisions the improvement was most significant in
property and investment, where there was a profit of Pounds 1.67m before
interest and tax, compared to a loss of Pounds 5.56m).
SHT's property division has a mixed portfolio of land around Britain and
owns tenement flats in the Glasgow area.

FT  03 APR 92 / Japanese companies face a legacy of the bull market: The
consequences of refinancing Dollars 160bn in warrant and convertible bonds
which mature within three years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE protracted weakness of the Tokyo stock market, highlighted by the plunge
of the Nikkei index below 18,300 yesterday, means that Japanese companies
will have to refinance vast sums of equity-linked debt raised in the late
1980s.
The scale of redemptions is immense: Dollars 36bn (Pounds 20bn) warrant and
convertible bonds issued by Japanese companies mature this year, Dollars
83.9bn in 1993 and Dollars 40.3bn in 1994.
The bonds were issued at the height of the bull market in Japanese equities.
Investors were prepared to accept very low interest payments because the
bonds were linked to rising share prices.
However, with the Nikkei index at around 18,000 almost all outstanding
warrant and convertible bonds are 'under water' - the exercise price is
above the current share price. Unless share prices stage a dramatic
recovery, few of the warrants to buy new shares will be exercised and few
convertible bonds will be converted into equity. Instead, the debt will have
to be repaid.
One option is for companies to issue equity-linked bonds, priced to reflect
lower share prices. International appetite for warrant or convertible bonds
is tied to the fortunes of the equity market, which shows no signs of
recovery. Without a sustained recovery in share prices, even matching the
Dollars 26bn equity-linked finance raised last year will be difficult.
Moreover, the Japanese authorities are backing moves designed to stimulate
the stock market which will block many companies from issuing new
convertible or warrant bonds. The Japan Securities Dealers Association
recently issued a guideline which prevents companies which pay out less than
30 per cent of profits in dividends from raising equity-linked finance. This
will force many Japanese companies either to raise dividends or forgo
equity-linked funding.
Where new warrant and convertible bond issues cannot be made, companies will
have to rely on straight debt, raised either from banks or the international
bond market.
The ability of Japanese banks to lend is also linked to the stock market:
falling share prices erode unrealised gains on banks' large securities
portfolios, which count as capital. As share prices fall, the capital
resources of banks deteriorates and their incremental capacity to lend is
reduced.
With the Nikkei index below 20,000, many Japanese banks are close to the 8
per cent capital-to-assets ratio demanded by the Basle Accord, which comes
into full effect next year.
The bond market may be a more reliable source of debt finance, although the
threat of a large number of new issues could depress bond prices in Japan
and internationally.
There are already signs of this. Mr Richard Grey, bond analyst at UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew in London, said: 'The decision to lift restrictions on
corporate bond issuance this week was a major factor behind the weakness of
the Japanese government bond market. Investors see the threat of a large
supply of corporate bonds.'
Against this background, bankers see the need for Japanese companies to tap
less obvious sources of capital, such as private placements of 'structured'
debt securities with institutional investors.
However, while corporate financiers see refinancing of equity-linked debt as
a potentially huge source of fee income, economists suggest some companies
may not need new finance.
Industrial companies such as TDK and Mitsubishi Corporation have said
maturing warrant and convertible bond issues will not be refinanced.
Redemption payments will be met from operating cash flow and sales of
financial assets.
Mr Peter Norton, head of research at Baring Securities in Tokyo, said
corporate liquidity in Japan remains abnormally high in spite of the
economic slow-down. 'Many of the factors which will depress reported profits
this year are non-cash charges such as depreciation and investment
revaluations,' he said.
In addition, many Japanese companies still have hoards of financial assets -
equities, bonds and money-market instruments - built up during the late
1980s.
Most of these assets are held in tokkin funds, trusts which allow Japanese
companies to account separately for investments and convert the capital gain
from rising share prices into a cash dividend. By the end of 1989, tokkin
funds held Y38,000bn (Pounds 163.8bn) assets, about 40 per cent in equities.
This figure has been eroded and now stands at around Y28,000bn. Assets have
been sold to raise cash for investment or to repay maturing debt. Further
liquidations are expected this year, including Y6,000bn of domestic
equities. Selling of equity investments by tokkin funds was a factor behind
the falling share prices in March. More selling could depress equity prices,
making it more difficult for companies without tokkin assets to raise
equity-linked finance and more difficult for Japanese banks to lend.
Moreover, as the Japanese economy moves into recession, corporate cash flow
will be squeezed. It also remains to be seen how many companies can afford
to liquidate financial assets - and crystallise paper losses - to repay
debt.
In addition, it is clear that the cost of capital for Japanese companies has
risen sharply. This could have negative implications for the stock market in
the longer term.
'The cost structure of business corporations will be fundamentally changed
by higher interest expenses,' said Mr Yuichi Kohashi, deputy general manager
of the investment advisory department at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo. 'If this
leads to a slower recovery in earnings, it will have a direct impact on the
level of the stock market.'

There is something unsettling about the Pounds 24m capital injection by WH
Smith into its Do It All joint venture with Boots. Technically the amount
represents the value of the preference dividend Smith would have owed Boots
had there been any profits from which to pay it. The restructuring simply
cancels that obligation and creates parity between the partners. Yet one
implication is Do It All is suffering in the battle with B&amp;Q and Texas.
Given the extent to which larger rivals are already competing on price, it
may have a tough time lasting the course of its ambitious three-year plan

Redland's successful Steetley bid looks shrewder by the day, yesterday's 17p
jump in the shares owing more to growing market appreciation of the bargain
price it paid than to largely anticipated 1991 results. Early indications
are that the forecast merger benefits should be comfortably achieved, and
that, thanks in part to the happy coincidence that Steetley's loss making
first quarter will not be consolidated, significant earnings enhancement is
possible. The combination of a generous 7 per cent yield and the overseas
earnings makes it an ideal political hedge in the sector, though whether
investors want to be there at all at the moment is another matter.

It was always likely that Fisons would choose an insider as its new chief
executive. Much less obvious was why elevating Mr Cedric Scroggs would
reassure investors that the group was on the mend, but in the event he has
made an encouraging start. There is no denying the fine growth of Fisons'
scientific instruments division under Mr Scroggs' leadership. Effecting a
shake-up of the pharmaceuticals division will be a far tougher challenge. It
is not just a question of his lack of experience in the technical world of
drug marketing. There is also the immediate issue of restoring Fisons'
reputation in the US.
Mr Scroggs acknowledges that Fisons made mistakes in its relations with the
Food and Drug Administration. The forthcoming FDA inspection of its Opticrom
plant is an early opportunity to show investors that such errors can be put
right. More generally, a strategy of focusing on defined areas such as
respiratory drugs suggests a new realism about Fisons' size in the
pharmaceuticals market. Other drugs will be developed by joint-marketing
deals, raising the hope that partners will improve the performance of the
division as a whole. It is too early to conclude that Fisons' management can
change its spots, but at least Mr Scroggs has declared his intent.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir John Quinton must think it unfair that Barclays' share price has been a
singular victim of current property and construction worries. His bank has
only 148 per cent of its equity tied up in lending to property and
construction companies. Lloyds quietly let slip in its annual report that
its exposure is even higher at 165 per cent.
Of the four top clearers, only National Westminster has lent less than its
total equity. Having taken fright after earlier excess in the 1970s, it
restrained itself to a mere 87 per cent. So, it only risks being almost
wiped out.
The banks would doubtless respond that the ratios overstate the danger. Much
of their property lending is perfectly sound and their BIS capital ratios
are strong. True, but they also have a large hidden exposure to property
through security on other lending. Nor do high real interest rates and
excess supply offer any grounds to expect an interruption to the 30 per cent
fall in commercial property prices since the peak in 1989. Having just about
sorted out developing country debts, the banks now face years of work on
property loans. Recovery hopes will be dented by further provisions while
interest margins will be squeezed by non-performing loans.
Barclays will be badly hit because its property and construction lending has
grown particularly fast in relation to its UK loan book since 1988, the year
Sir John launched a controversial rights issue to embark on an ill-advised
dash for growth. Barclays has also been slower to make provisions. Still,
there is no reason for Midland to smirk. Its exposure is 119 per cent of
equity. The Hongkong Bank must be scrutinising that ratio as it decides how
much to offer.

FT  03 APR 92 / The Lex Column: The risk of Sun burn
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The only way Sun Alliance could face a real challenge for last year's booby
prize in the insurance sector would be if its accounting methods were also
used by Eagle Star. As it is Sun's Pounds 466m pre-tax loss was almost
Pounds 100m higher than the dreadful Royal result, and starkly underlines
the company's rapid and humiliating fall from grace. Sun might have seemed
overcapitalised in the mid 1980s when its solvency margin (net worth as a
percentage of premiums) touched 120 per cent; with last year's figure
including minority interests down to 69 per cent - and likely to slip as low
as 50 per cent by end-1992 - it is perhaps just as well that there was so
much balance sheet fat to burn.
The case for buying the shares lies in the perception that Sun Alliance can
at least maintain its dividend this year and generate real increases through
the mid 1990s. That requires a lot of faith. All UK composites are dogged by
uncertainty, and it is worth remembering that this time a year ago many in
the City thought Sun capable of making profits of Pounds 50m in 1991. There
are encouraging signs, to be sure, that, like its competitors, the company
is prepared to shed unprofitable household and motor business. But the ill
fated mortgage guarantee book is sensitive to rises in UK unemployment, and
subsidence losses remain higher than elsewhere.
There is also room to ponder the group's relatively big exposure to
commercial property and equities (a large part of which is represented by
substantial stakes in Commercial Union and Chubb of the US, both poor stock
market performers this year). Investors would be wise to stay clear of
composites till well past the election; even then a 7.6 per cent yield may
not be sufficient enticement to buy the Sun.

FT  03 APR 92 / Stalemate before the final frantic lap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Next week the British general election may turn into the most exciting race
for power since Hubert Humphrey nearly pipped Richard Nixon at the post in
1968.
I remember being telephoned from London while the count was on. 'We must
plan our edition now,' barked the voice from across the Atlantic. 'Which is
it to be - Democrat or Republican?' Sitting on the edge of a chair in
Washington, the only possible response was to shut one's eyes and guess.
'Nixon,' came the scared whisper. In the event, he got a fractionally larger
vote than Humphrey, and squeaked through in the electoral college.
Next Thursday, we could be transfixed, hypnotised by the little screen,
staring at swingometers and chequered maps of Britain, while holding drinks
in one hand and using the other to tick off individual seats. Several TV
pundits will be required to explain Scotland to the rest of the nation. In
Northern Ireland the UUU, the utterly unpredictable unionists, will continue
to flummox us. A few disgruntled ex-MPs standing as independents may make a
difference in certain constituencies.
All of this presupposes that the polls will continue to predict a parliament
in which no party holds an overall majority. If the outcome is indeed as
close as that, we will be counting heads through the night to establish
which of the big two commands the largest number of seats - Mr Neil
Kinnock's Labour, or Mr John Major's Conservatives. In either circumstance,
the precise numbers will be decisive. In the pre-polling chitterchat of the
past few weeks one constant assertion has been that if the Conservatives
return fewer than 315 MPs (326 being necessary for an overall majority) they
will be out, since not even the UUU could save them then.
You can read a forecast of a hung parliament into the polls published so far
this week. The graphs of the results have told the same story for six
months. They register approximately 38-40 per cent Tory, 40-41 per cent
Labour, and mid-to-late teens Liberal Democrat. Mori's polls in The Times
have shown Labour at 41 per cent in week one of the campaign, 43 per cent in
week two and 41 per cent in week three. In the same poll, the Tories have
stayed put at 38 per cent. The Lib-Dems have moved up a point, to 17 per
cent.
Our FT poll of polls, based on a six-point moving average of the half-dozen
most recent reports sorted by field date, has also registered virtually no
change. The exception is this week's nearly three-point drop in the
Conservative score. It is balanced by an equivalent rise for the Liberal
Democrats. That is probably significant, but be warned. The whole basinful
of numbers, from seven points ahead for Labour to half a point ahead for the
Tories, is within the polling methodology's standard margins of error.
The picture could change when Sunday's fresh crop of results appears, or
again next week as the final snapshot counts are published. This week we had
a rehearsal of what could be another roller-coaster ride, with the polls
saying hung parliament on Sunday, Labour walkover on Wednesday, and hung
parliament yesterday.
There is another possibility. The betting at Ladbrokes, on the IG index and
elsewhere, suggests that people are beginning to put their money on a Labour
victory. The markets are hiding their cash from the very same prospect. But
what kind of a Labour victory? Some punters say flatly that Mr Kinnock will
win outright. There is a strong argument in favour of this theory. Labour is
ahead on most of the issues that voters say are important, including
education, health and the welfare state. It has succeeded in narrowing the
gap on economic confidence. There is also a powerful feeling, skilfully
exploited by Mr Kinnock, that it is time for a change.
Against that, it could be that Labour has peaked too soon. Its huge rally in
Sheffield on Wednesday night was either an inspirational ode to joy, as the
Labour leader would have it, or a triumphal display in less than excellent
taste, as it may have struck those who saw it on TV. Mr Kinnock has
disciplined himself well during this campaign. At every opportunity he has
presented and reinforced the appearance of a prime minister-in-waiting. In
truth he has shown a remarkable and hitherto little suspected capacity to
control his own reactions and prudently shape his face. That could turn out
to be a more telling characteristic than his celebrated changes of policy.
This week, however, Mr Kinnock's natural ebullience has begun to press
against his neat suit and tie, as it did when he was playing up the crowd in
Sheffield. He would not be human if he was not susceptible to the thrill of
anticipation of victory, but he constantly needs to remind himself that
over-confidence can lead to error, and error to defeat.
Such things matter. For this is turning out to be that rare exception - a
contest in which the actual details of the campaign could decide the result.
I'll come to those details in a moment, but first let me clear away a
counter-argument. To say that the campaign is changing people's minds is not
to contradict the view that there are deeper forces at work. It is just that
recent history is now well accounted for.
We know that the Conservatives have been relying on continuing mistrust of
Labour; Labour on deep disenchantment with the recession. We are aware that
Labour has worked hard to escape from the aura of untrustworthiness in which
the electorate has imprisoned it since 1979. That has moved the party to 40
per cent plus and kept it there. It has been established that the
Conservatives are riding a push-me-pull-you. They are dragged forward by Mr
Major's attention to public services, and backwards by the need to defend
the Thatcher decade. Forwards by, shall we say, some of their manifesto
commitments to social services, and backwards by the poll-tax demands
arriving this very week. That lethal mixture originally got them down to 40
per cent minus, from which they may now have begun to descend. These are all
givens.
The net result is stalemate. Analyses of the profound changes in British
history that lie behind this result can take us no further. What could count
at this stage, therefore, is the superficial stuff: the campaign strategies
and tactics, the images the parties and leaders present to the public, and
the last-ditch arguments produced as time races on.
It is for this reason that Conservatives have been drifting over to Mr Paddy
Ashdown's party. Mr Major does not suit the part of political tough.
Anti-Kinnock invective sounds false coming from his lips. His campaign has
been ham-fisted. Too many generals have led a toy-soldier army of
headquarters staff. Mr Ashdown's smooth crusade owes much to his willingness
to submit himself, and his entire team, to the control of a single manager,
the adept Mr Des Wilson. The Lib-Dem leader is the most popular campaigner
of the three. If Mr Major can frighten some of Mr Ashdown's supporters away
by saying they are letting Labour in, the race could yet be a cliff-hanger
for the Tories. If not, we shall awake bleary-eyed at about this time next
week to see Mr Kinnock on his way to No 10 Downing Street.

Most countries' citizens, seeing sheep on the roof of their national
parliament, would conclude they must be wolves in disguise. But that was not
the case with the 100-strong flock grazing on Australia's parliamentary
heights in Canberra.
They were there to mark National Wool Day, intended to recover the
Australian wool industry from the dip which last year took prices to a
25-year low of Pounds 1.90 a kilogram.
As the woolly backs grazed above, the woolly minds in parliament below
debated the industry, accompanied by the click of democrat senator Cheryl
Kernox's needles as she knitted a bright yellow jumper. There was also a
wool auction which raised an average price of Pounds 2.55 a kilo.
Even so, further trouble looms. Australia's sheep-shearers are protesting
about an influx of shearers from New Zealand, accusing them of undercutting.

What's up with Lech Walesa? Although the Poles have grown used to indulging
their president's strange whims, they've been cringing in embarrassment at
his antics during his official visit to Germany, the first by a
post-Communist Polish leader.
The trouble arose while Walesa and a group of Bundestag deputies were
discussing his ideas about relations between Poland and the EC and NATO. On
being asked to explain in more detail, Walesa was his usual evasive self,
responding with generalities and red herrings.
Not impressed, some of the deputies began to drift out of the room.
Whereupon Walesa lost his temper. 'I would get better treatment in hospital
than here,' he reputedly exclaimed. 'At least they would give me a bedpan.'
Amid much clearing of throats, the Bundestag committee chairman promptly
wound up the meeting to allow Walesa to answer the call of nature.
While it is not clear what is causing the latest bizarre behaviour, one
theory is that Walesa is increasingly preoccupied with efforts by other
politicians to form a grand coalition back in Warsaw. The idea that an
effective government might be imminent is apparently too much for the
president, who has been striving to keep the political scene fragmented
while seeking to define a role for himself.
The Germans, meanwhile, have been puzzling over Walesa's quirky humour. His
latest joke involves urging Mercedes to invest in Poland so as to reduce
thefts of their cars in Germany.

All the same, the competition was not as fierce as it might have been. It's

The last thing seemingly needed by Britain's biggest venture capitalist 3i
is another chartered accountant. The place is crawling with the selfsame
species already.
Hence the appointment of Alan Wheatley, Price Waterhouse's senior London
partner, as next chairman of 3i looks unlikely to inspire punters to back
what is going to be a difficult stock market flotation later this year.
While Wheatley is big in the profession and has sat on the boards of Cable
and Wireless and British Steel, he has spent more than three decades
climbing his way up the Price Waterhouse tree. He is certainly not in the
same sort of league as previous 3i chairmen such as Lords Sherfield, Seebohm
and Caldecote.
Admittedly, he is still only 53 and Price Waterhouse is a much bigger
business than 3i. So he may yet turn out to be an excellent choice.
However, the success of eminent accountants in turning from professional
practice to running businesses is less than compelling.
For example, Ian Hay Davison has still to prove his mettle at Storehouse,
and the mixed records of company chairmen on the lines of John Darby
(ex-Arthur Young) scarcely justify certainty about the wisdom of Sir John
Cuckney's choice.

To match the two memorial services being held for him today, Australia's
late mining magnate Lang Hancock had two big slices of luck.
First, his sheep farm turned out to hold iron ore for which the CRA mining
group pays Pounds 5.2m yearly. He spent it on quirky schemes - like
sterilisation for Aborigines - that got him branded a crackpot.
The week since he died has brought nastiness, starting with police swooping
on his Perth mansion, saying they'd heard he had been poisoned. And his
doctor's delay in certifying his death has not deterred squabbling between
his third wife Rose and his daughter by an earlier marriage, Gina Rinehart.
Each sent a hearse to collect his body from the mortuary, which refused to
release it to either. The widow finally prevailed, but the rivalry continues
in the holding of separate memorial services.
The estate should be less contentious. It is to be divided equally between
the two, with the proviso that neither must contest the will, on pain of
disinheritance.
To add to the rancour, Mrs Hancock's daughter by a previous marriage showed
off the magnate's death room to a less than respectful TV programme, with
the result that the widow plans to go on the box today to defend her good
name.
Hancock's second slice of luck?. He's not there to see his family's
behaviour.

FT  03 APR 92 / Letter: Labour tax plans will drag down south-east
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr P J DAMESICK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In assessing the alternative economic policies of the main political
parties, their differential regional impact must not be overlooked. In
particular, there are serious risks inherent in Labour's shadow budget
because of the potential damage to the UK's most important economic region
of south-east England.
Average earnings for non-manual male workers in the south-east were Pounds
22,100 pa in 1991. This is the level at which Labour's income tax and
National Insurance increases would start to bite. In Greater London, more
than 10 per cent of the white collar male workforce earn over Pounds 40,000
pa and would face the top tax rate of 50 per cent (plus 9 per cent NI
contributions).
Average earnings in London and the home counties are higher elsewhere in
Britain, but so too is the cost of living, especially housing. We saw in
1989-90 the crippling effect of high interest rates on heavily mortgaged
households in the south-east.
With the Institute of Fiscal Studies predicting that one-quarter of London's
households would be worse off (in many cases, significantly so) under
Labour's tax plans, the risk to consumer and housing markets is clear. The
real 'double whammy' for the south-east would be if Labour's fiscal shock
for higher earners were combined with higher interest rates needed to
support sterling in the ERM.
In the early 1980s the south-east led the economy out of recession. This
time the region was hit first and hardest in the downturn, dragging the rest
of the economy down with it. If Labour's new tax regime weakens south-east
consumer and housing markets further, this could hold back national
recovery.

Sir, Vanessa Houlder refers to new towns showing their age (The Property
Market, March 27). I would like to point out that the infrastructure of a
town is as important as the design of the buildings, if not more so.
The first new towns were chosen in strategic locations with excellent road
and rail communications and good access to London. They were well planned
with good road systems, ample car parking, shopping and leisure facilities
in the right position within the town together with quality modern housing.
Stevenage, for example, continues to attract investment from major
multinational companies. Over the past three years more than Pounds 1bn has
been invested in the town by such companies as Glaxo, Provident Mutual,
Confederation Life and British Aerospace. Is it a coincidence that Stevenage
has only one set of traffic lights?

FT  03 APR 92 / Letter: American sees Tories as lacking courage to use
legislative power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From C WARREN CARTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is with some bemusement that I sit here in New York and watch the
continuing decline of the Conservative party in the UK. Having spent nearly
five years living and working in London, I had grown envious of the English
parliamentary system where a government has the power of immediate
legislative action.
I am somewhat dumbfounded by the Tories' refusal to have used this very
authority to do something for the struggling UK economy and in turn improve
their standing with the electorate. Instead of addressing the problems of
Britain's high unemployment, a severely weakened property market, low
consumer confidence and high interest rates, John Major and his party have
wooed voters with small, piecemeal budget giveaways and a message to voters
somehow to trust in government to turn things around.
Not surprisingly, Mr Major has found it difficult to explain to British
workers why they are being priced out of jobs by high German interest rates.
Indeed, the real message coming through seems to be to let the Bundesbank
and ERM work their magic and everything will be fine.
I seriously doubt that the average UK worker cares much about the ERM, Ecu,
Emu, or the grand strategies put forth at Maastricht. He does, however,
understand the relationship between the cost of money and his mortgage
payments and the restraint that high interest rates impose on his own
economy.
I would also suspect that voters in the UK sense that the government's
intransigent adherence to a weak economic theory as the basis for public
policy is sign enough of a confused cabinet.
Even if one accepts that the UK's entry into the ERM was appropriate (and I
feel that it was) there is little empirical evidence to support an argument
that high interest rates should be the sole tool for maintaining a 'correct'
level of sterling exchange rates. The value of any country's currency is
usually a reflection of its overall economic well being - and sterling sits
at the bottom of the ERM because the economy is so weak.
Many wise pundits staked their reputations on the notion that the UK, with
its high rates, upon entering the ERM, would be forced to lower interest
rates to keep sterling from moving through the top of its upper band. The
upward push in sterling never occurred, and it is puzzling to witness a
government stymied by the equally specious view that lowering rates now as a
part of a responsible growth package would destroy confidence in sterling.
If the Tories lose power on April 9, it may well be because Mr Major has not
taken a more courageous stand on the economy.

FT  03 APR 92 / Letter: No benefit from road pricing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PAUL EVERITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The suggestion that commercial users would benefit from road pricing is
both misleading and naive ('Commercial users seen to gain from road
pricing', April 1). Road pricing would reduce their business in urban areas.
In Sweden, the local council in Stockholm has estimated that road pricing
would reduce retail trade by 8 per cent. Clearly, such a reduction in
economic activity would soon erode any operational benefits that might
accrue to commercial users.
While road pricing may offer a conveniently simplistic solution to urban
congestion, the practical realities of its introduction are more complex and
disturbing. During the 1980s, 80 per cent of the growth in retail floor
space took place in out-of-town sites. Pricing urban roads and discouraging
their use will only create greater pressure for the development of green
field sites where access is cheaper.
Road pricing is socially divisive and inequitable. The wealthy will be able
to afford personal mobility, the poor will not. Despite improvement to
public transport many will still aspire to be car owners. The majority of
people will find road pricing as popular as the poll tax.

FT  03 APR 92 / Leading Article: Tough time for Europe's left
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FEW TEARS will be shed over the departure of Mrs Edith Cresson. But it is
ironic that Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the main architect of her downfall, should
now take her crown. The new French prime minister has been the intellectual
driving force behind France's tight economic policy of the last few years,
the painful side-effects of which are largely to blame for the Socialist
government's present unpopularity. Mrs Cresson, for all her faults, was
sacrificed for this cause, a precedent upon which Mr Neil Kinnock might
reflect.
Mr Beregovoy may also find his electoral standing is rapidly squeezed by the
burden of France's economic problems. The electorate is weary after years of
high unemployment and slow growth, as last week's polls made clear. But
there is little he can do to change things for the better.
The French economy's downturn may well be reaching its nadir. Germany's
post-unification expansion, which buoyed French exports and growth in 1990,
has turned sour. But inflationary pressures remain, requiring the Bundesbank
to keep the interest rates of all members of the European exchange rate
mechanism at painfully high levels. German rates will remain high for some
months yet.
Greater cost
Perversely, France's hard-won battle to reduce its inflation rate below that
of Germany makes the real cost to it of Europe's tight monetary policy even
greater. Nor will Mr Beregovoy find it easy to follow the lead of other
European countries and relax fiscal policy. The one achievement after years
of rigour is France's lonely position as the only important European country
that meets all of the convergence criteria for European monetary union.
In short, the French Socialist government will have to fight next year's
general election against a background of sluggish growth and high
unemployment, similar to that which in Britain may be about to deliver the
first socialist government for more than a decade. Mr Kinnock's Labour party
is also pledged to follow similarly monetarist policies to those of
Socialist France.
There are some lessons the British Labour party would be wise to learn from
the French experience if it is not to follow its socialist brother's
example. The French government's problems are compounded by its failure to
tackle France's persistent long-term unemployment problem. Labour has a
clearer idea of the combination of counselling and training needed to reduce
long-term unemployment. But it must also avoid the over-zealous regulation
that has stifled French job creation, discouraged women from joining the
labour market and kept female and youth unemployment rates at very high
levels in the 1980s.
Ongoing strain
If it wins next week, Labour may have five years in which to get its act
together and see unemployment on a downward trend. But that might not be
long enough. Even if German interest rates are falling by 1993, they are
unlikely to fall very far. The fiscal strain of propping up east Germany
will last for some years to come.
Persistently high European real interest rates and a sluggish German economy
are not auspicious for European growth. Nor would an ERM re-alignment allow
interest rates outside Germany to fall further, although some form of
re-alignment before monetary union may be inevitable for countries with
persistent trade deficits such as Italy and possibly the UK.
The strains imposed by Germany's economic difficulties will be especially
tough for left-wing government to endure. Up to now, the French Socialists
have judged the pains of a rigid ERM - slow growth and fiscal restraint - to
be worth the gains in terms of enhanced credibility with financial markets
and the promise of Emu. Mr John Smith and his Labour party colleagues have
made the same judgment.
Yet if European growth remains sluggish after 1993, and Emu is pushed
further into the future, they will find life increasingly hard. Going
forward to Emu or retreating to a more flexible ERM with independent
national central banks, are both consistent with the agenda of Europe's
social democratic left. But the status quo, if it persists into 1993 and
beyond, may be too tough to tolerate.

FT  03 APR 92 / Safe hands for a party in distress: Ian Davidson asks
whether the new prime minister can save the French Socialists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, France's new prime minister, is a paragon of gravity,
moderation and great experience. Of all the available candidates, he looks
the safest to take over the government, at a time when President Francois
Mitterrand's administration is reeling from its humiliating rout in the
recent regional and local elections. What is not immediately obvious is
whether he also has that flair of inspiration, in addition to his many
manifest qualities of decency, which might help him restore the political
legitimacy of the Socialist government, now virtually destroyed.
This is the scale of the problem facing him. It is commonly said that
whoever succeeded Mrs Edith Cresson would face two tasks of steeply rising
difficulty. The first is to halt the disastrous collapse in the government's
popularity which accompanied her 10-month premiership; the second is to
encourage the Socialist party to face the general elections a year from now,
if not with confidence, at least without the dreadful certainty of a total
massacre. Equally commonly, it is said that the first task is difficult, and
the second out of reach.
In fact, the crisis facing the government is far more serious than that. The
question is not whether Mr Beregovoy can climb up the charts again in time
for next year's general elections, but whether this government can manage to
stay in power even until the end of this year. The political crisis is now
so acute that the Mitterrand regime may not be able to avoid either early
general elections, or early presidential elections, or both.
The question of democratic legitimacy is clearly posed by the stunning
collapse in popular support for the ruling Socialist party. Four years ago,
in the 1988 general elections, the Socialists fell short of an absolute
majority of seats in parliament, but at least they could claim the popular
support of nearly 35 per cent of the voters.
In the regional elections of 10 days ago, by contrast, their popular support
had shrivelled to less than 19 per cent. Of course, the regional elections
have no effect on the Socialists' strength in the National Assembly; but a
disavowal on this scale cannot fail to destabilise the credibility of their
position as the party of government.
The regional elections may, however, have overstated the Socialists' loss of
support. The free-fall proportional system encouraged a dispersal of voting,
which would probably not apply to a real-life general election with majority
voting. In the second round of the local elections, for example, the
Socialists got nearly 25 per cent, and most polls of future voting
intentions point to 22 or 23 per cent. Still, even 23 per cent represents a
very large drop.
The follow-on effect of the regional election disaster is that it will
become increasingly difficult for the Socialists to get legislation through
parliament. As it is, the previous government often had to resort to awkward
methods of pushing through its bills, to make up for its lack of an absolute
majority. First, it co-opted some non-Socialists into the cabinet so as to
enlarge the apparent size of its political base; second, it sometimes
coerced the Communists into reluctant acquiescence by threatening to provoke
a vote of no-confidence.
Neither of these devices is likely to work as well in future. The moderate
conservative, Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, was one of the leading non-Socialists
in the outgoing Cresson government. But he was forced to resign from his job
as minister of public administration because he appeared to have accepted
the support of the extreme right-wing National Front in his election to the
presidency of the Bourgogne regional council.
Mr Brice Lalonde, leader of the Generation Ecologie movement, was minister
for the environment in the outgoing Cresson government, but he has announced
that he will not be a minister in a future Socialist government. He says he
is revolted by the wheeling and dealing that have been taking place in the
corridors of power of the newly elected regional councils. His real reason
may be that, with more than 7 per cent of the national vote, he sees more
advantage in working for his own party than for a Socialist government which
looks doomed. But the result is the same: his interest is to lead a party of
opposition.
Whatever his reasons, the Socialists will find it more difficult to co-opt
symbolic figures from the ecological movements, who in any case are not
represented in parliament. Moreover, centrists who were once tempted by
President Mitterrand's overtures now know that they have much less to gain
from helping the Socialists than from lining up with their more natural
allies on the right.
The Communists, for their part, have finally rejected all vestiges of their
one-time alliance with the Socialists and are set to play an openly hostile
role in future. In the regional elections their vote sank once again to a
hard core of 8 per cent, compared with 11 per cent in the last general
elections, and the party now seems to have decided that it has little left
to lose. It has described its new posture as that of 'opposition of the
left', which implies a systematic hostility to the Socialist party. If the
Communists accept that they are now doomed to the residual role of a protest
party, but believe that their support can scarcely fall any further, they
will be much less afraid of early general elections than the Socialists. As
it is, they announced yesterday that they would not support a vote of
confidence in the new Socialist government.
It is a measure of President Mitterrand's predicament that his preferred
candidate to take over the prime ministership declined the invitation. Mr
Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, consistently sails
right at the top of the French popularity ratings, and the polls say he is
much the strongest potential Socialist candidate for the next presidential
elections. As a result, he looked naturally cast for the part of the white
knight who could rescue the Socialist party in its distress. He evidently
concluded that the costs of the operation would far outweigh the rewards.
dent Mitterrand and Mr Delors conducted intense negotiations last week.
Their failure was made public on Monday, with the pointed announcement by Mr
Delors' spokesman that the Commission president was fully engaged in his
present heavy responsibilities in Brussels, and expected to serve out the
rest of his term, which runs until the end of this year.
According to Le Figaro, the negotiations foundered because the political
conditions demanded by Mr Delors were unacceptably high. He insisted, said
the newspaper, that he must have the authority to dissolve parliament, as a
lever to exert the maximum discipline over the Socialist party.
In formal terms, such a condition could not have been met: under the
constitution only the president has the authority to dissolve parliament.
But the message was that Mr Delors was not interested in becoming prime
minister unless President Mitterrand was effectively prepared to concede to
him the ultimate powers of decision in the state.
This would be the second time that Mr Delors was offered the Hotel Matignon,
but set impossible conditions. In the spring of 1983, the new Socialist
government was being battered by continuing foreign exchange crises and a
third devaluation, as well as by a heavy electoral defeat in the March
municipal elections.
The president turned to Mr Delors, then finance minister, and asked him to
take over from Mr Pierre Mauroy as prime minister; Mr Delors said yes, but
only if he kept control of the Finance Ministry. Mr Mitterrand refused and,
after nine days of hesitation, Mr Mauroy was obliged to soldier on as prime
minister for another 16 months. So Mr Delors stayed at the Finance Ministry,
and imposed the new, rigorous and non-Socialist economic policy that is
still in force.
The lesson of today's crisis is that the job facing any new prime minister
is once again so difficult that the position is not necessarily attractive
to a politician with further ambitions. At best, the prime minister in
France carries responsibilities and risks which are far greater than his
political authority: the president rules, and the prime minister is his
submissive executant. In present circumstances, Mr Jacques Delors had
nothing to gain, and a great deal to lose, from President Mitterrand's
offer. He could only safeguard his popularity and his chances in a future
presidential election by staying right away from the calamitous situation in
France.
Yesterday, Mr Beregovoy set an agenda which is clearly meant as an answer to
France's disaffected protest voters: unemployment and economic recovery, law
and order, and the environment. This is unlikely to mean a significant
change of policies, however, because his room for manoeuvre is so narrow.
His key asset, his reputation for economic orthodoxy, remains unquestioned,
despite a budget deficit which has swelled out of control as a result of the
recession, because his anti-inflation achievements are intact. It is
unlikely he will risk any heroic reflationary adventures, because they would
do serious damage long before they did any good.
In any case, the managerial aspects of Mr Beregovoy's programme will be
overshadowed by the political dramas which lie ahead. President Mitterrand
is in a position of great difficulty and weakness; it is entirely possible
that he will be unable to complete his term, which expires in 1995; but he
is certain to fight to regain the initiative right until the end.
How he will fight is still undecided, but he must take his stand on an issue
of important political principle. There are two which are tailor-made for
the battle: the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty of European Union,
scheduled for next month; and a second constitutional revision, to shorten
the term of the presidency, planned for the autumn.
His problem is that he cannot make a conclusive personal come-back, except
with a convincing 'yes' vote in a popular referendum. The danger is that the
electorate might vote 'no' to the questioner, rather than 'yes' to the
question. Since President Mitterrand will not risk a rejection of the
Maastricht Treaty, he is likely to push ratification through a special
session of parliament.
The logical inference, therefore, is that he should wait until the autumn to
stake his position and the standing of the Socialist government on the
second constitutional revision in a popular referendum. But the key problem
is that he may not be able to control the timetable. If the crisis breaks
earlier for reasons beyond his control, much of his presidential legacy,
starting with the ratification of Maastricht, could be in jeopardy.

FT  03 APR 92 / Burdened but unbowed: The fight over Russia's economic
policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Yegor Gaidar, who was forced to step down as Russia's finance minister
yesterday, told the Financial Times as the announcement was made that he was
determined to ride out the criticism of his economic reform policy.
Though he said Mr Yeltsin 'fully supports this government and the direction
of its policy', he also said his tight credit policy would be significantly
relaxed under pressure from the industrial managers, now starved of credits
and with debts to the banks and to each other of more than Rbs600bn. He said
that about Rbs100bn would be quickly made available to these enterprise
bosses, 'enough to ease their problems, but not so much that that it
threatens hyperinflation'.
Mr Gaidar said he could no longer adhere to his previous target of balancing
the budget this year, and that there would be a large overshoot in spending
in March, April and May. This was because the government would fulfil its
promises to fund some programmes that it had squeezed in the first two
months of this year.
However, he said in the second half of the year he would be able to tighten
money supply again: 'I make no commitment on this, but I would hope we would
keep to a deficit of less than 5 per cent of Russia's gross domestic product
at the end of the year' (this compares with a 20 per cent deficit on the
all-Soviet budget at the end of 1991).
He said the International Monetary Fund had itself suggested the loosening
of credit - suggesting that without its pressure he might have continued the
tight policy.
Stressing that he would stay on as deputy prime minister, Mr Gaidar forecast
he would come under attack at Monday's meeting of the Russian Congress of
Peoples Deputies: 'There will be very strong criticism from the old
communist bloc, there will be very strong criticism from the Russian
nationalists, who will say I am selling the country to the IMF and the
western powers. We will be criticised by the agrarian deputies because we
don't care about agriculture and we will be criticised by the enterprise
managers because they face serious problems of industrial restructuring.
'But what really should be at issue will be this: can you really afford to
change the government now? Because a change of government will mean an
institutional mess, and it will be very bad to get rid of a government that
is so recently in office.' He added: 'I think we will survive next week.'
Mr Gaidar said that the Dollars 18bn balance of payment support and Dollars
6bn stabilisation fund from the Group of Seven leading industrial countries
announced on Wednesday was 'a sign of very serious support. And it was the
right moment to do it from the political point of view.' He said he was
'very satisfied' with the IMF's offer of a 3 per cent quota, giving
borrowing rights of Dollars 4bn once Russia gained membership at the end of
this month. 'Of course, we would like more as a big important country, but
first we have to prove we are a superpower economically as well as a
superpower because we have nuclear weapons.'
Mr Gaidar says the government will use the Dollars 6bn stabilisation fund to
allow the Russian Central Bank to intervene in the markets to keep the
rouble at a rate floating at - on his present estimates - 40 to 50 roubles
to the dollar (it is presently at Rbs110). He said the government's original
calculations that the rouble could be fixed at 25 to 30 roubles to the
dollar had been revised, and that 'we would never attempt to defend an
overvalued rouble'.
There were no fears, he said, that there would be a speculative run on the
rouble which would eat up all of the Dollars 6bn stabilisation fund  -
'quite small interventions by the bank would be enough to deter speculators,
because the market is really quite limited'. He said the new rate of the
rouble should be set after oil prices were raised (though not freed) to
about Rbs2000 a tonne in two months. Liberalisation of oil prices to world
levels might take a year and half longer after the first price rise to allow
the restructuring of the industry. It would reach these levels in stages.
He would not be drawn on what other changes would be announced in a wider
reconstruction of the cabinet, but said that Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian
president, would remain as prime minister. He evaded giving any reply on the
future of Mr Gennady Burbulis, the first deputy prime minister: it seems
likely that Mr Burbulis will lose this role in the reshuffle.
There was no sign in the interview, given in the old Communist Party Central
Committee headquarters, that Mr Gaidar was a broken politician: merely one
who has learned to compromise, and to survive.

FT  03 APR 92 / Arts: City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Towards the Millennium, the concert series devised for the City of
Birmingham Symphony Orchestra by Simon Rattle and the late Michael Vyner,
continues on its richly rewarding way in Birmingham, Cardiff and London. The
latest instalment in this vast progression through the 20th century was
devoted to the year 1912: a convenient peg - since closer links between the
works could hardly be traced - on which to hang a superb programme of
Schoenberg, Prokofiev and Debussy.
Inevitably, the London visitor to Symphony Hall (where on Wednesday I caught
the concert) spends much of his listening time revelling in its acoustics,
and in the freedom they allow the CBSO to make real music. Already, after
nearly a year's residence here, the gain in the players' responsiveness and
spontaneity of detail is a cause for simple amazement. The closing
performance of Debussy's three Images was a glistening tissue of
feather-brushed sounds, of single lines lightly poised, of timbral
combinations suspended in air.
Rattle has always had a native feeling for Debussy's orchestral ethos, for
its precise yet elusive flow of colours and ideas. In their home hall, he
and his orchestra have been able to develop this gift steadily; the
corporate achievement of these Birmingham Debussyans is now marvellous to
behold. There was far less need for orchestral subtlety in the Prokofiev
First Piano Concerto, earlier on; yet the accompaniment had a boldness and
vitality of colour very seldom equalled. Emanuel Ax was a magisterial
soloist, missing only the last degree of wit and wizardry.
The first part of the concert was devoted entirely to Schoenberg's Pierrot
lunaire - the seminal, mould-breaking 1912 masterpiece. Giving it here, with
lights down and in semi-staged form, was a brave experiment that failed to
come off. The five players from the Birmingham Contemporary Music Group plus
Ax as excellently stylish and communicative pianist offered a magically free
and fluent account of the score under Rattle's direction; the sound-world,
full of wild disturbance yet drily detached, was perfectly evoked.
Yet the sheer physical space placed between many of us and the reciter,
Elise Ross, robbed the experience of intimacy. The decision to speak the
poems in German rather than (as Schoenberg preferred) in the language of the
audience is further compromised when the printed words are rendered
invisible during performance. Pierrot lunaire should transport its audience
through night-worlds of fantasy. This time, in spite of innumerable
delicacies and graces in Miss Ross's delivery, the journey never really
began.

The National Gallery's successful campaign to acquire Holbein's 'Portrait of

attempt to retain Canaletto's 'The Old Horse Guards, London' from possible
export, writes Antony Thorncroft.
The Harris Estate had put the painting for sale at Christies' on April 15.
The Tate is keen to acquire this important work, painted in 1749, a year
before the Old Horse Guards was demolished.
Unfortunately, the National Heritage Fund stumped up Pounds 3.5m for the
Holbein and can credibly plead poverty. The Canaletto would cost at least
Pounds 3m, but negotiations continue and could still end in success.

Lotus Engineering, the automotive consultancy division of Norfolk sports car

development in a new field.
Lotus engineers have been working with experts from the Animal Health Trust
in Newmarket for the past two years to develop a new horseshoe to give
racehorses a softer ride on firm ground.
'The drier summers and resulting harder racecourse surfaces are giving
racehorses sore hooves, and trainers are unwilling to risk damaging their

'We've been asked to evaluate what can be done to put the spring back in

A camera on a chip could make life a lot tougher for criminals and reduce
the number of false alarms. Automated Security Holdings (Ash) has developed
a miniature video camera which, when triggered by a movement sensor,
captures four video images at one-second intervals.
These can then be transmitted to a police station or a communications centre
for analysis. The system, called TVX, is based upon an Edinburgh University
invention and uses a specially designed lens bonded directly on to the chip.

FT  03 APR 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Age crisis for compact discs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nothing lasts forever, and videocassettes and compact discs are no
exception. Researchers at The Netherlands Organisation for Applied
Scientific Research (TNO) believe that CDs may stop producing sound after
about 30 years because the pits in the metal surface will have oxidised.
Video recordings are at risk because they are gradually deleted as the tape
is demagnetised. Random checks from Dutch video archives showed blue-tinged
and striped images often after three years.
It seems that even CD-Rom, the latest electronic storage medium, has only a
limited lifespan. TNO plans further experiments to find out just how durable
contemporary sound and image storage media are. TNO: Netherlands, 3115

FT  03 APR 92 / Appointments: Verey rises at SG Warburg
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Rival cultures live on inside SG Warburg, the UK's top home-grown investment
bank. It may be six years since the bank was created, pieced together out of
some of the City's leading houses; but former partners of Rowe &amp; Pitman, a
stockbroker now subsumed in the group, still cleave jealously to their old
identity.
Against that background, the emergence of Nicholas Verey - a 49-year-old who
joined Rowe &amp; Pitman at the age of 18 - as a managing director of investment
banking at Warburg almost looks like the anointment of an old-style senior
partner in the stockbroking world. He will be deputy chairman of SG Warburg
Securities.
Verey, who has been chairman of Warburg in the US only since June 1990, will
return in the autumn to take over from Peter Hardy, another Rowe &amp; Pitman
man.
Hardy has managed 38 years with the firm, though he has still not reached
his 54th birthday. Warburg said that he had always intended to retire in his
mid-50s, playing down any suggestion of internal dissension.
Verey will become one of three managing directors of the group from June
this year.

Sir John Banham is appointed a non-executive director of NATIONAL POWER with

FT  03 APR 92 / Technology: Computers left, right and centre - How IT is
helping to improve the parties' chances of victory at next week's UK
election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HOLDSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE YEARS is a longer time in technology than in politics. The performance
of personal computers doubles every 12-18 months, which means that the
hardware available to today's political campaigners is between 10 and 30
times more powerful than what was on offer at the last UK general election
in 1987.
Computers have also grown in numbers. This election has them left, right and
centre, as one hardware supplier gleefully notes.
At Neil Kinnock's Walworth Road headquarters in London, a McDonnell Douglas
minicomputer tracks and co-ordinates the movements of the Labour party's
main campaigners; on John Major's election coach, a clutch of sophisticated
PCs and communications equipment provides the prime minister with instant
information wherever he is in the country; and in Paddy Ashdown's pocket, a
tiny PC, no bigger than a videocassette, stores speeches transmitted from
his office at the House of Commons.
At the constituency level, technology is far more widespread than in 1987.
PCs and laser printers produce personalised letters, target different
sections of the community, and on polling day, draw up lists of supporters
who have yet to vote. These systems are an indispensable canvassing tool in
a marginal seat.
John Major's coach is equipped with the latest hardware from Apricot, the
once British computer company now owned by Mitsubishi of Japan. Three
desktop computers based on Intel's superfast 486 chip churn out reports,
press releases and speeches. In an impressive demonstration of 1990s'
technology, they hook up to a device which scans incoming faxes and converts
them into files for word processing.
The system ships documents around the country, through BT's Cellnet, to the
computers, printers or autocue systems where they are needed. The PCs are
highly secure with infra-red cards to prevent unauthorised access.
At the Liberal Democrats' central office at Cowley Street, London, a new
computer system came on line earlier this month to help raise funds for the
election campaign. It's only a PC - but a very powerful one, again based on
the 486 chip. Although it takes up a fraction of the space of the party's
old UCL minicomputer, the new 'Pick' system represents a four-fold increase
in processing power. 'Given the power of PCs as compared with five years
ago, we've been able to upgrade by downgrading,' says Keith House, computer
director.
Labour, meanwhile, is several years into a computer revolution which mirrors
the overall modernisation of the party's image during the 1980s. The party
has been using IT in anger only since 1987 says Roger Hough, Labour's
information systems manager. Since then it has installed a new minicomputer,
arranged a bulk purchasing deal for constituency PCs with Opus, a maker of
IBM-compatible machines, and developed its nationwide interest group,
Computing for Labour, into a thriving organisation with 1,200 members.
Hough's department sends out a daily election bulletin to constituencies
using BT's Telecom Gold service. The bulletin sets the agenda for the day,
briefing local canvassers on the progress of the national campaign,
distributing press releases and suggesting answers to questions that are
likely to come up on the doorstep.
'In 1987 we had about 30 constituencies using computers,' says Hough. 'Now
it's more than 300. It's natural for people to use PCs - many already do so
at work.'
Computing for Labour (CFL) is a forum for party members who want to make
their computer skills available to the cause. Its main achievement is a
database called Elpack which allows a local party to store information on
every voter. Names and addresses from the electoral roll, available from
local authorities for a small fee per 1,000 names, are fed into the system
and classified through a mixture of intuition and footwork. CFL supplies
constituencies with discs containing names that suggest a particular sex,
age-range or ethnic group.
The system scans the database and marks people down, for example, as male,
female, Asian, Greek, retired, or a first-time voter. 'Anyone with an eye
for these things can identify pensioners from their forenames,' says David
Wilkinson, a Labour party organiser in London. 'The system can also work out
how many people live in a house - and whether they're a family or a bunch of
individuals sharing.'
Facts about each ward are entered such as locations of council houses and
whether or not the occupants have exercised their right to buy. 'Previously
we might have gone round a council estate giving out leaflets on council
rents when 30 per cent of the people there had bought their homes and would
have been more interested in a leaflet about mortgages,' says Wilkinson.
When canvassers go on their rounds they carry canvass cards, produced by
Elpack, which list all the voters in a district. Canvassers write
information on the cards and enter it into Elpack when they return to base.
The Liberal Democrats use software very similar to Elpack. It's called Polly
and comes from a company called Democrats Election Computer System (Decs).
'Paddy Ashdown was one of the original architects,' says Polly's author,
Gillian Gunner. 'He calls himself the architect,' she adds, 'but I call him
the first major guinea pig.'
As a priority Polly has been installed in marginal seats such as Richmond
and Barnes, and Twickenham in London.
Vincent Cable, the Liberal Democrat Candidate for Twickenham, finds the
system invaluable. 'Your canvassing can be much more creative and useful.
The traditional way is to go out in cars and chase your supporters. This
time it's much more personal.'
Locally, the Liberal Democrats appear to beg, steal and borrow their
hardware. Unlike Labour and the Conservatives very few constituencies own a
PC. They depend instead on local members bringing them in from their home or
work.
'Last time we could not have managed without business people being
involved,' says Peter Beardow, a Twickenham campaigner. 'Now there are more
people who have computers we can borrow.'
Twickenham has tested its two printers almost to destruction by producing
45,000 mailshot labels over eight hours and 2,500 canvass cards over three
days. 'We're doing things you wouldn't do in a commercial environment,' says
Beardow. 'The printer makers should be very proud of their products.'
The Conservatives also have a constituency computer system similar to Elpack
and Polly. It's called Fileplan and is supplied to local parties by Resource
Management, a company based in Bath.
Local Conservative parties are autonomous and can choose whatever software
they like stresses Nigel Hawkes, the Tories' constituency computer adviser.
However, he recommends Fileplan and Apricot.
The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats are also using a system called
Discfax for sending the contents of a floppy disc through the telephone
network to a second disc at the end of the line. The Conservatives have
installed Discfax on John Major's coach and at various locations around the
country. The Liberal Democrats use it to send faulty software back to Decs
for repair.
On polling day, PCs will have another role to play. Systems such as Polly,
Elpack and Fileplan will keep track of who has voted throughout the day so
that forgetful supporters can be rounded up.
Traditionally, the job is done with 'Reading' pads - ingenious multi-layered
lists of voters with a different colour on each layer to show how many times
a particular district has been visited.
Reading pads have a devoted following. They're better than progams, says
Alan Barnard, Labour agent for Islington South and Finsbury. 'With coloured
paper laid out on a table, you can tell at a glance which areas to send
people to.'
Barnard commands a room full of computers and printers but does not use
Elpack. Instead he has an equally-powerful database borrowed from a
colleague's employer.
'Last time we were using typewriters with carbon paper. People who were
working here then have come in and been amazed at what we are doing now. In
1987 we won the seat by 2 per cent and that 2 per cent was totally due to
our organisation. This time our organisation is improved through computers.'

FT  03 APR 92 / FT Law Report: No costs remission to arbitrators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT OF INDIA v JADRANSKA SLOBODNA PLOVIDBA
Queen's Bench Division:
Mr Justice Hobhouse:
March 26 1992
A PARTY to arbitration who seeks to challenge a costs award on the ground of
error of law must do so by way of appeal and not by application for
remission to the arbitrator, irrespective of whether the award was reasoned
or unreasoned, and whether or not it was included in the substantive award.
And as it would be almost impossible for an appeal from an unreasoned award
to succeed in that any appeal must be made out on the reasons, parties
should consider at the time of the hearing whether to ask for a reasoned
award.
Mr Justice Hobhouse so held when refusing an application by the charterer,
the president of India, against shipowners, Jadranska Slobodna Plovidba, for
an order to remit a costs award to the arbitrators on the ground of
misconduct.
Section 1 of the Arbitration Act 1979 provides: '(1) . . . without prejudice
to the right of appeal conferred by subsection (2) below, the High Court
shall not have jurisdiction to set aside or remit an award on an arbitration
agreement on the ground of errors of fact or law on the face of the award.
(2) . . . an appeal shall lie to the High Court on any question of law
arising out of an award . . .'
HIS LORDSHIP said that disputes arising between charterers and shipowners,
under a charterparty dated August 25 1986, were referred to arbitration in
London.
By an interim award dated January 28 1991 the arbitrators awarded that
charterers should pay owners Dollars 3,142.
On April 24 the arbitrators made a 'final award as to costs'.
That award was substantially adverse to the charterers. They issued a notice
of motion for an order that it be remitted to the arbitrators on the ground
of misconduct.
The application was made under section 22 of the Arbitration Act 1950 ('In
all cases of reference to arbitration the High Court . . . may remit . . .
to . . . the arbitrator'), in conjunction with section 18 ('costs . . .
shall be in the discretion of the arbitrator').
The allegation was that the arbitrators had failed to exercise the judicial
discretion required by section 18.
The award was not a reasoned award, but the arbitrators separately furnished
the parties with 'confidential' reasons explaining how they had arrived at
their decision.
In Blexen v G Percy Trenthan (1990) 42 EG 1331 the Court of Appeal
considered the procedure to be adopted by a party aggrieved by an
arbitrator's award on costs.
It held that the governing statutory provision for the purposes of the
application with which it was concerned was not section 22 of the 1950 Act,
but section 1 of the Arbitration Act 1979.
Section 1 provided that, subject to the right of appeal, the court had no
jurisdiction to remit an award 'on the ground of errors of fact or law on
the face of the award'.
The Court of Appeal in Blexen held that in the case before it the court no
longer had power to remit under section 22 of the 1950 Act, and that the
application must fail because it was not brought under section 1 of the 1979
Act.
That decision was binding on the present court.
In the leading judgment, Lord Justice Lloyd said power to set aside or remit
for misconduct survived, but not when the only misconduct alleged was an
error of fact or law in a reasoned award.
Blexen was similar to the present case in that the parties had requested the
arbitrator to hold a separate hearing and publish a separate costs award.
But it was different in that they had apparently asked that it should be a
reasoned award. That was the express basis of the Court of Appeal decision.
In King v Thomas McKenna (1991) 2 WLR 1234, 1246 Lord Donaldson MR said
obiter that appeal with leave under section 1 would also be the only means
of appeal in a case in which no reasons had been given.
Where the costs award was a separate award, following Blexen, it was clear
that the matter must be governed by the 1979 Act.
If the award was reasoned the procedure to be followed must be that laid
down in section 1.
Notice of motion must be issued in time and leave to appeal asked for. The
appeal must be made good on the reasons.
The applicant would have to satisfy the court, on the reasons, that the
arbitrator misdirected himself on what was involved in the judicial exercise
of his discretion or that, though there was no express misdirection, it must
be inferred because that was the only explanation of his award.
Under section 1, the applicant must satisfy the stringent criteria for grant
of leave to appeal laid down in The Nema (1982) AC 724. He would find that
difficult to do except in the most obvious case of a failure to exercise a
judicial discretion.
If the parties had not asked for a reasoned award they would almost
certainly be unable to appeal because they would not be able to satisfy the
criteria in section 1(6) for an order requiring the arbitrator to provide
reasons. They had each had an opportunity to ask for a reasoned award and it
was exceedingly unlikely in those circumstances that there would be any
'special reason' for not having made a request.
As pointed out by Lord Donaldson, the implication of Blexen was that the
same principles must be followed whether or not the arbitrators had given
reasons.
Where, as here, there had been a separate award on costs, the parties must
follow the procedures and requirements of section 1.
The procedure and remedy under section 22 might only be invoked where there
had been some excess of jurisdiction, some distinct element of misconduct or
procedural mishap, not simply some alleged unjudicial exercise of the
discretion.
Examples of such distinct misconduct could be making an award which went
outside the rival contentions of the parties, or making an award without
giving both parties an opportunity to be heard.
Where the costs award was included in a substantive award, if the award was
reasoned, Blexen must apply. If it was not reasoned continued use of the
different regime under section 22 would produce an unacceptable anomaly.
Therefore again the opinion of Lord Donaldson must be followed, and section
1 applied.
Where the complaint was some actual misconduct, such as breach of natural
justice, procedural mishap, excess of jurisdiction or failure to complete
the reference, for example by failing to deal with costs at all, a motion
under section 22 and/or 23 would still be appropriate.
Mr Simon for the charterers applied for leave to amend his proceedings to
include the appropriate application under section 1.
To avoid any question of whether the award was reasoned and whether the
court could look at the confidential reasons, the parties agreed that the
confidential reasons could be treated as the reasons in the final award. It
was therefore equivalent to a reasoned award.
The reasons disclosed no error of law.
It followed that the charterers' application for leave to appeal could not
succeed - nor would a motion under section 22 have succeeded.
To succeed on an application for leave to appeal from a costs award a party
would normally have to be prepared to satisfy the highest category of test
in The Nema, which was almost tantamount to persuading the court that the
appeal would almost certainly be successful.
Practitioners needed to take into account that the result of Blexen was not
only that a new procedure was to be followed in challenging a costs award,
but also that at the time of the arbitration hearing they would have to
consider whether they might want to challenge the costs decision, and
whether they should ask for reasons (with or without a separate hearing
and/or award on costs). In practice, it would probably be more difficult to
persuade a court to interfere with a costs decision under section 1 than it
was formerly under section 22.
For the charterer: Peregrine Simon (Gagrat Gardi &amp; Co).
For the shipowners: Dominic Kendrick (More Fisher Brown).

FT  03 APR 92 / Appointments: Trimming the shortlist at BAT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Martin Broughton, currently BAT Industries senior finance director, is to
take over responsibility for BAT's large financial services operation from
Brian Garraway who will be retiring later this year.
The promotion of Broughton (near right), 44, is part of a streamlining of
BAT's top management structure as the older executives led by chairman Sir
Patrick Sheehy, and deputy chairman Garraway, prepare to hand over to the
next generation. Brian Garraway will retire in October and Sir Patrick, who
has been chairman since 1982, is expected to step down sometime next year.
Although BAT has yet to name Sheehy's successor, the latest changes have
trimmed the shortlist. Broughton, who becomes managing director financial
services from July 1, is an obvious contender, as is Ulrich Herter (above
right), chairman of BAT Cigarettenfabriken, who becomes managing director,
tobacco. Herter, 50, joins the chairman's policy committee, BAT's key
executive body, as does David Alvey, 47, BAT's finance director.
Unlike Broughton, who joined British-American Tobacco as a travelling
auditor in 1971, Herter, a German marketing man, is a relatively recent
arrival only joining BAT's German subsidiary in 1984. Having studied
economics at Kiel University, he spent his early career with Martin
Brinkmann. Bernd Schweitzer, Herter's marketing director, will take over the
chairmanship of the German operation.
Broughton will succeed Garraway as chairman of Eagle Star and George
Greener, the Mars man who was hired as chief executive of Allied Dunbar last
September, will take over from Garraway as chairman of Allied Dunbar.
Greener also joins the BAT board.
*****
Alan Wheatley, the senior London partner of accountancy firm Price
Waterhouse, is taking over as chairman of 3i, the UK's biggest provider of
long-term capital to small and medium sized businesses.
3i has been looking for a chairman since the beginning of February, when Sir
John Cuckney said he would be stepping down at the end of July.
The other leading candidate for the chairman's post was Sir David Walker,
the chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, but he withdrew from
the race last month when he was appointed a deputy chairman of Lloyds Bank.
3i's chairman is chosen by its board and its leading shareholders, which are
the Bank of England and the UK clearing banks. Wheatley was Sir John's
preferred candidate who got him well in the mid-1980s when Wheatley drafted
a business strategy for Westland, the helicopter manufacturer then chaired
by Sir John.
Wheatley is a non-executive director of British Steel and was a deputy
chairman of Cable &amp; Wireless, the telecommunications group, until 1985. He
was appointed to the board of 3i last July.

FT  03 APR 92 / Management: Innocents abroad - Social Europe / National
borders being replaced with barriers for executives working in the EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD and CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Henke Lafebre is a partner in a Dutch firm of accountants who recently began
working in its London office. Yet under new European Community rules
intended to enhance his job opportunities in Europe, it will be at least six
months before he can audit UK companies. He believes that far from creating
a free market in labour, the new rules are a barrier. 'It is much harder for
me to qualify to work here than it would have been two years ago.'
Lafebre's experience is shared by many EC citizens coming to work in
Britain. That is because Britain has just swapped its traditionally liberal
approach towards accepting the qualifications of other EC countries for new,
harmonised, cross-border arrangements. It is thus easier for Britons to work
in the community but more difficult for continental European migrants to
work in the UK.
Freedom to work anywhere in the EC was one of the basic rights laid down in
the Treaty of Rome which established the European Economic Community in
1957. It is estimated that about 3m EC nationals work in other EC countries,
mainly in skilled manual, professional or managerial jobs.
The promotion of maximum mobility of workers has been a 'minimal' goal of
social Europe that even the non - interventionist UK Conservative government
has supported. Indeed, if the Conservatives win next week's general
election, initiatives to remove the remaining barriers to the free movement
of people are expected to be a central part of the UK's presidency of the EC
Council of Ministers later this year.
There are two main issues in EC labour mobility: the co-ordination of social
security systems - which affects all workers - and mutual recognition of
professional and craft qualifications.
There was some progress on the former, particularly on unemployment and
state pensions, in the early 1970s. A British worker claiming unemployment
benefit in France is entitled to the same treatment as a Frenchman. There
are, however, a host of practical problems, with different states
stipulating different periods before a person can claim entitlement to
benefit, for example.
The state pension rights of migrants are relatively straightforward. EC
provisions say that an individual must be paid a proportionate amount of his
or her state pension from the country of origin, plus a proportionate amount
of that of the host country, depending on the length of residence. This
creates winners and losers. In Italy where the state pension provision is
generous, immigrants often do well and Italian emigrants do correspondingly
badly when they go to countries with poorer state provision, like Britain.
The portability of occupational pensions is a bigger problem which affects
many better-paid migrant workers who belong to such schemes. Efforts to
harmonise such schemes were scuppered last year by the EC because pensions
are linked to taxation and therefore affect the sovereignity of member
states' taxation policies.
Migrants generally have to freeze occupational pensions in one country and
start a new one in the state to which they move. Watsons Europe, the
actuarial firm, estimates that around 150,000 managers are adversely
affected by the lack of harmonisation in EC pensions. But, says Watsons,
managers leaving one EC country to work in another can often negotiate
compensation for loss of pension rights with their new employer.
Portability of professional qualifications was identified by the EC in the
early 1970s as an area for action and initially, it was tackled profession
by profession. The approach was to compare the training required by each
member state for a given profession and, as far as possible, harmonise it.
This approach has proved slow and difficult and so far only covers jobs like
doctors, dentists, nurses, midwives, vets, pharmacists and architects. The
architects' directive took 17 years to agree.
In 1985 the Commission changed tack and introduced a directive laying down
the principle of mutual recognition of qualifications so that a professional
from one member state could become a member of the equivalent profession in
another without having to requalify. The directive is applicable to people
with at least three years' university-level education, plus any appropriate
job related training. It applies to most professionals.
So far just three member states - Ireland, Britain and Denmark - have passed
all the necessary national legislation to comply with the directive and the
European Commission has started legal proceedings against five other members
states for non-compliance.
It is too early to tell how efficiently the system will work. Some UK
professional associations say they are having trouble getting information
from their counterparts in the EC. They also say the tests in other states
are much harder and seem designed to keep people out rather than ease them
in. Several caveats in the directive give considerable power to the
specified national bodies which will assess applicants for recognition
within four months of receiving all the necessary papers.
Where there are significant differences in the training - as in accountancy
 -the host state can ask the incomer to sit a test or undergo an adaptation
period. Host states may also ask for evidence of professional experience
where education and training is a year short of the home member state. Both
these measures can hold up the free flow of professionals.
The Institute of Chartered Accountants in the UK requires Lafebre, the Dutch
accountant, to sit an exam in UK company and tax law to qualify as an
auditor. He applied to the Institute of Chartered Accountants, one of six
bodies competent to confer accreditation, last month. It will be at least
six months before he can qualify.
The Department of Trade and Industry argues that until now, although EC
nationals have been free to work in any community country, member states
were not obliged to recognise professional qualifications and many did not.
An accountant, it claims, would have needed 50 years to qualify to audit
throughout the community.
Britain has been a special case, adopting a more liberal approach to
recognising qualifications than other EC states. Although people like
Lafebre lose out, the new system is good for UK citizens who want to work in
the EC.
Finally, for skilled manual workers, a radical fillip to mobility will be
provided if a second general directive is ratified by the EC Council of
Ministers. This would give mutual recognition to qualifications of skilled
workers including the UK National Vocational Qualifications. Unlike most in
Europe, these are competence and not time-based.

FT  03 APR 92 / Management: Friends, Romans businessmen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ

<TEXT>
Few modern management concepts are as vague, yet promise as much, as the
'network organisation'. Among many other benefits, it claims to make
companies much more cost effective, faster, more flexible and more open -
what some business academics call 'borderless'. Yet evidence is mounting
that, at least in one of its various forms, the concept can be dangerous.
To most people, the word 'network' conjures up either the uninspiring image
of a series of linked computers, or the much more powerful one of a set of
close but informal relationships between individuals, whether within one
company or across several.
But to other people, the concept of networks stands mainly for a set of
links between companies: strategic alliances, joint ventures, co-operative
development deals, licensing collaborations, and so forth.
Of this corporate fraternity, one of the most advanced practitioners is
Olivetti, the Italian computer manufacturer. Its colourful chairman and
chief executive, Carlo de Benedetti, tends to wax lyrical about his belief
that the 'network corporation' as he calls it, is 'the reference model for
the future'.
Over the last decade, Olivetti has built up a network of alliances that,
relative to its size, is quite large even for the electronics industry,
which goes in for such arrangements more than most.
As Olivetti has been broadcasting to the world over the past fortnight, in a
series of curious-looking full page advertisements in this newspaper and
elsewhere, it has 229 alliances of various kinds at present. Their purpose,
it says in the advert, is to 'guarantee' a future not only of collaboration
(obviously), but also of independence.
But will they actually achieve this? One of the main purposes of the ad
campaign is to calm customers worried by Olivetti's inability so far to
strike a really significant deal with another computer company. It came
close to doing so a couple of years ago with both Philips and ICL, but each
of them found more powerful partnerships elsewhere.
Olivetti has been left trying noisily to make a virtue of its myriad of
smaller links, even though none of them assures it a future. Therein lies
the rub.
Unfortunately for Olivetti, its ad campaign coincides not only with the
widespread scepticism of many outside observers, but also with the
publication of an erudite book on alliances which warns against precisely
the sort of strategy which the company appears to be following*. The only
saving grace for the Italian company is that the book, by two Norwegian
business academics, Peter Lorange and Johan Roos, does not actually
criticise Olivetti by name. It is also written in a pretty impenetrable
style. But its message is still powerful.
The issue revolves around the relationship between alliances and another
powerful management concept, that of 'core competences'. This label refers
to a company's unique skills which give it a competitive edge.
It is pretty obvious that no company can survive for long without at least
one core competence: Honda's engine technology, for example, or Tetra Pak's
packaging skills.
Networks of strategic alliances can be used to reinforce a company's core
competences, or to exploit them, for instance through distribution deals.
But, as the Norwegians' book warns, woe betide the company which takes the
co-operation doctrine so far that it bases its core competences entirely on
alliances.
Until a few years ago, Olivetti still had a very obvious internal core
competence which gave it an edge against many of its rivals: its product and
manufacturing know-how in personal computers. But PC technology and software
are now virtual commodities.
Other Olivetti strengths lie in its undoubted edge in ergonomics and
industrial design. Its brand and distribution channels are also worth a
pretty penny. But none of these really ranks as a core competence on the
level of Apple's skills in user interfaces.
So whither Olivetti? Or will Olivetti indeed wither, to little more than a
brand and distribution channel for American and Japanese companies?
It is just possible that the company has discovered a managerial master-key
which enables it to extract more value than its rivals from the process of
forging alliances, exploiting and replacing them (most alliances are
temporary).
Its executives sometimes claim as much. But such a competence is extremely
intangible. It has not yet been expressed in a string of competitor-beating
systems.
Beneath its corporate rhetoric about alliances, the odds must be that
Olivetti would be just as relieved today as it almost was two years ago to
find a properly marriageable partner.
The independence of equity ownership on which it now places so much emphasis
is, after all, pretty irrelevant, given its dependence on the technology of
its allies.
Carlo de Benedetti should swallow that truth, and curb his mistaken
enthusiasm for the notion that co-operation is a viable strategy almost in
itself. It is not.
Other companies take note: you cannot live by alliances alone.

FT  03 APR 92 / Air passengers down 6.5% last year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of UK airline passengers fell 6.5 per cent last year to 98.5m
compared with 1990, reflecting the combined effects of the Gulf War, the
Yugoslav crisis and the recession, according to UK airport statistics
published yesterday by the Civil Aviation Authority.
It was the third decline in UK passenger numbers in the past 25 years. They
fell by 7.4 per cent in 1974 and by 0.1 per cent in 1981.
The overall number of UK air transport takeoffs and landings fell 3.9 per
cent last year after increasing 3.3 per cent in 1990. It was the largest
decline recorded in the past 25 years.
The CAA figures show that scheduled airline services from the UK to
continental Europe suffered worst from the setback in air travel, falling by
8.5 per cent last year. Charter services fell by 2.1 per cent. Air traffic,
however, has shown signs of a steady recovery since the beginning of this
year. Airline traffic in Europe continued to recover last month, according
to figures released yesterday by the Association of European Airlines.
The AEA, which groups 23 European airlines, said traffic lost during the
height of the Gulf crisis had been recouped.
The International Air Transport Association (Iata), which groups more than
200 airlines, said worldwide traffic continued to recover last month.
International passenger traffic increased 46 per cent in February compared
with the same month last year.
Mr Gunter Eser, IATA's director, emphasised that 'when looking at the
spectacular passenger-traffic growth rate for February, we must remember
that traffic in February 1991 was nearly 25 per cent less than in February
1990'.

FT  03 APR 92 / ITV agrees new commissioning procedure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ITV companies have agreed with the Office of Fair Trading to commission
programmes for the first seven months of next year under the old network
rules.
The commercial television companies' present way of commissioning programmes
has been registered as a restrictive practice but has not been sent to the
Restrictive Practices Court for investigation under competition law.
The agreement on the transitional programme commissioning arrangements
removes uncertainty facing both ITV and independent producers.
Details of the agreement and the structure of ITV for the 10 years from
January will be outlined early next week.
Agreement has been reached on everything from the rights of access of
independent production companies to the shape of the new central
commissioning system, which will spend about Pounds 550m a year.
Independent producers will be able to take ideas directly to the central
commissioning unit, but independently produced programmes will be contracted
for through ITV companies, which are the legal broadcasters under the 1990
act. The ITV companies will get a handling charge.
The move towards a central commissioning system represents an unprecedented
degree of centralisation in ITV. A senior figure is being sought to take on
responsibility for that function. The top job will be that of chief
executive, working with a director of programmes.

FT  03 APR 92 / Election 1992: Ashdown warns against minority government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MODERATE Conservative and Labour voters should deny both Mr John Major and
Mr Neil Kinnock the opportunity to form a minority government after the
election, Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, said last night.
He told a rally in Eastbourne, East Sussex, that neither Mr Major nor Mr
Kinnock would have the right to try to go it alone in a hung parliament, and
that pressure from within the Conservative or Labour party could ensure a
coalition government, involving the Liberal Democrats.
He reaffirmed that such a coalition would have to introduce a bill
authorising the introduction of proportional representation as a replacement
for the present first-past-the-post voting system in the first session of
the new parliament.
Mr Ashdown's speech came after a visit to Cornwall and Devon produced
evidence that Mr Major's warning that a vote for the Liberal Democrats could
put Mr Kinnock into 10 Downing Street could rebound on the Tories.
There were indications of Conservative candidates fearing that Labour
supporters could interpret the warning as encouragement to switch to the
Liberal Democrats.
As soon as Mr Ashdown crossed the River Tamar into the Cornwall South East
constituency, Liberal Democrat activists assured him that they were poised
to repeat their February 1974 victory, when a combination of Tory defectors
and tactical voting by Labour supporters defeated Mr Robert Hicks, the
sitting Conservative.
Mr Hicks regained the seat in October 1974 and has held it since, but his
confidence that he will beat off the Liberal Democrat challenge next
Thursday does not appear to be shared by some of his party workers.
Buoyed by favourable reports from other Cornish conmstituencies, Mr Ashdown
brushed aside statements by Mr Major that he would never be a party to
introducing proportional representation - the Liberal Democrats' key
objective.
Mr Ashdown, buoyed by the findings of recent opinion polls and the response
he has received on his nationwide election tour, told a rally in Eastbourne
last night that a vote to replace Mr Major with Mr Kinnock would not be
enough.
He dismissed Labour's slogan 'time for change' and said Mr Kinnock was not
seeking 'real change'.
Mr Ashdown added that a Labour victory would be a return to the old system
with a 'gang of playground bullies' using their strength to grab Buggins'
turn to do whatever they like.
It would be a return to so-called 'strong government' which refused to
accept the verdict of the ballot box and told people they had wasted their
votes.
Mr Ashdown described the poll tax as a 'cocktail of mishap, miscalculation
and mayhem' dispensed by Mrs Margaret Thatcher because 'the lady loved her
power - and loved it absolutely'.
He warned that a Labour government would also be likely to abuse unfettered
power.
Mr Ashdown called on Mr Kinnock to stop 'wobbling on the fence' and make it
clear whether he would support the introduction of proportional
representation. He declared that the Liberal Democrats would insist that
next week's election would be the last to be held in Britain on 'our unfair,
out-of-date and inefficient voting system'.

LABOUR'S first Budget would be accompanied by a 'green book' setting out the
environmental impact of the measures proposed - the environmental equivalent
of the traditional red book, which outlines the financial consequences of
Budget measures.
Mrs Ann Taylor, Labour's environment protection spokeswoman, said yesterday
that the environmental implications of all other proposed legislation would
also be clearly set out.
Labour wants to make environmental considerations part of the machinery of
government. Measures of this type have long been advocated by 'green'
pressure groups.
The undertakings are in Labour's environmental programme, A Clean Start,
published yesterday. It lists 18 proposals the party would put into action
in the first 50 days in office.
It is proposed that the regulators of the gas and electricity companies
would impose obligations on them to become 'energy services companies rather
than businesses whose profits come from maximising energy sales.'
Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, promised a new environmental
protection agency to set and 'rigorously enforce' pollution standards.

FT  03 APR 92 / World Trade News: When Japan finds two's company, more a
crowd - The pressure for bilateral deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON and NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN the US and Japan recently reviewed a co-operative financing programme
in which Japanese money helps US companies to win third-country contracts,
Mr John Macomber, the US Eximbank chairman, lauded Tokyo for a 'tremendous'
contribution that had led to better bilateral relations.
But the co-operative programme, which has seen joint project financing of
about Dollars 3bn in the past year, has also prompted questions about
Japan's fondness for bilateral agreements and its commitment to the
principle of multilateral trade.
The European Community has criticised the US-Japan semiconductor pact and
the Structural Impediments Initiative (SII), among other bilateral
agreements, while the lowering of Japan's 'voluntary' ceiling on car exports
to the US also drew attention to Tokyo's apparent willingness to give in to
Washington.
On co-operative financing, Mr Iwao Okamoto, the executive director of export
insurance at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti), said
that the agreement was 'not in any way exclusive', and the reason Japan has
such co-operation with only the US is that 'we have not received approaches
from other countries'.
Third country concerns over Japan's willingness to do bilateral deals at the
expense of multilateral trade were heightened during President Bush's visit
to Tokyo in January
which resulted in a target for Japanese companies' purchases of US-made car
parts and a widespread fear that the two countries had set an important
precedent for managed trade. European car makers complained at the time, but
the strongest criticism in recent weeks has come from Australia, which
claims that its parts suppliers are unfairly losing out to US companies.
Austrade, the Australian government trade body, has formally warned Tokyo
over 'two to three' recent cases in which Japanese car makers have allegedly
switched sourcing to US companies as a result of trade pressure from
Washington. And Mr John Button, Australia's industry minister, said 'we
would be concerned if trade is going to be based on political considerations
rather than commercial ones'.
But Japanese officials insist they are as uneasy as their trading partners
about bilateralism, and that the country is a firm believer in the benefits
of multilateral trade.
Mr Noboru Hatakeyama, the ministry for international trade and industry
vice-minister for international affairs, said Japan's commitment to the
success of multilateral negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade was shown when it was one of only five countries to meet Gatt
deadlines last month for the submission of tariff reductions on manufactured
and agricultural products.
A senior Japanese trade official said agreements such as that with the US on
car components were an unwanted result of the 'special pressures' arising
from the importance of the two countries' relationship.
He and other Japanese trade negotiators insist that, while SII and the pact
on semiconductor market share are the result of bilateral negotiations, the
carefully worded agreements do not provide specific benefits for US
companies. For instance, the chip pact, again becoming an issue in
Washington, calls for a 20 per cent 'foreign' share of the Japanese market
by the end of this year.
But, as with another agreement on foreign access to the construction market,
Japanese companies sometimes interpret such pacts as an indication that they
should 'buy American' in the interests of reducing trade tension and of
ensuring the US market remains open to Japanese products. Miti, however,
publicly insists that companies should make 'commercial decisions' on
foreign procurement.
In defending the country's multilateral reputation, Japanese officials point
to the extensive work done on new areas such as trade-related investment
measures (Trims) and trade-related intellectual property (Trips) as part of
the Uruguay Round. Tokyo submitted a landmark discussion paper three years
ago on trade-related investment, and has provided detailed submissions in
the debate on intellectual property.
And the Japanese government said yesterday that it wants to end a bilateral
agreement under which the US is able to monitor equipment procurement by
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp (NTT). The agreement, reached in 1980
when NTT was state-owned, has been renewed every three years since then, but
Tokyo argues that the Gatt provides sufficient guarantee of a fair
procurement process.
These often difficult to digest contributions tend to be overlooked when the
political focus is on Japanese trade statistics. Meanwhile, Tokyo has also
been accused by some developing nations of trying to tear down the sorts of
investment and trade barriers used to shield its industries during the
formative years after the war.
US and Japanese negotiators missed a March 31 deadline to finish a market
access agreement for foreign paper exports, but talks continued late into
Wednesday night, writes Nancy Dunne in Washington.
As part of an 'action plan' negotiated during President George Bush's trip
to Japan in January, the Japan Fair Trade Commission was to present a survey
of competitive conditions in the paper sector before March 31.
Under Miti's Business Global Partnership Initiative, the National Paper
Merchants Association announced a voluntary plan to develop business
relations with foreign paper producers and 37 Japanese paper distribution
companies.
In 1990, imports accounted for only 3.7 per cent of Japanese paper and
paperboard consumption compared with 31 per cent in the EC and nearly 15 per
cent in the US.

NEW ORDERS for manufactured goods in the US rose by 0.5 per cent in February
to register their second consecutive monthly increase, the Commerce
Department said yesterday.
Shipments of goods were up 2.1 per cent - the 10th increase in the past 11
months.
Inventories - stocks of unsold goods - fell for the fifth month, dropping to
their lowest level for three years.
This suggested that companies will have to increase production so as to meet
rising demand.
The rise in orders followed a 0.5 per cent increase in January and a 3.7 per
cent decline in December. Orders in February were 0.2 per cent higher than
in the equivalent month last year.
Orders for durable goods, however, fell 0.3 per cent in February, compared
with January. Excluding defence, new orders were up by 1 per cent.
The orders figures were seen as broadly consistent with a batch of reports
pointing to a revival of consumer and business demand since Christmas.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE White House yesterday issued new regulations to ease lending conditions
for real estate and to let 'well-capitalised' savings and loan institutions
open branches in any US state.
The Bush administration acted after both Democrats and Republicans in
Congress had defied their leaders late on Wednesday by failing to approve
Dollars 17bn in funding to liquidate bankrupt savings and loans bodies
(known as thrifts) and pay off their depositors.
The White House said the country 'can no longer afford to wait for Congress
to act' on proposed legislation to allow inter-state branches. It claimed
the authority to act unilaterally and said its moves would 'enhance the
ability of banks and thrifts to make loans.'
Under the new rules, the amount of capital that banks and thrifts must hold
'against conservatively underwritten loans for construction of pre-sold
homes' is reduced. Also, the threshold for requiring licensed appraisals on
loans secured by real estate is raised from Dollars 50,000 to Dollars
100,000.
Mr Michael Waldman, director of Mr Ralph Nader's Congress Watch, a citizens'
group, said the White House was repeating its tactics of 1988, when it
loosened rules and standards for S&amp;Ls: 'The White House is using the
regulatory apparatus as an arm of the campaign committee and the result will
be huge tax-payer costs. It's a little injection of extra debt and looseness
which makes you feel great at first, then there is a huge hangover.'
The administration's action contrasted with the paralysis in Congress, where
a majority of each party contributed to a 298:125 vote against a White
House-backed measure to fund continued S&amp;L rescues with Dollars 17m.
Democrats, concerned that the bill did not contain regulatory reforms,
joined many Republicans who had argued that many of the thrifts still can be
saved.
Members of both parties are worried about the S&amp;L issue in the Congressional
and presidential election campaigns this year. But they are also fully aware
that, the thrift crisis having been ignored four years ago, before the last
presidential election, the estimated cost of the rescue ballooned to
hundreds of billions of dollars.
Congressman Henry Gonzalez, chairman of the House Banking Committee,
complained that the White House had made only 'minimal' effort to lobby for
its own bill.

A SIMMERING trade row between Australia and the US flared again yesterday
when Canberra responded sharply to criticism from Mrs Carla Hills, the US
trade representative.
Senator Gareth Evans, Australian foreign minister, said a report to the US
Congress by Mrs Hills was inaccurate.
The report had said trade was distorted by tariffs, customs valuation
practices, export incentives and subsidies.
Senator Evans said the US had been told 'vigorously' that the allegations
were denied by Australia, which has substantially reduced tariff protection
over the last decade.
He said many US trade practices were 'unquestionably unfair,' especially in
areas such as agriculture which were of crucial importance to Australian
exporters.
'There is only so much that we can put up with by way of double standards
from the US. We do not accept these. . . allegations lying down,' Senator
Evans said.
His comments follow a series of complaints by Australia about lack of access
to the US market, notably in relation to sugar and dairy products, which
Canberra claims are virtually closed to imports.
Canberra also accuses Washington of using subsidies to poach its Middle East
markets for unsubsidised wheat exports.
The US says its subsidies are intended to combat subsidised exports from the
European Community.

FT  03 APR 92 / EC oil 'breaking embargo on Haiti'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, KINGSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US administration has complained to European Community governments that
shipments of oil from Europe are undermining an embargo aimed at restoring
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power in Haiti.
The embargo was established by the Organisation of American States after the
military overthrow of Fr Aristide six months ago.
But significant shipments of oil, mainly from Europe, have rendered much of
the embargo ineffective and are seen by the US State Department as lifting
the coup leaders' confidence in their ability to resist international
pressure.
'The latest information we have is that there are more tankers in the
harbour than they can unload,' said a senior state department official.
Shipments had come from France, Britain, Germany and other countries.
Sanctions by the EC would be useful in keeping pressure on the government in
Port au Prince, the official said. However, when the US had made
representations to EC governments, 'we were given all sorts of reasons why
sanctions were not possible.'
For example, the US was told that European sanctions would require six
months' notice of implementation under the terms of the Lome convention,
which grants developing countries privileged access to EC markets.
The latest known oil deliveries to Haiti were 10 days ago by two vessels
under the Norwegian and Danish flags. They unloaded fuel products expected
to last three weeks.
An even steadier supply of goods for Haiti has been crossing its border with
the Dominican Republic. Trade in petrol and other fuels, food and consumer
durables has become a lucrative venture for the Dominican military, despite
the government's public adherence to the embargo.

GREECE has awarded a Dr50bn (Pounds 152m) contract for a dam and tunnel
project, to boost the Athens water supply, to a Greek-Austrian-Italian
consortium of construction companies, writes Kerin Hope in Athens.
The consortium consists of three Greek companies, Aegek, Domika Erga and
Meton, together with Jager of Austria and Seli of Italy. The public works
ministry said Aegek and its partners submitted the lowest bid among six
contenders.
The project calls for a 90-metre high earth dam across the Evinos river in
central Greece, together with a 30 km rock-cut tunnel to feed the Mornos
reservoir north-west of the capital.
The ministry said work would begin in the next two months, with completion
due by the end of 1995. The Greek state investment budget will initially
finance the project, but negotiations are under way to secure additional
funding from the European Community, a ministry official said.
The Evinos project was planned to come on stream in the mid-1980s but was
postponed because of a funding squeeze.
A sharp decline in winter rainfall in recent years means Athens faces a
severe water shortage at a time when demand is increasing by 8 per cent
yearly, according to the city water company. At present, the Mornos
reservoir contains only five months' supply of water. The government may
have to revive an emergency plan to bring water by truck from the Evinos if
rainfall is light again this spring.

THE president of Venezuela's central bank, Mr Miguel Rodriguez, has resigned
in an effort to ease political pressure on the beleagured government of
President Carlos Andres Perez.
He named, late on Wednesday, Ms Ruth de Krivoy, a respected economist and
the first woman to hold the job, to head the central bank.
Mr Rodriguez, who only took the post in late February, had come under attack
from Mr Perez's opponents.
The outgoing central bank chief was the main architect of the highly
unpopular economic reform programme the Perez government initiated three
years ago.
It is not clear, however, whether his departure will much reduce pressure on
the president and on other free-market proponents in the cabinet.
Ms de Krivoy held an executive post in the central bank in the 1970s, but
has spent most of her professional life as a private sector economist.

FT  03 APR 92 / World Trade News: Dunkel confirms missed deadline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Easter deadline to complete the Uruguay Round of talks on world trade
liberalisation will be missed, Mr Arthur Dunkel, director general of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), confirmed yesterday.
He argued that the negotiations, which began in 1986, were 'past the point
of no return.' He insisted the trade reforms would be prominent on the
agenda of the Group of Seven summit in Munich in June if no settlement had
been reached by then.
The Easter deadline, set in December when he released a 400-page draft
Uruguay Round agreement, is the latest of many to be missed. Mr Dunkel
referred to a 'growing sense of frustration and urgency' among negotiators
in Geneva as differences over farm trade reform have put the entire
agreement in jeopardy. After the Easter deadline the US no longer has enough
legislative days left in its Congressional calendar to win approval for the
agreement ahead of presidential elections in November.
Speaking in Paris at a conference on world trade and investment organised by
the International Chamber of Commerce and the International Herald Tribune,
Mr Dunkel said that in spite of failure to reach agreement, each deadline
'had produced some results.'
'It is a very difficult, painful and complicated stage. Negotiations are
still moving forwards. We are not blocked.'
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who had talks with President Bush in Washington two
weeks ago in an effort to pave the way to a Uruguay Round agreement, will be
host to the Munich summit, and has made it clear he wants the agreement
settled before then.
Negotiators are now confident that necessary compromises are possible in all
areas under negotiation - including services and market access - except farm
trade. US officials, who also speak in this context for many farm product
exporters in the third world, insist that the European Community must make
cuts to the volume of subsidised exports dumped on world markets.

FT  03 APR 92 / Clash of the sound-bite slickers: The 'huckster' factor in
New York's Democratic party primary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS billed in advance as the great, much-needed policy debate on the
crisis facing urban America. And there could be no more fitting location for
it than New York, a city whose social fabric is being rent by 'crack',
violent crime and Aids, and where teenagers have taken to shooting each
other in the school room.
But so far the crucial Democratic primary race in New York has had
difficulty rising above the relentlessly personal or trivial. This both
confirms the city's reputation as a political circus and spells an uphill
battle for Mr Bill Clinton, the governor of the southern state of Arkansas
and front-runner for the presidential nomination.
Winning in New York next Tuesday is vital for Mr Clinton, yet his campaign
here has got off to a rocky start, dogged by two big problems.
First, there remain persistent doubts among voters about his character,
fanned by microscopic attention to his past from local television and a
hostile tabloid press.
New Yorkers, for all their supposed cosmopolitanism, tend crudely to divide
their southern countrymen into two categories: hicks and hucksters. And Mr
Clinton, with his bouffant hairstyle and mouth seemingly stuck in a smirk,
looks to many like a representative of the latter category, or a dubious
Southern tele-evansensible, detailed policy documents he may brandish before
the voters.
The governor has not helped by his confession in the middle of the campaign
that he smoked marijuana in Britain more than 20 years ago. This was in
itself trivial, but it made his previous pat answer to drug questions - that
he had never broken US laws - seem evasive and equivocal. He is, in short,
having a hard time difficulty shaking off his tabloid image as a sly,
slippery 'Slick Willie'.
His second problem is that Mr Jerry Brown, the former governor of California
and Mr Clinton's sole remaining official adversary, has fought a skilful
campaign. His populist rhetoric, ruthless tarring of Mr Clinton, and command
of the 10-second sound bite have turned him from a mildly dotty fringe
candidate into a serious challenger.
Victory in New York is important in part because the state has the
second-largest count of delegates (after California) at the Democratic
National Convention, which will choose the party's presidential candidate.
And New York City, with its extraordinarily diverse ethnic mix, is often
seen as an acid test of a candidate's national stature.
Not for nothing did Mr Clinton deliver a major foreign policy speech in
Manhattan this week.
New Yorkers, proud of the city's reputation for political toughness, would
like to think that no candidate can fail here and go on to win the
nomination, but that is typical New York hype. After all, Mr Jimmy Carter
(another Southerner) came a dismal third here in 1976. And Mr Clinton has
come to New York with almost half the delegates needed to sew up the
nomination.
Just a few weeks ago Mr Clinton seemed all but assured of victory in New
York after strong wins in the key Midwest states of Illinois and Michigan,
and the withdrawal from the campaign of New England's Mr Paul Tsongas.
But then Mr Brown won a surprise victory in the small north-eastern state of
Connecticut, amid polls showing that almost 50 per cent of local Democrats
questioned whether Mr Clinton had the honesty to be an effective president.
With the media continuing to question Mr Clinton's marital fidelity, Vietnam
draft status and ethical record, New York suddenly became a key test of the
governor's character.
Mr Brown has ruthlessly capitalised on this, accusing Mr Clinton of
delivering a 'big lie a day', and branding him as the friend of Wall Street
and the slick, unacceptable face of politics-as-usual.
'I am running,' he says, 'against a candidate who is the very symbol and
personification of a system and politics that doesn't work.'
This is extremely galling for Mr Clinton, whose preferred image is of a
new-age Democrat operating outside the traditional party hierarchy. But Mr
Brown's tactics have been effective, allowing him to capitalise on a
groundswell of bitter cynicism among ordinary US voters towards conventional
politics.
New York's bewildering ethnic mix means that any politician campaigning here
faces an extremely delicate balancing act. So far both candidates have
avoided any serious gaffes, but Mr Clinton appears to be well ahead in
winning the backing of Jews, who account for about 30 per cent of the
primary vote, thanks partly to his attacks on President Bush's tough new
policy towards Israel.
The important black, Hispanic and labour constituencies look more divided.
Mr Brown has appeared on the same platform several times with Mr Jesse
Jackson, the black former presidential candidate, and has invited him to be
his running mate.
The latest opinion poll suggests that Mr Clinton is ahead, but a large
number of voters appear undecided and there remains a significant wild card
in the form of Mr Tsongas, whose name remains on the New York ballot. As a
favourite son of the north east, he could yet attract a significant
Anyone-But-Clinton vote and wreak considerable damage on the Southerner.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KENYA'S opposition stepped up the pressure on President Daniel arap Moi
yesterday as a general strike, called to force the government to release
political prisoners and secure an early general election, kept most Nairobi
workers at home.
Clouds of black smoke hung over slum areas in Nairobi as youths, exploiting
the opposition's call for a peaceful strike, burned rubber tyres, set up
roadblocks and clashed with anti-riot police. State-owned buses and private
cars were stoned and burned to prevent commuters going to work.
Despite the violence about 40 per cent of Nairobi's workforce reached the
city and some shops opened at midday.
Most Asian businesses, however, remained closed after a series of fires
early yesterday destroyed houses and shops in the Asian commercial districts
of the city.
Opposition leaders in Nairobi claimed the action had been a 'huge success'.
Mr Paul Muite, a leading member of the Forum for the Restoration of
Democracy (Ford), the main opposition movement, said in London last night
that the strike would continue today.
He warned that Ford was prepared to mount a civil disobedience campaign if
the government failed to provide a timetable for an early general election,
monitored by observers from the Commonwealth and other organisations.
'We regret the need for such a campaign,' said Mr Muite, a Nairobi lawyer,
'but our calls for dialogue with the government have been ignored. Although
this strike is for two days, the next time it will be indefinite.'
Ford has called for the establishment of an independent electoral
commission, and speedy completion of a new electoral register.
Western diplomats said the day-long clashes added to concerns that Kenya's
transition to multi-party democracy was becoming jeopardised by violence.
Running battles continued throughout the day in the shanty towns of Kangemi,
Kawangware and Satellite as paramilitary police used tear gas and live
ammunition to disperse the rioters.
Several people were beaten by police wielding batons and pickaxe handles.
Yesterday's events mark the continuing threat of a descent into violence of
Kenya's precarious transition to political pluralism.

FT  03 APR 92 / Trade deficit presages tough year for Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Indonesian government posted a Rupiah 1,500bn (Pounds 426m) surplus in
the state budget for the financial year which ended on Tuesday, Mr Johannes
Sumarlin, finance minister, said. Bankers and donor economists warn,
however, that an Dollars 83m (Pounds 48m) trade deficit in January indicates
a tough year ahead for the economy.
The 1991-92 budget figures, which are preliminary, put government revenue at
Rp52,000bn, marginally above the Rp50,500bn target. Total government
expenditure, the minister said, amounted to Rp50,490bn.
Mr Sumarlin, speaking after the monthly cabinet meeting on the economy, said
that income tax revenue of Rp9,600bn was 19.4 per cent higher than forecast,
while revenue from value added tax was also above target. Import duty and
export tax revenue was below target, partly because of a reduction in import
tariffs, the minister said.
Foreign aid flows for the fiscal year amounted to Rp10,400bn while oil and
gas sector revenue of Rp15,000bn was as forecast, with oil production
averaging 1.56m barrels a day.
Mr Sumarlin noted, however, that figures for January showed a 37 per cent
year-on-year decline in oil and gas receipts, whilst in the same month
Indonesia recorded an overall trade deficit, with imports of Dollars 2.2bn
and exports of Dollars 2.12bn.
Although the January trade deficit was small, Indonesia needs to maintain a
substantial trade surplus if it is to counter invisible outflows (such as
interest payments on debt) estimated by bankers in Jakarta at more than
Dollars 6bn last year. Despite the government's budget surplus, Indonesia
had a current account deficit in 1991 of about Dollars 4.5bn.
January's trade deficit was 'very unhealthy', according to one banker, and
evidence that the economic downturn in western economies was hitting
Indonesia's export-oriented industries.
Economists at donor agencies warn of a tough financial year ahead, despite
maintaining a forecast of 5.8 per cent real economic growth. They express
concern at Indonesia's external debt which has increased from Dollars 65bn a
year ago to Dollars 75bn. Of this, Dollars 50bn is in public debt, and
Dollars 25bn in private debt, which has grown most rapidly in recent years.
They note, however, that there is no public short-term debt, and the
government remains committed to its debt obligations. The rise is also
partly offset by an increase in Indonesia's foreign reserves from Dollars
6.3bn in March 1990 to Dollars 10bn last November. The government has acted
to restrict further overseas borrowing by rescheduling many capital
intensive projects.
A further growth in exports is needed if the public debt service ratio,
estimated by donor agencies at 31 per cent of export earnings and described
by a senior economist as 'very high', is to be alleviated.
The January trade deficit bolsters recent complaints by industrialists that
Indonesia is losing its competitive edge in export markets. They blame the
government's tight monetary policy, designed to limit domestic credit. The
banks' prime lending rate is currently 25 per cent a year, and
industrialists say the high cost of funds has left an increasing number of
companies operating at a loss.

FT  03 APR 92 / Much of Europe and Libya look set for business as usual:
Neither side can afford to drag oil into tit-for-tat sanctions threats over
Tripoli's alleged role in airliner bombing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON, ROBERT GRAHAM, IAN RODGER, PETER BRUCE and CHRISTOPHER
PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COLONEL Muammer Gadaffi's reported threat to halt trade with countries
imposing United Nations sanctions against Libya would, if carried out, be a
severe blow to several European countries which depend on the country's
particularly light, low-sulphur crude oil.
But since 80 per cent of Libya's gross domestic product derives from trade,
and 97 per cent of its trade is oil exports, mostly to Europe, few analysts
believe Col Gadaffi could afford to enact any self-imposed oil export
embargo. Libya's oil revenues are roughly Dollars 9bn a year.
Indeed, yesterday journalists from Europeo, the Italian magazine in which
Col Gadaffi was reported to have made the threat of a retaliatory trade
embargo, denied that the Libyan leader had specifically mentioned a cut-off
of oil at all. 'Gadaffi did not actually pronounce those words,' said a
Europeo spokesman.
However, the dependence of some European countries on Libyan crude also
makes it certain that they would oppose any tightening of sanctions against
Tripoli to include a trade embargo against a supplier of rare crudes and
easily reachable across the Mediterranean.
According to oil industry officials, Italy, Germany and Spain privately made
it clear to the US in November, when the furore over Libya's alleged role in
the Lockerbie bombing came to a head, that they would not back a trade
embargo against Tripoli. Their non-compliance would make any such embargo
toothless.
Libya sells 95 per cent of its oil and petroleum products to Europe, mostly
to Italy, Germany, Spain, France and the UK - its five main trading partners
 -a total of 1.33m barrels a day. There is no trade with the US since
Washington imposed its own trade embargo in 1986, again over alleged Libyan
complicity in a terrorist attack.
Moreover, the oil imported is of a light, sweet quality upon which several
refineries in Italy, Germany and Spain depend and it would be extremely
difficult for these countries to replace the oil.
Although the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries is producing a
surfeit of oil, extra capacity is only available generally in high-sulphur,
heavy crudes. 'You cannot say there is any spare light, sweet crude capacity
in the market,' says one analyst. 'Most light, sweet producers are operating
to capacity.'
Italy is at most risk from any threat of halting oil sales and other
commercial activity and is viewing with concern the international
community's worsening relations with Libya. Italy imports 27 per cent of its
crude from Libya and is the country's principal EC trading partner.
Rome has given its full backing to the UN resolutions penalising Libya for
failing to hand over the two suspects in the Lockerbie bombing; but in
private Italian officials have been urging caution and the need to avoid a
break-down in communications with Tripoli.
Italian ambivalence underlines official fears that Italy risks suffering far
more from any Libyan retaliatory measures than Britain, France or the US,
which have pressed hardest for sanctions.
Last year Italy imported 17.4m tonnes of crude from Libya worth L5,480bn
(Pounds 2.54bn), a 2 per cent drop in volume on the previous year but still
27.6 per cent of total oil imports. This is more than double the oil
imported by Libya's next largest European client, Germany. It also
represents 41 per cent of total Libyan oil sales.
At the same time Italian companies, notably via ENI, the state oil concern,
are involved in all aspects of the Libyan industry from exploration and
production through to construction of refineries.
Italy is studying the possibility of importing gas from a Libyan offshore
field via a pipeline to Sicily. Libya is also a useful market for a wide
range of Italian consumer and industrial goods which last year increased 30
per cent to L1,687bn. Alitalia, the national carrier, transported 17.6m
tonnes of goods by air freight last year and more than 31,000 passengers;
and the Tripoli-Rome air link is regarded as one of Libya's most important
air connections.
Spanish officials are also watching anxiously. Libya supplies Spain with
about 10 per cent of its imported crude, though this is decreasing as
Spain's three refiners have begun to secure their own upstream supplies.
But about 19 per cent of the liquefied natural gas (LNG) Spain imports is
Libyan. Barcelona and much of the rich industrial territory around it are
heavily dependent on Libyan LNG, which is supplied under long-term contracts
the Spanish have with Tripoli and Algiers.
Spanish diplomats were warning yesterday that any decision to increase
pressure on Tripoli would place Spain in a difficult position. 'We would be
very concerned if these sanctions were hardened into a full economic
embargo,' one official said.
Germany, which depends on Libya for 16 per cent of its oil imports, appeared
relatively unperturbed by Libyan threats. 'We have been dealing with Gadaffi
since 1958 and we have been though our share of bilateral and multilateral
quarrels, and not once has he interfered with our supplies,' one industry
leader said yesterday.
The economics ministry was equally sanguine. 'We expect no supply problems,'
an official said. 'There is no shortage of oil on offer, although we cannot
of course rule out price repercussions.'
Swiss officials were equally unflustered. Libya supplies 15 per cent of the
country's 2.6m tonnes of annual crude imports. 'If it had come a year or so
ago, I would have said it was very serious,' Mr Baptist Gehr, economic
adviser of the Swiss Petroleum Association, said yesterday.
Since then, Libyan interests have invested heavily in oil refining and
distribution activities in Switzerland, and so Mr Gehr thinks it unlikely
that the Libyan government would want to damage its own operations. 'I think
it is unlikely that after all this investment Libya will then refuse to
supply us,' he said.
In June 1990, Tamoil (Suisse), a Libyan controlled consortium, purchased a
65 per cent stake in Gatoil, Switzerland's fourth-largest oil company then
in bankruptcy administration, for SFr201.25m (Pounds 77.7m). It later bought
the remaining 35 per cent stake from Sasea Holding, the investment banking
group headed by Mr Florio Fiorini.
Britain, despite having severed diplomatic links with Libya, also imported
1.6m tonnes of Libyan refined petroleum products in 1991 while exporting
Pounds 255m worth of goods, mainly machinery, to Libya. But given Britain's
own domestic supplies of light oil and its political determination to bring
the Lockerbie suspects to justice, the UK would likely not be as worried
about a Libyan oil ban - imposed either from without or within.

FT  03 APR 92 / Shipping checks come under fire in Australia
</HEADLINE>

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN INQUIRY into the loss of a Greek oil tanker off the Western Australian
coast has revealed 'substantial and graphic' evidence of deficiencies in
international checks on shipping, the Australian government said yesterday.
Senator Bob Collins, the shipping minister, said an inquiry by the
government's marine accident investigation unit showed that the 22-year-old
Kirki should never have been at sea.
The Kirki lost its bow in heavy seas in July last year, about 55 miles off
the north coast of Western Australia.
Senator Collins said the inquiry found evidence of deliberate efforts to
make the ship look seaworthy. 'I personally saw a number of the plates, and
they were so thin you could have shaved with them,' he said.
'It had got to the stage where entire sections of steel had corroded out and
had been deliberately covered up with a piece of canvas that had then been
painted over to make it look as though the original steel was still there.'
The inquiry also found serious deficiencies in the Kirki's safety equipment.
It said many of the crew could have lost their lives if the accident had
happened further out to sea.
Senator Collins said the government was pursuing the 'international scandal'
of unsafe shipping with the International Maritime Organisation, the UN
agency.
Most structural surveys on ships are carried out by classification societies
based in the leading maritime countries, which maintain inspectors in many
of the world's ports.
The larger societies, such as Lloyd's Register in London, are regarded as
highly capable. However, there has long been concern about some of the
smaller societies.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, yesterday met leaders of the
securities industry in an attempt to bolster confidence as share prices slid
to another five-year low.
The unusual meeting was the latest sign of rising alarm among politicians
over a persistent decline in the stock market. Mr Miyazawa warned that
recovery of Japan's rapidly slowing economy could be jeopardised unless the
market rallies.
The meeting amounts to a recognition that neither the government's emergency
economic package announced on Tuesday nor Wednesday's cut in the official
discount rate have yet had their desired effect of restoring business
confidence.
Mr Miyazawa nonetheless had nothing to offer the markets beyond suggestions
that the securities industry make greater efforts to restore investor
confidence. The meeting is likely only to reinforce investor fears that the
government is not prepared to take concrete measures to support the market.
The Nikkei average of 225 leading shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange plunged
to nearly 18,000 before partially recovering to close at 18,286.03, off
295.76 on the day. The market continued to slide in spite of Wednesday's
three-quarter point cut in the official discount rate to 3.75 per cent and
the package of emergency economic measures announced by the government on
Tuesday.
Pessimism spilled into other markets as well, with both the yen and
government bonds falling sharply.
Mr Miyazawa met Mr Shogo Watanabe, chairman of the Japan Securities Dealers
Association, and Mr Minoru Nagaoka, president of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
Elsewhere Mr Tamisuke Watanuki, secretary general of the ruling Liberal
Democratic party, and other LDP leaders said the party was preparing
legislation that would help boost the market by allowing companies to
purchase their own shares. Meanwhile, a steep decline in car sales in March
was reported yesterday by the Japan Automobile Dealers Association (Jada),
adding to the accumulating evidence that Japan's economy is slowing sharply.
March sales declined by 6.5 per cent compared to a year ago to 694,520
units, Jada said in a preliminary report. For the first three months of the
year, sales were down by 4.3 per cent.
The Jada report nonetheless contained a slice of good news for the industry.
Sales of cars with engines larger than 2 litres, which are more expensive
and profitable, rose by 40.8 per cent to 86,632 units in March. Small cars
(excluding minicars) were hit hardest, with sales down 15 per cent to
404,954 units.
Meanwhile, a report by the Economic Planning Agency issued yesterday showed
that plant and equipment investment by Japanese companies would rise by an
average of 4.6 per cent in the next three years, compared to an average rise
of 10.6 per cent in the past three years.
A main reason for the decline was the difficulty companies have raising
funds on the depressed stock market, according to a survey of companies.
The EPA report also said that investment in labour saving equipment and
spending on research and development were affected by interest rate
movements. Many analysts had assumed that these areas of investment were
relatively unaffected by financial market trends.

FT  03 APR 92 / UN pressure on Afghan factions

<TEXT>
A UNITED Nations representative yesterday stepped up pressure on warring
factions in Afghanistan, less than a month before a representative assembly
of Afghans is to meet to discuss a transitional government.
Mr Benon Sevan, personal representative for Afghanistan of Mr Boutros
Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general - in Islamabad after his second
visit this week to Kabul - called those who sought a military victory
'arsonists' for whom there was no longer room.
With international help, Mr Sevan said, 'we shall be able to resolve the
Afghan conflict peacefully and now, not next month, this month.'
Western diplomats are cautious in their optimism about prospects for an end
to the 14-year war. Last month Afghan President Najibullah agreed to step
down and pave the way for transferring power to an interim government.
A UN-backed assembly of representatives of Afghan groups is due to be held
by the end of this month, either in Geneva or in Vienna, as a first step
towards making arrangements for a transitional government.
Reuter adds from Kabul: Mr Najibullah sought to speed up the peace process
in Afghanistan when he met Mr Sevan yesterday, a presidential spokesman
said.
Mr Najibullah's announcement two weeks ago that he would not take part
coincided with his loss of Mazar-i-Sharif, the biggest city in the north, to
guerrillas and dissidents.

GERMANY yesterday reported a further rise in inflation last month to an
annual rate of 4.7 per cent at a time when pay talks have begun in the
engineering industry in the face of employers' determination to keep wage
rises low.
However, there was encouraging news on trade performance. The improvement in
February's trade surplus to DM2.2bn (Pounds 760m) from only DM45m in January
reflected a 1.1 per cent rise in exports, to nearly DM55bn. Imports eased by
2.9 per cent from January's level, to DM52.7bn. Since unification, the
surplus has come down sharply.

FT  03 APR 92 / Italian voters face a profusion of parties: Robert Graham
finds the choice is between more of the same and a step into the dark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ITALIAN electorate could scarcely claim it is being denied a choice of
parties or candidates in Sunday's general elections. The 47.4m voters have
never before faced such a deluge of parties and candidates, confirming
Italy's status as the most fragmented democracy in the EC.
Against 34 party groupings in the 1987 elections, 50 are now in the field,
including special interest lobbies from the League of Pensioners and the Car
Drivers' Party to the much publicised Party of Love, headed by Ms Moana
Pozzi, Italy's self-styled 'porno-star'.
The Rome electoral district tops the list with a bewildering selection of 27
parties. The Interior Ministry has permitted 109 different party symbols of
which 37 contain the word 'league', provoking the suspicion that government
supporters have deliberately sought to confuse potential voters of the
populist Lombard League which has emerged as the main challenger to the
ruling Christian Democrats in the north.
The number of candidates contesting the 630 seats for the chamber of
deputies and the 315 seats for the senate is up 17 per cent to 11,027. Over
one fifth of these candidates are contesting more than one seat - if they
win in more than one, their votes can be transferred to another candidate of
their party's choice.
But this proliferation of choice is deceptive. Little attention has focused
on issues, largely because the electorate is correctly assumed to know what
these are (institutional reform and convergence with the EC) and because few
politicians wish to commit themselves to concrete proposals. Instead the
campaign, with increasing intemperance, has centred on the nature and
composition of Italy's next and 51st post-war government.
As a result voters face only two real alternatives. The first is for a
majority to maintain their vote for the two main partners in the outgoing
coalition government, the Christian Democrats and the Socialists, which
alongside their minor allies, the Liberals (PLI) and the Social Democrats
(PSDI), have ensured a stable parliamentary majority. Between them, these
four parties mustered 52 per cent of the vote in 1987.
Alternatively, the apparently large number of undecided voters - up to a
third, which is unprecedented in Italian elections - could switch allegiance
to some nine groupings which could loosely be called the opposition for the
purposes of the campaign. This 'opposition' has presented itself as the
champion of reform of the political system and has been drumming up a
protest vote - but is not united in any other sense.
The parties include the metamorphosised communists in the form of the Party
of the Democratic Left (PDS); the breakaway hardline communists, known as
Reconstructed Communism; the centre-left Republicans (PRI); the anti-Rome
Lombard League and its league affiliates; the neo-fascist Italian Social
Movement (MSI); the Greens; the quixotic Radicals, the Referendum Party and
the Sicilian-based 'clean government' movement, La Rete (The Network).
It is thus a vote for the status quo to continue the Christian Democrats'
uninterrupted 46 year hegemony, or for an uncertain change involving new
players. In the past the same basic choice has existed; but the important
difference is that uncertain change then meant allowing a communist party
into government. Freed for the first time of this fear following the
collapse of communism, voters may well feel more willing to step into the
unknown.
The Christian Democrats, commanding 34 per cent of the vote, have been
unsettled by not having a well defined 'enemy' in the shape of a communist
threat. They have hit out in all directions with a defensive slogan 'they
want to break up Italy'; the all-embracing 'they' include highly responsible
former government partners such as the Republicans along with the Lombard
League. The Socialists have been equally defensive, exposed for having
little to do with socialism any more, and for making retention of power an
end in itself. The PSDI and the PLI have timidly clung to their partners'
coat-tails.
The 'opposition' has concentrated its fire on the Christian Democrats'
record in government and sought to capitalise on a protest vote. This is
especially the case of the Republicans and the Lombard League. But with few
exceptions the attacks have been muted by ambitions to govern that would
mean allying with elements in the outgoing government.
In the case of the PDS, the party has spent a lot of time ensuring that the
former communist vote, the second largest in 1987 with 26 per cent, does not
haemorrhage either to its break-away former companions in Reconstructed
Communism or to other parties. The PDS will do well to hold the line with 20
per cent of the vote.
Italian post-war elections have shown an electorate remarkably faithful to
individual parties with only minimal percentage swings. However, it would
require a relatively small swing from the four parties in the outgoing
coalition to undermine their chances of forming a new government.
Even if the present coalition partners scrape home with around 49 per cent
of the vote, the minimum to assure a working parliamentary majority, the
nature of the next legislature will be radically different. Over 400
deputies, embracing a cross-party alliance of Christian Democrats and
Socialists as well as Republicans and members of the PDS, are pledged, if
elected, to reform an electoral system which creates political fragmentation
and a political system which leaves the executive little accountable to the
legislature.
On economic issues no party disagrees on fundamentals - the need to tackle
the huge public sector deficit, slim down the state and conform to the
criteria of convergence with the EC laid down by the Maastricht summit. The
electorate is merely being left to decide amid a welter of vague promises
who is most capable of positive action.

FT  03 APR 92 / Super-Bere, socialist with a steady hand: France's new PM
has the best left credentials for right economic rectitude
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ARRIVAL of Mr Pierre Beregovoy as France's new prime minister, signals a
shift back towards the right and solid endorsement of the policy of
competitive disinflation he has pursued as finance and economy minister for
much of the past eight years.
It also marks President Francois Mitterrand's formal acceptance that the
attempt to introduce a fresh elan to government, with the nomination of Mrs
Edith Cresson last May, has not worked.
Mr Beregovoy can be expected to follow policies very similar to those of Mr
Michel Rocard, who preceded Mrs Cresson as prime minister, and with whom Mr
Beregovoy gets on very well. So, in the space of just under a year, the
government has turned full circle.
Yet anybody glancing for the first time at the life history of the genial Mr
Beregovoy might be forgiven for thinking he would be the last man who might
be expected to promote liberal economic policies at the head of a Socialist
government.
He was the only truly working class member of the Cresson administration,
otherwise dominated by alumni of the elite civil service colleges, and rich
bourgeois Socialists, dubbed the gauche caviar by satirical newspapers.
Mr Beregovoy is anything but that. Of Ukrainian descent, the 66-year-old
prime minister started work as a milling machine operator, then a
railwayman, and made his way into politics as a management assistant at Gaz
de France, the state utility. His formal educational qualifications are
limited. He got a certificate in metal working from technical college and
did not go to high school.
Yet as finance minister on and off since 1984, Mr Beregovoy more than made
up for his lack of grounding in the conventional elite by skilfully packing
his private office with some of the finest minds in the public
administration. He will undoubtedly pick a heavyweight staff for the
Matignon.
Mr Beregovoy's success in holding to his policy of firm budgetary and
monetary control for so long has made him more closely identified with
France's economic health - in foreign investors' minds - than any of his
European finance ministry counterparts in relation to their own economies.
The results are, as Mr Beregovoy never ceases to remind the public, much
lower-than-average inflation, respectable growth, and an economy that has so
far escaped a formal recession.
The importance of 'Super-Bere', as he is nicknamed, is underlined by the
gyrations that used to hit the capital markets during sporadic rumours of
his resignation, and the corresponding strength of the markets as rumours of
his promotion grew in recent days.
So President Francois Mitterrand's choice of Mr Beregovoy puts the country
in the hands of someone with a steady hand as well as undeniable Socialist
credentials.
A secondary advantage is that Mr Beregovoy has no presidential ambitions,
one of the factors that led to the falling out between Mr Mitterrand and the
ambitious and effective Mr Rocard. This will also avoid further splits in a
Socialist party already riddled with rivalry over how to repair its
electoral disasters and who will one day replace Mr Mitterrand.
It might seem surprising that Mr Mitterrand hesitated for several days
before appointing Mr Beregovoy. One reason might be the president's
annoyance at the fact that Mr Beregovoy prepared his own ministerial team
before even being nominated - and without consulting Mr Mitterrand.
What is more important, Mr Mitterrand has had to balance his need for Mr
Beregovoy's skills against the demands of an important Socialist party
faction, led by Mr Lionel Jospin, education minister in the Cresson
government, for a relaxation in Mr Beregovoy's policies of monetary and
budgetary rigour. As Mr Mitterrand's chief adviser from 1981-82 he has the
socialist credentials to steer through the party's sometimes conflicting
demands.
The Jospinists argue that less budgetary rigour would help curb
unemployment, one of the Socialists' biggest political problems, and to
stimulate the economy. Mrs Cresson shares those views, which is one reason
her relations with the former finance minister - who often outmanoeuvred his
old boss - were strained.
When questioned by critics, Mr Beregovoy has always come up with the same
answer: he will never devalue the franc. Mr Mitterrand has had to come to
terms with the fact that his new prime minister does not plan to abandon
that rigour for political, or any other, reasons.

FT  02 APR 92 / UK Company News: Cypriot bank offensive in PPI row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TURKISH Cypriot Central Bank has taken the offensive in a legal battle
with the administrators of Polly Peck International, the collapsed fruit,
leisure, and electronics group, and is to contest the High Court's decision
to serve a worldwide order against it last year.
News of the move, which if successful might result in the award of damages
to the bank, came within hours of a decision in the House of Lords refusing
the administrators permission to appeal against an Appeal Court decision
last month lifting the freezing order against the bank on Pounds 38.9m of
its assets.
'We strongly object to the way the administrators pitched their argument
against the bank in terms of fraud and money laundering.
Their evidence did not justify a Mareva injunction. That has now been
vindicated by the Appeals Court and the House of Lords,' said Mr David
Janney of Theodore Goddard, the solicitors acting for the Turkish Cypriot
Central Bank, which itself acts on behalf of the internationally
unrecognised Turkish Cypriot government.
The bank has already won costs in the case, believed to run into several
hundred thousand pounds, from the Polly Peck administration.
The original High Court order was one of five world-wide orders granted
last November to the administrators who are seeking to recover about
Pounds 500m of funds allegedly improperly removed from the company.
Last month the Central Bank won a Court of Appeal ruling lifting the
freezing order on its assets.
Likely interference of a Mareva injunction with the normal working of the
bank and the weakness of the administrators' evidence were given as reasons
for the Appeal court ruling.
The Turkish Cypriot Central Bank still faces a less stringent temporary
injunction requiring it to keep Pounds 10.7m in a special account until
tracing claims on funds have been resolved.

FT  02 APR 92 / Delay of Berlin move urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE COLITT and QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING members of all the main political parties in the German parliament
have now called for a reconsideration of the timetable for transferring the
government and Bundestag to Berlin.
The most prominent supporter of the transfer to call for a delay has been Mr
Willy Brandt, former chancellor and former mayor of Berlin, who last week
spelt out his concerns about mounting costs.
Budget spokesmen for the ruling Christian Democrat/Free Democrat coalition
government and the Social Democratic opposition in Bonn recently called for
the move to be delayed because of financial restraints resulting from the
transfer of government funds to east Germany. This year the transfers are
expected to approach DM180bn (Pounds 63bn).
The government has not yet responded to the calls, except to say that no
such delay is under consideration.
Parliament had been expected to begin moving into the Reichstag in Berlin by
1996. The move to Berlin of most major ministries was expected to be
completed by 2004.
Mrs Irmgard Schwaetzer, the building minister, has said that construction
costs could total up to DM10bn, and some 50,000 people would be transferred
to Berlin. But the parliamentary committee responsible has seen no proper
estimates.
It now seems clear that the Bundestag will not be in a position to approve a
precise transfer plan before the summer break at the end of June - as
originally planned. The costing needs to be completed and agreement reached
on dividing future government functions between Berlin and Bonn.
Meanwhile, Berlin politicians have expressed anger and bitterness over the
proposals.
Mr Peter Radunski, the senior Berlin official responsible for relations with
the federal government, replied testily that the move to Berlin was a
question of 'political will and not financial possibilities'. If there was a
shortage of funds, the scale and opulence of the official building projects
in Berlin should be reduced, he argued.
'Without an economic recovery in Berlin, there will be no economic recovery
in the east,' he said.

FT  02 APR 92 / Falklands invites oil search tenders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FALKLAND ISLANDS gov-ernment is inviting tenders for seismic studies in
disputed territorial waters in the South Atlantic, in effect excluding
Argentina from the initial search for oil in the area.
Senior Falklands government officials have been told by the Foreign Office
that further steps towards developing an oil industry in the area  - such as
full-scale exploration  - must await agreement between London and Buenos
Aires.
However, this initial move, coinciding with the tenth anniversary today of
the Argentine invasion of the Falklands, could provoke a strong protest from
Argentina, which has been pressing for joint participation with the UK on
every stage of the Falklands' oil programme.
Its timing also appears to have pre-empted the outcome of the UK general
election, which Falkland Islanders fear may lead to a Labour victory and a
more conciliatory attitude towards Buenos Aires on the issue of sovereignty.
Surprised foreign ministry officials in Buenos Aires said they had been
reassured by the UK there would be no unilateral move on oil. Argentina
wants to participate in the seismic studies, which it considers important in
establishing the true economic potential of the area.
Argentina, which does not recognise the islands' government, claims
sovereignty over the surrounding waters. But the Foreign Office in London
said that the Falklands government could, under local legislation, exercise
rights over the seabed and the subsoil of the continental shelf around the
islands.
There is widespread speculation in the Falklands and in Buenos Aires that
the islands have large oil reserves. A study of their oil potential by a
private company in the 1970s has remained a closely guarded secret.
Mr Ronald Sampson, chief executive of the islands' council, said there was
no reason why the Falkland Islands could not go ahead with the studies. He
expected seismic studies to be completed by the end of this year and to be
in a position to licence blocks for exploration by the middle of 1993.
Mr Sampson said local councillors had been 'made aware by the British
government' that in the 'longer term there will have to be a much closer
co-operation with Argentina in the exploration of oil'.
UK-Argentine talks in Buenos Aires in February about oil were inconclusive,
but further negotiations are planned for in London in June.
The Foreign Office said last night that, given the 'sensitivity' of the oil
issue, London and Buenos Aires were remaining in constant contact with each
other.

FT  02 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Large placing in United
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and COLIN MILLHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BIGGEST single deal of the day was in United Newspapers, which saw
17.25m shares placed as Canadian publisher Mr Conrad Black sold his entire
stake in the group.
Mr Black offloaded his 8.7 per cent holding through securities houses Smith
New Court and Cazenove. The Seaq electronic trading revealed two large
blocks of shares dealt at 346p, and a large number of trades carried out at
350p.
Smith said the shares were sold to around 30 different institutions at 350p
apiece in a bought deal. This involves a broker buying shares and taking the
risk of having them on its books rather than merely acting as an
intermediary.
United closed 13 off at 360p and was the most heavily traded stock in
London; the recorded volume of 39.6m shares accounts for both sides of the
Smith deal.
Analysts believe Mr Black has made a loss of between Pounds 15m and Pounds
18.6m on his holding. After the markets closed there were reports suggesting
that Mr Black was also seeking to raise money through a public listing and
sale of some 20m shares in the Daily Telegraph, his UK newspaper.
Tomkins shines
Speculation that conglomerate Tomkins is about to purchase the industrial
division of mining group RTZ was among the factors that helped the shares
stand out as the best FT-SE performer of the session.
The shares gained 8 to 440p, also powered by a buy recommendation from
County NatWest. Mr Geoff Allum at County pointed out that '75 per cent of
the company's earnings come from the US, and the UK businesses are not
overly sensitive to a Labour government and indeed some may benefit'.
Tomkins is still thought to be eyeing Racal Electronics, down  3/4 at 55 1/2
p, as a bid target with, it is thought, Chubb, Racal's security, locks and
alarms subsidiary, as the ultimate prize.
Several stocks were wanted for their large overseas exposure, as a guard
against a Labour party victory. RTZ added 5 at 579p, BAT Industries 6 at
679p and BOC 5 at 657p. Grand Metropolitan ended 7 better at 887p after the
company's managing director spoke of an upturn in the US economy which is
feeding through to benefit its Burger King chain.
Utilities hit
There appeared to be no doubt in the public utilities sector about Mr Neil
Kinnock's claim that he is on course for Downing Street as head of a
majority Labour government. Utilities are very vulnerable to the political
climate and will continue to move with the opinion polls in the run-up to
next week's election, according to dealers.
London Electricity fell 27 to 222p, with Manweb losing 24 to 257p, partly on
fears that a Labour government would be more severe in regulating profits of
the regional companies.
Among the power generators, National Power gave up 4 1/2 to 191p and
PowerGen slipped 5 to 200p, on turnover of around 3m shares each. Fears that
Labour will make the generating companies buy expensive British coal weighed
on the stocks. Scottish Power dropped 8 1/2 to 80 1/2 p and Scottish
Hydro-Electric 7 to 83p in spite of comments by analysts that the Scottish
power companies are less likely to be affected by any new regulatory
controls. The Electricity Package retreated 200 to Pounds 2288.
Views that Labour will be bad for utilities was also reflected in the water
shares. Thames and Wessex each lost 10 to 335p and 383p respectively, while
Seven Trent fell 9 to 310p.
Lower forecasts from bearish Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull contributed
to weakness in BP, which fell 6 to 249p on heavy turnover of 15.3m shares.
Strauss took a more cautious view on the prospects for Colombia's Cusiana
oilfield in which BP has a large stake. The house reduced its estimate for
first-quarter net income from Pounds 117m to Pounds 31m and its full-year
1992 forecast by Pounds 200m to Pounds 500m. Strauss also argued that a
dividend cut would come earlier than previously expected.
Oil company Lasmo held up relatively well in spite of the effects of a large
placing at well below the middle price yesterday. Smith New Court took on a
block of nearly 4m shares from one institution at 172p a share and placed
them with a number of institutions at 175p. This follows a similar deal in
Lasmo, conducted by the securities house, just over a month ago. Lasmo
closed 10 down at 185p.
County NatWest became the latest broker to warn that property groups with
exposure to the central London office market and the south-east retail
sector would be hardest hit by a Labour government.
Yesterday there were widespread falls across the whole sector, with Brixton
Estates adrift 9 at 149p, Hammerson ordinary 31 at 411p and MEPC 11 at 295p.
Chemicals company MTM fell sharply after the group said it had breached
banking covenants and did not expect to be able to pay a dividend for 1991.
The shares plummeted 40 to 26p with 3m traded.
Mr Howard Klein, chairman of Owners Abroad, made Pounds 724,500 in the
market on Monday, it was revealed, when he exercised options on shares at a
price of 3p apiece and sold them for 108p. Yesterday, Owners Abroad weakened
with the market, falling 5 1/2 to 99 1/2 p.
Heavy trade in Forte of 5.6m left the hotel group off 10 at 226p as some
dealers felt the stock's rise had been overdone.
Conglomerate Hanson receded 4 to 211 1/2 p on heavy turnover of 17.5m
shares, although US investors remained keen.
Rothmans International 'B' dipped 5 to 1014p as it was announced that
Australia had banned tobacco sponsorship of sporting events.

FT  02 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Poll news leaves Footsie at 1992 low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVIDENCE from opinion polls that Labour has established a significant lead
over the Conservative party triggered a predictable, but nevertheless heavy,
slide in UK share prices, which closed at their lowest levels so far this
year. The falls compounded a difficult day in international stock markets
which saw another hefty fall on the Tokyo market and a poor showing by Wall
Street during the afternoon.
The FT-SE 100-share Index plunged through the 2,400 level but later rallied
to close well above the day's worst with a net fall of 31.5 at 2,408.6.
The steep drop in share prices accompanied big falls in the gilt-edged
market and a rise in the three-month interbank rate as markets pondered the
chances of an increase in UK interest rates - currently at 10 1/2 per cent -
after next Thursday's general election.
The slide in equities took place during the busiest trading session on the
stock market this year. Seaq turnover totalled 701.6m shares, compared with
a previous high of 606.1m recorded on February 27. Yesterday's figure,
however, was given a substantial boost by a series of big placings and at
least six mostly small-size programme trades.
Marketmakers, most of which were thought to be carrying long positions, took
evasive action from the outset, chopping prices back to head off any
attempted sizeable selling. The Footsie opened 56 points down at 2,384.1,
subsequently proving to be the day's lowest, and quickly embarked on a
determined rally as a number of institutions moved in to pick up cheap
stock.
Dealers said 2,400 had been the trigger for a flurry of support. The buying
petered out mid-morning, however, with the index standing 26.7 off. The
afternoon session proved equally difficult for traders, with a weak Wall
Street opening prompting fresh bouts of selling of leading UK stocks.
Some senior marketmakers were dismayed at the latest turn of events. One
said the market had to absorb big lines of stock following heavy selling by
UK institutions. 'The market has been spooked and it looks odds on a Labour
administration,' said one. 'The mood is dreadful and there is still plenty
of downside. I just hope the overseas funds do not start selling,' he added.
Other dealers, however, said they had recorded more big institutional buy
trades than sales. 'There was an element of panic but it seems the market
has found a pretty good trading level,' was one view.
The drama of a falling market tended to mask some hefty share placings and a
series of corporate events. United Newspapers was the most heavily traded
stock as bought deal specialist Smith New Court, in tandem with Cazenove,
swooped to purchase the 8.7 per cent stake of some 17.25m shares held by Mr
Conrad Black, the Canadian entrepreneur, and placed the shares in the
market, taking a 4p a share turn in the process.
Smith also bought and sold a block of 3.5m shares in Lasmo, the oil group,
making a profit of 3p a share.
Utilities, retailers and property and building issues, undermined by fears
of a rise in interest rates, were among the worst affected areas.

<TEXT>
TURNOVER in the derivatives market rose sharply in a volatile session as
dealers hedged positions ahead of next week's election, writes Joel Kibazo.
In stock index futures, trading in the June contract on the FT-SE opened at
2,430, down 43 from the previous session, as dealers reflected on Tuesday's
opinion polls indicating a Labour party lead, and on the overnight fall in
Tokyo.
However, June was soon back in favour following a bout of bear closing and
recovered to stand at 2,444 by mid-morning. A poor Wall Street opening
caused the contract to once again retreat, before rallying in the final
stage of the session on renewed closing of short positions.
June finished at 2,446, the high of the day, down 27 from Tuesday's finish
and around 12 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about
28. Turnover was a hefty 9,197 contracts.
On the LTOM, volume was also heavy, reaching 40,111 contracts by the close.
The FT-SE option had a total of 23,911 lots transacted, one of the clearest
signals of the hedging activity in the market. Trade in the stock options
was, however, muted. Lonrho was the day's top stock option with 1,518 lots
dealt, followed by BT with 1,024.

FT  02 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Signs of US recovery help Dow
to rebound
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
US EQUITIES initially reacted to the latest fall in the Nikkei average but
came off early declines with help from economic news and a strong bond
market, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average blue chip indicator bounced off a morning
low of 3,215.34 to close a net 13.86 up at 3,249.33, but declining issues
still led rises by 1,036 to 667 after New York SE volume of 186.4m shares.
The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished a slight 0.54 ahead at 404.23, while the
Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks lost 1.68 at 602.09.
The market opened on a weak note in sympathy with Japan, but started to
recoup its losses after the release of the US National Purchasing Manager's
report for March, which showed the most rapid rate of growth in the economy
since last September.
The March index rose to 54.1 per cent from the 52.4 recorded in February.
Any reading above 50 per cent is seen as a sign of economic expansion. In
addition, the new orders index climbed to its highest level since June 1988.
The employment component, however, had a dampening effect on the stock
market ahead of tomorrow's release of employment figures for March.
Employment in the manufacturing sector fell at a sharper rate last month
than in February, with the employment index dropping to 42.8 per cent from
44.5 per cent.
Chemical Waste Management slipped Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 18 1/4 in active
trading. The hazardous-waste subsidiary of Waste Management, the biggest US
waste management company, yesterday disclosed that it is facing a criminal
invest-igation for work it performed for the US army corps of engineers.
Details of the government investigation came out in Chemical Waste
Management's 10-K filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
Trading was less active in Waste Management's shares, which shed Dollars
1/2 to Dollars 37 7/8 . Browning Ferris, the country's second largest waste
management concern, retreated Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 21 1/4 .
Shares in WR Grace also saw heavy trading, tumbling Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars
37 5/8 after the specialty chemicals company said its first-quarter results
would probably decline from the 36 cents a share in the comparable period of
1991.
The company, however, expects full-year earnings to rise more than 10 per
cent from the Dollars 2.50 earned in 1991. Grace attributed the
first-quarter erosion to timing and continuing weakness in the energy
sector.
Among active blue chips, Eastman Kodak rose Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 41 3/8 ,
IBM dipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 82 7/8 and Citicorp receded Dollars  1/2
to Dollars 16.
Bristol-Myers Squibb recovered Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 77 5/8 after falling
Dollars 2 on Tuesday when several analysts downgraded their ratings on the
issue. The big pharmaceutical company disappointed Wall Street by saying
that its first-quarter sales would be below expectations.
High-technology shares dominated Nasdaq trading, with Intel rising Dollars
1/2 to Dollars 55 3/4 , Microsoft appreciating Dollars 2 to Dollars 120 1/2
and Apple Computer firming Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 59.
Canada
TORONTO was finally little changed in moderate trading after the market
picked up late in the session in response to the improvement in New York.
The composite index, down 24 points at one stage, lost just 0.3 on balance
at 3,411.9, although declines retained a lead over advances of 291 to 220.
Volume was 23.2m shares.
The financial services and energy groups had the day's biggest gains, up 1
per cent apiece. The gold group was slightly firmer.
Nova, down CDollars  1/2 at CDollars 7 5/8 , said it will issue about
CDollars 300m of new common equity through a public offering.

FT  02 APR 92 / Money Markets: Jitters push up rates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RATES soared in a frenzied UK money market yesterday, as news of Labour's
firm lead in the opinion polls sank in.
A batch of polls on Tuesday night put Labour between four and 7 per cent
ahead of the Conservatives, enough to give Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour
leader, an overall majority this time next week in the general election.
The news 'fired the market into life', as one dealer put it, after several
sleepy days in which the polls showed no decisive lead.
During the day the three-month sterling interbank rate - the key guide to
the level of base rates - firmed   3/8 of a point to just above 11 per cent,
compared with a base rate of 10.5 per cent. It closed at 11 1/4 - 1/8 ,
anticipating more than a mere half-point rise in base rates after the
election to support the pound.
At the longer end, rates also firmed. The one year rate rose from 11 1/8 -11
per cent to 11 3/8 - 5/16 .
The June sterling contract dropped from an opening 88.86 to 88.77 in high
volumes of trading.
The Bank of England gave the money market Pounds 350m of assistance in the
morning, having revised its forecast liquidity shortage from Pounds 500m to
Pounds 350m. It bought Pounds 365m of band 1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent.
The Bank did not operate in the afternoon, but again revised its forecast
liquidity shortage, this time to Pounds 300m.
The only consolation for the market was a flood of cheap money. Discount
houses filled up with money that was being 'chucked around' at 10 per cent
in the first half of the morning.
The overnight rate, having firmed to around 10 1/2 - 1/4 per cent for a
brief spell, slid down to 9 1/8 -8 5/8 after the Bank revised its forecast
at midday. It closed at 10 1/4 - 1/8 .
German call money remained stuck near the 9.75 per cent Lombard rate after
the Bundesbank took a relatively large DM9.4bn of liquidity from the banks
with this week's securities repurchase transaction. Dealers quoted call
money at 9.65/70 per cent, unchanged from Tuesday.
The US Federal Reserve added temporary reserves to the banking system with
overnight system repurchase agreements.
The intervention had been expected by economists because of firmness in the
Federal Funds Rate at the end of the two-week reserve maintenance period.

FT  02 APR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Sterling unruffled by polls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FIRM Labour party lead in the UK opinion polls failed to ruffle sterling
yesterday, writes Emma Tucker.
After losing more than  1/2 pfennig in early trading on the news that the
previous night's polls pointed towards an overall Labour majority in next
Thursday's general election, the pound spent the rest of the day hovering
around DM2.8512, well above its DM2.7780 floor in the European exchange rate
mechanism.
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Yamaichi Securities in London, said:
'All the talk about a sterling crisis is exaggerated. Gilts and equities
have reacted quite badly to the opinion polls but the exchange rate has been
as flat as a pancake.'
The pound opened at DM2.8512 after Tuesday's close of DM2.8584, dipped to
DM2.8510 towards the end of trading and closed at DM2.8515.
Mr Nick Stamenkovic, an economist at DKB International in London, said
sterling held up because of the commitment of the main parties to the ERM
and because the interest rate differential against the D-Mark widened over
the day, providing some interest rate protection for sterling.
The yen lost ground against the dollar in early trading in London as the
markets reacted with dismay to the response of Tokyo stocks to the
long-awaited 0.75 per cent cut in the Japanese discount rate. The Nikkei
index sank 3.95 per cent to a five-year low.
'Any further weakness in the Japanese stock market is going to spill over
into the currency,' said Mr MacKinnon.
By mid-morning in London the dollar was standing at Y134.15/20 after a
Y133.90 finish in Tokyo and a Y132.70/80 close in New York.
The dollar continued to build on its early gains in the afternoon following
the release of positive US economic data. The National Association of
Purchasing Management survey for March rose to 54.1 per cent from February's
52.4.
The US unit ended in London at DM1.6530 from a DM1.6477 close in Tokyo and a
DM1.6425/35 New York finish. Against the yen it closed at Y134.30. In New
York yesterday the dollar finished at DM1.6513 and Y134.55.
Traders said the dollar was the biggest beneficiary from the yen weakness
but that yesterday's US data was too mixed to justify further gains. The
real test for the dollar comes tomorrow when US employment data is released.
As the US currency drifted up, the D-Mark lost ground against it.
Underpinned by German interest rates, however, the D-Mark remained firm on
most cross rates.
The French franc barely moved all day as the wait for news on the government
reshuffle went on. The franc is expected to remain stable provided Mr Pierre
Beregovoy remains finance minister or is named premier.

FT  02 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia's aluminium sector may
soon grind to a halt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S ALUMINIUM industry, previously expected to bring in Dollars 1bn of
foreign currency this year, is nearing collapse because of severe shortages
of raw materials, according to western observers.
They suggest that at the very least the industry can be expected to follow
the pattern set recently by Russia's steel and coking coal sectors where
output has plunged 40 per cent.
Expert eye witnesses say that Russia's Siberian aluminium smelters have only
four days stock of alumina, the essential raw material for aluminium
production, and are virtually out of carbon coke and pitch, without which
they cannot operate.
They estimate that the smelters - at Bratsk, Irkutsk, Krasnoyarsk, and
Novokuznetsk, with a combined annual capacity of 2.5m tonnes or two-thirds
of the Russian total - can operate for another four weeks at most before
having to stop production. It would then take another four weeks to get them
up and running smoothly again, once enough raw materials became available.
No alumina is currently being shipped through Batumi in Georgia, the main
port used by the Siberian smelters, because half the specialised handling
system is out of action and railway links have been disrupted by fighting in
the republic.
Extreme measures are being taken to overcome these problems. For example,
the Switzerland-based Marc Rich trading organisation is packaging alumina -
usually shipped in bulk - into 5 kg bags and transporting them to Russian
smelters from Rotterdam via Kokkola in Finland.
All this is a serious blow to Russia, which at the end of last year hoped to
export 1m tonnes of aluminium to the west in 1992 and to earn at least
Dollars 1bn.
Western observers suggest the decline in Russia's aluminium industry
accelerated in the first quarter of this year.
At first the industry was set the 1m tonnes export target, equalling last
year's flow of the metal to the west which, coming on top of recession in
key markets, caused the aluminium price to fall to its lowest level in real
terms and the western industry to shut down about 10 per cent of its
capacity.
In January the Russian authorities caused turmoil domestically by imposing
an export tariff of 500 Ecu a tonne. But after protests by the industry that
it would have to close export capacity because of this cost increase, the
authorities agreed last month that 615,000 tonnes could be exported free of
tariffs.
Raznoimport, the metals import-export organisation, has been allocated 80
per cent of the tonnage to swap in the west for alumina, observers suggest.
They say that between 170,000 and 200,000 tonnes of aluminium is stockpiled
at Russian ports ready to be shipped as part of these barter arrangements.
Western observers suggest that Concernalumini, set up last year to include
most of the former Soviet Union's aluminium industry, is close to
disintegrating because it has failed to keep the smelters supplied with raw
materials.
Smelter managers complain that their costs are rising sharply. At Irkutsk
production costs, Dollars 50 a tonne in January at the official rouble
exchange rate, are now Dollars 500.

FT  02 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Smoke signals from tobacco
sales - Why Zimbabwe's growers fear the worst
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ZIMBABWE'S flue-cured tobacco auctions opened this week against a background
of near-uniform economic gloom. The farming season now drawing to its close
has been one of the worst anyone can remember - 10 weeks of searing hot, dry
weather from Christmas to March was followed by some relief in the last
three weeks; but this came too late for most crops.
Late-planted tobacco has benefited, however. Only a few weeks ago the crop
was forecast at 160m kg; now it is estimated at 180m kg, about 5 per cent
more than last year's.
Because tobacco is a hardy, drought-resistant crop, the industry, which has
enjoyed boom conditions in the past two years, will be least affected by the
adverse climatic conditions, though between a quarter and a third of the
crop is believed to be drought-stressed and will fetch poor prices at the
auctions. Both growers and merchants predict that the price will average
about ZDollars 10 (USDollars 2) a kilogram this year, down 14 per cent from
1991 in local currency but 40 per cent in US dollar terms.
It is always dangerous to read too much into the first week's sales, but
when the floors opened on Tuesday growers were disappointed with the daily
average price of ZDollars 7.74 a kilogram. Quality leaf attracted reasonable
prices but droughty tobacco sold at a discount as expected. While it will be
at least a month before the market settles down sufficiently to draw any
firm conclusion, some growers see the first day's prices as confirming their
worst fears.
Comparisons with 1991 are misleading because that was an unusual season. In
the first few weeks prices were lifted by a bitter battle between major
merchants for market share. Then, in the second half of the season, prices
rose further on currency speculation.
With production rising in Brazil and India, and recession-stressed cigarette
manufacturers preoccupied with cost-cutting, the merchants are anxious to
keep prices down this year, especially as leaf quality will be lower.
A major change from last year, too, is the steep rise in interest rates in
the local money market. Tobacco bills, which were yielding 15 per cent a
year ago, are now returning 30 per cent, and the merchants want to hold leaf
prices down to compensate for increased preshipment borrowing costs.
The Zimbabwean authorities, anxious to curb currency speculation, have
ordered that leaf prices be quoted in US dollars in 1992. This will have an
impact only to the extent that buyers believe the central bank can maintain
the local currency at ZDollars 5 to the US dollar. While no one doubts the
reserve bank's desire to hold the line, the recent loosening of monetary
policy at a time of 30 per cent inflation suggests that the best intentions
could turn to ashes in the second half of the year. Some economists believe
Zimbabwe's current account deficit will reach USDollars 1bn, or 20 per cent
of GDP this year, making it extremely difficult to maintain the existing
currency value.
Tobacco crop financing was responsible for a surge in money-supply growth
last year because the central bank was prepared to rediscount tobacco bills,
thereby fuelling monetary expansion. In an effort to avoid this, and meet
IMF credit-creation ceilings, it has been agreed that 15 per cent of tobacco
sales revenue will be withheld from the grower and used to finance export
sales. The grower is to be paid interest at rates above prime lending on
these involuntary savings, which he will get back early next year.
An average price of between ZDollars 10 and ZDollars 11 a kilogram this year
would value the crop at just under ZDollars 1.9bn, 4 per cent less than last
year's record ZDollars 1.97bn. But the foreign currency value of the crop
will be down by a third because of devaluation. Even so, tobacco will remain
the country's chief export; when local processing is taken into account, the
1992 crop is forecast to account for USDollars 500m out of projected total
export earnings of USDollars 1.6bn.
With costs having risen at least 30 per cent in the last year, the predicted
10 per cent fall in local prices will squeeze margins. In spite of this,
growing flue-cured tobacco remains the most profitable activity in
Zimbabwean agriculture and few growers will incur the losses facing their
counterparts in livestock, maize, cotton, oilseed and coffee.
This year is likely to be seen as no more than a temporary setback and
industry expansion will continue apace, particularly now that growers will
enjoy 35 per cent export retention. This means they can use up to a third of
their export earnings to purchase imports and, since many of them will have
more foreign currency than they need, they will earn a handsome premium from
selling the funds to commercial and industrial importers.

FT  02 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Foreign stocks lure Americans
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US INVESTORS did not just rush into domestic equities in record numbers last
year, they also bought record amounts of foreign stocks. According to
figures released yesterday, US investors bought a net Dollars 34.9bn of
foreign equities in 1991, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The total smashed the previous record of Dollars 13.1bn established in 1989.
The final quarter was the busiest for US investor participation in foreign
stock markets, with net acquisitions reaching Dollars 9.6bn in the final
three months.
The Securities Industry Association, which compiled the data, said portfolio
diversification by US money managers to strong performing foreign equity

FT  02 APR 92 / Government Bonds: UK bonds shaken sharply by election fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ELECTION jitters shook the UK government bond market sharply yesterday,
wiping nearly a percentage point off gilt prices early in the day and
pushing yields on 10-year bonds at one stage to 10 per cent. Ten-year gilts
now yield around 2 per cent more than German bunds - though the widening gap
has yet to bring out many buyers.
The cause of yesterday's fall was three opinion polls which pointed to the
possibility of outright victory for the opposition Labour party. With the
general election a week today, the market seemed to feel the ruling
Conservative party has little chance of regaining ground to secure an
outright majority. One immediate effect was a sharp hike in short-term
rates, with three-month money rising to around 11 1/4 per cent,  3/4 per
centage point above the current UK base rate.
The move reflects concern that a Labour government would have to boost
short-term rates to defend sterling's position in the exchange rate
mechanism.
Ten-year yields rose from 9.9 per cent on Tuesday to 10 per cent yesterday,
later falling slightly. Meanwhile, the benchmark 9 per cent gilt maturing
2011 lost  3/4 of a point, falling to 93 27/32 , or a yield of 9.7 per cent.
Although there was a widespread view yesterday that the market had fully
discounted a Labour victory, some parts of the yield curve could still be
vulnerable: at the short end, for instance, where few expect a  3/4 point
rise in interest rates to be enough to protect sterling in the aftermath of
a Labour victory, and in the three to four-year area, where a yield of 10.5
per cent may not fully reflect pressure in short-term interest rates.
LONG-DATED US Treasuries posted strong gains yesterday afternoon as the
market prepared for Friday's release of the March employment report.
In late trading, the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was higher at 101
5/32 , yielding 7.89 per cent, while the three-year note rose  1/4 to to
yield 5.99 per cent.
Although yesterday morning's release of the National Association of
Purchasing Management's report for March showed continued economic growth,
bonds firmed on the back of the weak employment component of the report.
The index indicated that the overall US economy in March grew at its fastest
rate since September, with the NAPM index rising to 54.1 per cent. In
addition, new orders for March, at 62.4 per cent, were at their highest
since June 1988.
The bond market, however, took strength from a decline in the March
manufacturing employment index, which dropped to 42.8 per cent from 44.5 per
cent in February. A reading of less than 48 per cent is generally consistent
with a decline in the Bureau of Labour Statistics' (BLS) data on
manufacturing employment.
THE long-awaited cut in Japan's official discount rate, from 4.5 per cent to
3.75 per cent, was greeted yesterday by a bout of profit-taking and gloom
about the prospects for further gains in the government bond market. It was,
said one analyst, 'too little, too late' to lift confidence.
Any further rate cut may not arrive until the summer, and with most of the
bad economic news apparently already priced into the market, and further
pressure on the Japanese yen, there seemed little prospect yesterday for
government bonds to gain much ground in the weeks ahead. The yield on the no
129 bond closed at 5.36 per cent, up four basis points on the day.
FRENCH government bonds gave up their gains of Tuesday, slipping by 1/2
point, as the hoped-for cabinet reshuffle failed to materialise yesterday
and the market was pulled back by profit-taking. June bond futures fell by
0.26 on the day, to 107.36.
Weakness in France also set the tone for German government bonds, though
losses in the bund market were less severe (the yield gap between the two
markets opened up again to over 70 basis points, reversing the tightening
seen earlier in the week).
Further unease came with the Bundesbank's latest weekly repurchase auction.
The hike at last week's auction had been widely put down to technical
factors. There was a further tightening yesterday.

THOMSON-CSF, the French state-controlled defence company, has joined forces
with two US partners to bid Dollars 400m for the aerospace and missile
businesses of LTV, the US steel and defence company under bankruptcy
protection for the past five years.
The Thomson-CSF bid, which features Hughes Aircraft and the Carlyle Group as
partners, tops a Dollars 355m bid LTV agreed in February with Vought, a
venture formed by US defence groups Lockheed and Martin Marietta.
The French company and Hughes are offering Dollars 280m in cash for LTV's
missile business, while the Carlyle Group, an investment firm run by Mr
Frank Carlucci, the former secretary of defence, is offering Dollars 90m in
cash and Dollars 30m in preferred stock for LTV's aircraft division.
As LTV is operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, any bid for its
assets would need the approval of the judge following its case.
Thomson and its partners claimed last night that their bid would not create
any anti-trust complications.
Following the acquisition, each division would be separately capitalised and
operated independently, Thomson-CSF said.
LTV's missiles division would remain an American company, it was claimed,
and would observe US Defence Department restrictions to prevent the
unauthorised disclosure of classified information or transfer of sensitive
technology.
Thomson-CSF said compliance with US laws and regulations would be ensured by
a Special Security Agreement (SSA) written to US Defence Department
specifications.
Security compliance would be overseen by an eight-member board of directors,
all but one of whom would be US citizens.

associate private

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Securities &amp; Futures Commission, Hong Kong's corporate watchdog,
yesterday scored an important victory over one of the colony's most
controversial corporate raiders when it successfully intervened to stop Mr
Joseph Lau's Evergo International from taking private its associate Chinese
Estates.
The SFC said it had appeared before the Supreme Court of Bermuda on Tuesday
and requested it to overturn the approval by Chinese Estates' shareholders
of Evergo's bid because of irregularities in the conduct of the vote.
Mr Ermanno Pascutto, an executive director of the SFC and chairman of the
Hong Kong Takeovers Committee, said the commission's successful intervention
in the Bermuda court would bolster confidence in Hong Kong's system of
regulation. He pointed out that about 40 per cent of Hong Kong's listed
companies were registered in Bermuda and that concern had been expressed
that they might have been trying to escape regulation by being so domiciled.
Chinese Estates' shareholders in February approved a scheme whereby Evergo
could acquire the 50.4 per cent of the company it did not already own.
Shareholder approval had to pass two tests - a majority of voters had to
approve the scheme and their combined shareholding had to account for at
least 75 per cent of the stock under offer.
The SFC found that 527 of the 644 shareholders who voted held just 4,000
shares in the company - the smallest dealing size allowable on stock
exchange trades. Of those, 491 appeared on the company's share register at
the end of August last year, just before Evergo bid for Chinese Estates.
'The voting pattern for the meeting suggests, and our inquires so far lend
weight to the suggestion, that one person did orchestrate both a splitting
of shares into. . . lots and the purchase of (those) lots,' the SFC said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MALBAK, the industrial arm of the Gencor group, weathered the effects of a
worsening economy to record a 29 per cent increase in earnings in the six
months to the end of February.
Turnover rose by 27 per cent to R5.3bn (Dollars 1.84bn), assisted by a
number of acquisitions. Operating income was 10 per cent higher at R393m.
Attributable earnings rose to R152m from R118m.
Earnings per share dropped by 3 per cent to 55.1 cents following a share
increase. The interim dividend was maintained at 12.5 cents a share.
The reporting period was a busy one for Malbak as it acquired control of
Fedfood and SA Druggists, and disposed of its holdings in Darling and
Hodgson and half of its stake in Standard Engineering. It also arranged a
R430m rights issue.
The effect of these deals was to give Malbak a stronger consumer focus,
particularly in food and pharmaceuticals, while largely removing it from the
engineering and construction fields.
Mr Grant Thomas, executive chairman, said he was delighted with the
performance, which was in line with forecasts. But he cautioned consumers
were only now feeling the full effects of the recession and hence no
significant upturn in the group's sales was foreseen in the second half.

FT  02 APR 92 / International Company News: German watchdog challenges
Allianz's might - Unravel the web of shareholdings controlled by Europe's
largest insurance group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE German cartel office has made a tough decision: it is taking on the full
might of the German financial establishment. This week, the Berlin-based
monopolies watchdog decided that Allianz - Europe's largest insurance
company - must reduce its stake in Dresdner Bank, Germany's second biggest.
Allianz, conservative and publicity-shy, is one of the most powerful
financial institutions in Europe - possibly the most powerful. It is by far
the biggest participant in the German and the European insurance markets. It
also exercises profound influence on German industry and financial services
through a network of shareholdings worth, according to some estimates,
DM400bn (Dollars 243.9bn).
Dresdner Bank is the second biggest of Germany's big three banks. Along with
Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank, Dresdner holds considerable power over German
industry.
Together, it is thought that the Dresdner-Allianz axis holds powerful
minority stakes in a number of very large German companies - including Bayer
and Hoechst, two of Germany's big three chemicals giants; the MAN
engineering group; the Lufthansa airline group; Metallgesellschaft;
Heidelberg Cement; RWE and the Thyssen steel group - to name but a few of
the holdings.
The full reasons for the cartel office's decision have not, as yet, been
made public - indeed, they have not even been communicated to the two
companies concerned. However, it is clear, even at this stage, that the
order will be strenuously resisted.
It may take years for the battle to be resolved. At stake is the future
shape of not just the German insurance industry but also the future pattern
of relations between industry and finance in Germany.
Under German anti-trust laws, companies must seek cartel office approval for
any purchase of more than 25 per cent in another company. At that level, it
is deemed that the acquirer starts to have significant influence over the
management of the acquiree - and is in a position to block rights issues and
acquisitions.
The Berlin authority first became interested in the relationship between
Allianz and Dresdner in the summer of last year when it emerged that Allianz
had increased its stake in the bank to over 22 per cent, up from a hitherto
disclosed level of 10 per cent. This followed an agreement in 1989 when
Allianz and Dresdner decided to sell each others' services, cementing the
relationship by taking a 10 per cent stake in one another.
In this case, as in others, Allianz was scrupulously careful to keep its
stake to below the 25 per cent threshold. However, Berlin has been looking
at a web of other stakes which - it has now decided - give Allianz greater
de facto influence over the management of the bank than is suggested by the
22.3 stake under Allianz's direct ownership.
Last weekend, in a Der Spiegel magazine article, it was suggested that
Berlin had decided that Allianz spoke for 47 per cent of the bank, almost a
majority. This figure was at first confirmed by the cartel office, then
denied.
Allianz itself put out an angry statement saying - in essence - that the 47
per cent figure was wrong, and that its stake was 22.3 per cent.
At issue is the influence which Allianz exerts over two investment companies
which between them own 21 per cent of Dresdner's shares. These are
Frankfurter Gesellschaft fur Finanzwerte (FGF) - with 10 per cent of the
bank - and Vermo with 11 per cent. Allianz does not hold a direct stake in
either of these two companies, but it does hold stakes in some shareholders.
For example, it holds a 24.6 per cent stake in Bayerische Hypobank, one of
Germany top five banks, which in its turn holds a 12 per cent stake in
Vermo. Allianz also holds sizeable minority stakes - around the 10 per cent
level, according to Der Spiegel - in each of Bayer, Linde and RWE, three
industrial companies which are reported to control a further 36 per cent of
Vermo between them.
Similarly, Allianz holds no direct stake in FGF, which is owned by 14
insurance companies - other than Allianz - one property company and one
chemicals company - believed to be Hoechst - none of which owns more than 10
per cent of FGF.
However, Allianz does have stakes in some of these stakeholders - for
example a 25 per cent cross-holding in Munich Re, the Munich-based
reinsurance company. Together with Munich Re, it has a controlling interest
in Hamburg Mannheimer, Germany's second largest life company after Allianz
and a shareholder in FGF.
Allianz maintains that it is nonsense to accuse it of controlling either FGF
or Vermo when it has no direct stake. Even if account is taken of all its
holdings, the stake still does not reach 25 per cent, it says.
However, many analysts are convinced that Allianz really does pull the
strings at Dresdner and other companies in which it holds stakes,
irrespective of the formal level of its holdings.
The Germans call this vorauseilendgehorsam - a structure of pre-emptory
obedience. This means that these companies will never act against Allianz's
wishes - acting as if they were majority controlled by Allianz, even if
formally they are not.
To illustrate this, there is speculation in the German press that Allianz
has blocked Dresdner from setting up its own life assurance business ahead
of the European Community-driven freeing-up of the heavily-protected German
insurance market in 1994.
Deutsche Bank set up its own life subsidiary in 1990 - reportedly much to
the annoyance of its largest shareholder, which just happens to be Allianz,
with a 10 per cent stake.
Furthermore, Dresdner has used its 10 per cent stake in Aachener &amp;
Munchener, Germany's second largest insurance company, to support the
incumbent management in its bid battle against AGF, the French state-owned
insurance company which has amassed a 25 per cent stake in its target.
Is this not another example of vorauseilendgehorsam? Certainly Dresdner is
acting in accordance with the wishes of an Allianz keen to keep foreign
companies out of its home patch - the source of its profitability and the
fuel for its recent expansion overseas.
A battle between Allianz and the cartel office is likely to last years.
Meanwhile, the biggest loser at this stage would appear to be Dresdner. The
bank's shares fell by 2 per cent on Monday after the news was announced.

FT  02 APR 92 / International Company News: Silver lining behind Japanese
economic clouds - The quickening pace of reform in the Tokyo corporate bond
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE Tokyo financial markets found little comfort in the Japanese
government's emergency economic package unveiled on Tuesday, companies
welcomed proposals that could quicken the pace of reform in the country's
corporate bond market.
The government indicated this week it wanted to eliminate limits on
corporate bond issuance, allowing a broader range of companies to raise
funds through a wider range of instruments.
Currently, only companies with market capitalisation of more than Y100bn
(Dollars 743m), and which have over Y100bn shares traded on the stock market
annually, are allowed to issue straight bonds.
These restrictions will now be relaxed. Companies will also be allowed to
issue bonds with one and two-year maturity and floating rate notes.
Deregulation of the corporate bond market is already underway, in line with
the Ministry of Finance's dismantling of the barrier between the banking and
securities industries, slated for next year.
Banks are expected to enter the underwriting business, currently dominated
by the big four brokerages - Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities, Nikko
Securities and Yamaichi Securities.
The commission-bank system, in which every issue has a bank that acts as an
agent representing investors, is also expected to be abolished.
Banks will have the most to lose since they will forfeit high fee revenue as
the agent bank. Also, corporate bonds with shorter maturities will compete
against banking deposits, while floating rate notes are an attractive
alternative to short-term bank lending.
Daiwa Securities said that although it may take more than two years for
legislative changes, the calls for reforms pointed to a more larger and
liquid corporate bond market in Japan.
In the past, Japanese companies have relied on banks for financing, and in
the peak of the bull market in the late 1980s turned to cheap equity-linked
financing. In the last quarter of 1989, Japanese companies raised Y9,000bn
through equity-linked issues.
However, with the stock market's slump, sources of financing have dried up
for companies. New share issues during the fiscal year to March 1992 plunged
48 per cent from the previous year to Y243.9bn.
Banks, which face increasing bad loans, need to widen profit margins, and
are reluctant to lower rates despite a decline in the official discount
rate.
Although demand for funds has subsided briefly due to the current lull in
the Japanese economy, financing needs for Japanese companies are expected to
rise from the middle of this year due to repayments on the equity-linked
issues. According to Daiwa Securities, Japanese companies will see a total
of Y6,950bn equity-linked debt maturing in the year ending March 1993. The
amount is expected to rise to Y9,000 in the year ending March 1994.
Economists also predict Japanese companies will need to start financing
themselves for capital investment once the economy picks up, the consensus
being during the third quarter of this year.
Mr Marshall Gittler, bond analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said although the
proposals were not revolutionary, and the pace of change is expected to be
gradual, further restructuring of the corporate bond market would provide an
option for Japanese companies.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; York, the cash-strapped Canadian property developer, is expected
to raise several hundred million dollars over the next few days to help meet
overdue debt obligations.
The Toronto-based company was expected to announce late yesterday or today
that GW Utilities, its 89 per cent owned subsidiary, would immediately
provide O&amp;Y with a short-term loan pending the receipt of CDollars 158m
(USDollars 132.7m) in special dividends from GWU on April 14.
The dividends are being financed from GWU's sale last month of its
controlling interest in Interprovincial PipeLine, a large oil pipeline
operator, for CDollars 655m.
GWU is itself arranging a substantial loan secured by the second instalment
from the Interprovincial sale, totalling CDollars 277m, which is only due to
be paid by buyers of the shares in March 1993. This receivables financing
will, in effect, give GWU immediate access to the full proceeds of the
Interprovincial sale.
In addition, O&amp;Y is understood to be within days of concluding the sale of
Exchange Tower, a Toronto building which houses its own head office and the
Toronto Stock Exchange.
O&amp;Y is due to present an interim plan for the restructuring of its estimated
CDollars 20bn debt to its creditors in Toronto on April 6.
A report by RBC Dominion Securities, Canada's biggest securities firm, has
put O&amp;Y's exposure to Canadian banks at CDollars 2.6bn, which is somewhat
higher than earlier estimates.
Proceeds from the Exchange Tower sale and the GWU loan will be used to
retire two O&amp;Y CP programmes.
Repayments under these programmes have come to a virtual halt since O&amp;Y
revealed on March 22 that it was suffering a liquidity crisis. The amount of
commercial paper outstanding remains at about CDollars 380m.
O&amp;Y has gained further breathing space thanks to what is described as an
'informal' standstill agreement with a group of financial institutions on a
CDollars 450m loan to finance construction of the 68-storey Scotia Plaza
complex in downtown Toronto.
O&amp;Y failed to make a principal payment on the loan due on March 31.
The lenders refused O&amp;Y's request for a one-year rollover, but a source
close to the company said they had agreed not to take precipitate action to
enforce repayment.
Mr Michael Goldberg, Dominion Securities' banking analyst, said yesterday
that his figures of the banks' loans to O&amp;Y were based on 'educated
estimates'.
Mr Goldberg puts the exposure of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, O&amp;Y's
biggest creditor, at CDollars 1.1bn, which is higher than other estimates
published so far.
Royal Bank of Canada's exposure is estimated at CDollars 700m, Bank of Nova
Scotia at CDollars 450m, Bank of Montreal at CDollars 200m and National Bank
at CDollars 150m.
The sixth Canadian bank, Toronto-Dominion, last week said that it has no
direct exposure to O&amp;Y.

NOVA, the west Canadian energy, pipeline and petrochemicals group, plans to
raise about CDollars 300m (USDollars 252.1m) in new equity in the North
American and European capital markets and regulatory filings have been
completed, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
The issue is being co-ordinated internationally by RBC Dominion Securities,
and the company says the actual amount will depend on market conditions.
The issue will be finalised on April 20 and closing is set for April 28.
Last year, Nova took a CDollars 675m special restructuring charge mainly to
write down the value of its petrochemicals business. Including this, it
posted a final loss of CDollars 629m on revenues of Dollars 3bn.
North American petrochemical producers have announced polyethylene and
styrene price increases for May 1.
Videotron, the Canadian communications group investing USDollars 150m in
cable TV in southern England, has raised CDollars 68m of new equity by an
issue of subordinate voting shares to Canadian investment dealers. The new
equity had to be raised by October under an agreement between Videotron's
British cable TV subsidiary and Citicorp and Bank of Boston.

DATA GENERAL, which last year showed signs of a recovery, yesterday said it
may record an operating loss for the second quarter.
In addition, the US minicomputer-maker announced it was cutting 1,000 jobs,
 -almost one-eighth of its workforce - and would take a second-quarter
charge of about Dollars 46m.
The anticipated losses represent a setback in Data General's financial
turnround.
The company returned to profitability in fiscal 1991 after four years of
heavy losses during which operations were severely cut and the company
developed a new 'open systems' product line.
Data General said that while revenues from its AViiON family of open systems
computers continued to be strong, sales of its older line of proprietary
systems had slowed.
The company said that second-quarter revenues would be below industry
analysts' projections. The company blamed competitive pricing pressures and
a weak worldwide economy.
The workforce reduction would be worldwide, with 'a significant number of
administrative positions being eliminated within the company's international
operations', Data General said.
Neither the company's salesforce nor its research and development operations
would be affected.
'This is a painful, but necessary, step,' said Mr Ronald Skates Data General
president and chief executive.
'Competitive and economic factors are accelerating the need for companies
both within and outside the computer industry to become more efficient.
'Data General is positioned both organisationally and strategically to
succeed,' said Mr Skates.
'Our product strategy is correct. In addition, our financial position
continues to be strong.'
For the first quarter, Data General reported net income of Dollars 4m, or 12
cents per share, on revenues of Dollars 294.8m, down from Dollars 12.4m, or
41 cents per share, on revenues of Dollars 311.7m in the same period a year
earlier.
On Wall street yesterday, Data General's stock price closed at Dollars 9 1/8
, a fall of Dollars  1/8 . As recently as January, Data General was trading
as high as Dollars 18 5/8 .

At present large ITV companies can only acquire the smallest commercial

'We think it would be reasonable to relax restrictions on big companies
being able to take over medium sized companies and let the market decide
whether that is appropriate,' said Mr Christopher Bland, chairman. 'The
limits on takeovers of medium or even large companies should be set by
market share of advertising - about 25 per cent.'
The attack on present restrictions came as Mr Bland announced that LWT had
beaten the trend and the recession to increase pre-tax profits for 1991 by
21.5 per cent, from Pounds 20.8m to Pounds 25.2m. Earnings per share rose 23
per cent, from 14.9p to 18.3p basic and from 13p to 16p fully diluted.
Turnover fell from Pounds 275.7m to Pounds 260.5m.
The fixed preferred dividend is raised by 50 per cent to 5.91p - the last
increase possible before the share conversion scheme matures in autumn 1993.
If the share price reaches 278p by then - and it rose 5p to 263p yesterday -
Mr Bland and Mr Greg Dyke, chief executive, will be able to exercise options
worth several million pounds, as will, to a lesser extent, 38 other
executives.
Mr Bland said yesterday he thought the chances of being able to exercise the
options 'reasonably strong.'
LWT has been able to increase profits against a background of three years of
flat advertising revenue in the UK - a decline in real terms. It had also
reduced debt by Pounds 17m to Pounds 27m over the year.
Part of the answer has come from cutting costs. Staff numbers have fallen by
more than 40 per cent since 1988 to 723 full time at the moment. The numbers
will continue to fall but not drastically.
At the same time it has increased its share of network and London
advertising helped by successful drama.
The company, which claimed the highest margins in ITV, said it attracted
more viewers from the managerial and professional ABC1 groups than the BBC,
and that 30 per cent of its weekend peak time ratings came from its own
programmes rather than the rest of the ITV network.
LWT retained its franchise against opposition with a surprisingly low bid of
Pounds 7.58m.
Mr John Scaife, media analyst at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said
yesterday that LWT had taken costs out early and that when the economy
improved would be taking money in 'in buckets.'
Mr Bland forecast that 'some high bidders will find it difficult to survive
on their own.'

FT  02 APR 92 / UK Company News: Lonrho investors seek debt details - Share
price collapse prompts disquiet among large shareholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In an interview on BBC Radio's The Financial World Tonight, Mr Spicer was
asked if Mr Tiny Rowland, chief executive, wanted to take Lonrho private. Mr
Spicer said: 'I've heard him say that it would be a fascinating thing to
do.' And on the question of whether the board would agree to Mr Rowland
taking it private, Mr Spicer said: 'At those sort of prices (more than
Pounds 1bn), it would be very interesting indeed,' adding, 'One advantage
would be that it would take us out of the public limelight.'
LONRHO, the international trading group, is being pressed by some of its
largest UK institutional shareholders to divulge information over debt and
banking covenants in the wake of the collapse of its share price.
Directors will be asked to reveal the amount of debt and in which countries
it has been taken out.
Mr Rene Leclezio, chairman, told shareholders at last month's annual general
meeting that net debt stood at Pounds 850m.
In particular shareholders want to know whether this figure was calculated
before or after the payment of Pounds 177m by the Libyan Arab Investment
Company for the one third stake in the Metropole Hotels chain.
Lonrho will also be pressed to give details of its banking covenants or
conditions. Only if covenants are breached, can a bank apply the threat that
a loan should be repaid immediately.
Mr Paul Spicer, Lonrho deputy chairman, refused to comment on the
relationship between Lonrho and its institutional shareholders, but added:
'There is nothing to be concerned about. Our debt is easily explained and is
being reduced.'
Lonrho's shares yesterday recovered a little to close at 71p, following
Tuesday's fall to 65 1/2 p, an eight-year low. Last November the shares were
worth about 250p.
Bankers said yesterday that they were more than a little concerned about
Lonrho's falling share price. However, they are unable to apply much
pressure on the company to provide them with more information.

FT  02 APR 92 / Daily Telegraph listing proposed

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR CONRAD Black, the Can-adian proprietor of the Daily Telegraph, yesterday
announced he was considering a stock exchange listing for the UK newspaper
group in June 'barring a market over-reaction' to the outcome of the UK
election.
He also announced the sale of his 8.8 per cent stake in United Newspapers,
publishers of the Daily Express.
The proposed flotation would require the Hollinger Group, the international
media group which is Mr Black's main holding company, to reduce its holding
from 83 per cent to 70 per cent. A minority of the shares is held by
directors and former owners of the Telegraph newspapers.
The Telegraph newspapers have just announced pre-tax profits for 1991 of
Pounds 40.5m on turnover of Pounds 219m, compared with profits of Pounds
38.5m the year before, on turnover of Pounds 222m.
Mr Joe Cooke, managing director of the Daily Telegraph, said the proposed
flotation and the sale of the United Newspapers stake did not indicate
Hollinger was short of money: 'It is more in the way of building up a war
chest.'
Hollinger Group sold the 17.25m United Newspapers shares to brokers Smith
New Court and Cazenove, who placed them with several dozen institutions at
350p a share, raising Pounds 60.4m.
United Newspapers shares yesterday slipped by 13p to 360p.
The average price paid by Hollinger in building the stake in July and August
1989 is believed to be about 458p, implying a loss on the shares of Pounds
18.6m. This does not include the cost of financing the investment or
dividends received.
Mr Jack Boultbee, vice-president for finance at Hollinger's head office in
Toronto, said yesterday there was 'no particular need' for the company to
raise money, but that 'there's a lot of sense in paying down debt right now
whether or not we take on anything else', writes Bernard Simon in Toronto.
He said Hollinger gave a 'soft commitment' to spin off some of its interest
in the Telegraph at the time of its original investment. He added that the
company expects to raise 'at least' CDollars 120m (Pounds 58.4m) by reducing
its stake from 83 per cent to 70 per cent, double what it paid for its
original 58 per cent stake in the company.

FT  02 APR 92 / BMW sales up 30% in first quarter
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BMW, the German carmaker, achieved a rise of nearly 30 per cent in sales
during the first quarter of 1992, but Mr Eberhard von Kuenheim, chief
executive, said the company would certainly not keep this up over the whole
year.
He also added some stern words to the warnings by German executives about
the country's decreasing attraction as a production location, mentioning
high costs, over-regulation, and bureaucratic inflexibility, especially in
BMW's home city of Munich.
But he declined to be drawn further on the possibility of BMW producing cars
in the US, as reported this week. 'This is wholly in the stars,' he said.
BMW had been considering whether to produce abroad, but had no preference
for any particular location.
BMW had looked at sites in the US - the one referred to this week was in
South Carolina - and obviously had to think whether it should continue
supplying North America from Germany. 'This is a theoretical question at the
moment, but it could become very acute tomorrow.'
He said the growth rate experienced in the first quarter could not be
applied to the full year, as the results in January-March, 1991, had been
held back by production changes caused by the introduction of the new
3-series, its smallest and most popular model.
Total world sales in the first quarter of this year rose 29 per cent to
141,000 cars, with double-digit percentage rises in Germany, the US, the UK,
France, and Italy. Turnover was 24 per cent higher at DM7.8bn.
Barring unforeseen events, 'we assume that 1992 will be another successful
year'.
Production and sales should show a further rise from 1991, when group
turnover rose by 10 per cent to DM29.8bn (Pounds 10.4bn), car output by 6.5
per cent to 553,000 units and net profits by 12.5 per cent to DM783m.
Earnings per share were DM55, up from DM51.
Like other car companies, BMW is reducing its labour force to curb costs.
'We have to consider what we can afford and what we cannot,' he said. 'It is
a question of how much customers are prepared to pay.' This year's
reduction, not involving redundancies, will be around 3,000 out of its
workforce of 74,000.

FT  02 APR 92 / Caution dominates steadier Tokyo market

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BARGAIN HUNTERS helped to steady the Tokyo stock market in initial trading
early today, after the sharp drop yesterday despite a cut in the official
discount rate.
But sentiment remained predominantly cautious as Japan weighed the likely
impact of the rate cut and of the emergency package announced by the
government on Tuesday to try to stimulate the economy.
The Nikkei average was up 200 points in early trading. The steadier tone
came after the Nikkei plunged 764.16 to close at 18,581.79 in the previous
day's trading.
It was the first time since early 1987 that the market had slid through the
19,000-level. The fall was partly because investors who had bought shares
last autumn liquidated positions into a market with no buyers in sight.
Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, the central bank, yesterday
left no doubt that the official discount rate, lowered by 0.75 points to
3.75 per cent, had hit bottom, at least for the time being.
He said monetary policy was limited in its ability to stimulate the economy.
He described the rate cut as the final phase of credit easing, and said the
level was low by historical standards.
At the same time, Mr Mieno expressed confidence that the process of reducing
excess manufacturing inventories would continue. A build-up of unsold
inventories has caused manufacturing companies to cut output and has slowed
the pace of the economy. Mr Mieno said, however, that the interest rate cut,
combined with the government's financial package, would restore the economy
to a path of stable expansion.
The measures failed to coax investors in a large way back into the market
immediately. Life assurers, which were leading buyers of equities in the
late 1980s, have started to move from stock investments and into direct
corporate lending. The flow of money into investment trusts has also dried
up as individual investors have grown weary of the scandal-tainted market.
Investors with funds have been staying on the sidelines, convinced the
market may fall further. Analysts, nonetheless, said the decline would have
little effect on the broader economy.
'We don't think it will have any economic implications except for
confidence,' said Mr Paul Summerville, economist at Jardine Fleming. 'The
sources of growth in the Japanese economy are less dependent on the stock
market than in the last cycle.'
Ms Rie Ota, analyst at Baring Securities, said the decline in the market had
contributed to an erosion of capital asset ratios at Japan's commercial and
long-term credit banks.
The rate cut and the financial package were broadly welcomed by industrial
leaders. Mr Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of Employers'
Associations, praised the timing. Mr Keizo Saji, chairman of the Osaka
Chamber of Commerce and Industry, however, said the rate cut by itself was
insufficient, and called for lower taxes.

FT  02 APR 92 / EC-US agree on aircraft subsidies: Deal to limit government
support lifts hopes for progress on world trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community and US trade negotiators ended six years of intermittent
talks on aircraft subsidies early yesterday morning when they struck a deal
to limit direct and indirect government support to civil aircraft
manufacturers.
The agreement, which has yet to be approved by US and EC governments, will
remove one of the darkest clouds over their trade relations, and should
provide a psychological boost to the flagging world trade talks under the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Before leaving Brussels, Mr Michael Moskow, US deputy trade representative,
said he was 'very pleased' with the deal, which should become the
centrepiece of a multilateral agreement on aircraft subsidies under Gatt
next year. A senior EC official said the agreement would mean a leaner and
fitter aircraft industry on both sides of the Atlantic.
Airbus said the agreement had lifted 'an important question mark on whether
we could continue selling aircraft in the US without paying a penalty'. The
US had threatened to impose special duties on Airbus air-craft.
Boeing, the world's largest commercial aircraft maker, said it would not
comment until the agreement was ratified. But US manufacturers appeared to
consider the compromise as marking 'good progress'.
But there are already fears that conflict over interpretation of the
agreement may lead to new trade disputes, particularly in the sensitive area
of indirect subsidies and government inducements to help sell aircraft.
The dispute centred on US accusations that Airbus Industrie, the EC
manufacturing consortium, received direct development aid from EC
governments. In its turn, the Community claimed US manufacturers benefited
from massive support disguised as space or military research grants.
Both sides were forced to give ground to reach a compromise, although
neither would quantify the new subsidy limits yesterday.
EC negotiators believe the US has implicitly admitted that its manufacturers
benefit from indirect support, by agreeing to limit such grants to less than
5 per cent of each company's civil aircraft turnover.
The Community appears to have settled for an upper limit of about 30 per
cent on direct subsidies, as a proportion of total development costs, on
future airliner programmes compared with its original offer of 45 per cent.
The US will now drop its threat to pursue the Airbus case through Gatt or
take unilateral action against Airbus sales in its market.
But Mr Moskow made clear that a parallel complaint - against a German
government scheme to protect Deutsche Airbus from exchange rate fluctuations
 -was a separate case. The EC will not go along with a Gatt panel's
condemnation of the scheme although Bonn indicated this week it would alter
the exchange rate guarantees it gives Daimler-Benz, the parent of Deutsche
Airbus.

Tests at Toronto University show that a network of fungal filaments in the

What's more, the discovery of this creature, known technically as a 'fungal

Much play has been made with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew's resignation as joint
broker to Lonrho, and its impact on City confidence. But it's worth noting
that Lonrho has a habit of outliving its brokers.
Who remembers Joseph Sebag, for example? They were taken over by WI Carr a
long time ago, which in turn has been swallowed by other organisations and
regurgitated in virtually unrecognisable form. Capel-Cure Myers then took up
the Lonrho brokership and although its name still survives it is no longer a
force in corporate broking.
Lonrho's remaining broker Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull is not such a
name to conjure with, but its Lord Roger Manners and Tiny Rowland go back a
long, long way. By contrast, the relationship with UBS Phillips and Drew
could never be the same after Lonrho's Terry Robinson quit.

The newest addition to the list of those embarrassed by the fall from grace
of Control Securities' Nazmu Virani is no less than the Agha Khan. In
December 1990 Virani was appointed the UK member of the supreme advisory
body for the Agha Khan's 12m Ismaili Muslim followers throughout the world,
the International Conciliation and Arbitration Board.
As Virani was being remanded in custody for a week by City of London
Magistrates on charges of conspiring to present false accounts to the BCCI
auditors Price Waterhouse, the Agha Khan's headquarters staff in France were
unable to comment on the reasons for or details of his appointment.
For some of the faithful, however, the latest development will merely be
confirmation of their long-voiced misgivings about having a brewer in such a
senior Islamic position.

While other organisations may be promoting women to their top positions, the
Association of British Chambers of Commerce is doing the opposite. The
elegant damsel enthroned on a cornucopia, who has headed its notepaper
almost continuously since 1860, is being made redundant.
Not only is she past it herself, it seems, but there are problems with her
background - a pastel-hued montage of mill chimneys, kilns and sailing ship,
which doesn't show up on faxes. So she is being ditched for what the
association thinks will be a not only more fitting but more fetching image
for the 1990s when it hopes to recruit 60,000 more members.
Whether it will turn out to be right is another question; the replacement
for the delicate picture is a charmless letter-dominated logo. And the
damsel, for all her demure looks, has proved more than a match for such
things before.
In the 1970s the association jilted her for a hideous design of arrows, only
swiftly to see the error of its ways and restore her to her throne.

Would the old omens work again, the jittery Tokyo market wondered yesterday
as the Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank emerged in its brand new guise of the Sakura
Bank.
After all, in the market's gravity-defying heyday, when any excuse was good
enough for buying shares, none was better than a corporate name-change.
Moreover, sakura means 'cherry blossom' and the switch of identity had been
timed to coincide with the blooming of the blossoms as well as a new
financial year.
Alas, the omen that came true was the rain which has washed out this
spring's blossom-viewing, boding ill for the Japanese who see the delicate
pink petals as symbols of the fragility of life itself.
Down drooped the renamed bank's share-price by nigh on 10 per cent to a new
year's low and - despite brokers' protestations that they'd have liked to
place congratulatory buy orders - a probable portent of worse to come.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Howard Davies, controller of the Audit Commission, is a highly intelligent
and astute character. But is the man widely tipped as next director-general
of the CBI really right for the job?
After all, he is a virtual identi-kit of Sir John Banham, the outgoing
president. They even followed one another at the Audit Commission.
In many respects he is exactly the kind of person the CBI intended not to
appoint. After the Prudential's Sir Brian Corby became CBI president, there
were tensions with Banham, on the grounds that the latter was good at
orchestrating clever campaigns about the environment etc, but weak on
representing the core passions and ideas of business, especially of
manufacturing industry. There is a strong lobby that believes the CBI needed
someone on the lines of Sir Terence Beckett of Ford, who had actually run a
proper industrial business.
Davies's big advantage is that he seems to be apolitical whereas Corby is an
old-style Thatcherite. He has been very good indeed at the Audit Commission,
where he has tangled with the most unpleasant elements of Tory and Labour
municipal politics. With Unilever's departing Sir Michael Angus assuming the
CBI presidency next month, the CBI could argue it doesn't need another
industrialist as director-general.

FT  02 APR 92 / Towers of strength turn to pillars of sand: The UK property
market may have been through the worst of its decline, but the misery is not
yet over
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cracks in the UK's overborrowed and overbuilt commercial property market
are widening.
In the past two weeks, Olympia &amp; York, the world's largest property
developer responsible for the ambitious Canary Wharf project in the London
Docklands, has sought refinancing talks. So too has Heron International, the
property and finance group. On Tuesday Speyhawk, a development company,
revealed its liabilities exceeded its assets by Pounds 70m after losses of
Pounds 217m.
For a sector numbed by two years of disastrous news, these developments,
serve as a forceful reminder of the severity of the slump.
The decline is the worst for 50 years. Rental values are falling for the
first time since the Second World War. Capital values have dropped by some
30 per cent since their peak in September 1989. By contrast, in the property
crash of the the early 1970s, values fell by 15-20 per cent.
The scale of the downturn has been masked by the drawn-out and relatively
low-key nature of the crash. Property shares have slowly lost more than half
their value since November 1988. Some observers find the measured nature of
the adjustment reassuring. 'There is very little in the sector that remains
to be hit,' says one.
The banks may find the message from the stock market less reassuring,
however. Property companies - and their banks - have not yet acknowledged
the full depth of the fall in their portfolios, as is illustrated by the gap
between property share prices and companies' net assets, which averages a
hefty 35 per cent.
When the banks come to terms with the true reduced value of the assets, they
could find many of their loans may not be repaid in full. Estimates by
surveyors suggest the problem loans could be as high as Pounds 8bn. The
scale of the potential losses is a result of record increases in
international bank lending to the sector at the end of the 1980s, which rose
to more than Pounds 40bn last year.
Assessing the scale of the damage to the banks is complicated by a lack of
information. A City broker reckons that considerably more than half of the
loans were made to private companies with the rest split between publicly
quoted companies and housing trusts. Like an iceberg, the bulk of the
problem is invisible.
The banks are reasonably sanguine about the scale of the problem. Sir John
Quinton, chairman of Barclays, recently said UK banks' exposure to property
is not excessive, at 6.9 per cent of their total lending. At least half of
the Pounds 40bn debt was loaned before 1988 when asset values were similar
or lower than now. More than 60 per cent of loans were made to finance
income-producing investment property, where interest payments are not in
jeopardy.
One risk for the market is that banks will curb new loans, making it tougher
for some companies to refinance properties; another is that banks may be
less supportive of companies that fall into difficulties. Companies can no
longer take their banks' patience for granted. Speyhawk, with debts of just
Pounds 303m, has 46 bankers and they have agreed to support it. But in any
restructuring process, it takes just one unco-operative bank to scupper the
talks.
It is not clear yet whether a rash of large receiverships would tip the
property market into another spiral of decline. On one hand, some observers
argue that the overhang of property that is now or will eventually come on
to the market - and the shortage of would-be buyers  - is already being
taken account of in the low asking prices. The cheapness of property, by
historical standards, is reflected in the convergence of rental yields and
gilt yields. This has not been the case since the 1960s.
On the other hand, high-profile receiverships and debt restructuring could
have a depressing effect on investor confidence. 'The O&amp;Y saga will frighten
off less well-informed overseas investors,' says one broker.
However, experienced institutional investors have been attracted by the idea
of bottom-fishing for the best part of a year. Indeed, there has been
intense competition for a certain type of building, namely one that is high
yielding and let on a long lease to a financially strong tenant.
Few sales have resulted from such interest for two reasons: first, this type
of building accounts for perhaps 15 per cent of the market and, second, its
owners, typically, do not need to sell.
The overriding problem in the market is that many buildings are simply
unsellable because they cannot attract tenants. The combination of the
recession and the oversupply of buildings have left a forest of To Let signs
in British cities. Some buildings in the most overbuilt areas such as the
City and Docklands will never let.
With hindsight, the surge of speculative building at the end of the 1980s
seems reckless. But at the time, developers thought their buildings were
superior to the existing supply and would be easy to let and sell. O&amp;Y, for
instance, described many London offices as 'slums', believing that companies
wanted to regroup their head offices in state-of-the art buildings.
Developers might have been proved right, had it not been for the rigidity of
the UK lease structure. Tenants are locked into 25-year leases with
upward-only rent reviews every five years. Although asking rents for new
properties have tumbled, most tenants are still paying well above market
rates. Although businesses want to move to better offices, they cannot get
out of their existing leases.
Even buildings that do let will not necessarily help the developers' cash
flow. One of the industry's self-inflicted wounds is the custom of waiving a
tenant's rent for several years, rather than dropping the asking rent.
Although this may have artificially propped up values at the outset, it has
cut severely into cash flow.
The pain is not restricted to the new generation of developers that emerged
in the 1980s. The stalwarts of the market such as MEPC, Hammerson and Slough
Estates have all experienced problems. Some investors do not rule out a
dividend cut for top companies.
The worst prognosis is reserved for a UK election result that puts sterling
under pressure. Any rise in interest rates could be critical for a heavily
indebted company.
Furthermore, a rise in gilt yields would depress property values. Kleinwort
Benson Securities, the broker, estimates that in the event of a Labour-led
hung parliament, the fall in net asset values could be 15 per cent.
Whichever party wins power, the all-party commitment to the exchange rate
mechanism of the European Monetary System will perhaps have the greatest
impact on the property industry in the long run. If the constraints of ERM
membership continue to result in a relatively low rate of inflation,
overborrowed property investors will not be bailed out. as they were in
previous crashes.
The prospect of low inflation and high real interest rates should dash hopes
of a swift recovery. Rental growth will lag behind the recovery by as much
as three years, says UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the broker.
But the broker expects the values of offices in central London to fall by
another 23 per cent by the end of next year. The property market may have
been through the worst of its decline, but the misery is not yet over.

FT  02 APR 92 / Arts: Dimitrij - Bavarian State opera, Munich
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This was not the triumphant vindication of Dvorak's grand Russian opera for
which many had been hoping and which the work has long deserved. It amounted
to little more than a swift succession of bleeding chunks, hacked from Milan
Pospisil's new edition of the original 1882 score (not credited in the
programme book) and stitched together with a German translation to make just
over two hours of music.
The perpetrator of this crude musical butchery was Gerd Albrecht, who
crippled Tchaikovsky's Maid of Orleans in exactly the same way in Munich two
seasons ago, and then walked out of this Dimitrij production after the first
day of rehearsal because of disagreements with the producer, Tony Palmer.
Albrecht's complete recording with Czech forces has just been released on
Supraphon, and may offer some mitigation.
The opera picks up the story of the Polish Pretender to the Tsarist crown
after the death of Boris Godunov, and nicely complements the Mussorgsky work
in the current Munich repertory.
The Munich production was too fragmented to allow the long melodic arcs and
breathtaking choral tableaux to be heard in their proper context. Too often
one extended scena would come to an abrupt end, only to give way instantly
to another, with no linking material. In the circumstances, the young
Russian stand-in conductor, Nicholas Ulyanov, did a competent job, though
there was not the sense of engagement that comes from long study of a score,
nor the necessary choral attack and variation of orchestral dynamics.
But the production had been well cast. The title role calls for a dramatic
tenor who can sing with Italianate lyricism and agility, and Ben Heppner met
the requirements perfectly. His voice has a Domingo-like fluidity, but it is
tighter, with a cutting edge that pierces the thickest orchestral climaxes.
He knows how to colour the words, and cuts a big, commanding figure without
seeming ungainly - unlike the Marina, Luana DeVol. The other saving grace of
the performance was the poised, pretty Xenia of the Slovak soprano, Livia
Aghova, who is probably the Rusalka of our dreams. The remaining principal
roles - particularly Shuisky (Gottfried Hornik) and Marfa, beautifully sung
from the side of the stage by Pamela Coburn while the indisposed Livia Budai
acted the part - were reduced to a cipher.
About Palmer's broad, emblematic staging, probably the less said the better.
Goran Wassberg's single set conveyed the bleak void of the Kremlin square
and was flanked by a vast array of gold icons, making for some
seductively-lit stage pictures.
But Palmer completely ducked the political issues in the opera - the
relationship between power and legitimacy, the occupation of one country by
another's forces - which are of striking relevance to the Slav nations
today. And he seemed hopelessly tied to operatic conventions in his movement
of chorus and principals.

There are four themes running through this year's Edinburgh Festival, the
first under the stewardship of Brian McMaster, formerly controller of the
Welsh National Opera.
The most obvious is the music of Tchaikovsky. A retrospective embraces 30
events. The highlights are a concert performance of his rarely staged opera
The Oprichnik, by Scottish Opera on August 20; his Cantata Moscow on
September 3; and a re-creation of his original opera and ballet double-bill
Yolanta and The Nutcracker from August 26-29.
Another theme is a series of five concerts featuring music by Scottish
composers, including the Scottish premiere of James McMillan's Percussion
Concerto performed by Evelyn Glennie.
Drama includes retrospectives devoted to Harley Granville Barker, including
his three major works, The Voysey Inheritance, The Madras House and His
Majesty, and to the Glasgow-born playwright C. P. Taylor. The National
Theatre brings Lope de Vega's Fuente Ovejuna.

DECEIVED (15) Damian Harris
KUFFS (15)Bruce E. Evans
SCORSESE TIMES 4 Martin Scorsese
LA BELLE NOISEUSE DIVERTIMENTO (15) Jacques Rivette
Dear Oscar,
What a pleasure to see you in action again. Watching you on television the
other night, I was glad to see that you are as bronzed and fit as ever,
despite so much pawing by the great and famous.
One or two points about the 1992 awards. I was intrigued and pleased to see
The Silence Of The Lambs sweep five top prizes, although the selection of
this idiosyncratic horror film by the normally conservative Academy
surprised me. Frankly - I might as well come out with it - I suspect there
was an element of homophobic counter-attack here. All those gay
demonstrators converging on the Oscars gala to protest about Hollywood's
obsession with gay or bisexual killers, as instanced in Silence: here was a
chance for the Academy to stand up in full evening wear, stiffen its sinews
(under the guise of a 'liberal' choice) and say 'Ya boo' to them.
Unfair? Well, Oscar, you were there. But never mind: I am quietly delighted,
as every Briton should be, at the same film allowing best actor Anthony
Hopkins to make it three in a row for the UK. The Welsh wizard made a meal
of Hannibal Lecter, who in turn was so touchingly keen to make a meal of
everyone else. The progression of these Oscar-winning British roles, I must
note, is becoming somewhat alarming. From the innocence of a handicapped
Irish poet (Daniel Day Lewis) to a suspected wife-poisoner (Jeremy Irons)
and now to a cannibalistic serial killer. If Britain is to make it four in a
row, it is probably time to get Alan Rickman into costume for the Marquis De
Sade.
I was disappointed in the actress awards. Jodie Foster has won it before,
for a more challenging role in The Accused, and I thought Mercedes Ruehl was
over-the-top in The Fisher King. But dear Jack Palance] The man with the
snake-hiss voice and the face like the back end of a container truck was a
delight in City Slickers. And he gave the awards night audience what they
wanted: the sight of a 70-year-old actor doing press-ups. More inspiring to
most of us than those garish song-and-dance numbers with which you started
and intermittently punctuated your show.
No, no, Oscar, I am not getting into a quarrel. Nor am I suggesting that you
imitate the etiolated dullness of your cousin Bafta. He is not looking at
all well. The other evening he was reduced to a haggard mask waved about in
the air by Michael Aspel. When handed over for further brandishing to the
Best Actor and Actress, he began to look particularly green about the gills.
I shall get into trouble for writing this, of course. We take our native
screen awards seriously here, although few people sit through an entire
evening of them in any comfort. All those prizes given to long-serving TV
producers no one has heard of, to ageing actor-knights still ambulant enough
to collect them, and to lovable international female stars from an era when
we actually had such things.
So many speeches, so much crepitation of freshly-opened envelopes. So much
clapping of the winners by the telegraphically generous losers. Is there any
chance we could end all this, Oscar? That cinema could be return to being an
art rather than a horse race? That we could turn our back on all that
glitters in pursuit once more of what is truly gold?
You do not have to answer immediately. I am arranging a small secret dinner
on the Cayman Islands for you and Bafta in which we could discuss this. It
will be a quiet affair: just a few hours of good food and entertainment
hosted by Billy Crystal, directed by Busby Berkeley and with the menu
courses read out by Goldie Hawn and Sir Richard Attenborough.
I close the envelope,
Best, Nigel Andrews
                           *      *      *
By a strange coincidence Miss Hawn is on view this week in Deceived (15,
Odeon West End). It is often said that there are only four basic plots in
the world. If so, this thriller written by Mary Agnes Donoghue and directed
by Damian Harris (The Rachel Papers) consists of all of them put into a
blender together and sliced into tiny screaming pieces.
We begin romantically with Miss Hawn marrying gentle art curator John Heard.
We move into mystery with her suspicion that her husband is playing hookey.
We shift into grief when he 'dies' in a car accident. Then we gear-crash
into Grand Guignol as Hawn and the true villain chase each other through a
darkened warehouse.
Amazingly the actress's expression never changes. The wide-eyed gosling
features peer through the Niagara of hair, the voice tastes the dialogue
ruminatively as if it were a suspicious dish (it is), and sometimes a small
scream and hop will be managed in deference to a dramatic moment: say, the
discovery of a corpse. If this is acting, I think I could have a go myself.
Much better is Mr Heard who is an eerie Mr Nice and might be - I am giving
nothing away - an equally eerie Mr Nasty.
Deceived is entertaining even when it is foolish. Kuffs (15, Cannon
Haymarket) is stupefying even when it manages small moments of intelligence.
Watching this police thriller written and directed by Bruce E. Evans is the
aesthetic equivalent of swallowing a bottle of aspirins and then hitting
yourself on the head with a coal shovel to make sure.
Across San Francisco swarm the men in dark blue, led by plain-clothes
irregular Christian Slater who hopes to avenge his policeman brother's
brutal death. A preening Mr Big (George De La Pena) dances across the city
saying 'Catch me'. But the equally preening Mr Slater is too busy talking to
the camera and perfecting his Jack Nicholson impersonation to devote himself
as he might to the chase. It all ends in a warehouse, as things do in action
films, and only careful traffic direction probably prevented Slater and
company running into Hawn and company
At least in an imperfect world there is Martin Scorsese. Scorsese Times 4
(ICA) is a programme of his early short films: the kind of potentially
embarrassing work that many film-makers would like to wrap in a sack, weight
with a stone and throw into the nearest river.
But the director of Taxi Driver and GoodFellas has nothing to be ashamed of
in What's A Girl Like You Doing In A Place Like This?, It's Not Just You,
Murray], The Big Shave and Italianamerican. The films get longer as the
titles get shorter.
But longueurs themselves do not exist in Scorsese. Here is rapid cutting and
balletic camera movement. Here are visual jokes Woody Allen might covet,
like a prisoner's Italian spaghetti through the interview-room grille. And
here are the nervy characterisation and crisis-point plotting - a con man
running out of luck, a shaving session that becomes a suicide ballet - that
have allowed Scorsese to create the closest thing American cinema has to
modern tragedy.
Finally, for the devout: two hours of La Belle Noiseuse Divertimento (15,
Minema) to add to the four hours of La Belle Noiseuse. Painter Michel
Piccoli once more sets out to eternalise a nude Emmanuelle Beart while wife
Jane Birkin jealously looks on.
Director Jacques Rivette here offers a reshuffled version as well as a
(contractually obliged) shorter one. It is an offer few Rivette fans could
refuse.
But if there are any more variations on who does what to whom in this
time-devouring, intrigue-ridden French mansion we may have to summon H.
Poirot or J. Maigret.

If the experience of Peter Walker and Norman Tebbit is any guide, ex-Tory
cabinet ministers should have no difficulty picking up a clutch of
impressive non-executive directorships. There is therefore some surprise at
Cecil Parkinson's first foray into the boardroom since being free from
Parliament. He has been appointed a non-executive director of Usborne, a
relatively small firm of grain merchants and pig producers with a market
capitalisation of just Pounds 10m and an unimpressive share price record. It
is understood that Parkinson and David Frame, Usborne's chief executive, did
their chartered accountancy articles together and have known each other for
a long time. Parkinson's office said yesterday that he was likely to take up
other non-executive directorships. In the meantime his construction
expertise should come in handy as Usborne extricates itself from an
ill-timed venture into property development.

FT  02 APR 92 / Accountancy Column: Budget extravaganza and electoral
headache
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE THE announcement of the general election may have caused some
parliamentary stomachs to churn in Westminster, it has also generated a bout
of gleeful hand-rubbing among tax accountants.
A combination of the Budget, electoral uncertainty, and new-found aggressive
marketing have created a platform during the last few weeks by which tax
practices have gained a higher profile and sold more services than probably
ever before.
While the heyday of Budget-related marketing may now have been passed, the
prospects of a change of government have given business a strong
compensatory boost.
Arthur Andersen was the first firm to land a slim summary of the Budget
proposals in this writer's in-tray first thing in the morning after the
Chancellor's speech, with the ink barely dry. The booklet - produced in
conjunction with the Confederation of British Industry - was arriving in
Volvo showrooms and Holiday Inns at the same time.
Others firms have been equally aggressive. Touche Ross had copies of its
guide to the Budget on the QE2 and other Cunard ships the following day.
Salvoes from other firms generated healthy income for the Royal Mail. There
were evening presentations and next-day breakfasts for clients and
journalists alike.
The reason for the gimmickry is simple. As Mr John Barnsley, head of tax at
Price Waterhouse, puts it: 'Tax is very big business. Internationally it
pulled us more than Dollars 1bn last year.' Two years ago his firm sent its
Budget day analysis by computer to New York, where it was printed and ready
for the evening Concorde flight back to London.
If media references are anything to go by, the Budget has pushed the
profession into higher prominence than ever. Last month the top six
accountancy firms were mentioned in 106 national newspaper articles on the
budget. That compared with only 60 references for the same period last year
and 54 in 1990. (Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte toppedthe 1992 list, followed by
Touche Ross and Ernst &amp; Young.)
As the firms hold their post-mortems on the marketing success of budget day,
most are subdued. Mr Roger White, head of tax at KPMG Peat Marwick, points
out that his firm's post-budget briefing was deliberately 'de-glossified'
this year and that it has abandoned the 'lavish entertainment' of the past.
That is due partly to a budget with a fewer significant changes than in
previous years, and with fewer still translated into legislation in the
Finance Act. It also reflects thinking that a new Budget may follow later in
the year.
The extravaganza has also become something of a victim of the relaxation of
rules on marketing and advertising by the profession in the mid-1980s.
Before then, it was one of the few chances accountants had to get their name
out to the public. Now, in an era of intense price competition and ethical
guidelines that allow firms to indulge in cold-calling, budget breakfasts
look positively old-fashioned.
'We have discussed abandoning the Budget booklet, but the feeling is that
our clients like to receive it,' says Mr David Marks, a tax partner with
marketing responsibilities at Arthur Andersen.
He says the booklet coincides with a more detailed internal document
distributed to tax partners, which helps them instruct clients personally.
That view is shared by Mr Peter Collier, chief executive of the Charter
Group, which provides professional support services to small accountancy
firms. Last month one of the services was 35,000 copies of a Budget summary
distributed to client firms' doorsteps the morning after.
'There are two schools of thought,' he says. ''Everybody does a Budget
summary, so why bother?' or 'If we're not doing one and everyone else is,
there is a danger of not keeping our profile high enough.''
Most firms in his group have taken the latter view, much to his surprise:
'There are more important ways to show clients value for money, but it's
very easy to be noticed as the one firm in, say, Rotherham which didn't
produce a summary.'
Even so, more subtle, discriminating marketing techniques still make great
play of the Budget and its corollaries. Mr Barnsley of PW is sceptical about
the spate of skimpy instant publications produced by accountants. This year
he established a media hotline for the shadow Budget, which provided advice
to journalists interpreting the proposals.
He says the firm has also been quietly advising the major political parties
about the implications of tax changes, while treading a delicate line in
striving to remain apolitical and to ensure that its comments do not impinge
on work for clients.
Coopers earlier this week provided free of charge to national newspapers a
detailed analysis of the fiscal 'holes'it believes exist in the manifestos.
While the Budget may have had a subdued impact on accountancy firms, the
strong possibility of a Conservative defeat in the election has helped
increase work for their tax staff beyond the advice that is normal at the
end of the tax year.
Mr Peter Wyman, a tax partner with Coopers,says: 'People are now very
worried. Up until the last two weeks they somehow thought the Conservatives
were going to get back in. Now, if they are not panicking, they are
certainly concerned.'
MAI, the financial services group, admitted at the start of the week that it
is paying bonuses to more than 300 staff in one of its money broking
subsidiaries in gold bars through Jersey. That makes the payments exempt
from National Insurance contributions.
BHS, the retailer, has emerged as one of the latest in a series of employers
to be paying bonuses to senior managers before the year end, which would
escape any rises in income tax under Labour.
At the same time there is evidence that some companies are deferring capital
expenditure in the hope of greater tax relief under Labour - a consideration
that is also delaying the prospects for economic recovery.
Accountants are reporting an increase in inquiries as news of such tactics
trickles out. Mr Maurice Parry-Wingfield, national technical tax partner at
Touche Ross, estimates that the election has generated perhaps five times
the level of interest and activity normal at this time of year, and even
three times that of the previous general election in 1987, when a Tory
victory seemed more probable.
It is not all good news for the tax practitioners this year, however. Mr
Norman Lamont's Budget promised a shift from quarterly to monthly VAT
remittances for the largest payers as part of moves to help progress towards
the single European market. Several accountancy firms will be among the
businesses required to provide cash more frequently.
The proposal to bring together both the budget and the government's
expenditure plans in December for future years (which has been echoed by the
opposition parties) also means trouble for some accountancy firms. That
month is one of the busiest of the year for audit work, and it will place
considerable additional demands on staff already coping with extra tax work.
Mr Peter Wyman from Coopers is one partner who concedes that a Labour
victory would probably be good for his firm. Tax legislation is likely to be
more complicated, and higher rates are likely to encourage more people and
companies to seek advice on avoidance strategies.
Much, however, that the Labour party would give indirectly to the
accountancy firms through new tax legislation, it might well recoup directly
in extra corporate and income taxes.

FT  02 APR 92 / Record price made for Japanese sword: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHRISTIE'S sold in New York on Tuesday part of the superb collection of
Japanese swords and sword fittings assembled by the late Walter A. Compton.
The 399 lots fetched Dollars 7.99m (Pounds 4.6m), a record for an auction of
Japanese work.
Swords were revered as religious symbols by the Japanese, and a samurai
regarded his blade as far more valuable than land or gold. The top price was
Dollars 418,000, a record for a sword. It was paid by a private European
collector for a Fukuoka Ichimonji tachi, or long sword for mounted warriors.
It was forged in the 13th century and signed Ichi.
A Japanese dealer acquired a Soshu Ichimonji tachi, signed Sukezane, and
made in about 1250, for Dollars 374,000. A Japanese private buyer paid
Dollars 341,000 for an Osaka Inoue katana, a short blade used in fighting on
foot, signed Inoue Shinkai and dated 1677. All three prices were comfortably
above forecast. A Shinshinto Musashi tachi of about 1850, which was
estimated at Dollars 25,000, sold for Dollars 242,000.
Compton started building one of the finest sword collections in 1963.
Christie's plans two more sales of the swords and should exceed its Dollars
20m estimate for the 1,000 lots.
Sotheby's in London sold second-division Old Master paintings with some
success. The morning session raised Pounds 1.5m with less than 13 per cent
unsold. A portrait of two children attributed to Moroni sold to a Swiss
collector for Pounds 187,000, against an estimate of Pounds 30,000 to Pounds
40,000.

He said in Derby that two prototype trains would be ordered immediately

independent design controllers. British Rail would be invited to renew the
track and signalling and a training programme would be started to increase
the pool of electrical engineers.
Mr Prescott said the programme would 'lead to high-speed rail links for
passengers and freight before the end of the century'. He added that Labour

FT  02 APR 92 / A bumpy ride on a firmer track: The outlook for
rolling-stock maker Brel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 6,500 workers at Brel, the largest UK railway rolling-stock maker, may
be relieved that the troubled company is coming under the majority control
of Asea Brown Boveri - but they may be in for a bumpy ride.
By purchasing the 40 per cent stake in Brel held by Trafalgar House, the
Swiss-Swedish company ABB has at least resolved part of the uncertainty over
Brel.
Ownership of Brel now looks secure, with Europe's largest electrical
engineering group holding 80 per cent and managers and employees sharing the
rest.
But Brel now faces the prospect of becoming a much more integrated part of
ABB, and that is where the question marks remain.
The deal might open the way for Brel to benefit from closer co-operation
with ABB and share in work on overseas orders. Even so, Mr Bo Sodersten,
installed as chief executive by ABB and Trafalgar House six months ago to
revamp Brel's badly-organised management structure, stresses this will
depend on Brel's continuing efforts to improve competitiveness.
At the same time, though, the share purchase brings Brel closer to a big ABB
division, transport, which is not exactly the star in the multinational's
firmament.
In Stockholm last month Mr Percy Barnevik, ABB's hard-driving president,
made clear that he remained dissatisfied with the profitability of a
division with 12,000 employees, excellent technology and rising orders, but
also profits that were low in 1990 and lower still last year.
ABB's transport business, like most of the rest of Europe's rail equipment
sector, is struggling to emerge from its fragmented, inefficient and
nationally-based past into a pan-European market where the old cosy
'cost-plus' relationships between suppliers and railway companies are
loosening.
ABB has been a key factor in the resultant restructuring, with nine
acquisitions across Europe since 1988. This helped boost its transportation
revenues from Dollars 1.31bn (Pounds 743m) in 1990 to Dollars 1.9bn last
year, but profits remain depressed.
Mr Barnevik says, however, the mid and long-term external outlook is bright,
with the 'comeback' of railways in Europe and Asian expansion plans offering
tempting prospects for well-organised European suppliers.
Brel's future could benefit from the expected world growth in rolling-stock
sales. Mr Sodersten says it will be 'much easier to find really good areas
of co-operation now that ABB has 80 per cent of the company'.
Brel has a solid repair and overhaul business at Crewe, where Mr Sodersten
has had little need to wield the hatchet. Its problem has mainly been that
of management, and particularly in its new construction business at York and
Derby.
Mr Richard Hope, consultant editor of Railway Gazette International, says:
'That's what brought them to grief. They have not been organised in getting
their components suppliers and subcontractors lined up.'
Mr Sodersten has had to reorganise management of the new construction
division, and across Brel as a whole 1,000 jobs have gone since he took
charge. He is pleased with what has been achieved, but admits more needs to
be done.
While the restructuring under Mr Sodersten continues, the short-term key to
Brel's survival, let alone prosperity, is work from the UK. That is why
observers believe this week's settlement of an acrimonious dispute with
British Rail over the cost of modifications to 447 class-158 coaches is
significant.
While not directly linked, it looks like smoothing the path for the award by
BR in the next few days of a Pounds 130m order for 188 coaches for Network
SouthEast.
Capturing such orders, and sharing in ABB's transportation growth, will be
crucial in deciding any further job cuts at Brel.

FT  02 APR 92 / British Coal profit higher than last year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL is to announce record profits for the second successive year,
the corporation said yesterday. Profits will be even higher than last year,
when the corporation made Pounds 78m, its first profit for 15 years.
The corporation also announced its biggest increase in productivity, which
rose from an average of 4.7 tonnes per manshift last year to 5.3 tonnes this
year. British Coal also set a new productivity target of 7.5 tonnes per
manshift within two years.
Mr Neil Clarke, chairman, said: 'It's quite clear British Coal has made
another tremendous leap forward in terms of efficiency'.
Last year, 15 pits closed, but the corporation still produced 70.5m tonnes
of coal, just 1m tonnes less than the year before.
The corporation's improved record will be an important bargaining counter
for British Coal as it negotiates important new contracts to sell coal to
the electricity generators, National Power and PowerGen, who buy about 80
per cent of the corporation's coal.

FT  02 APR 92 / Tube line in Docklands is wins support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday expressed support for extending London Underground's
Jubilee Line to Docklands. But it stopped short of offering to provide funds
if Olympia &amp; York, the property developer, failed to provide its share of
the finance.
O&amp;Y agreed under a proposal announced by the Department of Transport in 1989
to contribute Pounds 400m to the cost of the Pounds 1.3bn project, with the
rest coming from the government. There is also thought to be a smaller
contribution due from British Gas.
Ms Joan Ruddock, a shadow transport minister, said: 'We are not seeking any
variation of the proposals. The plan (for the extension) is there ready to
start. We want O&amp;Y to come up with the money.'
O&amp;Y, which is holding debt-restructuring talks with its banks, was
originally expected to pay Pounds 40m towards the project on Tuesday.
However, the Department of Transport has said that if the agreement with O&amp;Y
about its contribution to the project's costs is not concluded before the
election, the first payment will become due on the day the agreement is
signed. Ms Ruddock declined to be drawn on reports that O&amp;Y and its banks
might seek to reduce their contribution - a move that would almost certainly
shift the onus to the Treasury.
'We still expect Olympia &amp; York or its bankers and British Gas to honour
their financial commitments to this scheme,' she said. 'Clearly we want to
see whatever is on offer and see how best the contract can be drawn up.' If
O&amp;Y carried out its 'moral obligation' and came up with its share, there was
'no reason why the extension should not go ahead within the original
timetable'.
Last week Mr Wilfred Newton, chairman of London Transport, wrote to Sir
Jeremy Morse, chairman of Lloyds Bank - which is co-ordinating the UK
restructuring of O&amp;Y - saying that O&amp;Y's obligations on the Jubilee Line
should be met. 'You will, of course, be aware of the crucial importance of
the Jubilee Line extension to the medium and long- term fortunes of Olympia
&amp; York's development at Canary Wharf,' he wrote.
Labour hopes O&amp;Y and its bankers will back the project because of the risk
that failure to do so might jeopardise Canary Wharf.

FT  02 APR 92 / Decline in housing index slows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSE PRICES fell in February for the fourth successive month, the latest
index published by Nationwide Building Society shows. But the fact that
February's decline was only 0.2 per cent has kindled hopes of a recovery.
In each of the previous three months house prices fell by well over 1
percentage point, and prices have fallen in nine of the past 12 months.
Mr David Gilchrist, general manager of Halifax Building Society, the largest
UK mortgage lender, said the figures suggested that the housing market might
have bottomed out after three years. 'We think that the market is on the
turn and this should be clearly seen this spring,' he added.
Mr Peter Munday, Nationwide's divisional director, said: 'March is
traditionally a busy time in the housing market, and early in the month we
were seeing strong signs of increased activity.' But he added that many
people might be delaying buying until after the election.
Last month's slight fall compares with an 0.7 per cent rise in house prices
in March last year. The average UK house price now stands at Pounds 55,193,
4.9 per cent lower than a year ago.

FT  02 APR 92 / Rise in complaints about government departments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPLAINTS by the public about their treatment by government departments and
official bodies have increased sharply in spite of the Citizen's Charter,
which aims to improve the quality of public services, according to a report
by Mr William Reid, the parliamentary ombudsman.
A total of 801 complaints were made about maladministration last year, 13.7
more than the previous year and the highest number since 1984. More than a
quarter of complaints were about the Department of Social Security, with 16
per cent about the Inland Revenue.
The number of investigations last year - up 29 per cent to 215 - rose much
faster than the number of complaints. The ombudsman found that 90 per cent
of complaints were partly or wholly justified, in line with previous years.

FT  02 APR 92 / Doubt cast on minimum-wage link to job losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RESEARCH on the effect of wages councils on employment in the UK has cast
doubt on the assumption that the introduction of a national minimum wage, as
proposed by Labour, would lead to a significant increase in unemployment.
Mr Stephen Machin and Mr Alan Manning argue in a paper for the Centre for
Economic Performance at the London School of Economics that the minimum
wages set by wages councils for about 2.5m workers have not reduced
employment. 'If anything,' they say, 'there is weak evidence that they have
increased it.'
They say that researchers who have concluded that a minimum wage would
increase unemployment have not looked at the economics of particular
sections of the labour market. They also point to the fact that employment
of women continued to rise after the 1970 Equal Pay Act.
The paper notes that the toughness of the control imposed by wages councils
declined in the 1980s as a result of government intervention, but there was
no corresponding increase in employment. Indeed, when wages councils were
tougher there was a positive effect on employment.
'Employment has declined as a result of the decreasing effectiveness of the
wages councils, an effect that seems particularly strong in the catering
sector,' they conclude. 'Our findings cannot tell us anything about the
employment effects of a minimum wage at Pounds 3.40 an hour. However, they
do question proposals aimed at abolishing the wages council system on the
grounds that it inhibits job creation.'

FT  02 APR 92 / German challenge to Farnborough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GERMAN aerospace industry is challenging Britain by staging in June its
first air show in Berlin since the Second World War. It will be only three
months before the Farnborough air show at the beginning of September.
The challenge reflects Germany's ambitions for its aerospace industry, which
has been regrouped around Daimler-Benz, the industrial group. Sir Barry
Duxbury, the director of the Society of British Aerospace Companies, the
organiser of Farnborough, conceded yesterday that the German move was
increasing the competition in the world of air shows.
But he said he was confident Farnborough would retain its lead and that the
show this year would be a success in spite of the recession, the decline in
the airline industry and the cuts in the defence industry.
Farnborough and Paris are the leading international air shows and alternate
every other year. The society and its French equivalent are determined to
maintain the current standing of their respective shows.

FT  02 APR 92 / Howard Davies to be CBI chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Confederation of British Industry is expected to announce next week the
appointment of Mr Howard Davies, controller of the Audit Commission, as its
new director-general.
He will replace Sir John Banham, who also was controller of the Audit
Commission, the local-government watchdog, before becoming director-general
of the CBI in 1987.
The CBI said there had been 'a great deal of speculation' about the post,
which had attracted more than 100 applicants. It added that an announcement
was expected on election day, when the organisation's ruling council meets.
The choice of a CBI director-general is the responsibility of Sir Brian
Corby, the organisation's retiring president. He is to be replaced by Sir
Michael Angus, chairman of Unilever.
Mr Davies has apparently been chosen because of his political contacts and
organisational experience. He spent a period at the Treasury while on
secondment from McKinsey, the management consultants, as an advisor to Mr
Nigel Lawson when he was chancellor. He was appointed controller of the
Audit Commission after Sir John's departure.

FT  02 APR 92 / Lamont optimism on recovery finds glimmer of support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN LAMONT, the chancellor, said yesterday Britain's economic recovery
may be under way. He was rewarded by tentative evidence of improved business
conditions from parts of industry.
Mr Lamont said on the BBC's Today programme: 'It may be that when the
statistics are compiled that we will see that recovery has already started.'
Hours later his claim gained some support from a survey of UK purchasing
managers and signs of greater optimism in the lighting industry. A report
from 3i, the venture capital group, and Cranfield School of Management said
smaller UK businesses were more hopeful than their continental counterparts
that profits would improve this year.
The Institute of Purchasing and Supply reported that its purchasing
managers' index rose to 54.1 per cent last month from 50.8 per cent in
February and 48.1 per cent in December last year. It said that suggested
'significant economic growth is under way in the manufacturing economy'.
The Lighting Industry Federation, which represents companies with total
annual turnover of Pounds 650m and 17,000 employees, said its latest monthly
trends inquiry pointed to a recovery in orders since January with nearly
half the companies polled expecting to increase output in the next four
months.
Neither of these indicators has a known track record, however, although one
economist said they might be 'straws in the wind'. The purchasing managers'
survey, which is based on techniques developed in the US, started in July
last year.
The latest Treasury survey of independent economic forecasts, published
yesterday, found that the average expectation of growth this year fell to 1
per cent in March from 1.2 per cent in February.
Meanwhile, a bleak analysis of economic developments from Mr Peter
Warburton, the monetarist chief economist of Robert Fleming Securities,
warned that there is little chance of growth without a fall in interest
rates and a devaluation of sterling in the European exchange rate mechanism.

FT  02 APR 92 / Election 1992: Labour's 'time for change' theme strikes a
chord - North-west England is crucial for the Opposition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF LABOUR fails to capture most of its target seats in the north-west of
England next week, even the party's most committed supporters might begin to
question its ability ever again to form a government.
Political gifts have been showered upon the party with such profligacy by
its Conservative opponents that initial assessments made three weeks ago by
experienced Labour agents have, so far, been exceeded.
At the outset of the campaign they said that what they hoped would see
Labour home was nothing more positive than '13 years, time for a change'. It
has been a simple, very effective message and one that, on the doorsteps and
during public debates, neither Conservative candidates nor Central Office
have been able to counter.
Going to the country hoping for a fresh mandate after 13 years in government
and against a background of rising unemployment and business failures may
have been stretching optimism beyond reasonable levels.
Worse still for the Tories, the election campaign has brought to the surface
resentments and even a sense of personal betrayal among voters who suffered
for the cause in the early 1980s and came to believe in aspects of the
Thatcher economic miracle. To be, as they see it, back at square one is a
reversal that is hard to bear.
Mr Alistair Burt, defending Bury North, summed up the dilemma for many more
of his supporters when he said that what they were looking for was a reason
to continue voting Conservative. With a week until polling day, it seems
that while some are still searching, others may have given up.
None of the key issues which Tory leaders have chosen to highlight has
achieved much resonance in the north-west. Those in the region liable to be
hit hardest by Labour's income tax and national insurance proposals may be
assumed to be Conservatives.
Most others appear ready to identify themselves as the 80 per cent whom Mr
John Smith says would benefit from his first Budget as chancellor.
Conservative attacks on Labour's proposals for a Pounds 3.40-an-hour minimum
wage have been met with similarly little response. A few extra pence a week
for the lowest paid serves what many northerners see as a need for greater
justice in financial rewards.
And, for Conservative candidates, opposition to a minimum wage sits
miserably alongside the huge pay rises awarded to chief executives in newly
privatised public utilities.
Rising crime figures in the region offer equally little scope on the law and
order issue, while foreign policy questions such as the Gulf war and the
great themes of European integration scarcely warrant a mention.
But if the Tories cannot make ground on their chosen issues, they are
certainly losing it in the critical arena of the health service. Labour's
broadcast last week featuring the case of Jennifer Bennett probably did not
win it many votes, but it is so far ahead of the Conservatives on this issue
that it mattered little.
The health service in the north-west has become almost part of local
folklore. Stop anyone in Greater Manchester and if they have not been
subjected to a hospital waiting list then they know of somebody who has.
Prompt health care is viewed as part of the British birthright, and no
amount of Conservative argument has been able to shift the suspicion that
the service is being undermined.
Then there is the poll tax. In the modestly rated terraced houses and
semi-detacheds of the north-west it produced a financial shock two years ago
which has not been forgotten and, worse for the Tories, is being recalled
this week as payment demands for the coming year's poll tax are pushed
through millions of letter-boxes.
What has checked a higher level of Conservative disaffection appears to be
essentially the Labour party's lack of positive appeal. This in turn helps
explain the increase noted over the past 10 days in the number of people who
say they will vote for the Liberal Democrats and would welcome a parliament
in which no one party has an overall majority.
But the rising tide of optimism among Labour workers this week cannot
disguise the modest enthusiasm for the party among voters who are switching
allegiances.
The most often-heard reason on the doorstep for changing sides is not that
Labour is deemed to have exciting or convincing policies, but that it could
not do any worse than the Conservatives.
There are also serious and sometimes unresolvable doubts expressed by
undecided voters over the ability of Mr Neil Kinnock to lead the country.
Just as there are Conservative candidates who in their latest campaign
literature have managed to avoid almost any mention of their party, so there
are Labour candidates who in public speeches never refer to Mr Kinnock.
Instead it is the reassuring presence of Mr John Smith who is most often
invoked to underline Labour's commitment to sound finances and good
housekeeping.
Either side of the centre there is a desire to see politicians working
together for the greater good of the nation, an invocation of the spirit of
wartime. Such voters would be pleased to see Mr Major and Mr Smith
co-operating while Mr Kinnock and Mr Lamont retired from public view.
It was always going to be hugely difficult for the Conservatives to justify
another five years when the culmination of the past 13 was so difficult to
defend. If Labour does as well as it expects in the north-west, it will be
primarily because it has not blocked that message from reaching the
electorate.

FT  02 APR 92 / Unions reject chemical industry's 4% offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH and CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIONS representing 20,000 chemical process workers have rejected an offer
by employers which would lead to minimum pay rates rising about 4 per cent.
The employers agreed to provide 3.76 per cent in new money. Consolidation of
other payments would lead to a 4.16 per cent rise in the minimum rate,
taking it to Pounds 3.88 an hour.
Negotiating through the Chemical Industries Association, the employers
rejected union claims for a cut in the 39-hour week and an increase in
holidays. They agreed to establish a group to look at equal opportunities.
Increases in minimum rates do not necessarily lead to comparable increases
for all workers as the industry practices two-tier bargaining through which
local negotiations supplement national talks.
Until recently most companies followed the percentage rise pattern set by
the national talks. The association believes there has been more variation
during the recession. RMT, Britain's largest rail union, is likely today to
reject British Rail's 4 per cent pay offer for 100,000 staff.

FT  02 APR 92 / Election 1992: A thorn in the red rose's side - How Terry
Fields may harm Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH its opinion poll leads it may seem unlikely that Labour could lose a
seat in Liverpool, but some in the party are braced for the shock.
The foe in question is not the Conservatives, but the old enemy within -
Militant Tendency. The battleground is Liverpool Broadgreen. Mr Terry
Fields, jailed last year for not paying his poll tax and then expelled from
Labour for alleged Militant links, is defending against the official Labour
candidate, Ms Jane Kennedy.
Labour's private fears, however, have nothing to do with a Fields victory.
They are summed up by Mr David Alton, the Liberal Democrat defender of
neighbouring Mossley Hill: 'Labour's two roses are going to do their worst
to each other and our Rosie is going to come steaming through the middle to
win.'
'Our Rosie' is Ms Rosemary Cooper, a 41-year-old menswear buyer for
Littlewoods and the Liberal Democrat candidate. She fought Knowsley North in
Liverpool twice in 1987 - once at a by-election - has been a councillor in
Broadgreen for 19 years and will be the next Lord Mayor of Liverpool.
Mr Fields, using the motto 'A Workers' MP on a Worker's Wage', has a
formidable armoury. It includes years of canvassing records, a portfolio of
constituency casework, and a visibly large army of unemployed men who lost
their jobs with Liverpool council during its seven-month dispute last year
with town hall unions.
Mr Fields knows the odds are long against any independent fighting former
colleagues in a national election, but he is well-known locally and is
respected for his sincerity.
Many of his posters have the words 'independent' and 'candidate' in very
small letters and the word 'Labour' in big ones between them. They are in
traditional Labour red and yellow and are very visible in Broadgreen's
streets.
Ms Kennedy is relatively unknown and is hated by many of Mr Fields'
supporters. An official of Nupe, the public employees' union, she gave
information on Militant infiltration to the Labour party.
The only certainty about Liverpool is that the Conservatives have no chance
of taking any of the city's six seats. With the Tories fielding a company
secretary from the south as cannon fodder, how Labour's vote splits between
Mr Fields and Ms Kennedy will be crucial to the Liberal Democrats' chances.
If Mr Fields reduces Labour's 49 per cent of the poll last time by 14
percentage points and the Liberal Democrats keep up their 1987 performance,
Ms Cooper will win.
A possible fly in Ms Cooper's ointment is that Broadgreen's independent
Liberal councillor is standing, but the key will be tactical voting by
Tories. Victory for Ms Cooper or Mr Fields would make Labour's national
chances one seat harder, so it may be in the Conservatives' interests not to
hinder Ms Cooper. The same argument applies to Mossley Hill, where Mr Alton
is defending a 2,226 majority and fighting a strong challenge from Labour's
Mr Neville Bann.
Mr Neil Kinnock will be hoping that the fight with Mr Fields will be one of
his last against the far left. As long as Mr Fields does not win, it may
well be.

A SURVEY showing that more than 50,000 young people were waiting for Youth

The Unemployment Unit said the survey, conducted by the Local Authority

FT  02 APR 92 / Insurance ruling
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE rights of policyholders to have insurance claims paid even if their
insurers go out of business could be limited by a Commercial Court ruling
yesterday.
The ruling came in a case involving three policyholders of subsidiaries of
London United Investments, which went into administration in 1990.
Under the Policyholders Protection Act of 1975 policyholders can claim a sum
equal to 90 per cent of claims from insurance companies which have gone into
liquidation.
Mr Justice Webster ruled that contingent liabilities - where an event giving
rise to a claim has occurred but the amount due has still to be determined -
are excluded from protection under the act.

ROYAL MAIL, the letters arm of the Post Office, yesterday completed a
reorganisation which has cut management and administrative staff by 3,500
and forced a further 9,000 managers to re-apply for their jobs, Diane
Summers writes.
The number of reporting levels between the managing director and the postal
worker delivering letters has been cut from nine to six.
Headquarters staff have been reduced from about 2,000 to 160. The shake-up
will result in annual savings of Pounds 60m to Pounds 70m. Nine divisions,
each with average turnover of Pounds 300m, have replaced four territories
and 64 districts.

FT  02 APR 92 / Deposition by Names may affect losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DETAILS in an affidavit submitted to a commercial court and due to be made
public today could have a significant effect on losses faced by Names on
Lloyd's syndicates formerly managed by the Gooda Walker agency.
Names on the syndicates - which specialised in catastrophe reinsurance
business and ran up losses of more than Pounds 200m in the 1989 year - are
among the 820 Names taking action in the case, which was adjourned by Mr
Justice Saville on Tuesday.
The Names, who are advised by solicitors Michael Freeman, are seeking
injunctions to prevent Lloyd's drawing down on their deposits in order to
meet cash calls. Hearings are set to resume on Monday. Names are the
individuals whose assets back underwriting at Lloyd's.
The affidavit is understood to have drawn on information about the affairs
of one Gooda Walker syndicate gathered by GW Run Off, a body which has
administered the syndicates since the Gooda Walker and related agencies went
into liquidation last year.
Mr Alfred Doll-Steinberg, the chairman of the Gooda Walker Action Group,
said the group had been pressing GW Run Off and Lloyd's to make the
information public. Lloyd's marine syndicate 475, which underwrote
re-insurance business, will report a loss of more than Pounds 12m for 1989,
about five times the figure previously expected.
Spratt &amp; White, manager of the syndicate, says in a letter to the 956 Names
on it that losses from hurricane Hugo, which devastated the Caribbean and
parts of the US in 1989, will exceed the syndicate's reinsurance
protections.
Spratt &amp; White took over management of the syndicate from RJ Bromley
(Underwriting Agencies) last year and has reviewed the syndicate's exposures
to Hugo. Managers have been unable to complete their assessment of likely
losses and are leaving the syndicate's accounts open for the 1989 year.
They are expecting to make a cash call of at least 50 per cent (Pounds 5,000
for every Pounds 10,000 traded by Names on the syndicate) in July, but say
this depends on the continuing co-operation of the syndicate's bankers.
Names were told in February that the loss might not exceed 10 per cent.

FT  02 APR 92 / Lobbyists' pressure proves positive in EC: British
organisations beating their rivals to the policymakers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH organisations are rapidly learning how to lobby Brussels. In the
process, they are even beating French and German rivals in the race to the
policymakers, according to Mr Jeremy Richardson, director of the European
Public Policy Institute based at Warwick University.
'British groups, used to a tradition of close and informal relationships
with civil servants, are rather adept at influencing policymaking in
Brussels and indeed are regarded as good Europeans,' says Mr Richardson.
His conclusions find support among those involved. 'The British operation
nowadays tends to be quite sophisticated compared with the French and
Germans,' says the Brussels office of Hill &amp; Knowlton, the US public
relations company.
Mrs Edith Cresson, before she became French prime minister, called on French
companies to be more assertive in dealing with Brussels directly, rather
than relying on l'etat, according to Mr Richardson.
By contrast, the British Textiles Confederation is lobbying Brussels
directly to prevent German carpet quality standards, based on springiness,
taking precedence over their UK equivalent, based on comfort and durability.
The chemicals sector, too, has taken the battle to Brussels. Mr Jonathan
Peel, executive director of EC and government relations at the UK Chemicals
Industries Association, says: 'We have become much more active in Brussels
in the last two or three years because more of the weighty decisions are
being made there.'
Britain's parliamentary constituency system has bred lobbying into UK
companies, says Mr Peel. 'There isn't the same sense of that in France or
Germany'.
The EC patchwork means that UK companies have found themselves on familiar
ground when lobbying. There are 23 directorates-general, each divided into a
number of policy units. The commission is headed by 17 commissioners, each
of whom has an entourage to screen those seeking access to the commissioner.

FT  02 APR 92 / Election 1992: Morelli's decree - Ballot Box
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a change of direction in Brecon and Radnor. Leon Morelli, the
second-hand book dealer and current self-styled King of Hay-on-Wye - who
succeeded the founder of the book dynasty 'King' Richard Booth - has written
to all his 120 employees telling them he has abandoned the Liberal
Democrats, who hold the seat, and is now supporting the Tories.
Hay is the second-hand bookshop centre of Britain. The town is given over to
them and Morelli dominates the place.
An astute publicist, he set up the independent republic of Hay some years
back and proclaimed himself king. His employees are puzzled. 'What's his
vote got to do with us?' one of them asked yesterday. 'Anyway, he's always
been a maverick. In his republic there wouldn't be any such thing as
democracy or voting. He would be an autocratic monarch like the French
ancien regime.'

FT  02 APR 92 / Election 1992: Chancellor Neil - Ballot Box
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Scottish National party appeared to receive a welcome boost for its
economic policies from an independent body yesterday - in contrast to a less
favourable picture of a devolved parliament painted by Edinburgh economic
consultancy Pieda.
The Scottish Centre for Economic and Social Research produced a budget for
Scotland, based on current figures, which concludes that Scotland is
responsible for a bigger share of Britain's GDP than of the national debt.
The author is Alex Neil, an economist who seems to echo the SNP's manifesto
when he comments: 'It is ludicrous for anyone to suggest that the Scottish
economy is not capable of sustaining self-government.'
But the report fails to mention that Neil is a prominent SNP activist whose
potential role is chancellor in the party's Scottish cabinet.

Labour's Sheffield rally was brilliant, superb. It far surpassed anything
that the Conservatives could have managed. It electrified the party's
supporters and came across wonderfully on television. No that wasn't the
judgment of Neil Kinnock's spin doctors. It was offered by Harvey Thomas.
His last job? Stage managing the rallies which so triumphantly projected
Margaret Thatcher for much of the 1980s.

<TEXT>
Chancellor Norman Lamont's resurrection of the label 'stark staring bonkers'
to describe those who believe that a Labour government could revive the
British economy is hardly a happy omen for the Conservatives.
It was used in 1964 by Lord Hailsham (after he had temporarily reverted to
being Mr Quintin Hogg in his unsuccessful bid for the Tory leadership) when
the last period of 13 years of Tory rule was brought to an end by a Labour
government.

FT  02 APR 92 / Election 1992: Service views not on parade - Ballot Box
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One group of electors for which there are no available polls is the armed
forces. They were not polled in 1945 either when pre-election opinion
soundings - just among civilians - underestimated the swing to Labour.
Postal votes from overseas servicemen are reckoned to have clinched that
election. But, however bitterly today's servicemen may resent cuts, nothing
of the sort can be expected this time for three good reasons.
First, the forces, at 294,000 and declining, are smaller than at any time
since the war. Second, although they are encouraged to vote, many do not.
Army officials say arrangements for proxy and postal votes 'just don't work
terribly well'. Third, unlike the civilians in khaki who voted in 1945,
today's all-professional services are a bastion of conservatism with a small
'c' and probably a big one as well.
Historically, Labour defence secretaries have been relatively kind to the
forces. But distrust of Labour is ingrained among officers and, even more,
senior NCOs. 'Socialism is anathema,' says one former cavalry officer. 'From
the early stages it's drilled into people.'
But just how dominant rightwing sympathies are, who knows? John Elliott,
editor of Soldier magazine, says he has never come across any information
about the service vote in 15 years' association with the Army and Navy. No
such poll has been heard of at NOP, Gallup or Mori. 'I suspect you would
never get permission to do it,' ventured one pollster.
A fair indication might be service-dominated constituencies like Aldershot,
where Julian Critchley is defending a Tory majority of nearly 18,000, or
neighbouring Gosport, which in spite of being largely working-class is one
of the safest Tory seats in the country.

FT  02 APR 92 / Election 1992: Lib Dems must target at local level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARETH SMYTH and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Liberal Democrats' best chances of making gains next Thursday depend on
riding the swing in support away from the Conservatives and Labour but - far
more critically - on targeting effectively at a local level.
Very few Conservative-held seats would be won by the party if the swing
shown in the latest opinion polls - including last night's two polls - was
applied uniformly across the UK.
But the Liberal Democrats have an established reputation for fighting
individually tailored campaigns and for building a strong personal vote for
their candidates. Mr Des Wilson, campaign director, is confident of holding
the 22 seats the party is defending.
That includes saving 10 seats in Scotland, where Liberal Democrat support
fell to 10 per cent in a Mori/Sunday Times poll last weekend, compared with
19 per cent of votes cast at the 1987 election.
Mr Wilson is also optimistic - perhaps too much so - about retaining seats
like Southwark and Bermondsey, Rochdale and Liverpool Mossley Hill, which
appear vulnerable to Labour.
The most likely gains for the Liberal Democrats are seats where exceptional
local factors are enhancing the national swings in support. Electoral
geography means those gains would come almost exclusively from the Tories.
Mr Wilson yesterday confidently predicted taking from Labour the seats of
Sheffield Hillsborough, Glasgow Hillhead, Bow and Poplar, and Liverpool
Broadgreen, but this may reflect a desire to counter charges that a Liberal
Democrat vote would let in Labour.
Broadgreen would need a swing of 6.3 per cent from Labour and depend on the
candidacy of Mr Terry Fields, the expelled former Labour MP, splitting the
Labour vote.
Among the 375 seats the Conservatives won in 1987, the SDP/Liberal Alliance
was second in 228. Cambridge, Colne Valley, Stevenage, Stockton South,
Plymouth Drake and Conwy must now be regarded as three-way marginals as a
result of the Labour revival. But there are 18 other seats, shown on the
accompanying map, where the Liberal Democrats are clearly the challenger to
the Conservatives and which they would win on a swing of around 6 per cent.
Successful targeting would make many winnable on a much smaller national
swing.
Liberal Democrats have been able in the past to transfer support from local
to parliamentary elections. In Hazel Grove, where Conservative Sir Tom
Arnold defends a majority of 1,840, the Liberal Democrats have 14 of 18
council seats. The party has 23 of 25 council seats in Richmond and Barnes,
a seat it failed to win by 1,766 votes in 1987.
Another factor favouring the Liberal Democrats is their ability to squeeze
the Labour vote in their crucial target seats. In a Harris poll in March,
more than a quarter of those questioned said they would vote for another
party if their preferred party could not win the seat.
Liberal Democrat supporters are more likely than the supporters of other
parties to vote tactically, but the Liberal Democrats are by far the
greatest beneficiaries when Conservative or Labour voters do the same.

FT  02 APR 92 / Election 1992: Checking out the blue-rinse brigade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S vote-seeking pol-iticians were yesterday given a comprehensive
thumbs-down by that driving force in any election, the blue-rinse brigade of
Sainsbury shoppers.
Trolley-pushing voters in six safe southern Tory seats - Carshalton, Sutton,
Epsom, Horsham, Worthing and Hove - granted John Major a narrow vote of
confidence.
In an exclusive FT poll of blue-clad middle-aged lady shoppers outside
Sainsbury stores there was one overwhelming message to the politicians: head
for the electoral checkout and get it all over with as quickly as possible.
Out of the small but scientifically chosen sample of women shoppers wearing
blue coats or pullovers - two in each constituency - five said they would
vote Conservative, two each gave their allegiance to Labour, the Greens and
the Liberal Democrats, with one saying she would abstain.
Outside Sainsbury, Wallington, in the Carshalton constituency (majority:
14,409), Mrs Mary Cunningham in a bright-blue coat said she was a
traditional Conservative but had hesitated in making up her mind this time
before being pushed back to the Tory camp by fury over Labour's health
broadcast. 'I'd like to punch Neil Kinnock on the nose,' she said.
In North Cheam, in the Sutton constituency (majority: 15,718), Mrs
Jacqueline Brown said she would vote Liberal. 'None of them are coming over
very well.' Mrs Ida Cass, with a mauve tint to her hair, said she was Green
'because of what they're trying to do for the world'.
In Epsom (majority: 20,761) Mrs Evelyn R, a lifelong Tory in a blue anorak,
said that for the first time she would not be voting. She was 'disgusted' by
the Tory performance. 'Education, employment - you name it, they've messed
it up.' She did not want her name quoted because Tory friends would think
she was 'a renegade'.
In Horsham (majority 23,907) Mrs Doris Whitehead said she would opt for the
Tories but without enthusiasm. So would Mrs Dora Silver 'I'm sick to death
of the politicians on TV. They go on and on and on,' she said.

FT  02 APR 92 / Election 1992: Sharp fall in 'Tory gainer' stocks seen
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES that might benefit from a Conservative victory dropped sharply
yesterday, falling twice as far as the FT-SE index of big-company stocks.
Shares that might benefit from a Labour win dropped by much less.
'Conservative gainers' are now over 9 per cent lower than at the start of
the campaign, while 'Labour gainers' have dropped only a third as far.
A number of shares did particularly badly. Courtaulds Textiles, which might
face higher costs from a minimum wage, dropped 16p or 3 1/2 per cent to
431p. SG Warburg, the merchant bank, which might lose corporate finance
business if a Labour government clamped down on takeovers, dropped 20p or 4
per cent to 471p. Thames Water, threatened by tighter Labour regulation,
dropped 10p, nearly 3 per cent, to 335p.
Meanwhile, a poll of City fund managers found that 89 per cent expect the
election to result in a hung parliament. Labour will be the single biggest
party, according to 48 per cent, while 41 per cent think the Conservatives
will have the most seats.
Most - 46 per cent - think the Liberal Democrats have conducted the most
impressive campaign. None consider the Tory campaign the most impressive,
while 30 per cent chose Labour. However, 80 per cent think the Tories have
the best long-term economic programme, compared with 9 per cent for the
Liberal Democrats and 6 per cent for Labour.
The survey was conducted by Gallup for Smith New Court, the securities
house.

FT  02 APR 92 / Election 1992: Shopping for votes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The elderly man in the supermarket looked up with a glint in his eye. He
nudged his wife, nearly tripping over the shopping trolley. 'Here,' he said,
'come and shake hands with a millionaire.' Obliging as ever, Mr Michael
Heseltine marched up, arm outstretched. 'Please support your local
candidate, Mr Francis Maude,' said he, whirling on to scour the aisles for
another customer. The financial secretary to the Treasury shuffled behind
the secretary of state for the environment, barely able to keep pace as the
taller man loped ahead, walking yet seeming to run.
There is no certain evidence of the trends in public opinion to be gained
from such forays into the suburban streets and shopping malls of middle
England. The opinion polls do a more comprehensive job than any single
individual can. Yet the few titbits I picked up in Nuneaton and Warwickshire
North yesterday do suggest two common-sense reasons why the Conservatives
appear to be losing the election. First, Labour's resurgence since 1987 is
no fluke. The party's modernisation of policies has been accompanied by a
modernisation of its vote-getting machinery. Second, Conservatives are fed
up with their own party.
Stockingford Labour Club, headquarters of the Nuneaton campaign, looks
efficient and well-equipped. Its computer link with national HQ in London,
actually works: yesterday someone was retrieving policy statements on the
economy, industry, and education. Failing that there is always the fax.
Canvassers reported in briskly; their story is that the Tories on whose
doors they knock register 'disillusionment' with the negative campaign
emanating from Conservative Central Office.
The Nuneaton Conservative Club feels downtrodden and bedraggled by
comparison. It has no computer links; if you want to send a fax, said Mr
Lewis Stevens, the candidate, it must go straight to his home. I sat down
for a cup of tea. Two strangers came in, anxious to do their bit. They were
worried about how things were going and could not bear to watch the TV news
because the BBC was so biased against the government. What could they do?
Posters were thrust upon them and they were asked: 'Do you think you could
find half a dozen people to form a ward committee in your area? We can't'
Mr Stevens is the sitting Conservative MP. He has a majority of 5,655, once
comfortable enough but now vulnerable. A swing to Labour of 5 1/2 per cent
would wipe him out. The national polls say that will happen; so does the
local evidence. I walked up the high street with the Labour challenger, Mr
Bill Olner. A former Rolls-Royce machinist and ex-mayor, he seemed to be
liked by everyone we passed. He led a troika of conservatively dressed
middle-aged men in suits, all smiling and handing out leaflets. One of them
was his AEU engineering union minder, discreet and patently longing for
invisibility.
Down the road Mr Maude was canvassing in scruffy corduroy trousers, a
Barbour jacket, and worn-out suede shoes. He looked like Labour 1983, a
curiosity for a Conservative defending a majority of merely 2,829. 'I feel
more comfortable like this,' he explained. Locals spoke about how they
expected their MP to be formally or at least neatly attired, as is the
modern Labour party.
A police constable guarding the approaches while Mr Heseltine was in town
unburdened himself. 'Crime has increased fivefold,' he complained, 'but our
pay has not. 'The police supported Mrs Margaret Thatcher in 1979, but we'll
vote against this government now. Do you realise what their flexible
rostering will mean . . . ?' An Alf Garnett in a cheap cafe wanted the birch
and national service brought back, but said he would vote Labour.
His evocation of reactionary wisdom constitutes classic evidence of the way
in which long incumbency has trapped the Conservatives. They cannot
convincingly attack Labour for being soft on crime, since they have no good
explanation of why the rate has risen at so apparently alarming a pace
during their own 13 years in office. It is no good trying to explain the
unreliability of criminal statistics to people who see their town centre
close down at dusk, only to be threatened after dark by gangs of
frightening-looking youths.
Mr Heseltine was kind enough to give me a lift. His scouring of the country
for Tory votes is carried out with little fanfare and no support staff. Only
his driver and his wife are in attendance. He will contemplate nothing other
than victory. What comfort could I give FT readers who feared the advent of
a Labour government? Tell them, the eternal campaigner replied between
taking calls on his carphone, that when disaffected Tories among the Liberal
Democrats realise they are voting for Labour, they will place their crosses
beside Conservative candidates. 'This message will be shouted from the
housetops.' I did not need to travel to the West Midlands to hear it, but it
sounded almost credible, coming from him.

FT  02 APR 92 / Election 1992: Where words could fail the politicians -
Wales is divided both politically and socially by its language
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICALLY and so-cially, Wales is a country divided by the one thing that
should unite it: the Welsh language.
'The problem in Wales,' says the senior executive with a company in Newport,
south Wales, 'is that the language divides us. Those who speak Welsh don't
believe the rest of us, whether born or just living here, are full citizens.
'It's not like that in Scotland. Nationalism there is part of the culture.
Everyone is equal. Here in Wales, because of the language, there are two
peoples, two cultures. And the fanatics will burn down your cottage whether
you're English or Welsh.'
That feeling, widely held outside the deeply Welsh areas of Gwynedd in the
north-west and neighbouring Ceredigion in the west, means that support for
the nationalist cause in Wales is severely limited.
The result is that support for Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party, is
largely confined to those areas where Welsh is an important part of everyday
life. Plaid is engaged in an unavailing and unsuccessful struggle to break
out of its language ghetto.
Election results substantiate this. The three seats won by Plaid Cymru in
1987 were all in Gwynedd, the one part of Wales where Welsh is the everyday
language. In the three constituencies of Ynys Mon, Caernarfon and
Meirionnydd Nant Conwy the nationalists gained 36.1 per cent of the votes,
comfortably ahead of the Conservatives' 30.9 and Labour's 18.1 per cent.
Elsewhere, the picture was very different. Throughout Wales, Plaid Cymru
gained no more than 7.3 per cent of the vote, a figure which has been
steadily declining since as recently as 1974, when it was 10.8 per cent.
There are only two other seats in Wales where Plaid Cymru is a credible
political force in vote-winning terms. At the last election the party took
23 per cent of the vote in Carmarthen, Dyfed, and 16.2 per cent in
Ceredigion and North Pembroke. Both are parts of the country where the Welsh
language is an integral part of the fabric of society.
By contrast, in south Wales the nationalist vote diminishes to
insignificance. In Monmouth the candidate won just 363 votes in 1987, 458 in
next-door Newport East, 377 in Newport West and 535 in Cardiff Central. In
three constituencies Plaid Cymru is so weak it is fielding a candidate
jointly with the Green party.
Nevertheless, in a hung parliament every vote could count. Plaid is hardly
likely to throw in its lot with the Conservatives since devolution does not
figure on their agenda. In any case, Plaid Cymru sees itself as a radical
party, on the left of the political spectrum.
The party's stance is unequivocal: it wants a parliament for Wales. Whether
it would support a Labour government, or a Lab/Lib-Dem coalition that
offered something less, such as an assembly with limited powers, is not
clear and would be part of the horse trading that would occur.
Even though there is some evidence that support for an assembly - a
centrepiece of nationalist demands - is gaining ground in Wales, it is
doubtful if even half the population would vote for such a body in a
referendum.
When the referendum was held in 1978 just 18 per cent voted for a Welsh
assembly. The opposition to it then was led by Mr Neil Kinnock. Now Mr
Kinnock leads a party that is promising a Welsh assembly within the lifetime
of a first Labour government.
While there are undoubtedly people in the Welsh Labour party who are close
to the nationalist cause, there are senior figures who are appalled at the
assembly commitment. They believe Labour in Wales is being swept along on
the tide of Scottish nationalism.
'The Scottish Labour party has been captured by the nationalists',' one
politician said. 'Their mad policies have infiltrated the Welsh party and
are pushing it in a direction and at a rate that the people of Wales do not
altogether want.'
Conservatives are adamantly opposed to any form of devolution. Mr David
Hunt, Welsh secretary, has time and again reiterated party policy that a
strong Welsh Office, with a cabinet minister, produces the best results for
Wales.
While this view is shared by almost the whole party, slight chinks have
appeared. Mr Jonathan Evans, candidate at Brecon and Radnor, has said that
though he personally opposes devolution perhaps the matter should be put to
the people.
Most business people, a voting class closely allied with the Conservatives
politically, certainly oppose devolution. They see all their links going
east, to London. 'We do not fear either London or the English,' said one.
'We work very happily with them and have no desire to cut those ties.'
OF THE 38 seats in Wales, 26 are being defended by Labour, six by the
Conservatives and three each by the Liberal Democrats and the nationalist
Plaid Cymru. The principality holds out the prospect of a number of close
contests, and many seats could go one of three ways. For example, at Brecon
and Radnor in mid-Wales Mr Richard Livsey for the LIberal Democrats is
defending a 56-vote majority - the smallest in Britain. The Tories were
second at the last election, with Labour a close third. Conwy in the north,
Cardiff Central and Monmouth in the south and even Pembroke in west Wales
could also go to any one of three parties.

FT  02 APR 92 / Election 1992: Warning on price of Scots separatism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMISTS yesterday painted a much less attractive picture of the benefits
to Scotland of a devolved parliament and of independence than those
portrayed by the political parties arguing for them.
A devolved Scottish parliament would be far more dependent on the UK
Treasury for its revenue than supporters of devolution claim, according to
Professor Donald MacKay and Mr Peter Wood of Pieda, the Edinburgh economic
consultancy. They add that it would have little autonomy in economic and
industrial affairs.
They say in a report for Bell Lawrie, the Edinburgh stockbroking firm, that
an independent Scotland would have a large structural budget deficit and
probably a substantial balance of payments deficit.
The report is a challenge to Labour and the Liberal Democrats, which support
a Scottish parliament, and to the Scottish National party which wants
independence in the European Community.
The economists warn that there is a gulf between public expectations and
reality over a Scottish parliament, and say that the resulting
disillusionment could cause political instability leading to demands for
full independence.
The tax revenues that a Scottish parliament would have assigned to it under
the proposals of the Scottish Constitutional Convention would fall far short
of its public spending.
It would therefore have to negotiate with the Treasury for the rest of its
funding, the economists say. It is unlikely that the Treasury would agree to
anything which gave a competitive advantage. The parliament's right to raise
taxes by up to 3p in the pound would raise only 4 per cent of expenditure.
The economic powers proposed for the parliament were 'vague, confused and
unconvincing', Prof MacKay said.
As for independence in the EC, Scotland would have a public sector borrowing
requirement of Pounds 5.85bn in 1991-92, assuming unchanged tax and spending
levels, and two thirds of UK oil revenues. This would amount to 14.4 per
cent of Scotland's gross domestic product and would be difficult to fund
without punitive interest rates. Higher taxes would appear inevitable to
maintain spending.
The Act of Disunion of 1992? Bell Lawrie White, 7 Drumsheugh Gardens,
Edinburgh EH3 7QH. Pounds 30.

AS MANY as 53 per cent of voters would be likely to support the Liberal
Democrats if they thought the party could win a majority, according to
today's Daily Telegraph/ Gallup poll.
The figure falls to 44 per cent if the party were likely to hold the balance
of power. Only 20.5 per cent of respondents said they would vote Lib Dem if
there was an election tomorrow.
The survey also gives further evidence of Labour's improved ratings for
economic competence: 38 per cent said they felt the party could best handle
Britain's economic difficulties, against 44 per cent for the Conservatives
and 31 per cent before the campaign.
Meanwhile, the latest ICM poll for The Guardian, published yesterday, points
to a fall-off in Conservative support among women, the paper says today.
The survey, which gave Labour a four-point lead overall, put the party three
points ahead among female voters.
This reversed the position in a poll published on March 17 which suggested
that women favoured the Tories by a margin of three points.

FT  02 APR 92 / Election 1992: Parties revise for crucial test - The Issues,
Education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER taxes and health, the future of Britain's schools and colleges is the
campaign issue with the highest profile.
The Liberal Democrats took the early initiative, hammering away at their
commitment to raise the basic rate of tax by 1p to provide an extra Pounds
2bn in funding for next year and a similar sum the year after.
Labour countered this week with details of its more modest plans to spend an
extra Pounds 600m in 22 months - an increase of about 0.7 per cent in the
education budget. The Tories have kept out of the auction - to their cost,
according to the pollsters.
In practice, state education spending is set to grow sharply, whichever
party wins. All three parties support the real increases in teachers' pay
begun, and likely to be continued, by the teachers' independent pay review
body this year. All want to see a higher staying-on rate at the ages of 16
and 18, and endorse the target of one in three 18-year-olds going on to
higher education by the year 2000 (from one in five now).
The opposition parties would replace student loans by more generous grants.
This would save money in the short-term because of the time taken to repay
loans, but in the long term the switch will be a massive drain on the
education budget.
The spending argument is not, therefore, mainly about salaries and
participation - but about class sizes, equipment, school buildings and
nursery provision.
Mr Matthew Taylor, the Liberal Democrats' education spokesman, promises
immediate improvements on all fronts.
Mr Jack Straw, the shadow education secretary, is more cautious. He is
restrained by Mr John Smith's modest 'recovery programme'. He promises a
nursery place for all three-year-olds and four-year-olds who want them by
2000 (Mr Taylor proposes to do this within five years), while his Pounds
180m extra for school buildings - to tackle an estimated backlog of Pounds
4.5bn - compares with Mr Taylor's Pounds 1bn-plus.
Both agree, however, that schools will get the bulk of extra resources.
Lecturers are promised a pay review body, but universities will look in vain
for the funds needed to greet 100,000 extra students with existing standards
of accommodation and current student/lecturer ratios.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, education secretary, emphasises choice as the Tory
message. If re-elected the Conservatives will leave A-levels unreformed,
continue the assisted places scheme to pay private-school fees for
low-income families, create more City Technology Colleges, and encourage all
state schools to opt out of local authority control - with small primary
schools to be allowed to opt out in groups if they would prefer.
Grant-maintained schools will also be allowed to introduce selection, 'if
that is what parents clearly want and it fits in with the wider needs of the
local area', adds Mr Clarke cryptically.
Those policies are bitterly resisted by opposition parties, but they have
strong support from the Tory grassroots. Wandsworth, the Conservatives'
model borough in south London, is bursting with ideas to take them further.
Mr Edward Lister, Wandsworth's ebullient education chairman, was the brains
behind Mr Clarke's ill-fated scheme for competing school inspectors; he also
aroused local controversy last month with plans - hurriedly withdrawn - to
cut more than Pounds 3m from local school budgets. He wants all the
borough's nine secondary schools to join the three that have opted-out, and
larger primary schools to do so 'when they are ready'.
What role then for Wandsworth council? Mr Lister argues that the local
authority will have four clear roles: 'It will be innovator, inspector,
planner - making sites available for successful schools to expand - and
educator of last resort.' On innovation, he points to new maths and
non-verbal-reasoning tests to be introduced for 11-year-olds.
Mr Lister is enthusiastic about selection, for commitment as much as
ability. 'Yes, there will be rejects, but if children are to be rejected
it's better they are rejected at 11 than later,' he says.
His plans for the borough involve Battersea Park School becoming a
technology college, Chestnut Grove School in Balham becoming a 'magnet
school' in art and design, and he favours experimentation with 'bilateral
schools' engaging in formal streaming. As to the rejects: 'we will pick them
up as the education authority'.
Mr Alf Dubs, fighting to regain the marginal Battersea seat for Labour,
opposes all that. He derides changes to the character of schools as
'creating instability and division.'
'The bottom line of all this is selection,' he insists. 'That's the real
agenda - and we will fight it tooth and nail.' So whoever wins on April 9,
expect an education brawl.

FT  02 APR 92 / Election 1992: Crime beat is played softly-softly - The
Issues, Law And Order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PICTURE of policing Oxford painted by television's Inspector Morse is
not one that acting chief superintendent Ralph Perry, the Oxford area
commander, recognises.
'There are more murders in the average episode of Morse, than Oxford has in
two years,' he says.
If Morse existed, Mr Perry could find more than enough to keep him busy.
Last year recorded crime in the city increased by 34 per cent compared with
16 per cent nationally. In three years crime in Oxford has doubled.
Beyond the dreaming spires the city has very real problems of vagrancy,
homelessness, drink and drugs. It also has a disproportionately high level
of auto crime, connected partly with the theft and racing of cars on the
city's outlying estates of Barton, Rose Hill and Blackbird Leys.
With Mr John Patten, the home office minister, defending Oxford West and the
continued media attention on the problems at Blackbird Leys, law and order
ought to be a main talking point in Oxford during the campaign. Yet, as
appears to be the case nationally, in spite of record levels of crime
everywhere, the law and order debate has been little more than a sideshow.
Mr Patten says that not one person has raised the issue with him on the
doorstep in this campaign. Crime was only an issue recently at the height of
the 'joyriding' at Blackbird Leys last summer.
Sir William Goodhart QC, the Liberal Democrat challenger in Oxford West,
says it is clear why the Tories have not raised the issue: 'It no longer
works to their advantage.' The rise in recorded crime shows the Tories'
claim to be the natural party of law and order is 'wearing a little thin',
he adds.
If that explains the Tories' desire to keep what little debate there is
firmly focused on its plans rather than its record, it does not account for
Labour's apparent reluctance to raise the subject.
However Mr Andrew Smith, who is defending Oxford East for Labour and lives
on Blackbird Leys, says law and order has been specifically raised with him
by a significant number of people.
Residents on Oxford's estates are fed up with the continuing nuisance of
'theft and racing of cars' - he refuses to call it joyriding.
There seems very little to choose between the main parties' policies. All
three give a commitment to reform of the criminal justice system after
recent miscarriages of justice - an issue nobody has raised with any of the
candidates.
All three parties also talk about the need to focus on crime prevention
rather than cure and the need to concentrate efforts on the young in
particular.
Mr Patten says: 'Crime prevention starts with the young. This is the message
for the nineties.' The Tories are planning a national task force 'to
co-ordinate action against criminal behaviour among children in the family
and at school'.
The Liberal Democrats talk about the need to keep young people aged 16 to 18
active by building up local youth facilities. Sir William says stealing and
racing cars is 'a symptom of young people with too much time on their
hands'.
Mr Smith says: 'There is a real problem in Britain today with rootless
people who feel they have little to lose by breaking the law.'
All three parties also speak of the need for more community-based policing,
and give a manifesto commitment to increase police numbers.
All of which is good news for Mr Perry. The Thames Valley force has one of
the lowest police-to-people ratios in the country. Mr Perry is expected to
deal with the huge increase in crime with 250 officers - roughly the same as
Oxford had in 1968. He says: 'With an extra 30 or 40 officers we could do an
awful lot to meet the public's expectations.'
He would love to work towards some concept of regular policing of the
community, but a recent increase in the number of beat officers by 12 is as
far as he can go with present resources.
He is particularly concerned about the socio-economic aspects of crime.
Youths hanging around with nothing better to do contributed to the problems
on the city's estates last summer, but he is aware that that is not the
complete explanation. Many of those involved, particularly on Blackbird
Leys, were not economically deprived.
Mr Perry says: 'There is no way you can compare an estate such as Meadow
Well (the Newcastle estate where trouble also flared last summer) with
conditions on Blackbird Leys. Facilities on Blackbird Leys are second to
none - swimming pool, sports centre, BMX track, nice schools, speedway
stadium, Greyhound racing stadium, youth clubs - you name it, it's there.'

FT  02 APR 92 / Election 1992: Hattersley pledge on police numbers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR WILL increase police numbers and create a partnership between local
government and local police forces to combat the crime wave which had
'turned into a typhoon', Mr Roy Hattersley, shadow home secretary, said
yesterday.
At a London news conference he promised to increase total police numbers in
England and Wales by 1,250 immediately after the election, to restore cuts
to the police housing allowance, and to implement the recommendations of the
1990 Morgan Report on local crime-prevention strategies.
Labour estimates that the package will cost up to Pounds 60m in the first
year. It will meet this by reducing the numbers of prisoners held on remand
in police cells, which costs Pounds 220 a night each. Mr Hattersley said the
comparable cost of holding them in prison was Pounds 50 a night each. On
Monday there were 1,744 prisoners being held in police cells.
He said all suspects remanded in custody would be accommodated in prison by
shortening the average time on remand before trial and by removing from the
system such categories of offenders as maintenance payment defaulters, who
should not be there.
Mr Hattersley pointed out that the number of recorded crimes had risen from
2.5m in 1979 to 5.3m in 1991, although crime surveys suggested that the real
figure was as much as four times as great. It was possible first to halt the
increase and then to reduce crime.
Mr Barry Sheerman, Labour's crime spokesman, said that preventing youth
crime would be a priority as half of all crime was committed by young
people.
He added: 'We have to ameliorate the circumstances in which young people
find themselves and establish specific crime-prevention programmes targeted
on youth.'

FT  02 APR 92 / Election 1992: Major tries to win the undecided
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN APPEAL to the uncommitted to 'come and join us' came yesterday from Mr
John Major as he led the Tories' attempt to win over floating voters in the
final week of the campaign.
The Tories believe that there are some 10m people who have not yet decided
how to vote - a larger proportion of the electorate than is usual this close
to polling day.
Speaking at a party rally near Bath, Mr Major said: 'This is no time to be a
'don't know'. This is a time to fight for a positive future for our
country.'
He spelt out his aims for a Britain in which people had the incentive to
work harder and create resources for better public services, and urged those
who shared that vision to talk to people who were still uncertain. 'None of
us can afford to stay on the sidelines. What is at stake is the future of
Britain,' he said.
Beyond presenting the positive Tory vision, however, Mr Major sounded a
warning about what a Labour government would mean. He highlighted the choice
between the Conservatives and the other parties on devolution, defence and
Britain's role in Europe.
Earlier on a visit to Bath, the marginal seat where party chairman Mr Chris
Patten is under pressure from the Liberal Democrats, Mr Major was hit by an
egg thrown from a crowd of demonstrators.
Mr Christopher Chope, the roads minister, was struck in the face while
campaigning in his Southampton Itchen constituency last night. Police were
called as he was taken to a nearby house for first aid.

FT  02 APR 92 / Election 1992: No slackening, orders confident Kinnock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NEIL Kinnock last night launched the final phase of his general election
campaign with a confident prediction of victory at the largest political
rally in Britain since the second world war.
At a Pounds 150,000 Labour extravaganza in Sheffield, Mr Kinnock told 10,000
supporters: 'In nine days' time Britain is going to have a Labour
government.'
The party would win because 'people know we will govern as we have
campaigned - strongly, positively, looking to the future.'
By contrast, the Conservative government was portrayed as a spent force:
'They have no vitality and they are rapidly losing the remnants of their
integrity.'
Senior party figures echoed his confidence that the Conservatives would be
defeated on April 9. Despite last night's opinion polls, strategists said
there was overwhelming evidence that Labour support had been firmly
established above 40 per cent. That would be enough to deprive Mr John Major
of his majority.
But Mr Kinnock has warned colleagues that the last 48 hours of the campaign
will be crucial in determining whether Labour secures an overall majority.
He has ordered that there should be no slackening in the disciplined
campaigning which has given his party the lead.
Last night's rally was designed to reinforce the party's confident image and
lift the morale of its supporters as it enters the final days of
campaigning.
Framed by giant video screens, Mr Kinnock sought to reinforce his image as
prime minister-in-waiting with a dismissive attack on the Conservatives'
'negative' campaigning.
While Mr John Major traded in 'sour insults', Labour would 'carry on
fighting for the British people.'
Setting Labour's task as healing the divisions wrought by 13 years of
Conservative government, Mr Kinnock signalled that education, health,
housing and social welfare would be at the centre of his campaign until
polling day.
He accused the Conservatives of seeking the end of 'free schooling' and the
privatisation of the National Health Service. In a scathing reference to Mr
Major's 'soapbox' campaigning he said: 'What's at issue in this election is
not the soapboxes that people stand on. It's the cardboard boxes that people
live in.'
Mr Kinnock said Labour's alternative prospectus for the economy and social
provision would be based on the experience of successful competitor
countries.
That meant support for investment and innovation and an understanding that
it was essential for a modern government 'to support research, to improve
the transport system, to foster long-term industrial development, and to
make a continual commitment to raising standards of skill.'

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NEIL Kinnock and Mr John Major battled yesterday to raise their strongest
issues to the top of the election agenda, with Labour promising to freeze
prescription charges and the Tories trumpeting their commitment to strong
defences.
Buoyed by Labour's lead in opinion polls published yesterday morning, Mr
Kinnock complained about the impact of government health policies on
patients' pockets and said: 'Putting a price barrier in the way of
prevention today simply adds to the cost of cure tomorrow.'
Mr Robin Cook, shadow health secretary, said the 10 per cent increase in
prescription charges that came into force yesterday would be reversed if
Labour came to power and so 'cut back the cost of being sick'. He pledged
also to restore free eye and dental checks.
The Liberal Democrats also underlined their commitment to public services,
detailing how they would improve the National Health Service and raise
spending on education.
Mr Major claimed that defence was 'an issue of the greatest importance when
opposition policies pose a threat to the security of our country'.
At a press conference peppered with attacks on Labour's past shifts on
defence policy, the prime minister said he would 'always maintain strong
defences for Britain'. He added: 'The Labour party would not. They would cut
our defences to the bone, to the marrow.'
Tory strategists have made a central part of their strategy to win back
voters what they see as the contrasts between the proven leadership
qualities of Mr Major and policy 'U-turns' by Labour.

FT  02 APR 92 / World Trade News: Airbus subsidy accord awaits final hurdle
of ratification
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT was perhaps appropriate that the European Commission and the US should
resolve their six-year-old dispute over government subsidies for Airbus on
April Fool's Day.
Until the last minute, few in the aerospace industry believed the two sides
would reach a compromise.
The issue has provoked intense and regular trade frictions between the
Europe and the EC since 1986, spilling over into the US election campaign
this year and casting a dark cloud over the broader trade liberalisation
negotiations under the aegis of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(Gatt).
But the pact reached in Brussels yesterday is unlikely to be the end of the
story. It still has to be ratified by the US government and the 12
individual EC governments.
'The Europe versus US issue will remain pretty active for the balance of
this year and in the years ahead inspite of the agreement,' said Sir Barry
Duxbury, director of the Society of British Aerospace Companies, the UK
industry's trade organisation.
But both the European Airbus consortium and its two US rivals, Boeing and
McDonnell Douglas, acknowledged that the last minute compromise 'looks like
good progress'.
The US had set a deadline of March 31 for an agreement threatening to take
the Airbus subsidy issue before the Gatt subsidies panel, or worse still to
take unilateral action against Airbus by imposing contravening duties on
Airbus airliners which are sold in the US market.
That in turn would have led to retaliatory action on the part of the EC
against US aircraft sales in Europe. 'It would have been a no win
situation,' an Airbus official said.
'If a compromise is not found, we will both be losers,' Mr Jean Pierson, the
Airbus managing director, warned a few months ago.
The new bilateral agreement will cover all new civil airliners over 100
seats but government subsidies granted by both sides before the agreement
will not be affected.
This reflects the fact that Airbus has now reached maturity, having captured
more than 20 per cent of the world market and having developed a complete
family of aircraft to compete against the traditional dominance of the
market by the US manufacturers.
Without government support, Airbus would never have got off the ground. As
Mr Pierson has often argued: 'Airbus stands today as the only recourse
against a monopoly of the civil aerospace industry by US manufacturers.'
But the US manufacturers, worried by the growing inroads of the European
group in their home market, felt Airbus could now stand on its own feet.
In turn, the EC and Airbus complained the US manufacturers had benefited
from indirect subsidies from military programmes and other US government
agencies.
Each side claimed that the other had received in direct or indirect
subsidies at least Dollars 25bn during the last 15 years.
Tentative agreement has now been reached on the following issues:
Direct subsidies: Direct grants for aircraft production will be banned and
direct subsidies for new aircraft programmes will be limited to about 30 per
cent of total development costs. Conditions will be imposed on the timing of
repayments because the US was worried of the risk of manufacturers not
repaying subsidies at the end of a development programme.
Indirect subsidies: The level of indirect grants is expected to be limited
to less than 5 per cent of a manufacturer's civil aircraft turnover. EC and
Airbus officials claimed this was the first implicit admission by the US
that its civil aircraft industry benefited from defence and space research
subsidies.
Transparency: The two sides will meet twice a year for consultations and
will be expected to keep each other informed about current and future
projects and the level of government support attached to these programmes.
Inducements: New rules will include a ban on governments putting pressure on
third countries to buy aircraft.
Suspension of restrictions: Both sides can ask for suspension of part of the
agreement if a manufacturer's business is badly hit by 'external' political
and economic factors.
Trade disputes: Both sides have agreed not to initiate any new unilateral
trade action against the other over aircraft subsidies.
The new bilateral agreement will find its first applications with the
current proposals of the three manufacturers to launch programmes to develop
new ultra large 600-800 seat airliners as well as some less ambitious
programmes for smaller airliners.
These include the proposed Airbus 120-seater A319 aircraft, an eventual
replacement for the Boeing 737 narrowbody twinjet and McDonnell Douglas'
plans for a new medium sized airliner the MDXX. McDonnell Douglas is also
hoping to launch later this year its MD-12 400-600 seater airliner programme
with Asian partners.
Disputes seem certain to continue on the extent to which military research
grants are of direct benefit to commercial aircraft development; on
transparency of aircraft financing with the EC arguing in the past that too
much transparency risked releasing commercially sensitive information; and
especially on government inducements and other practices to win new aircraft
sales.
But the two sides, at least, managed to avoid an all out trade war.

FT  02 APR 92 / World Trade News: Delors may intervene over trade talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, is expected to try
to break the impasse in the Uruguay Round trade liberalisation negotiations
in talks with President George Bush later this month.
This emerged as a senior EC negotiator, Mr Hugo Paemen, called for 'last,
ultimate efforts' to get a political breakthrough in the Round before the
Easter deadline set by Mr Arthur Dunkel, director general of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt).
Mr Paemen said a political accord would have to resolve the differences on
agri - culture, services and market access, and that detailed 'implementing
work' could be done in the following two months.
Commission officials said Mr Delors was likely to try to get a mandate on
the Uruguay Round from EC heads of government, before meeting Mr Bush on
April 22, along with Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, prime minister of Portugal,
which currently holds the EC's rotating presidency.
This meeting is one of the twice-yearly EC-US summits, but is now set to be
the last chance for a Gatt breakthrough if none occurs by the April 19
deadline.
It also emerged yesterday that EC-US negotiators may be making some headway
on the farm subsidy row, which, along with US reluctance to open up parts of
its service industries, is the main obstacle to a deal. In particular, there
are signs of movement on the so-called 'green box' issue - whether
Washington will consent to allowing payments Brussels wants to make to
farmers, in compensation for big price cuts, to be considered as non-trade
distorting.
The US is understood to be considering a 'blue box,' whereby these payments
would be unchallenged for six years, provided they then became degressive
and the EC provided a framework ensuring they constrained rather than
promoted production.
There is so far no sign the US is prepared to meet EC objections to Gatt's
formula to cut the volume of subsidised exports, in addition to the
subsidies.
The chances of the EC accepting some volume constraint depend, some
officials now believe, on the US agreeing to a partial freeze on its cheap
grain substitutes coming into the Community.

FT  02 APR 92 / World Trade News: Voluntary restraint may give way to Steel
Wars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE stalled effort to negotiate a Multilateral Steel Arrangement (MSA),
phasing out subsidies and market barriers among leading steel exporting
nations, may stand as one more failure of free market idealists who at the
end of the 20th century tried to build a world without trade distortions.
Mr Bert Delano, a spokesman for the US specialty steel industry, sees the
effort to get other nations to give up their regional aids, environmental
subsidies, assistance to redundant workers and the rest as 'naive'.
It is the view of others at the bargaining table in Geneva that the US,
which launched the talks, stood as the principal obstacle to agreement by
refusing to amend its anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws.
Not surprisingly, Mr Delano sees the failure of the talks as all the fault
of 'foreigners' who understood that the US 'badly' wanted an MSA and used
the opportunity to try to 'gut' US trade laws. With the expiration of the
Voluntary Restraint Agreements (VRAs) on Tuesday night, these laws may be
given full rein.
'Every part of the industry has kept cases in some state of readiness as an
insurance policy against the failure of the multilateral talks,' said one
Washington trade lawyer. These cases are could be filed in chunks - product
by product - against several countries at once.
Although the industry has from time to time threatened to unload a
lorry-load of cases before the doors of the Commerce Department, decisions
to file have yet to be made. There is lingering hope that the Bush
administration will succumb to election year pressure and change its mind
about renewing the 'voluntary' restrains. Alternatively, the US industry
might settle for de facto VRAs if foreign governments - particularly the EC,
Japan and Korea - unilaterally decide to continue to restrain their US
exports.
The 'fair trade' option is not without risks for the US industry. Each case
can cost Dollars 50,000-Dollars 100,000 to file, and victory cannot be
assured. Small exporters may be deleted from a trade case by the Commerce
Department because their market share is inconsequential. They may then feel
in the clear to expand their sales in the US.
The massive filings which frightened the EC into negotiating VRAs in 1982
resulted in losses in more than half the cases. That is because US
anti-dumping and subsidy laws - although skewed towards the domestic
producers - are still more fair than many other nations' because they
require a finding by an independent International Trade Commission that an
industry has suffered damage (or will do so in the future) from imports.
The whole process is 'costly, time consuming and you have to be practically
dead before you can win something,' said Mr Delano, sadly.
The VRAs, imposed globally in 1984, were designed to limit US steel imports
to 18-21 per cent. Many countries did not even fill their quotas. But
others, such as stainless steel rod, have lost more than 40 per cent of the
domestic market. One tactic in demonstrating injury will be to compare
imports to the US with other countries, whose governments found injury with
much lower levels of market penetration.
The 36 nations negotiating an MSA agreed to continue the effort, but the
outlook for its success is dim unless there is accord in the Uruguay Round
over subsidies and anti-dumping. It was agreed among a small group of
nations which met on Tuesday after the MSA talks broke off that bilateral
and multilateral efforts would continue; the EC particularly did not want
the negotiation to be seen as breaking up.
The US is likely to continue to talk, said one source close to the
negotiations, because 'you have two people at USTR and that is their only
job. The only thing that will stop them is lack of travel funds.'

FT  02 APR 92 / Arab League opposes sanctions
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ARAB League warned yesterday of dangerous consequences from the United
Nations' imposition of sanctions against Libya, but reaction among most Arab
states was relatively restrained.
In Cairo, home of the Arab League, officials were describing the resolution
as hasty and ill-conceived, and they doubted it would force Libya to yield
the two men suspected of the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am airliner over
Scotland.
The league called on the international community to intensify the search for
compromise 'in order to avoid the dangerous consequences of this
resolution.' League officials said they would continue working behind the
scenes in an effort to defuse the crisis, but they were not optimistic.
Iraq, Lebanon and the Palestine Liberation Organisation derided Security
Council resolution 748 as another example of 'double standards', comparing
it unfavourably with the west's perceived failure to exert similar pressure
on Israel to vacate Arab land.
The sanctions oblige all UN member states to bar flights to or from Libya,
prohibit arms deals with the North African state and significantly reduce
the staff of Libyan missions.
Libya has been given until April 15 to yield the two men accused of the
airliner bombing in which 270 died. It is also being asked to hand over four
of its nationals to France for questioning in connection with the 1989
downing of a French UTA airliner over Niger in which all 171 passengers and
crew perished.
A Libyan foreign ministry statement accused the US, Britain and France of
conducting a 'crusader war against Arabs and Moslems' by depriving them of
their weapons.
The UN will send a senior envoy to Libya tomorrow to discuss the Lockerbie
dispute, Reuter reports from Cairo. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN
secretary-general, informed the Arab League of the mission.

Mr Shimon Peres easily won second place after Mr Yitzhak Rabin, who unseated

SOUTH KOREA said yesterday that it had no plans to repatriate any of the
5,000 Korean construction workers who risk being stranded in Libya by a
United Nations embargo on air travel.
Government officials said that Korean companies would continue working in
Libya, where the Korean contractors are estimated to be owed almost Dollars
6bn (Pounds 3.4bn) for work already completed. At least four large South
Korean groups - Dong-Ah, Daewoo, Hyundai and Samsung - are currently working
on projects in the country.
Korean companies working in Libya also employ close to 10,000 third-country
nationals, many from Thailand and the Philippines.
The Korean government has been working on contingency plans to prevent
Korean and third country citizens from being stranded. These would involve
moving workers overland to Tunisia where they would be put on chartered
flights.
Mr Ho Seung, assistant foreign minister, said: 'South Korea has requested
help from Tunisia through diplomatic channels on flight re-routing and it
has promised full support.' Korean Air currently flies from Seoul to Tripoli
via Bahrain and Jeddah. The last flight is due to leave Seoul on April 13
just before the UN air embargo takes effect on April 15.
South Korean companies have been very successful at winning contracts in the
Middle East where they have been able to offer low prices on the back of
cheap labour from Asia.
Initially workers were brought from Korea. More recently labour has been
come from other countries. Libya yesterday gave hundreds of foreigners exit
visas. A western ambassador in Tripoli said 250 South Koreans and a
'considerable number' of European Community nationals were given visas.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CATERPILLAR, the world's largest maker of earth-moving equipment, announced
yesterday that it would impose its last contract offer next Monday, five
months into a strike at the company by the United Auto Workers union in the
US.
The company said it would ask all strikers to return to work on April 6, and
would fill the positions of those who do not return by recalling laid-off
employees or hiring new replacements.
The use of replacements has been regarded as potentially explosive. The UAW
responded last night to the prospect by placing on strike another 1,800
workers at four additional plants. These joined 10,800 union members already
idled, making a total of 12,600 or nearly 80 per cent of the Caterpillar
workforce.
Union anger is likely to be further stoked by the company's statement that
it has found, during the strike, it can operate with fewer employees.
Caterpillar officials estimated they would reduce the workforce by some
10-15 per cent.
The company decided to impose its last contract offer after another attempt
at negotiations failed last week.
Next, the UAW complained to the National Labour Relations Board of what it
called unfair labour practices at Caterpillar. If the charges were accepted
by the NLRB, the company would be prevented from hiring permanent
replacements for striking union members, though temporary ones would be
allowed.
The company's first-quarter results are expected to show a sizeable loss due
to 'economic conditions and the strike,' said Mr Gerald Flaherty,
Caterpillar Group president.
Caterpillar reached a settlement with the US Securities and Exchange
Commission yesterday over its failure to disclose adequately information
about its Brazilian operations in 1989 and 1990.
It agreed to comply with disclosure rules henceforth and was not fined.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES that the US economy is moving decisively out of recession were lifted
yesterday by the second sharp monthly increase in the purchasing managers'
index, a closely watched gauge of US industrial conditions.
Led by a surge in new orders, the index rose to 54.1 per cent in March,
compared with 52.4 per cent in February and only 47.4 per cent in December
and January. A reading above 50 per cent indicates expansion of the
manufacturing economy.
Mr Robert Bretz, a senior official at the National Association of Purchasing
Managers, said growth of new orders appeared stronger than in last year's
aborted economic recovery. He was thus hoping for sustained production.
Proliferating signs of recovery have led to disputes about the timing of the
recession's end. Mr Bretz said the index, which hit a low of 40.4 per cent
in March last year, indicated the recession probably ended last spring.
In a circular to clients, Mr Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko
Securities in New York, said the official indices of leading and coincident
indicators indicated the recession had persisted until this February.
The purchasing managers' new orders index - a component of the overall index
 -rose from 57.5 per cent to 62.4 per cent, the highest level since June
1988.
The association said this indicated economic growth would continue for at
least the next few months.
The component measuring production rose from 58.6 per cent to 60.1 per cent,
the highest level since last October. Data on prices pointed to little
inflationary pressure in the early stages of recovery.

FT  02 APR 92 / Clinton attacks Bush over 'isolationism': The main
Democratic presidential contender addresses foreign policy
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR BILL Clinton, front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination in
the US, yesterday accused President George Bush of 'invoking a new world
order without enunciating a new American purpose' in external relations.
In a foreign policy address in New York, the governor of Arkansas charged
that the Bush administration had brought about 'a new birth of isolationism
on the left and on the right' of US politics.
He was specifically critical of what he called 'an overly cautious approach'
to assisting the former Soviet Union.
But his main purpose was to take on the president in Mr Bush's perceived
area of strength - management of foreign policy - and to contrast it with
his own internationalist prescriptions.
The speech, his first on foreign policy since last December, was also
intended to deflect attention from his own bitter contest with Mr Jerry
Brown, former governor of California, in the New York, Wisconsin and Kansas
Democratic primaries next week. It was delivered the day after Mr Brown had
thrashed him in the Vermont party caucuses.
Mr Clinton, implicitly critical of both Mr Bush and Mr Brown, said the
American people were being offered 'a false choice' between domestic and
foreign priorities. The two, he argued, were indivisible, and restoring the
nation's domestic strength and competitivity constituted a necessary
precursor to 'leading the world we have done so much to make.'
He conceded that the president had shown 'deft' crisis management in the
Gulf War. But, he went on, the lack of a positive vision had led to
miscalculations and missed opportunities.' He cited the 'browbeating' of
Israel, earlier attempts to woo Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, 'coddling
China's ageing rulers,' and failing to keep pace with the democratic
revolutions in the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe, including the
absence of US recognition of Slovenia and Croatia.
Mr Clinton saw a world shaped by three realities: continuing danger even
after the end of the Cold War, with threats from such diverse quarters as
ethnic rivalries, terrorism and the proliferation of nuclear weapons; the
force of democracy: and the imperative of strong US leadership.
As president, he said, 'I will not shrink from using military force
responsibly and I will maintain the forces we need to win, and win
decisively, should that necessity arise.'
In Europe, 'we must maintain our ties to Nato, even as the Europeans play a
stronger role both within Nato and in the evolution of future secureity
arrangements for the continent.'
He committed himself strongly to the UN and to international financial
institutions, while reserving the US right to act alone when vital national
interests were at stake. The US should pay its arrears to the UN, and Japan
and Germany should be made permanent members of its Security Council.
It would, he said, be 'deeply irresonsible' to pull the plug on foreign aid,
and he charged Mr Bush with failing, yesterday's announcement in Washington
notwithstanding, to show leadership in pressing for bigger quotas at the
International Monetary Fund.
The overall message was to emphasise the historic changes taking place in
the world asnd the continued need for US leadership. 'After World War two,'
he concluded, 'in similar circumstances, our nation proclaimed its character
with an historic pledge to defend, to build, and to lead. I am confident the
American people stand ready to affirm that pledge again today.'

ACTIVIST environmental groups Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, with the
Brazilian Forum of Non-
Governmental Organisations, yesterday launched a blistering attack on the
stalled negotiations for the UN environment summit, to be held in Rio de
Janeiro in June.
They warned yesterday that the meeting might do more harm than good,
exacerbating north-south differences.
'Unless there is a dramatic change of course, the Rio conference is heading
towards failure of historic proportions,' the organisations stated in Rio.
Their document sets out ten points seen as essential 'to give the planet the
minimum changes of survival.' Chief of these is a commitment by President
George Bush of the US to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions that contribute to
global warming. 'Without this, the conference will be a disaster,' it
warned.
The attack heightens fears over the content of the conference and comes amid
renewed worries over the Brazilian organisation of it, particularly
following the resignation of President Fernando Collor's entire
administration on Monday.

FT  02 APR 92 / The transformation of a regional bank: Problems remain at
the IADB, but much has been achieved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE the region it was formed to serve 33 years ago, the Inter-American
Development Bank (IADB) languished throughout the 1980s. Now, optimism is
high over prospects for the economies of Latin America and over the role
which the bank has carved out for itself in the 1990s.
Four years ago, the relevance of the institution to Latin America's deep
economic problems was being questioned. In 1988, its lending fell below
Dollars 2bn: a drop in the ocean compared to the billions of dollars being
transferred out of the region.
The bank's management and its largest shareholder, the US of the Reagan
years, were consistently at loggerheads. It was used by Latin American
governments as a way of rewarding faithful servants with sinecures. As a
result, it was inefficient and ineffective.
The bank, which is preparing for its annual meeting next week in the
Dominican Republic, has not solved all these problems. But it has come a
long way.
The change dates back three years, to the laboriously negotiated capital
increase settled amid much acrimony. This widened the bank's role beyond
that of a traditional project-lender, helping the bank's lending nearly to
triple.
The bank was put at the centre of President Bush's Enterprise for the
Americas initiative, which foresaw increased economic and trade co-operation
between North and South America. The initiative was seized upon with
enthusiasm by many Latin American governments, which saw the end of
superpower rivalry as necessitating new relationships within the hemisphere.
The man who helped to transform the image of the bank is its president, Mr
Enrique Iglesias, a well-connected, outgoing Uruguayan diplomat and
architect of the current Uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations.
Mr Iglesias was not, however, the man to reform the internal administration
of the bank, whose staff now totals 1,700. That task fell to his deputy, Mr
James Conrow. He was seen initially as Washington's 'hard man,' but this
bluff, bearded American cut a more sympathetic figure, while still being
effective in restructuring the bank. Much of the restructuring is done. Some
departments are under review - the public relations, legal and secretariat
sections - and the auditing and control functions are also to be examined.
The bank is again beginning to talk about raising more capital. The increase
agreed in 1989 expanded capital from Dollars 15.7bn to Dollars 26.5bn and
allowed for a Dollars 22.5bn lending programme in the four years 1990-1993.
This has put the IADB on a par with the World Bank in terms of new loans
made to the region and may lead the IADB soon surpass it: despite the new
ability of some countries to attract private capital, the region's
investment needs are huge.
Although not on the formal agenda at next week's meeting, a central element
of the discussions over a capital increase will be the question of whether
the bank should break with the past and lend directly and without government
guarantee to the private sector. Some governments, such as Mexico's, have
opposed this in the past, in part because they say that the bank is not
equipped to assess commercial risk.
On the other hand, governments such as Chile's worry that, if they hand over
large parts of infrastructure development to the private sector, they lose
access to IADB capital for infrastructure development. The meeting will
assess, however, whether to expand the bank's capacity to make balance of
payments, as opposed to project, loans.
The bank has been able to make such sector-loans - meant to encourage
reforms in specified sectors of the economy - since the last capital
increase. The idea was that about 25 per cent of its lending should be in
sectoral loans over 1990-93.
The 1991 figure was 37 per cent of total lending (without significant
lending to either Brazil or Argentina), and the bank wants to formalise an
increased share for sector lending. It wants this in part to encourage
reform in its smaller member countries, in which the World Bank has less
involvement but to which the IADB must make 35 per cent of its loans. It has
also been asked to contribute finance to Brady-style bank debt
restructurings, from its sector-lending programme.
The bank also sees itself as increasing its role in the alleviation of
poverty and in the social-investment sectors such as health and education
that have been badly neglected in many countries through the austerity of
the 1980s.

FT  02 APR 92 / Western aid to fill trade gap for Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Western aid to Russia unveiled yesterday is intended to fill the
critical balance of payments gap faced by Russia after the collapse of its
external trade, just as it is embarking on a drastic reform programme.
Broad details were spelt out yesterday in Bonn and Washington, on behalf of
the Group of Seven (G7) western industrialised states, in an open effort to
strengthen support for President Boris Yeltsin's economic reforms.
Mr Horst Kohler, state secretary in Germany's finance ministry and
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chief adviser for the forthcoming world economic
summit in Munich, said yesterday the Dollars 18bn (Pounds 10.4bn) assumption
for this year included Dollars 4bn drawn directly from the International
Monetary Fund.
This represents 100 per cent of the Russian quota of 3 per cent, agreed by
existing IMF members on Tuesday. The other former Soviet republics will get
a further 1.75 per cent.
On top of the Dollars 4bn would be up to Dollars 1.5bn from the World Bank
in the current year, and more cash available from the Bank for European
Reconstruction and Development.
Export credit guarantees, and food credits from the western countries, would
push the total up to around Dollars 13bn, and contributions from the
Scandinavian countries should bring it up to Dollars 18bn, Mr Kohler said.
The entire package depends on agreement between the Russian government and
the IMF on an adjustment programme, which could be finalised in May, with
first credit tranches coming as soon as June - before the Munich summit in
July.
World Bank credits should also be available in June or July, Mr Kohler said.
The secondary stabilisation fund for the rouble would also be directly
linked to the implementation of the IMF adjustment programme, and only a
global sum of Dollars 6bn has been agreed.
Finance could be provided partly by the G7 member states, and partly by the
fund, with a supervisory committee to ensure that the strict conditions -
above all that the money should not be used to fund consumer goods imports -
are upheld.
Mr Kohler, speaking on the express instructions of Mr Kohl, welcomed the US
involvement in the support programme as 'late but gratifying'. He said that
it represented a fair burden-sharing for Germany, which had been carrying by
far the largest share of aid and credit for the former Soviet Union.
The only new money from Germany would be whatever it has to contribute to
currency stabilisation.
Its main contribution to the Dollars 18bn comes from DM5bn (Pounds 1.7bn) in
export credit guarantees promised this year.
The immediate package concerns Russia alone. However, Mr Kohler said
agreement had been reached in the G7 on a framework for co-operation with
Russia and the other former Soviet republics. Precise details remain to be
finalised.
Mr Kohler said that other republics would have to undergo exactly the same
negotiating process with the IMF in order to qualify for similar treatment.
There would be no exceptions, and he stressed repeatedly that agreement on
an IMF adjustment programme was an 'absolute precondition' for large-scale
western assistance.
On the other hand, he insisted that the framework agreed represented 'the
basis of a reliable aid programme', which would fill the payments gap faced
by Russia in the immediate future, and was intended to strengthen the hand
of Mr Yeltsin and his government to push through their programme.
As soon as Russian membership of the IMF was agreed - by the end of April -
he said the fund and the Russian government would conduct an immediate and
comprehensive 'economic stock-taking'.
That would form the basis of a comprehensive adjustment programme to be
finalised in May. He said the Russian government's economic programme had
already been submitted, and the initial judgment of the fund was positive.

FT  02 APR 92 / Mitterrand prolongs uncertainty on Cresson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Mitterrand yesterday appeared to be having second thoughts over
the dismissal of Mrs Edith Cresson as French prime minister.
Her removal had previously been regarded as virtually inevitable after the
disastrous setback suffered by the government in the recent round of local
elections.
Le Monde yesterday openly aired the possibility that President Mitterrand
might be in the process of changing his mind over whether to replace Mrs
Cresson. But, Mr Jean Auroux, parliamentary leader of the Socialist Party,
predicted that a new government of some kind would be formed within the next
24 hours.
For the third day running, the President conducted intensive consultations
with friends and associates on the lessons to be drawn from the regional and
departmental elections, in which the Socialists suffered humiliating
defeats.
Mrs Cresson was again summoned to the Elysee Palace for talks, but when she
returned to her office at the Hotel Matignon, it appeared nothing had been
settled.
A broadcaster who accompanied her on Tuesday to the Hanover trade fair said
Mrs Cresson had privately vented her bitterness against the party, accusing
the Socialist leader, Mr Laurent Fabius, and the finance minister, Mr Pierre
Beregovoy, of having sabotaged her premiership.
If President Mitterrand were to ask Mrs Cresson to stay on, she is believed
to have told him that she would want a far-reaching cabinet reshuffle that
would include the removal of many of the barons of the Socialist Party,
known colloquially as 'les elephants'.
The depth of the crisis precipitated by the regional election results also
appears to have brought to the surface antagonisms between leading members
of the Socialist Party, as well as differences over the right policy choices
to respond to the popular vote.
President Mitterrand's delay in making up his mind does not prove that he
has decided to keep Mrs Cresson, nor that he has decided against any of the
other candidates. But he is evidently determined to take all the time he
needs before making up his mind on such a critical choice at such a critical
time, since this is probably the last change of government he can make
before next year's general elections.
Officials at the Elysee Palace said that Mr Mitterrand was mainly
preoccupied in thinking about how the government should best change its
policies in response to the swingeing disavowal of the electorate. They
suggested that the President's strategic decisions in adopting new policies
were more important than the choice of a prime minister. Long delays in the
lead-up to an important decision have been frequent in Mr Mitterrand's
career. In 1983, he hesitated for nine days over whether to dismiss Mr
Pierre Mauroy, before finally asking him to stay on.
Yesterday, there were conflicting signals from the camps of the contending
candidates for prime minister. Some of Mrs Cresson's staff indicated that
she might, after all, stay in office, with one official saying: 'We shall
not leave until the crocuses are completely out. The work goes on.'
However, Mr Beregovoy, widely tipped as the favourite to succeed Mrs
Cresson, was reported to be busily engaged in taking soundings with possible
members of a new cabinet.
However, political sources said some senior party barons had launched a
counter-offensive in favour of the European Commission president, Mr Jacques
Delors - despite the fact that Mr Delors has appeared to rule himself out of
the race. They argue that Mr Beregovoy would not be able to rally support
behind the Socialists, who fell to a mere 18.3 per cent in the regional
elections.

FT  02 APR 92 / Price explosion hits war-worn Serbia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE inhabitants of Serbia awoke yesterday to the news that their government,
under President Slobodan Milosevic, had admitted that inflation could reach
an annual rate of 100,000 per cent.
'Our rate of inflation is the highest in the world', declared a bold
headline in Politika, the Serbian daily. 'It could hit 100,000 per cent by
this month.'
The soaring rate of inflation is bringing home to Serbs the price of the
seven-month war against Croatia. Many factories have stopped production and
industrial output has fallen by more than 30 per cent in relation to the
already low levels of last year.
While the federal government is still servicing its foreign debt of Dollars
16bn (Pounds 9.2bn), many economists doubt Yugoslavia will be able to keep
up payments. 'It is no longer a question of 'if' but 'when' the payments
stop,' says one diplomat.
'The federal reserves are officially put at Dollars 1.95bn (Pounds 1.12bn),
commercial reserves are at Dollars 500m - but these are collateralised. Free
reserves are at zero,' he said. The only flourishing sector is the black
market in hard currency. Desperate to keep pace with the plummeting dinar,
shopkeepers change some prices twice a day. A family which just a year ago
earned an average monthly wage equal to DM1,000 (Pounds 350) has seen their
combined income fall to the equivalent of DM100. Hundreds of Serbs last
month gathered in the centre of Belgrade to demonstrate their despair at the
soaring prices by offering their babies up for adoption to Mr Milosevic. Mrs
Maja Vujovic, the mother of 18 month-old Marko, said: 'I make 24,000 dinars,
a month's supply of Pampers nappies costs more than my salary.' The average
monthly wage for factory workers amounts to Dollars 30 on the black market.
It would take a worker 13 years to buy a no-frills Yugo car manufactured in
Serbia. Mr Dragan Stosic, a factory worker, said: 'My monthly wage is 16,000
dinars (Pounds 20). My head aches from the fear of how I will be able to
feed my family of four after I've paid out rent.'
Farmers have also seen inflation erode the prices they receive for their
crops.
Mr Dusko Vasic, a peasant from Pozarevac, the birthplace of Mr Milosevic,
says: 'From sunrise to sunset, my entire family farms our 10 hectares.' Two
years ago 100kg of beans sold for Pounds 48, but inflation means the price
in real terms has fallen to Pounds 11.50.
Observers have long predicted that the collapsing economy would touch off a
tidal wave of social unrest.
But the government has so far succeeded, in the eyes of most Serbs, in
deflecting blame for the economic situation on to Croat leaders and the
west.
It has hinted at a programme of economic reform, but last year it was
instrumental in undermining the market reforms of Mr Ante Markovic, the
former prime minister. Mr Miroljub Labus, an economist, points out: 'The
Serbian government is busy drawing new borders, claiming that their
anti-inflation programme cannot be implemented until the state is clearly
defined. . . We should not expect any programme in the next couple of
months.'
The presidents of the six sparring ex-Yugoslav republics agreed yesterday to
work towards restoring trade and infrastructure links in a move that may
increase pressure on the EC to remove its sanctions on Serbia, writes David
Buchan in Brussels. After a low-key session of the EC-sponsored peace
conference, its chairman, Lord Carrington, also hailed as progress the fact
that leaders of Bosnia's Moslem, Serb and Croat communities agreed not to
renege on their March 18 accord to negotiate a new constitution despite
continuing violence . For the first time since the conference started last
September, republican leaders appear to be taking seriously the need to
patch up their collapsing economies.

GERMAN companies are expecting the current downturn in the domestic economy

that German businessmen are confident that by the summer of next year they
will have put high interest rates, poor profitability and high wage demands
firmly behind them.
Manufacturing companies are expecting a nominal 4 per cent growth in
domestic sales and a 7 per cent rise in exports for the whole of next year.
To help meet expected demand they are planning to increase investment by 7
per cent next year, compared to just 1 per cent planned for the current

UP TO Dollars 18bn (Pounds 10.4bn) in credits and loan guarantees is to be
provided for Russia this year, along with Dollars 6bn for a rouble
stabilisation fund, under an aid programme unveiled yesterday by the Group
of Seven leading western industrialised states.
The package was sealed only after the US committed itself to the programme.
President George Bush said the US backed a 'comprehensive and integrated
programme to support the struggle for freedom' in the former Soviet Union.
'The stakes are as high as any we have faced in this century. Together we
won the cold war and today we must win the peace', Mr Bush said. The package
was presented in Bonn and Washington as the basis of a 'Help for Self-Help'
programme, which must be underpinned by agreement between the Russian
government and the International Monetary Fund on a full-scale structural
adjustment programme.
Although many details, particularly of the rouble stabilisation fund, have
yet to be finalised, the scale of western assistance was spelt out in Bonn
and Washington as part of an attempt to win support for the economic reforms
of Russian president Boris Yeltsin. He faces a crucial vote on his package -
intended to be the basis of the IMF agreement - in the Russian parliament on
Monday.
The package, seen in Moscow as an important show of international support
for Mr Yeltsin, will put him in a stronger position to beat off critics at
the congress. Some deputies at the meeting will be seeking the resignation
of Mr Yegor Gaidar, first deputy prime minister and architect of the reform
programme.
Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, and the driving force behind the aid
programme as chairman of the next G7 world economic summit in Munich, said
the package was intended as 'a decisive signal of the political and economic
support' of the western powers for Mr Yeltsin's reforms.
'We know that we can only have a limited influence on the reform process in
the Commonwealth of Independent States', he said. 'But given the dimension
of the task . . . the west must do everything to contribute towards the
stabilisation of the democracy and the economy there.'
Mr Horst Kohler, German state secretary for finance, and Mr Kohl's chief
negotiator in the G7, said the Dollars 18bn was the sum total of credits
from the IMF (Dollars 4bn) and the World Bank (Dollars 1.5bn), as well as
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, export credit
guarantees and food credits, both from the G7 and Scandinavian countries.
He forecast that the total would be enough to meet the immediate gap in the
Russian balance of payments this year.
He said G7 finance officials had agreed in Paris on Tuesday to extend the
roll-over period for repayments of principal on ex-Soviet debt - in exchange
for Russian agreement for western auditors to inspect the books of the
Vneshekonombank, and the country's leading hard currency industries.
The intention would be to try to identify where hard currency earnings are
leaking out of the Russian system, either in the form of capital flight, or
as illegal foreign currency bank accounts kept abroad.
In addition to these multilateral aid measures Mr Bush threw his weight
behind the US's Dollars 12bn contribution to the IMF's quota increase, which
has been stalled in Congress, and announced a series of unilateral US aid
measures.
These include Dollars 600m of agricultural credit guarantees to help Russia
buy US food, and a further Dollars 500m for the Ukraine and other former
Soviet republics and the repeal of 'Cold War legislation'.
Mr James Baker, US secretary of state said the US would take up 25 per cent
of the rouble stabilisation fund, and its overall share would be between 20
and 25 per cent of the Dollars 24bn G7 package.

FT  02 APR 92 / Lib Dem surge prompts Major to shift attack: Opinion polls
highlight volatility of electorate and set back Labour hopes of decisive
lead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SURGE in Liberal Democrat support at the expense of both Labour and the
Conservatives last night provoked Mr John Major to turn on the third party
in an attempt to recapture the support of wavering Tories.
Two opinion polls, highlighting the volatility of the electorate, set back
Labour hopes of having taken a decisive lead over the Tories. The polls led
Mr Major to accuse Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, of being the
'door keeper to a Labour Britain'.
Mr Neil Kinnock, Labour leader, launched the final phase of his general
election campaign last night with the largest political rally in British
post-war history and - in spite of the latest poll results - a confident
prediction of victory on April 9.
But earlier he implicitly acknowledged the Liberal Democrat threat in
arguing that 'Britain needs a change of government if it is to be
successful, and the only way to get that is to vote Labour.'
As Tory strategists tried to avoid any impression of gloom descending over
their campaigning, an NOP poll for today's Independent puts the
Conservatives on 37 per cent - two points behind Labour. But Labour's score
was three percentage points lower than last week. The Liberal Democrats, in
contrast, are up five percentage points over the week at 19 per cent,
A Gallup opinion poll in today's Daily Telegraph will come as relief for the
Tories, giving them, at 38 per cent, a half a percentage point lead over
Labour. But Liberal Democrats are up four points at 20 1/2 per cent.
Speaking near Bath, where Mr Chris Patten, the Tory chairman, is defending a
majority of 1,412 over the Liberal Democrats, the prime minister warned that
Mr Ashdown was 'the Trojan Horse' for a Labour government. He described Lib
Dem policies as 'close cousins' of Labour's.
A upbeat Mr Ashdown responded by promising that his party would not be
swayed from its 'positive' campaigning. Speaking in Cheltenham, he told
supporters: 'Your vote is not a protest vote. A vote for the Liberal
Democrats is a principled, positive vote - which is why we are gaining
ground as each day goes by.'
He added: 'Your vote is not a back-door vote for Labour, or for the Tories.
A vote for the Liberal Democrats - in Cheltenham, in Hereford, and in dozens
of other constituencies up and down the country - is a winning vote for the
Liberal Democrats.'
Later on ITN, Mr Ashdown deliberately distanced himself from Labour's
'swingeing' tax proposals for higher earners.
He said he would 'not be prepared to go along' with a government that
proposed a top rate of 50 per cent plus nine per cent National Insurance
contributions, as set out by Labour.
As Mrs Margaret Thatcher called on Conservatives 'to say that it was our
policies which brought Britain from decline to high repute the world over',
Tory officials said efforts in the campaign's last week would concentrate on
Conservative strengths, including law and order today.
Meanwhile, senior Labour strategists voiced confidence that Labour was set
to end 13 years of Conservative government. At the Sheffield rally - an
extravaganza estimated to cost Pounds 150,000 and attracting 10,000
supporters - Mr Kinnock said: 'In nine days' time Britain is going to have a
Labour government.'
Private polling evidence indicated that Labour's share of the vote was now
soundly established at more than 40 per cent, the strategists said. That was
enough to ensure that Mr Kinnock entered Downing Street on April 10.
But Mr Kinnock has privately warned senior colleagues that Labour's
performance next Thursday is likely to depend on the final 48 hours of the
campaign.
He has told them that there must be no slackening of the tight discipline
under which Labour has so far operated.
Last night's rally, designed to demonstrate to the voters Labour's
confidence and to spur on party workers during the last week of the
campaign, saw Mr Kinnock combine an attack on 13 years of Tory government
with his own vision of Labour's prospectus.
He said Labour was assured of victory, because 'people know that we will
govern as we have campaigned - strongly, positively, looking to the future'.
Attacking the widening gulf between rich and poor, he derided Mr Major's
recent 'soapbox' performances. 'What is an issue in this election is not
soapboxes that people stand on. It's the cardboard boxes that people live
in.'

FT  02 APR 92 / Shares fall on prospect of Labour win
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE PRICES in London fell sharply yesterday as investors came to terms
with opinion polls showing the Labour party with a clear lead.
The polls were the main factor driving the FT-SE 100 index of leading shares
down 31.5 to close at 2,408.6. Prices of government gilt-edged securities
fell too, closing nearly a point down.
Mr Robin Aspinall, an economist at Schroders, the merchant bank, said: 'Last
week six out of 10 people in the City thought the Tories would probably win
the election. Now it's six out of 10 who believe a Labour victory is
possible. The City doesn't like the idea of a Labour government and the
nervousness we've seen is the result.'
Yesterday's drop in the FT-SE index means the index has lost nearly 170
points since Budget day on March 10. The jitters also forced up rates in the
London money market, indicating a perception that if Labour wins it might
increase base rates.
Relatively few investors shifted funds out of sterling yesterday. The fall
in the pound against the D-Mark was just half a pfennig. The pound closed in
London at DM2.85, 10 pfennigs below its DM2.95 central rate in the European
exchange rate mechanism (ERM).
The market's worries had their effect on the key three-month interbank rate,
at which banks lend among themselves. It climbed  3/8 of a point, to close
at about 11 1/4 per cent. That pointed to an increase soon in base rates -
which have been held at 10 1/2 per cent for nearly seven months.
Mr John Shepperd, an economist at SG Warburg Securities, said: 'The markets
are looking to a Labour victory, and many people are taking Mr John Smith
(Labour's shadow chancellor) on his word that he will not devalue the pound
in the ERM. But there is also a belief that as soon as Labour takes office,
investors will test his resolve on this point, and sell sterling. On this
basis, to keep the pound in its band, base rates will have to rise.'
Mr Ken De La Salle, head of foreign exchange at National Westminster Bank,
said another reason for nervousness was the size of the public sector
borrowing requirement, which the Treasury says will be Pounds 28bn in the
government's financial year.' To fund this, base rates might rise.
irrespective of who forms the next government.'

FT  02 APR 92 / Unpaid government bills stall Civil Service headhunters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT appeared to have egg on its face yesterday after the Cabinet
Office admitted that late payment of bills by government departments had
caused cash flow problems at a hived-off agency which selects high fliers
for the Civil Service.
About 30 business people and public figures who help in the selection
process have been told that payment of their fees has been delayed. A letter
to them from the Civil Service commissioner blames cash flow problems at
Recruitment and Assessment Services (RAS), which recruits under contract to
government departments and agencies.
'It appears that the Cabinet Office is informing a cross-section of the
establishment that the much-vaunted Civil Service financial and accounting
reforms don't work as well as they are supposed to,' said one recipient of
the letter.
The Cabinet Office said last night that all outstanding fees would be paid
by Friday. Some of the payments are for work done at the end of January.
The delays will be embarrassing for ministers who have condemned the late
payment of small businesses by large companies. In his Budget speech last
month, Mr Norman Lamont described the practice of boosting cash flow by
delaying payments as 'wholly deplorable'.
Government departments, he said, had a good record for paying their own
bills on time and the government hoped their example would be followed by
private sector companies.
The delays reveal increasing financial problems at one of the government's
executive agencies, on the day that 15 new ones were launched. RAS looks set
to make an Pounds 800,000 loss in its first year, against the government's
target of recovering all its costs in full.
Income at RAS has been depressed by reduced recruitment to the Civil
Service. RAS has also lost business from departments which have taken
advantage of rules introduced in April 1991 allowing them to do their own
recruitment.

FT  02 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris falls back as Cresson
clings on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOKYO'S DROP and domestic uncertainty weighed on bourses yesterday, writes
Our Markets Staff.
PARIS fell in nervous trading on fears that Mrs Edith Cresson might stay on
as prime minister after all. However, optimists still believed that she
would be replaced by the finance minister, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, and expected
an announcement today. The CAC-40 index fell to 1,919.87 before recovering
to close 14.36 lower at 1,928.07. Turnover was modest at FFr2.7bn, with
Perrier accounting for FFr558m.
Paribas lost another FFr12.10 or 3 per cent to FFr382 as the bank gave
details of its UK exposure to London analysts. The insurer AGF rose FFr8 to
FFr508 in volume of 122,880 shares which was virtually made up by two block
trades.
Sommer Allibert, the industrial and home equipment maker, added FFr46 or 3.4
per cent to FFr1,405 in spite of a 62 per cent slide in 1991 profit.
Analysts attributed the rise to speculative buying on hopes of a management
change after criticism from leading shareholders. The stock is also viewed
as a turnround situation.
Bic, the razor and pen manufacturer, jumped FFr34 or 4.9 per cent to FFr719
after reporting better-than-expected 1991 results.
FRANKFURT reversed Tuesday's gains, as an absence of corporate news
depressed sentiment. A speech by Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank deputy
president, in which he restated the view that wage increases must be reined
in, also weighed on the market. The DAX index fell 10.65 to 1,707.30, while
the FAZ index, calculated at midsession, was 0.91 weaker at 698.95. Turnover
fell to DM4.8bn from DM5.1bn.
Lufthansa closed down DM5.20 or 3.6 per cent to DM145.10 on unconfirmed
reports that the airline had suffered a DM400m loss in the first quarter.
Allianz weakened DM36 to DM2,118 after the cartel office said that it had
written to the insurer asking it to reduce its 47 per cent holding in
Dresdner Bank. An Allianz official said that the group will give an initial
response today. Dresdner put on 40 pfg to DM350.20.
Deutsche Bank, which is expected to release good 1991 earnings today,
advanced 50 pfg to DM713.50.
Among car makers BMW, which reported a 24 per cent increase in first quarter
group sales, in line with forecasts, fell DM2.00 to DM572.50. Volkswagen
slipped DM2.50 to DM361.30.
Schering, which has been under pressure following an analysts meeting last
week, weakened DM9.30 at DM802.20.
MILAN calmed down after Tuesday's rebound and dealers expected little change
ahead of the general election at the weekend. The Comit index rose 1.67 to
504.10 in turnover estimated at L85bn after Tuesday's L90bn.
Sip, the telephone company, ran into some profit-taking after Tuesday's
gains, falling L11 to L1,445 as volume remained heavy at 8.5m shares.
Banca Nazionale dell' Agricoltura tumbled on fears that the state-owned
Credito Italiano would sell its stake in the bank, following a report in a
Rome newspaper quoting Mr Franco Nobili, the president of the state holding
company, IRI. BNA fell L315 or 6.1 per cent to L4,890. Credito controls 8.5
per cent of BNA's shares and 22.4 per cent of Bonfiche Siele, the holding
company that controls a further 48 per cent of BNA. BNA and related issues
were temporarily suspended in early March because of a dispute about
ownership.
ZURICH, which rose moderately in early trade, weakened after the release of
data suggesting that inflation was increasing. The SMI index finished down
10.5 at 1,826.7.
Swissair bearers closed up SFr7 at SFr745 after announcing group net profits
of SFr83m and a resumption of dividend payments.
The chemical sector, which has performed strongly this week, weakened on
profit-taking. Ciba-Geigy bearers and registered shares fell SFr20 and SFr10
to SFr3,470 and SFr3,480 respectively. Roche bearers eased SFr60 to
SFr4,290.
AMSTERDAM lacked domestic news and investors appeared to turn their
attention towards companies with a US exposure. One analyst commented that
the positive economic news coming out of America would benefit those stocks.
Wessanen, which derives 40 per cent of its operating earnings from America,
gained 30 cents to Fl 91.80. Philips was also stronger, rising 40 cents to
Fl 36.80 and Royal Dutch advanced 50 cents to Fl 141.70. The CBS Tendency
Index fell 0.2 to 124.55 in turnover of Fl 516.5m.
STOCKHOLM followed overseas markets lower. The Affarsvarlden general index
closed at 994.7, down 5.2, in turnover of SKr399m after SKr521m.
Volvo B fell SKr3 to SKr415 on reports that its partner Renault is in
negotiations with Citroen.
BRUSSELS's Bel-20 Index ended 3.52 lower at 1,189.49. In retailers, Delhaize
eased BFr20 to BFr9,410 on profit-taking, while GIB reversed a three-day
decline, climbing BFr16 or 1.2 per cent to BFr1,348.
MADRID eased with the focus mainly on blue chips. The general index closed
down 2.19 to 253.28 in turnover of Pta10.5bn.
ISTANBUL declined ahead of a four-day holiday. The 75-share index fell 14.44
to 4,062.18 in turnover of TL247.6bn after TL392.8bn.

FT  02 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei drops 3.9 per
cent despite rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of Japan's 75 basis point-cut in the official discount rate to 3.75
per cent failed to alleviate the stock market's bearishness, and the Nikkei
average plunged 3.9 per cent to its lowest close since January 1987, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average lost a net 764.16 at 18,581.79 after opening at the
day's high of 19,325.47 and falling to the session's low of 18,562.63. The
Topix index of all first section stocks ended 58.65 weaker at 1,359.67,
dropping below 1,400 for the first time since November 1986. In London
trading, however, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was finally 0.44 up at 1,070.44.
Volume rose to 300m shares from 220m. Declines overwhelmed advances by 1,005
to 35, with 47 issues unchanged. The June Nikkei futures fell by a daily
limit of 600 points to 18,980, while a total of 537 stocks set new lows
since the beginning of last year.
Total capitalisation of all first section stocks, which peaked at Y590,908bn
in December 1989, fell below Y300,000bn for the first time since January
1987.
The sharp falls were triggered by heavy selling by speculators and
short-term investors, who had bought issues on margin. Speculative
favourites plunged in panic selling as investors were forced to reduce
holdings due to the declines in margin collateral values. Minebea, the day's
most active issue, shed Y50 to Y414 and Kurabo Industries Y66 to Y415.
Sentiment worsened as the market fell below the 10-year moving average of
the Nikkei, at the 19,000 level. 'This means that investors who have bought
shares during the past 10 years are losing on their investments,' said Mr
Masao Ariga, general manager of Daiwa Securities' financial institutions
sales division.
Most analysts refrained from forecasting the expected downside support for
the Nikkei average. Mr Jason James, strategist at James Capel, said share
prices should bottom out between now and June.
Mr Yasuo Ueki, general manager at Nikko Securities' equity division, said
the 18,000 level would be the next support. 'Institutional investors would
not buy equities at such levels but they wouldn't sell either,' he added.
The overall weakness of the market was represented by the fall in Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone, which lost Y21,000 to a new all-time low of
Y615,000. However, some analysts pointed out that the major cause of the
market's drop was the plunge in speculative issues. Blue chips remained
above their mid-March lows on small-lot bargain hunting. Hitachi was down
Y15 to Y770 and Sony Y50 to Y4,000.
In Osaka, the OSE average closed 969.29 lower at 20,091.62 in volume of 32m
shares.
Roundup
THE weakness of Tokyo drove other markets in the Pacific Basin down.
HONG KONG staged a partial recovery after falling more than 60 points in the
morning session on rumours that China was to announce changes in its party
leadership. The Hang Seng index finished 28.35 off at 4,909.96. Turnover
increased to HKDollars 2.14bn from HKDollars 1.94bn.
Cheung Kong appreciated 10 cents to HKDollars 21.20 but HSBC Holdings
declined HKDollars 1.00 to HKDollars 38.75. New World ended 10 cents firmer
at HKDollars 14.90 after reporting strong earnings growth.
SINGAPORE moved down to its lowest level since last October. The Straits
Times Industrial index slipped 20.20 to 1,394.06 in turnover of SDollars
90m, against SDollars 67.7m.
SEOUL closed below the 600 level on profit-taking. The composite index
receded 7.32 to 599.00 amid turnover of Won329.7bn, after Won388.7bn.
The government's announcement of an investment package for the manufacturing
sector failed to lift sentiment.
MANILA rose in dull trade. The composite index put on 6.87 to 1,099.81.
Philippine Long Distance Telephone, which advanced overnight in the US, was
up 10 pesos at 820 pesos.
BANGKOK ended on a mixed note as investors awaited news of the formation of
a new government. The SET index was a slight 0.30 up at 822.42 in turnover
of Bt4.99bn.
AUSTRALIA, which had gained ground in the morning session, fell after Tokyo
opened. The All Ordinaries index lost 8.6 on balance at 1,574.0 after
ADollars 288m turnover.

FT  02 APR 92 / World Stock Markets: Electricity flotation puts dampener on
1992 rally - The growing number of shares traded on the already buoyant
Malaysian market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors making room in their Malaysian equity portfolios for shares in
Tenaga Nasional, the electricity utility which is due to be privatised at
the end of May, have put the brakes on the stock market's new year rally.
The KLSE composite index climbed to a 1992 high of 619.06 on February 20,
driven by blue chips and some good corporate results, but has since drifted
back to close at 588.37 yesterday. It is still above its 1992 low of 546.63
reached on January 14.
But, according to the FT-Actuaries World Indices, Malaysia remains ahead of
the average for the region, with a 6.2 per cent rise in local currency
terms, compared with a gain of 3.4 per cent for the Pacific Basin, excluding
Japan.
The flotation of Tenaga has attracted a lot of interest from local and
foreign investors. Not only is it the country's largest privatisation to
date, but it is also the first time that foreigners have been allowed to
take part: of the 23 per cent the government has offered for sale, some 10
percentage points of that has been set aside for non-locals.
The privatisation is expected to raise Dollars 1.3bn and, when listed, the
utility will account for 11 per cent of total market capitalisation.
Of the shares on offer, the bulk - some 625.05m - are restricted to local
investors and will be offered at a fixed price of MDollars 4.50 (Dollars
1.73). However, results of the tender tranche of 60m shares, which closed on
March 27, show that there were 178 applications at a price of MDollars 6.55
to MDollars 7.10 and that the issue was oversubscribed 7.4 times.
The source of the applicants has not been made public, but analysts believe
that there was a strong Japanese presence.
Tenaga's May 30 listing highlights the growing number of shares listed on
the KLSE, so much so that the stock market authorities have tightened the
rules to limit the rise.
The number of listed companies has grown since last year - there are now 334
companies with a total market capitalisation of MDollars 161.4bn, compared
with 296 last July. Companies wanting a quotation have now to show a pre-tax
profit record of not less than MDollars 4m over a three to five-year period,
against MDollars 2m previously.
Last week saw the debut of Proton, the car manufacturing joint venture
between the Malaysian government and Mitsubishi, of Japan. Its shares have
settled at a premium of some MDollars 1.60 over the offer price of MDollars
5, although some analysts feel the stock may drift down on disappointing
vehicle sales figures.
As for the Malaysian stock market as a whole, analysts say that an easing in
interest rates would act as a catalyst for a fresh market rally. This
appears unlikely, however, following the central bank's annual statement on
Monday, in which it reaffirmed its intention to check inflation, which last
year reached a 10-year high of 4.4 per cent.
Hopes in the latter part of 1991 that the bank's tight monetary policy had
started to cool the economy down have now faded. According to the most
recent data, GDP in the 1991 final quarter accelerated to an annualised 9.7
per cent from 7.9 per cent in the first half of 1991, and compared with 8.8
per cent for the whole year.
Analysts say the bank's recent interbank rate tightening indicates a cut is
still some way off. But they believe a drop in inflation to about 4 per cent
could lead to cuts of between 1 and 1.5 per cent in the second half of the
year.

FT  02 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC urges Canada to face up to
overfishing problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
IN AN unusually robust rebuttal of Canadian charges that European Community
fishermen are overfishing near its waters, the European Commission yesterday
accused Ottawa of 'inventing external adversaries' to avoid facing up to the
structural problems of its own fisheries industry.
Mr Manuel Marin, EC commissioner for fisheries, said 'the conflict has much
more to do with Canadian internal problems than with fisheries'.
He was speaking after the commission unanimously approved guidelines on
fishing in international waters, spelling out the approach it has urged on
Canada to resolve the seven-year-old conflict, which intensified five weeks
ago.
Canada then claimed that Spanish and Portuguese vessels last year took
42,000 tonnes of cod - rather than the 21,500 tonnes it says they reported -
from the so-called 2J3KL area of the Grand Banks, off Newfoundland. This is
outside Canada's 200-mile limit and administered by the Northwest Atlantic
Fisheries Organisation.
The Canadians maintain that EC overfishing on the limits of their waters has
depleted stocks inside them. A Canadian scientific committee in February
revised its estimate of the cod spawning stock from 1.1m tonnes in December
to 780,000 tonnes.
The EC says even if Canada's charges were true, an extra 20,000 tonnes of
cod could hardly have caused this. It adds that Canada's own studies show
the drop in last year's Canadian catch - to 127,000 tonnes of cod compared
with 191,000 tonnes in 1990 - was largely due to the weather.
The commission says it will participate in conservation cuts if they derive
from joint scientific studies. Mr Marin said Canada, however, had rejected
his suggestion of a meeting of the Nafo scientific committee.
'I invite Canada to stop inventing external adversaries and address the real
cause of the problem,' the commissioner said.
If there was overfishing, it was by the Canadian fleet. He suggested they
emulate the EC's response to overfishing, of trying to reduce the EC fleet
in community waters by up to 40 per cent.
Mr Marin added that while Canada was trying to make a scapegoat of the EC,
it was simultaneously granting licences inside its waters to Japanese,
Korean, Polish and Cuban vessels.
The hirsute Spanish commissioner remarked that 'I demand at least the same
treatment as Fidel Castro, even if only because we both have beards; let's
have a little bit of seriousness please'.

FT  02 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil prices up in wake of UN
move over Libya

<TEXT>
OIL PRICES moved up yesterday following news on Tuesday night that the
United Nations would impose sanctions on Libya. While this does not include
an oil embargo, Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi, was quoted in an Italian
magazine yesterday saying he would stop the flow of oil to any country that
participated in sanctions.
Libya supplies about 1m barrels of oil a day to the west with the bulk
delivered to European countries, including Italy, Austria and Spain. But
analysts remain sceptical that Libya would cut off oil deliveries since they
provide one of the country's few sources of hard currency revenue.
The price for North Sea Brent crude oil for May delivery rose 30 cents
yesterday to Dollars 18.35 a barrel after moving up 15 cents late on
Tuesday. The price had remained stuck at the Dollars 17.90 level during the
previous two weeks as output cuts by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting
Countries managed to arrest the decline in price but were not enough to push
the market higher.
Mr Peter Gignoux, head of Smith Barney's energy desk in London, said the
market had been nervous for some time and the Libyan news was enough to give
prices a bit of a boost.
Last week traders were anxious over talks between Iraq and the UN about a
deal to sell some Iraqi oil which they feared would depress prices. But the
discussions broke up over the weekend with no conclusion.
Opec yesterday vigorously attacked proposals by western countries for a new
carbon tax, charging that oil is already over-taxed and additional increases
will slow development of the organisation's member states, writes Karen
Fossli in Oslo.
At an an oil price seminar here, an Opec representative warned that a carbon
tax could reduce demand for Opec oil by 27 per cent by the year 2010. He
referred to the European Commission's carbon tax proposal which would rise
from Dollars 1 a barrel in 1993 to a peak of Dollars 10 a barrel of oil
equivalent by the year 2000.
'It is indeed ironic that developing countries, which have contributed
minimally to the problem of the environment, should have to bear the burden
of a fresh tax on their main export commodity,' the representative said.

FT  02 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Warning of growing grain bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FORMER Soviet Union will have to import about 33m tonnes of grain for
1992-93 to ensure adequate supplies in key areas, according to a World Bank
report published today.
The Bank's Review of Food Policy Options and Agriculture Sector Reforms
warns, however, that if weather conditions deteriorate significantly, import
needs could rise to a 40m-45m tonne range. It puts the total 1992 food
import bill for the Commonwealth of Independent States at Dollars 11bn,
including the Dollars 5bn in credits and humanitarian aid already given for
this year.
Food imports worth between Dollars 15bn and Dollars 19bn a year from
mid-1985 made a major contribution to the balance of payments crisis of 1990
and the resulting inability to continue importing food through commercial
credits.
The study, designed to provide a comprehensive strategy to help the country
feed itself, extends from reform of agriculture to the distribution system.
In a graphic example of how poor distribution is a chief cause of the
country's dependence on imports, it says that 1991-92 grain imports of 37m
tonnes 'would not have been necessary if grain losses could have been
prevented through adequate storages'.
A third of food produced is lost through poor storage, waste, theft, and
inadequate transport systems.
Although private agriculture, where it is allowed on small plots, has
already displayed its superiority over the state sector, the report
recommends a cautious approach to land reform. It recommends restructuring
rather than abolishing collective and state farms, until they become
efficient enterprises or are replaced by family farms. It says, however,
that it will 'take many years before individual farms are established in
sufficient number to have a dominant role in agricultural production.'
With this in mind, it places a high value on co-operatives and the retention
(but as private enterprises) of so-called machine tractor stations - common
pools for equipment devised by the Bolsheviks.
At the retailing end, it urges the state, which, until recently, has been
bogged down in arguments about how to privatise, to take immediate steps to
lease shops to managers and their workforce. It calls for the provision of
small business loans and education programmes to teach retailers 'the
fundamentals of good retailing and good business practices.'
But it warns that this must be accompanied by rapid steps to take out of
state hands and demonopolise wholesale and processing sectors.
Among the effects of the liberalisation of prices in January, food prices
rose four to five times on average. Meat consumption is expected to fall and
there will be an increase in per capita consumption of bread, fruit,
vegetables, fruit and potatoes.
The report's recommendations on how the international community can help
include:- Assistance for the next year or so at least with financing
critical imports of food, spare parts and equipment.
Direct foreign investment in projects that can be operational within six
months - farm-level storage facilities, truck imports, constructing small to
medium wholesale markets, and equipping new retail outlets. Loans for
investment projects from multilateral and bilateral assistance programmes
and technical assistance programmes.

The PLATINUM price extended this week's gain on the London bullion market
with a Dollars 4.50 rise to Dollars 362.50 a troy ounce, up Dollars 12 since
the end of last week. It continued to be helped by Tuesday's announcement
that Russia's Almazyuvelirexport was maintaining its monopoly on the sale of
platinum group metals, deflating fears metal would leak into the market. A
more hopeful mood on US economic prospects also continued to have a bullish
influence. A trader commented that the market's reaction to these factors on
Tuesday had shown that 'the shorts were less confident than the longs'. At
the London Metal Exchange COPPER prices rallied on talk of Chinese buying,
with the three months delivery price pushing up to Dollars 2,250 a tonne on
short-covering after breaking through resistance at Dollars 2,230 a tonne.
At the close the cash price was quoted at Dollars 1,300.50 a tonne, up
Pounds 23.50 on the day. TIN prices made further gains and the cash premium
over forward metal widened as concern grew about the tightness of supplies
for delivery this month. The cash price rose Dollars 85 to Dollars 5,802.50
a tonne, while the three months price was up only Dollars 40 at Dollars
5,772.50 a tonne.

</HEADLINE>

Australian wool has sold at steady prices this week, but the previous easier
tendency has not been replaced by a definitely firmer movement. A high
proportion of auction offerings is still being withdrawn by farmers hoping
for better prices later on. The lack of demand from the old Soviet Union
areas, and patchy participation from Eastern Europe, continue to act as a
major depressing influence. Other major wool-using countries were active
buyers during February's price rise but are less keen after the recent
market setback. The AWC market indicator rose 2 cents to 572 on April 1.

INDIA'S TEA production in the first two months of 1992 has fallen by 5.83m
kg to 23.81m kg because of adverse weather.
The production shortfall is almost entirely in the tea estates in south
India, where the crop in January and February amounted to 20.65m kg,
compared with 25.99m kg in the corresponding period of last year. North
Indian tea production was 3.16m kg, down from 3.65m kg last year.
Plucking of tea leaves in Assam, Darjeeling and north Bengal picks up from
March, coinciding with the end of the winter.
According to industry officials, tea production has also suffered in Sri
Lanka, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Bangladesh and Indonesia. India, which harvested a
record tea crop of 741.7m kg in 1991, will be fixing the production target
for the current year once the March figures are available.

BANCO Rio del Plata, Argentina's largest private bank, has raised Dollars
100m in the Eurobond market. The bank said it planned to return to the
market with a further Dollars 100m bond issue before the end of the year.
The bank is paying a yield to investors of 9.6 per cent a year on the
three-year bonds. Argentine corporate and government borrowers have been
flocking to the Eurobond market in the past 18 months. Rates and maturities
on the international market are more attractive than the under-capitalised
local market.
Local legislation has also been reformed to encourage borrowers to enter the
bond market by offering companies tax exemptions. Equally, international
investors have taken increasing interest in Argentine paper, since Argentine
borrowers must still offer above-market yields.

FT  02 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Lucas likely to lose top
commercial paper rating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LUCAS Industries, the UK engineering group, is likely to lose its top credit
rating for commercial paper but has pre-empted the move by replacing
short-term borrowings with long-dated institutional funding.
Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, said it was reviewing the A-1
credit rating of Lucas Industries and its US subsidiaries following the
announcement of results for the six months to end-January.
The agency said the fall in trading profits to Pounds 32.7m, from Pounds
66.5m, was worse than expected. It noted net interest cover, before
exceptional items and distribution from pension fund surplus, had fallen to
under two times, from over five times in the last full financial year.
But, Lucas has already moved to repay commercial paper in the US. Last week,
it said it had secured Pounds 100m 12-year debt funding from a group of US
financial institutions, arranged by Wertheim Schroder.
Mr Peter Skeggs, assistant treasurer, said the arrangement had been used to
pay down uncommitted short-term funding in the US, mainly commercial paper.
A term loan arranged last year was also used for this purpose.
Net of the proceeds of the debt placement, Lucas will have only around
Dollars 30m of commercial paper outstanding in the US. In the UK, the
company has a cash surplus, said Mr Skeggs.
The debt placement with five US financial institutions, led by Lincoln
National of Indiana, gives the company access to fixed-rate dollar funding
at an interest rate of 8.57 per cent. The proceeds of the placement were
swapped into floating-rate dollars.
Harrisons &amp; Crossfield, the diversified UK trading group, has raised Dollars
120m debt funding maturing between 2002 and 2004 from a placement with US
institutions arranged by Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities.

FT  02 APR 92 / International Bonds: European Investment Bank issue causes
controversy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Investment Bank yesterday provoked controversy in the
international bond market, launching a new issue which was shunned by many
leading underwriting firms and seen by many as a threat to market
profitability.
The Ecu400m 12-year deal was lead-managed and largely underwritten by
Deutsche Bank Capital Markets, which identified substantial demand for
long-dated Ecu bonds.
However, most recognised Ecu bond firms declined to take part, arguing the
pricing and fee structure chosen by the issuer offered no return to
underwriters.
The bonds were issued at 100.66 per cent, with full fees of 2 1/8 per cent.
Hence underwriters owned the issue at 98.535, where the bonds yield 4 basis
points more than Ecu bonds issued by the French government, the sector's
benchmark.
Deutsche Bank supported the deal at this lower level. Intermediaries can
only make a return by selling the bonds at a higher price than quoted by the
lead manager.
A group of nine mainly continental European banks opted to participate in
the deal on this basis, hoping to sell the bonds to retail accounts.
The EIB has caused controversy with earlier bond issues which have been
handled as 'block trades', wholly underwritten by a single firm with only
small fees.
For a transaction of this maturity, underwriting fees are normally 30 to 35
basis points, or 0.3 to 0.35 per cent of the total amount raised. The EIB
has shaved underwriting fees below 10 basis points in some recent
transactions.
However, these earlier deals were sold at a fixed price which guaranteed
participants at least a slender return.
The lead manager fixes the price at which bonds must be sold to investors,
usually at a level which guarantees a minimum return to underwriters. The
system was introduced to protect the profitability of intermediaries.
Deutsche Bank said yesterday it had firm demand for the bonds at a yield
spread of around 4 basis points. Its underwriting risk was, therefore,
slight.
However, many firms complained that abandoning the fixed price re-offer
method of syndicating new issues would damage primary market transparency,
since each participant in the deal could sell the bonds at a different
price.

DAI-ICHI Kangyo Bank (DKB), the leading Japanese commercial bank, is to
donate Dollars 1m of its loan portfolio to the Republic of Ecuador in a
'debt-for-nature' swap to assist a conservation project in the Galapagos
Islands, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The debt donation will be channelled through the World Wildlife Fund (WWF)
Japan, and is the first to be organised within Japan.
Japanese banks have been reluctant to become active in such projects, due to
the negative image of lending to developing countries. A Japanese bank
official said they were afraid that shareholders would find such write-offs
hard to accept.
DKB will donate the right of claim for the loan to WWF Japan, and will write
off Dollars 1m next fiscal year to March 1993. The WWF will then release the
obligation of repayment to Ecuador.

THE LIFTING of restrictions on foreign ownership of Swedish shares may be
delayed until 1994 due to strong opposition from Swedish industry.
While officially welcoming foreign investment and capital, the Confederation
of Swedish Industry said more time was needed to implement the necessary
changes to companies' articles of association.
According to Swedish law, foreigners used to need government permission to
own more than 40 per cent of a Swedish company's share capital or over 20
per cent of its voting rights. Although the law was abolished with effect
from January 1 1992, more than 200,000 Swedish companies still contain these
restrictions in their articles of association.
According to a proposal from the Aktiebolagskommitten, a working group
appointed by the government to look at the question of share ownership,
companies must change their articles of association by January 1 1993 or
else the changes will be imposed on them by the government. The committee's
proposals are currently under discussion and suggested amendments must be
submitted to the government by May 8 1992.
Already, some companies have started to propose changes to their articles of
association at their annual meetings, according to the Confederation of
Swedish Industry.

MUKAND, the Bombay-based subsidiary of Bajaj - India's fourth largest group
 -is ready to set up a sponge iron plant in Maharashtra state in a joint
venture with Bharat Forge, part of the Pune-based Kalyani iron and steel
group.
The companies are engaged in talks aimed at reaching an agreement on
building a Rs6.5bn (Dollars 225.6m) plant producing 800,000 tonnes of hot
briquetted iron a year.
Mukand already operates the largest electric arc furnace in India, while
Bharat Forge has the largest forge in the country's private sector.
The groups are among the largest buyers of sponge iron and scrap in India.
Once the new plant comes on stream, at least 70 per cent of its capacity
will service the raw material needs of the companies.
The new facility is expected to be a setback for the growth plans of Essar
Gujarat, the Ruia group company which was hoping to supply Mukand with at
least half the capacity of its huge new sponge iron plant at Hazira.
The joint venture also puts a question mark over other plans by the
companies. Earlier, both Mukand and Bharat Forge announced ambitious plans
to build large integrated steel plants. These may well now be shelved.
Meanwhile, Indian government studies anticipate a six-fold rise in sponge
iron production over the next three years.

<TEXT>
JAPAN Leasing has become the country's largest leasing company after
absorbing the domestic business division of LTCB International Leasing, an
affiliate of Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan (LTCB).
The transfer agreement is a result of the already close links among the
three companies - Japan Leasing has a 30 per cent stake in LTCB
International Leasing, and LTCB holds 4.8 per cent of Japan Leasing and 4.9
per cent of LTCB International Leasing.
The bank said the transfer of outstanding leasing claims of about Y80bn
(Dollars 601.5m) to Japan Leasing 'is in the interests of all the
companies'. The transfer price was not disclosed.
It said LTCB International would be able to concentrate on international
business, while Japan Leasing would have extra influence in the domestic
market after having surpassed Orix.
Japan Leasing now has an estimated Y870bn in leasing assets, while Orix has
about Y850bn, although both companies have been under pressure following the
collapse of the Japanese 'financial bubble', which has increased their
exposure to bad debts and led to a slowdown in corporate leasing.
LTCB International said the transfer of assets would reduce its expenses and
make it more competitive in international leasing business. About a quarter
of the company's 107 workers have been sent to Japan Leasing, while
contracts with 700 clients have been absorbed.

<TEXT>
FISHER &amp; PAYKEL and Steel &amp; Tube Holdings, two members of the consortium
controlling New Zealand Steel, have agreed to sell their 25 per cent
shareholdings to BHP.
Their agreements, announced yesterday, are central to BHP gaining control of
NZ Steel, operator of the big Glenbrook mill near Auckland, a big exporter
of steel products to Australia. BHP has a 31 per cent shareholding.
Both agreements to sell, however, are subject to approval from the
Australian Trade Practice Commission (ATPC) and the New Zealand Commerce
Commission. In 1989, the ATPC strongly opposed BHP gaining control of NZ
Steel. It said then that high tariff barriers meant that NZ Steel was one of
BHP's few competitors.
Fisher &amp; Paykel and Steel &amp; Tube became partners in NZ Steel in 1989 as part
of the BHP-led consortium that bought the company from collapsed Equiticorp
for NZDollars 323m (USDollars 177.5m). Steel &amp; Tube is 49 per cent owned by
Tubemakers of Australia, which is in turn 49.8 per cent owned by BHP.
The fourth member is the ANZ Bank, with 19 per cent. Yesterday, ANZ said it
had not received an offer, but 'would be happy to receive' one.
This week, BHP said NZ Steel needed a further capital injection - partly to
reduce debt - which it was prepared to commit. However, the other partners
were unwilling to do so because of poor returns.
All partners in the consortium have invested in preference shares in NZ
Steel since 1989, and both Fisher &amp; Paykel and Steel &amp; Tube said they had
agreed to sell these to BHP.
Fisher &amp; Paykel said it would receive NZDollars 47.75m for its preference
shares, but no other figures have been disclosed on the proposed purchase
price.

<TEXT>
NORWAY'S minority Labour government has given details of its proposal to
establish the controversial state-owned Norges Postbank, which is expected
to begin operation before the end of this year.
Norges Postbank is viewed by some as a new threat to the country's banking
sector, which is struggling to survive after suffering several consecutive
years of large losses.
The decision to press ahead with the creation of Norges Postbank comes
during Norway's worst banking crisis since the 1930s and at a time when a
consolidation of the sector is underway.
It also comes three months after the state became the owner of Christiania
Bank and Fokus Bank, two of the country's top banks, as part of a rescue
operation to save them from insolvency.
The bank is to be established with equity capital of NKr2.175bn (Dollars
336m) and will have an equity ratio of 33 per cent in relation to
risk-weighted balance sheet items.
It will be formed from the Norges Postsparebank - a state-owned savings bank
operated by the postal system, with assets of NKr41.3bn.
Norges Postsparebank will also contribute NKr300m to the new bank. These
funds will constitute a loss-reserve fund and infrastructure for Norges
Postbank.
Last year, Norges Postsparebank lifted operating profit to a record NKr517m,
from NKr450.1m a year earlier. Unlike commercial and savings banks, Norges
Postsparebank has suffered only minor credit losses in recent years. In
1991, its credit losses were just NKr36.3m, up from NKr27.2m in 1990.
Norges Postbank will operate under the rules which govern both commercial
and savings banks, forcing it to compete under the same conditions. It will
have to charge fees on a par with the commercial and savings banks in order
for the state to phase out subsidies.

REYNOLDS METALS, the second-largest US aluminium group, has signed memoranda
of understanding with two Japanese corporations - Mitsubishi Aluminium and
three members of the Sumitomo 'family' - to develop new applications and
production techniques for the use of aluminium within the automotive
industry.
The US group claims it is one of the world's largest suppliers of aluminium
products to the automotive industry with sales of 471m lb, worth Dollars
556m last year.
Reynolds announced recently that it would accelerate research and
development work in this sector, which is seen to hold the greatest growth
prospects for the aluminium industry.
Reynolds' main competitor, Alcoa, suggested recently that by 2005 transport
applications would generate worldwide demand for another 2bn lb of
aluminium.

FT  02 APR 92 / International Company News: Gota Group shareholder pledges
support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BIGGEST shareholder in Gota Group, Sweden's fourth largest bank, was
forced to pledge its support yesterday for the loss-making bank following
rumours that Gota was close to collapse.
Trygg-Hansa SPP, the Swedish insurance group which owns 50 per cent of Gota
Group, said it would underwrite the bulk of a SKr2.04bn (Dollars 340m) share
issue which is planned this spring.
The guarantee means that Gota Group will probably become a consolidated
subsidiary of Trygg-Hansa SPP since other shareholders are unlikely to take
up the share offer.
Trygg-Hansa SPP will also propose installing Mr Bjorn Sprangare, Trygg-Hansa
SPP's chief executive officer, as chairman of the Gota Group.
Senior management of the bank and its main shareholder met for several hours
yesterday to hammer out a way of rebuilding confidence in the loss-making
Gota Group.
International banks, worried by speculation that Gota was facing a liquidity
crisis and was close to collapse, pressed Gota for information about its
financial state yesterday.
Gota Group plans to raise SKr2.04bn in preference shares - consisting of
151m shares priced at SKr13.5 each.
Trygg-Hansa SPP will underwrite SKr1.5bn of the issue. The new capital will
be used to pay off a SKr1.5bn perpetual subordinated loan which Trygg-Hansa
SPP made to Gota earlier this year.
Gota received its SKr1.5bn capital injection from Trygg-Hansa SPP after the
bank warned that it faced heavy credit losses for 1991.
Operating loss plunged to SKr2.13bn, partly due to the bank's exposure to
the real estate sector and the collapse of finance firm Gamlestaden.
Gota pointed out that the capital injection was intended as a
confidence-building measure. Even before the capital injection, Gota said
its capital adequacy ratio was well over the minimum 8 per cent requirement
set by the Basle accord. The risk-weighted capital adequacy ratio rose from
9.22 per cent to 11.22 per cent after the capital injection.

<TEXT>
SNIA-BPD, the textiles, chemicals and munitions subsidiary of Italy's Fiat
group, raised consolidated group profits by 12.5 per cent to L48.7bn
(Dollars 39.30m) last year, despite a 6.7 per cent fall in sales to
L2,317.8bn.
The company announced a L192bn rights issue, on the basis of one new
ordinary share for every three ordinary or savings shares held.
The proceeds will be used to maintain the group's heavy investment strategy.
Earlier this year, a SNIA-BPD subsidiary spent Dollars 230m to buy some of
the cardiovascular activities of the US Pfizer group.
SNIA-BPD has been restructuring recently, striking joint ventures with other
producers in troubled area such as fibres, while pushing ahead, via
acquisitions, in new sectors like bio-engineering
The company blamed last year's fall in sales on slower world economic
growth, which had affected its fibres, base chemicals and defence and space
activities.
By contrast, sales on the bio-engineering side rose by 14 per cent while
materials climbed by 13.3 per cent. The same trend in turnover had continued
so far this year, the company said.
SNIA-BPD attributed the boost in group earnings to unspecified extraordinary
elements. By contrast, net profits for the parent company almost halved to
L22.2bn from L41.8bn in 1990 as a result of extraordinary burdens.
Despite the drop, the company is dipping into reserves to pay an unchanged
dividend of L65 for ordinary shares, L85 for convertible savings shares, and
L95 for non-convertible savings stock.

<TEXT>
SKANDIA, the Swedish insurance group, plunged to an operating loss of
SKr580m (Dollars 97m) for 1991, compared with an operating profit of SKr554m
in the previous year.
The group, which has now reported a sharp deterioration in results for two
consecutive years, was hit by losses in its international non-life
operations and the fall in the real estate market.
However, the board proposed holding the dividend at SKr4 per share.
Total premium income climbed 17 per cent to SKr29.03bn from SKr 24.85bn.
Skandia said developments were favourable in the Nordic region, where
operating profit increased from SKr63m to SKr354m last year. Premium income
in the Nordic area rose 9 per cent to SKr9.73bn.
However, the group suffered a serious decline in its international non-life
insurance operations, including reinsurance as well as direct business.
The group said a 'considerable share' of the losses stemmed from credit
insurance - direct insurance and reinsurance - which is written by its
subsidiaries in Norway and the UK. It said it had decided to discontinue its
credit insurance activities.
The loss on international reinsurance business ballooned from SKr163m to
SKr537m last year, on premium income of SKr10.02bn.
In addition, losses at its international direct non-life insurance business
grew from SKr142m in 1990 to SKr558m last year, on premium income of
SKr4.4bn.
Skandia said premium income for its international life assurance and
financial services division nearly doubled to SKr5.48bn, although this
business area showed a loss of SKr104m due to charges arising from new
ventures in Germany and Japan.
It said talks with Uni Storebrand, the Norwegian insurer, and Hafnia, the
Danish insurance company, about a possible link-up were continuing.

returns to profit
</HEADLINE>

   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWISSAIR took analysts by surprise yesterday, reporting a return to profit
in 1991 after a consolidated SFr22m (Dollars 14.70m) loss in 1990, and
proposing a partial restoration of the dividend to SFr20 per share.
Bearer shares of the Swiss international airline group rose SFr22 to SFr760
on the Zurich Stock Exchange following the news.
Mr Otto Loepfe, president, said the SFr83m consolidated net profit was 'very
gratifying', although the group was 'not satisfied with the result we
recorded in 1991 as an airline'.
The airline itself remained in loss, and the group profit was made possible
only by an exceptionally large gain, SFr140m, from sales of old aircraft. In
the previous year, only SFr85m had been raised from this source.
Mr Loepfe said traffic volume declined 2.6 per cent as movements of
passengers, cargo and mail all slumped during and after the Gulf war. The
overall load factor was 63 per cent, compared with 65.8 per cent in 1990.
However, the group's efforts to enhance revenues and cut costs bore some
fruit. Airline revenues rose 5.2 per cent to SFr5.3bn, while expenses rose
only 4 per cent to SFr4.9bn. Mr Loepfe said the break-even point for the
airline had been lowered by 4.3 percentage points.
Revenues from flight operations were up 4.4 per cent to SFr3.8bn, while
services sold to other airlines gained 5.2 per cent to SFr914.8m.
Mr Loepfe said directors decided to recommend that a dividend be paid partly
because final profits showed an improvement in real terms. There was no
payout in 1990.
He said demand was likely to be slow this year, with a recovery foreseen in
the second half. 'We must assume that the strong growth witnessed in the
1970s and 1980s is a thing of the past,' he said.
However, Swissair had a strong financial base and was attempting to
capitalise on its modern fleet, a new frequent flier programme, and on
alliances with other airlines to improve its revenues and cut costs.
Mr Loepfe reported that progress in implementing the group's Global
Excellence alliance with Singapore Airlines and Delta Air Lines of the US
had been delayed because of Delta's preoccupation with acquiring the
European routes of Pan American. However, reservations systems would be
linked from May 1, and 550 ticket offices worldwide were now issuing tickets
for the three airlines.

SANPAOLO Holding, the holding company for the recently-floated Italian bank,
has confirmed it is to take a further 14 per cent stake in Milano
Assicurazioni, one of the main operating subsidiaries of the Fondiaria
insurance concern, writes Haig Simonian.
In February, Milano Assicurzioni announced a rights issue of up to L463bn
(Dollars 373.68m) amid strong speculation that Sanpaolo would use the deal
to raise its 6 per cent holding.
The latest purchase of shares, which will cost Sanpaolo L195bn, is coming
directly from Fondiaria.
Sanpaolo is spending a further L22.5bn to buy 1.5 per cent of La Fondiaria
Assicurazioni, another of the Fondiaria group's main subsidiaries.
The deals will reinforce the growing links between the bank and Fondiaria.
Under an agreement earlier this year, Milano Assicurazioni is to develop
life and non-life insurance products to be sold by Sanpaolo branches.

FT  02 APR 92 / International Company News: Olivetti head given top Xerox
post
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK, ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR VITTORIO CASSONI, the managing director of Olivetti, the Italian computer
and office automation group, has been named to a senior post at Xerox, the
US document processing company.
The 49-year-old Mr Cassoni - who in 1988 went back to Italy to run Olivetti
after a stint as president of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph's data systems
division - will become one of three executive vice-presidents at Xerox,
reporting directly to Mr Paul Allaire, Xerox chairman and chief executive.
At Xerox, based in Stamford, Connecticut, Mr Cassoni will become one of the
members of the newly-formed Xerox corporate office, responsible for the
operations of the company.
Xerox reorganised its top management structure in February, creating three
operational executive vice-presidents, plus heads of research and technology
and strategy in place of a single president under Mr Allaire.
Mr Cassoni's responsibilities will include running four of Xerox's nine
document processing equipment divisions. Document processing last year
accounted for Dollars 13.8bn of the company's total revenues of Dollars
17.8bn. 'He will be one of three people who are all ranked as
second-in-command to the chairman,' Xerox said.
Although Olivetti denied it at the time, Mr Cassoni was perceived by
industry watchers to have been effectively demoted last November, when Mr
Carlo De Benedetti, whose CIR holding company controls Olivetti, returned to
the company to take full-time management responsibility.
Great pains were taken by Olivetti to describe Mr Cassoni's new role as an
'ambassador' who would forge international alliances for the company.
However, it was clear to insiders that Mr Cassoni would eventually seek new
employment.
Mr De Benedetti took Mr Cassoni back to Italy in the spring of 1988, just as
Olivetti's 'global alliance' with AT&amp;T was beginning to sour. The energetic
Mr Cassoni, who is fluent in English and French as well as Italian, quickly
launched a huge restructuring at Olivetti, involving the creation of three
autonomous divisions.
However, Olivetti's fortunes have flagged in recent years and Mr Cassoni,
while respected in the computer industry, increasingly became a victim of
the sector's crisis. He faced declining growth, rapid innovation and
plunging product prices.
Olivetti, which suffered a L73.7bn (Dollars 59.48m) loss in the first six
months of last year - compared with a L60.9bn profit in the same period of
1990 - is expected to report a heavy full-year 1991 loss later this month.

issue
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SKF, the world's leading roller bearing manufacturer, is planning a
convertible debenture issue aimed at international investors. The deal could
raise as much as SKr935m (Dollars 156.3m) at SKF's current share price,
The issue will correspond to up to 8.5m shares, and shareholders can either
convert the issue into equity - in this case into unrestricted series B
shares - or be repaid.
SKF said the convertible debenture was intended to refinance some of its
debt. The company increased its debt by about SKr2bn when it acquired part
of Ovako, a specialty steel producer with plants in Sweden and Finland.
The issue will also be used to pay off some of SKF's short-term debt.
The issue, which requires approval from this month's annual meeting, will be
directed at the international capital markets, and will be in a foreign
currency.
SKF reports interest among international investors in non-share investments.
The group said it would waive existing shareholders' preferential
subscription rights in favour of international investors. This would allow
it 'to raise a more favourable long-term financing than otherwise'.
Foreign investors already own between 16 and 18 per cent of the group's
share capital. SKF is listed in London, Zurich, Geneva, Basle, Paris and on
Nasdaq in the US.

maintained dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HARRISONS &amp; Crosfield yesterday recommended an unchanged final dividend of
5.4p although the 9p total for 1991 was not covered by earnings of 7p per
share. Earnings in 1990 totalled 11.6p per share.
Mr John Maltby, chairman, said the board had given considerable thought to
the dividend. He said many of the group's shareholders were high income
funds; shareholders had supported the rights issue in May 1990; the group's
cashflow could sustain the payment and prospects for a recovery in profits
were good enough to justify it.
The shares rose 2p to 126p in response, against the market trend.
However, Mr Maltby said that 1991 was 'not the happiest of years', and so
far in 1992 there were 'only faint signs of recovery'.
Pre-tax profits tumbled 33 per cent to Pounds 71.2m (Pounds 106.1m). Group
sales were 2.2 per cent up at Pounds 1.83bn, but operating profits fell 27
per cent to Pounds 92.4m (Pounds 126m) after a loss on disposals of Pounds
1.4m (profit Pounds 6.1m). Redundancy costs of about Pounds 2.5m were
charged against profits.
Operating profits from the chemical and industrial division were 32 per cent
lower at Pounds 30.1m (Pounds 44.3m). Mr George Paul, chief executive, said
the profits were hit by falling demand from the building products industry
and by increased competition from Russia.
In the timber and building supplies division, profits fell 33 per cent to
Pounds 22.8m (Pounds 34.2m), though in the second half the fall was
shallower than in the first.
The main problem was a sharp fall in UK sales volumes, although a higher
gross margin following the acquisition of Crossley in May 1990 and cost
savings alleviated the profit decline.
The food and agriculture division, which is being boosted by the acquisition
of BOCM-Silcock, suffered a Pounds 1m profit fall to Pounds 30.4m after an
increase in profits in the first half. Here the sharp fall in pig prices hit
pig feed profits but most other areas were ahead. Pig prices have recovered
again. The group makes own-label foods for supermarkets but has just
launched a branded dog food called Bakers Complete.
The plantations business increased profits from Pounds 10m to Pounds 10.5m
helped by higher yields, especially for cocoa where trees planted in recent
years are reaching full production.
The interest charge was higher at Pounds 21.2m (Pounds 19.9m). After a 31.5
per cent tax rate (30 per cent), profits attributable to shareholders were
Pounds 48.2m (Pounds 75m) while the dividend cost Pounds 61.7m (Pounds
61.6m).
Net borrowings were Pounds 185.3m (Pounds 176m) at the year-end and
shareholders' funds were Pounds 488m (Pounds 514m). Interest cover was 4.4
times (6.3 times). The cashflow statement showed a Pounds 6m deficit. H&amp;C
cut working capital by Pounds 45m, mainly in the timber division, and
disposals raised Pounds 37m, covering the Pounds 31m spent on acquisitions.

<TEXT>
EMAP, the publishing and exhibitions group, has acquired Trenton, an
exhibition company and another small slice of the empire of the late Mr
Robert Max-well.
Having recently paid Pounds 21.5m for most of the business magazines
published by Maxwell Business Communications, Emap spent a further Pounds 4m
for Trenton. It organises four main national trade fairs in heating and
ventilation, packaging, fluids, and commercial fishing. In most cases the
exhibitions link up with business magazines.
Last week Reed Exhibition Companies bought Evan Steadman Communications,
another Maxwell subsidiary, which organises exhibitions in the industrial,
scientific, electronic and antiques sectors.
The sale of the two exhibition companies means that virtually all of Maxwell
Business Communications has now been successfully sold by Price Waterhouse,
the administrator to Maxwell Communication Corporation.
Mr Alan Barrett, the Price Waterhouse partner responsible for disposing of
MBC, said yesterday that a gross total of Pounds 40m had been raised by the
disposals, with all businesses continuing to operate and only a handful of
redundancies.
'I am very pleased at the outcome,' Mr Barrett said.
Emap also announced that it had increased its stake in Kiss FM, the London
commercial radio station, from 59 per cent to 94 per cent. Emap now has 75
per cent of the voting rights in the station which claims a regular audience
of 1.2m in London, particularly in the 15-24 age group.

AAH HOLDINGS, the healthcare and distribution group, announced two
acquisitions yesterday.
It is paying up to Pounds 13m for ECE (Distribution Services) a specialist
contract distribution company, and Pounds 1.8m for five pharmacies.
ECE has six depots handling processed foods and the deal will treble the
size of AAH's transport division.
Mr Bill Pybus, chairman, said the acquisition switched the division's
emphasis to contract distribution for manufacturers and retailers. ECE's
pre-tax profits in 1991 were Pounds 2.6m and are forecast at not less than
Pounds 2.3m for the year to March 31 1993. Net assets are Pounds 3.2m.
Four of the pharmacies being acquired are on the Isle of Wight and one at
Weymouth on the south coast. Net assets involved are not less than Pounds
300,000. They will take AAH's chain to 151 pharmacies.
For the ECE deal AAH is paying Pounds 10.5m now with the possibility of
another Pounds 2.5m in three years time depending on profits. For the two
deals, AAH is issuing 2.54m shares of which 1.45m have been placed with
institutions. AAH is also paying Pounds 690,000 in cash.

SHERWOOD COMPUTER Services, the USM-quoted company specialising in insurance
software, yesterday reported a 23 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, from
Pounds 1.99m to Pounds 2.45m, last year.
Sales, however, dipped 10 per cent to Pounds 22.3m (Pounds 24.8m), a
consequence of the transfer of the disaster recovery business to a joint
venture with ICL, the computer manufacturer, during the year.
The share price, which has improved 40 per cent since the beginning of this
year, yesterday rose 1p to 195p.
The balance sheet was strengthened with net assets increasing from Pounds
4.1m to Pounds 5.1m with net cash of Pounds 2.3m.
Mr Richard Guy, chief executive, said the company was well placed to make
acquisitions to improve its position in its key financial services and
government markets. There was, he said, a choice of companies to buy and an
acquisition was likely in the near future.
The company's fortunes have improved markedly since it moved to products
based on open, or industry standard, systems but it is still spending large
amounts on research and development - Pounds 2.6m in both 1990 and 1991.
Mr Guy said investment would not be as high this year but would remain
significant. This year's accounts included an exceptional provision of
Pounds 191,000 for potential losses on one of the first installations of
Sceptre, the company's Lloyds software.
Fully diluted earnings per share increased by 26 per cent from 15.5p to
19.6p.
A proposed final dividend of 4.5p gives a total of 6p (5.25p) for the year.

FT  02 APR 92 / UK Company News: Extraordinary restructuring loophole
exploited by ICI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TREATMENT of substantial reorganisation costs in the 1991 accounts of
Imperial Chemical Industries, the pharmaceuticals group, and Unilever, the
Anglo-Dutch consortium, has exposed loopholes in the existing system of
accounting regulation.
ICI has not restated Pounds 300m of net extraordinary costs - related to a
series of business closures and restructurings announced in 1990 - in spite
of a pronouncement from the Accounting Standards Board's urgent issues task
force late last year that such costs should generally be treated above the
line as exceptional items.
Meanwhile, Unilever said yesterday that its 1991 annual report - due to be
published in mid-April - would also not restate a Pounds 195m extraordinary
charge described in the 1990 accounts as reorganisation expenses 'in the
light of legislation leading to the single European market'.
ICI did restate a net Pounds 39m share in Tioxide Group for fundamental
restructuring classified as extraordinary in the 1990 accounts and now
presented as exceptional. This has reduced 1990 pre-tax profits to Pounds
936m.
If the other reorganisation costs had been included, pre-tax profits would
have been Pounds 636m, instead of the originally stated Pounds 977m. The
extraordinary item, unchanged at Pounds 300m, was for divestments, closures
and other restructuring measures.
It is believed that publication of the ICI and Unilever extraordinary items
in the 1990 accounts were two of the incidents that spurred the urgent
issues task force to produce its abstract, which came into force in
mid-November.
The abstract states that restructuring costs should be treated as
exceptionals. Any remaining extraordinaries will require full description in
the company's financial statements of both the event itself and the nature
of the related restructuring costs. There is no such additional explanation
in the ICI accounts.
However Mr Michael Hughes, the partner at KPMG Peat Marwick responsible for
the ICI audit and a member of the 16-strong urgent issues task force, says
ICI's treatment falls outside the task force guidelines and was discussed
with the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales before the
1990 accounts came out.
Mr Hughes says that SSAP 6, the relevant accounting standard, permits the
inclusion of the closure of business segments as extraordinary items. Given
that the Pounds 300m charge applies to a previous year, he argues that there
is no need for ICI to include any justification of why it is extraordinary.
Other accountants suggest that the company should, at the very least, have
provided more explanation. But Mr Hughes says: 'There may be important
commercial considerations which restrict disclosure of certain kinds of
information.'
Guidance from the task force is not always clear, partly because its
pronouncements are not allowed to contradict the wording of existing
accounting standards. One accountant described the abstract on restructuring
costs as 'trying to put a plaster on a leg that should be amputated'.
However, the uncertainty over extraordinary items is likely to be eradicated
this summer with the launch of a new financial reporting standard. In its
draft form as Fred 1, it orders the virtual elimination of extraordinaries.
As Mr David Tweedie, chairman of the ASB, says: 'SSAP 6 is fundamentally
flawed. That's why we launched Fred 1.'

FT  02 APR 92 / UK Company News: Losses at Acsis rise to Pounds 4.5m as
sales slump
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACSIS GROUP, the nursing recruitment and sales promotion company, yesterday
reported a further fall into the red but said the worst of its problems were
now behind it.
For 1991 the loss rose to Pounds 4.53m at the pre-tax level on sales nearly
halved at Pounds 29m. Profits for the previous year amounted to Pounds
4.94m.
Losses per share of 1.8p compared with earnings of 2.8p. The dividend is
being omitted - the 1990 payment was cut to 0.4p.
The group's banks, which last year agreed to reschedule Pounds 8m of its
debt with the first repayment after three years, have to approve any
dividend payment.
The group has to hold an extraordinary meeting to discuss the fact that net
assets have fallen below half its called-up share capital. The board plans
to take no action.
Mr Robert Ledger, finance director, said the group had traded profitably in
the first quarter of this year.
'We are trying to rebuild the value of the company for the benefit of the
shareholders and the banks,' he said. 'In three years time if we can treble
the number of nurses recruited this business becomes extremely cash
generative.'
Mr Ephraim Barsam, the company's largest shareholder and a large creditor,
is to become chairman at the annual meeting, replacing Mr Neil Balfour, who
became acting non-executive chairman following the departure of South
African Mr Darryl Phillips.
Mr Ledger said that following the sale of certain businesses, more than half
Acsis's sales this year would come from the nursing business which recruits
English speaking nurses for the US market.
Heavy expenditure on recruiting and training nurses last year should begin
to produce additional revenues this year, Mr Ledger said.

Vaux Group, the brewer and hotels and nursing homes operator, has bought 113
pubs from Inntrepreneur Estates and Whitbread.
Inntrepreneur is a joint venture between Grand Metropolitan and Foster's
Brewing.
The deal, worth about Pounds 13.5m, is the biggest pub purchase by Vaux
since the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report into the brewing industry
in 1989.
Some 85 pubs were bought from Inntrepreneur and 28 from Whitbread, bringing
the number of pubs Vaux owns to nearly 900. The group intends to increase
its estate to 1,000 properties.

Norcros, the building materials and print and packaging group, has disposed

Servomex, a maker of gas analysers and instrumentation systems, saw profits
advance 6 per cent, from Pounds 1.94m to Pounds 2.06m, in 1991.
Turnover was 10 per cent higher at Pounds 18.3m, against Pounds 16.7m.
Operating margins narrowed slightly to 13 per cent mainly because of the
weakening of the dollar against sterling.
Earnings per share were 13.8p (12.7p) from which a final dividend of 3.9p is
proposed for a total of 5.7p (5.4p).

Lec Refrigeration returned profits of Pounds 1.21m pre-tax for 1991, a 33
per cent improvement on last time's Pounds 907,000.
Turnover fell from Pounds 51.5m to Pounds 48.4m.
Directors of the Sussex-based refrigerator manufacturer said steeply falling
demand in the home market generally, particularly in single door
refrigerators, meant they had to reduce output drastically in proportion and
take firm action to contain costs.
They added that the fall in home market demand was offset to some degree by
an 18 per cent increase in exports.
Earnings rose to 13.28p (9.89p) and a proposed final dividend of 10.5p makes
a same-again 14.5 total.

Delaney Group, a furniture maker and shopfitter, progressively reduced its
loss during 1991 to finish with a deficit of Pounds 474,000.
In 1990 the loss was Pounds 825,000. At the end of the first half of 1991 it
had been cut to Pounds 646,000 and at the three-quarter stage stood at
Pounds 507,000.
Mr Nathu Ram Puri, chairman, said it would be imprudent to speak of revival
but he believed the second half represented a 'significant milestone on the
road back to full recovery'. In 1987 and 1988 group pre-tax profit topped
Pounds 2.8m.
Turnover in 1991 fell by nearly 20 per cent to Pounds 21.8m.
Losses per share were 0.6p (2.4p).

FT  02 APR 92 / UK Company News: Shake-up again at Conroy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR RICHARD Conroy has regained his chairmanship of Dublin-based Conroy
Petroleum and Natural Resources, the company he founded. This has occurred
less than two months after a boardroom coup led by the two main
shareholders, Outokumpu and Dundee Bancorp, ousted him and the rest of the
board at an extraordinary meeting in February.
In what has developed into a saga of Irish corporate trench warfare over the
control of a large 6m ton zinc/lead ore deposit in Ireland, Mr Conroy
rallied his troops last month for the counter-attack, with the buy-out of
Dundee's 16.3 per cent stake by Columbia Investments, a company controlled
by Mr Tony O'Reilly, one of Ireland's leading businessmen.
The battle for control of Conroy was precipitated at the end of last year by
Conroy's share-swap takeover of Atlantic Resources, a company owned by Mr
O'Reilly, and which was viewed by Outokumpu as a move designed to dilute its
stake in Conroy. Mr Conroy maintained that Outokumpu was seeking total
control over the future marketing of ore from the Galmoy zinc deposit,
Conroy's principal asset still awaiting planning permission.
Yesterday Outokumpu announced the resignation of its four Conroy board
members, saying it had been 'unable to agree a basis for the reconstitution
of the full Conroy board and management of the company' following the
appointment of four new directors by Colombia last month.
Outokumpu holds 22.5 per cent of Conroy while Mr Conroy and 'those who are
deemed to be concert parties with him' control 28.9 per cent following
Colombia's purchase of the Dundee stake.

FT  02 APR 92 / UK Company News: Hogg disappoints with decline to Pounds
16.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEPRESSED investment income and losses in its Australian business held back
profits at Hogg Group, the insurance broker, despite strong growth in new
business.
The group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 16.8m, down from Pounds 17.1m
in 1991. Earnings per share were down to 15p compared with 16.4p last year.
The final dividend is maintained at 5p making a total for the year of 8.15p,
up just 1.9 per cent.
The group's dividend cover is 1.85 and it has cash available for potential
acquisitions. The City, however, was unimpressed marking the shares down 19p
to close at 167p.
The fall in investment income to Pounds 7.45m (Pounds 9.56m) masked an 11.4
per cent rise in profits from insurance broking to Pounds 13.2m (Pounds
11.9m) on the back of a 10.7 per cent rise in turnover to Pounds 111m
(Pounds 100.2m).
The UK operations performed strongly with revenues rising to Pounds 60.1m
(Pounds 51.9m), with rates rising by an average of 5 per cent.
Profits from the group's Lloyd's members' agents fell to Pounds 600,000
(Pounds 1.04m) and from divested managing agents to Pounds 2.27m (Pounds
2.87m). Other activities contributed Pounds 210,000 and exceptional items
Pounds 490,000 (Pounds 750,000).
COMMENT
Of all the listed UK brokers, Hogg is most dependent on low margin retail
business - which accounts for 75 per cent of its income. Over a third of its
business is generated in the US where insurance rates remain depressed and
about 60 per cent of its investment funds are in dollars. Add in the
maintained final dividend, the fact that about 15 per cent of its business
is with the Lloyd's market and that its Lloyd's agency business faces a
couple of troubled years ahead and it is easy to understand the market's
negative reaction to yesterday's dip in profits. Even so there were some
positive aspects. Outside Australia new business growth has been strong,
expenses were reduced by two percentage points last year and, in the longer
term, the group has more than doubled its broking profits in the last five
years. For 1992 profits of Pounds 18m can be expected lifting earnings per
share to about 16p, which on yesterday's closing price of 167p leaves the
group on a prospective p/e of under 11. That seems cheap for a sector
trading on a historic multiple of over 15.

FT  02 APR 92 / UK Company News: MGN buy-out team hold talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MANAGEMENT buy-out team at Mirror Group Newspapers met yesterday for the
second time in a week, at the offices of Electra, the venture capital group,
to plan a Pounds 250m refinancing as part of its bid to take over the group.
MGN, which includes the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror, and Scottish Daily
Record, used to be one of the most soundly-financed parts of the empire of
the late Mr Robert Maxwell.
However, after his death in November it emerged that he had siphoned Pounds
97m out of MGN's bank accounts, and several hundred million pounds from its
pension fund, leaving some of its staff and pensioners facing poverty.
Sir Peter Parker, chairman of the buy-out group, which also includes Mr
Richard Stott, editor of the Daily Mirror, told a meeting of the team and
Mirror editorial heads of department on March 25 that the team was proposing
a Pounds 250m refinancing 'right now'. The team has written to the Mirror's
board to tell them this.
However, one participant in yesterday's meeting emphasised that the Pounds
250m figure should be regarded as provisional. The administrators, Arthur
Andersen, who now control MGN, have not yet released financial figures for
1991 or projections of future trading.
The administrators have appointed Rothschilds, the merchant bank, to handle
the sale.
The two obstacles delaying a sale are understood to be the poor advertising
climate, which could allow a higher price to be achieved by waiting, and the
uncertainty about the group's legal responsibility to make good the deficit
in its pension funds.
Sir Peter made clear to the meeting that 'I would not touch this buy-out
unless we could honour the pension commitment'.
Electra, which has received several expressions of interest from potential
investors, has identified a potential chief executive currently working in
the media industry. However, it declined to give the person's name to the
meeting.

<TEXT>
PETROCON and its advisers, Robert Fleming, are to appeal to the full
Takeover Panel to try to reverse what is increasingly looking like a
thwarted bid for fellow engineering company, James Wilkes.
The Panel's executive earlier yesterday rejected Fleming's contention that
NM Rothschild, Wilkes advisers, had given a few crucial shareholders
material additional information that was not made available to the market as
a whole.
The panel executive ruled that the offer, which closed on Monday, should not
be extended and that it would have lapsed but for Petrocon's appeal to the
full Panel which will be heard on Friday.
Petrocon is understood to be angry that a few shareholders, including Baring
Brothers and Edinburgh Fund Managers, were given assurances that two Wilkes
directors, who helped support Mr Stephen Hinchliffe, the discredited former
chairman, would play reduced roles in Wilkes in the future.
In an all-paper bid battle that has revolved around the question of which
management team is best equipped to turn Wilkes around, Petrocon is thought
to believe such assurances were material to the bid.
As one observer said 'to lose one director during a bid is unfortunate; to
lose two would have been viewed as careless.'
The departure of Mr Hinchliffe, who resigned as chairman after the Pounds
35m bid was launched, appears to have assuaged a number of institutional
shareholders' concerns about Wilkes's future.
Last Friday, Edinburgh Fund Managers decided not to back Petrocon with its 8
per cent stake in Wilkes even though it had given written assurances that it
earlier been among institutions that wrote to say they would support the
bid.

FT  02 APR 92 / UK Company News: Refinancing plans expected at Young Group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Young Group, the USM-quoted opencast and drift coal-mining concern, is
expected to announce today a refinancing package, following the suspension
yesterday of its shares for the second time in seven weeks.
The company requested yesterday's suspension - early last month it warned of
substantially lower-than-expected profits for the year to November 30 1991 -
announcing that it needed more working capital and confirming that it was in
negotiation with its bankers and large shareholders to arrange additional
finance.
As expected the Durham-based company, which operates in the UK and
Venezuela, failed to publish its annual results by the end of March.
The warning, which coincided with the reinstatement of dealings in its
shares after a fortnight's suspension from mid-February, triggered a dive
from 96p at resumption. When dealing was again suspended yesterday, the
price was 35p.
Confirmation last week of a Pounds 16m contract from British Coal Opencast,
Young's biggest-ever scheme, did not deliver the hoped-for boost to the
share price.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Directors of Beckenham Group, the USM-quoted maker of ductwork systems and
specialist distribution, yesterday said they knew of no reason for the
recent substantial fall in the share price.
The directors said the results for the year to October 1991 would be
announced on April 14. Although they showed substantial losses and
write-downs, directors said that management figures for the first four
months of the current financial year were significantly better than for the
second half of 1991.
Banking facilities had recently been renewed and the order book was ahead of
last year.
The shares yesterday rose 2p to 9p.

FT  02 APR 92 / UK Company News: Bowthorpe bids for Penny &amp; Giles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOWTHORPE HOLDINGS, the electrical and electronic components maker,
yesterday launched a Pounds 30m agreed bid for instrument manufacturer Penny
&amp; Giles, sending the target's shares leaping 32 per cent in a falling
market.
Penny &amp; Giles shares closed 75p higher at 310p yesterday in response to the
offer. Mr John Westhead, Bowthorpe's chief executive, said Penny &amp; Giles
would fit the group's strategy of exploiting niche markets. 'We aim to get
it into the top three position around the world,' he said 'That is what we
are good at.'
Bowthorpe shares ended the day just 2p down at 234p. The company already
holds just under 30 per cent of Penny &amp; Giles.
Bowthorpe is offering 136 new shares for every 100 Penny &amp; Giles shares.
Alternatively, Penny &amp; Giles shareholders may elect to take 1 new Bowthorpe
share and 84p cash for every one of theirs. Based on last night's prices the
offer values Penny &amp; Giles shares at 318p.
Mr Westhead said the deal with Penny &amp; Giles offered global synergies. For
example, Bowthorpe had businesses in the US which manufactured products
complementary to Penny &amp; Giles's output in the UK. About 80 per cent of
Bowthorpe's sales were outside the UK, said Mr Westhead, with 60 to 70 per
cent manufactured abroad. Penny &amp; Giles exported about 40 per cent of its
business. 'The emphasis will be on growth outside the UK', he said.
The deal was likely to dilute Bowthorpe's earnings by less than 2 per cent,
said Mr Westhead. He added, however, that the dilution would be eliminated
within 18 months.
The new Bowthorpe shares will be eligible for the 4.43p final dividend
announced in the annual results last month. Bowthorpe reported an 11 per
cent decline to Pounds 40.3m in the year to December 31.

FT  02 APR 92 / UK Company News: Senior Engineering bucks sector trend with
14% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR Engineering Group, the specialist engineer with interests ranging
from construction services to flexible tubing, bucked the gloomy sector
trend with a 14 per cent increase in annual profits.
The pre-tax line for 1991 rose from Pounds 16m to Pounds 18.3m, despite
lower group turnover of Pounds 297.6m (Pounds 318.3m).
Professor Sir Roland Smith, the chairman, emphasised the results were
achieved while many engineering companies had experienced significant
downturns, and that they followed a 'very creditable' performance in the
previous year.
Earnings per share edged up from 6.1p to 6.56p. A recommended final dividend
of 1.95p makes a total of 3.15p (2.86p) for the year. The pay-out is covered
more than twice - contrasting again with the uncovered dividends paid by
several other engineering groups.
The performance of Senior's four business areas and its Australasian
business varied widely, with thermal engineering, the largest division,
lifting operating profits from Pounds 2.63m to Pounds 4.28m on turnover down
from Pounds 129.5m to Pounds 125m.
Mr Don McFarlane, group manufacturing director, said the division had
benefited from cost reductions carried out in 1990 and from two important
industrial trends - power station refurbishment and the 'tremendous
progress' in industrial boilers linked to combined heat and power (CHP) and
waste recovery projects.
The engineering products division saw profits fall from Pounds 6.43m to
Pounds 4.21m as turnover slipped from Pounds 103m to Pounds 90.6m. However,
Mr John Bell, the division's chief executive, said the return was reasonable
given that the tubing, heat treatment and expansion joint businesses had
been hit by the recession.
The construction services side raised profits from Pounds 4.84m to Pounds
6.71m as turnover edged up from Pounds 49.8m to Pounds 52.3m. Business has
been aided by the focus on high-specification, non-commercial contracts, and
by the acquisition of Nordclima, a German air handling business.
On acquisitions, Flexonics, the US flexible hose and expansion joint company
purchased in February for Dollars 40m (Pounds 23m) was performing better
than expected, said Mr Bell. The company also wants to increase its presence
in the German flexible hose market.
Elsewhere, said Mr McFarlane, Senior is keen to make a further construction
services acquisition in Germany to complement Nordclima.
COMMENT
Senior has taken a few knocks from the City over the years for being
unexciting, but in the current climate there is much to be said for a
virtually debt-free company that has consciously aimed for steady growth.
The results reflect the prescient round of cost-cutting in 1989 and 1990,
along with Mr McFarlane's philosophy of devolving profit responsibility. As
for the outlook, Senior is not seeing any significant signs of change in
business levels, but is well placed for the recovery: a 4 per cent return on
sales in engineering products at the bottom of the cycle augurs well, while
acquisitions such as Flexonics have boosted non-UK earnings to 40 per cent
of the total and could go higher. At the very least, expect maintained
earnings this year, putting the company on a prospective p/e of about 11.

FT  02 APR 92 / UK Company News: More light thrown on Goldman Sachs'
dealings with Maxwell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES and BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ATTEMPT to force the Department of Trade and Industry to disclose
documents for use in a pending criminal trial has thrown more light on
dealings between Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, and the late Mr
Robert Maxwell.
Mr Peter Marks, a director of stockbroker Branston and Gothard, is to be
tried in June for alleged offences under the Financial Services Act.
It is alleged that on October 12 1990 he told Mr Timothy Medland of Goldman
Sachs Securities that he believed that on that day Mr Robert Maxwell would
be calling in the liquidators or filing for bankruptcy of Maxwell
Communications Corporation - a statement Mr Marks is alleged to have known
was untrue.
Mr Andrew Collins QC, for the DTI, said at Knightsbridge Crown Court
yesterday that Mr Marks made about Pounds 2,000 from his 'bear raid' -
dealing in MCC shares on the assumption that they would fall.
Mr Marks' lawyers asked the court to order the DTI to hand over any
documents relating to Goldman Sachs' involvement with Maxwell.
The DTI claimed the documents sought were government papers that it was not
in the public interest to disclose, and were in any event not relevant to Mr
Marks' trial.
Mr Collins said the documents dealt with concerns about what might have
happened in relation to Goldman Sachs and Mr Maxwell and what should be
done, but they were not relevant to Mr Marks' trial. It was no secret that
there was a continuing investigation into Mr Maxwell and his companies, he
added.
Judge Hordern said the DTI had established its immunity claim but he would
look at the documents to see whether they were relevant to the trial. Mr
Anthony Scrivener QC, for Mr Marks, told the court that the whole case
depended on what was said between Mr Marks and Mr Medland.
The documents already made available showed that on July 26 1991 the DTI
wrote to Mr Maxwell raising queries about a possible breach of the Companies
Act and said: 'We understand the facts to be that . . . on August 13 or 14
1990 . . . you granted Goldman Sachs an option to sell you 15.65m shares in
MCC.'
The option gave Goldman the right to sell 15.65m shares to Mr Maxwell in
November at a previously fixed price and so could have given it an incentive
to buy MCC shares, or not to sell ones it already held. Goldman has said
that when the option was issued it already held enough shares to fulfil it
and so had no incentive to buy.

FT  02 APR 92 / UK Company News: Daily Telegraph listing proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR CONRAD Black, the Can-adian proprietor of the Daily Telegraph, yesterday
announ-ced that he was considering a Stock Exchange listing for the UK
newspaper group in June 'barring a market over-reaction' to the outcome of
the UK election.
At the same time he announced the sale of his 8.8 per cent stake in United
Newspapers, publishers of the Daily Express, ending three years of
speculation about his intentions.
The proposed flotation would require the Hollinger Group, the international
media group which is Mr Black's main holding company, to reduce its present
holding from 83 per cent to 70 per cent.
A minority of the shares is currently held by directors and former owners of
the Telegraph newspapers.
The Telegraph newspapers have just announced pre-tax profits for 1991 of
Pounds 40.5m on turnover of Pounds 219m, compared to profits of Pounds 38.5m
the year before, on turnover of Pounds 222m.
Mr Joe Cooke, managing director of the Daily Telegraph, said that the
proposed flotation and the sale of the United Newspapers stake did not
indicate that Hollinger was short of money: 'it is more in the way of
building up a war chest'.
Hollinger Group sold the 17.25m United Newspapers shares to brokers Smith
New Court and Cazenove, who placed it with several dozen institutions at
350p a share, raising Pounds 60.4m.
United Newspapers shares yesterday slipped by 13p to 360p.
The average price paid by Hollinger in building the stake in July and August
1989 is believed to be about 458p, implying a loss on the shares' value of
about Pounds 18.6m. This does not include either the cost of financing the
investment or dividends received.
Hollinger said yesterday that it still believed United Newspapers 'is a
fundamentally un-dervalued stock but . . . there are more attractive
investment possibilities . . . and the resources engaged in holding this
investment can be more prudently applied to the reduction of outstanding
loans.'
The stake sale followed United Newspapers' 1991 final results last week,
which exceeded City expectations.
It also comes four months after Hollinger paid ADollars 1.4bn for Fairfax,
the Australian newspaper group. The company's worldwide collection of titles
includes the Jerusalem Post and over 80 newspapers in Canada and the US.
Stock market speculation that Hollinger would bid for United Newspapers or
try to buy its stable of regional newspapers or business magazines pushed
the share price to a peak of 512p in late 1989, but speculation has been
ebbing for some time.
Mr Graham Wilson, managing director of United Newspapers, which also
publishes the Sunday Express and Daily Star, said 'we got on perfectly
amicably while he was a shareholder and we'll get on amicably now he's not'.
The Telegraph and Express newspaper groups will continue their joint venture
of London printing facilities at West Ferry in Docklands.

FT  02 APR 92 / UK Company News: Adwest hit by losses in defence division
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOSSES IN the defence division hit Adwest, the car parts and power systems
group, as it recorded its lowest interim profit for ten years.
In the period to December 31 the pre-tax outcome fell 34 per cent, from
Pounds 3.07m to Pounds 2.03m. Sales, however, declined only 2 per cent to
Pounds 60.5m (Pounds 61.8m).
Mr Fred Grant, chairman, offered some encouragement for the full year,
however, saying the opening three months of the second half were
significantly better than last year.
'The main reason is we are coming to an end of the rationalisation
programme,' he said, 'and we are beginning to see the benefits.'
The two-year restructuring programme throughout the group had resulted in
staff cuts of 24 per cent over 18 months, and nine fewer factories for a
total of 17.
Indicating that he expected the group to return to its traditional one
third/two thirds profits pattern this year, and perhaps even exceed that in
the second half, Mr Grant said the interim dividend would be maintained for
the fourth consecutive year at 1.25p. This was almost twice covered by
earnings per share of 2.3p (3.2p).
Analysts welcomed Mr Grant's upbeat comments, although the results came in
at the lower end of expectations. Forecasts for the full year to June 30
were pitched at between Pounds 6.5m and Pounds 7.5m, compared with Pounds
7.1m last year.
The power systems business had been hampered by losses in defence, which had
since been eliminated.
Adwest had no intention of abandoning defence, Mr Grant said. 'If everyone
else gets out through the exit door, then maybe we would like to stay in.'
The property division contributed the majority of profits. Industrial rents
had been raised by 12 per cent per annum and Mr Grant expected to achieve
Pounds 2.5m (Pounds 2m) in rent rolls this year.
On the automotive side, which represented some 60 per cent of turnover, the
fortunes of the Jaguar group presented some uncertainty, said Mr Grant. 'We
do not know from week to week what some of our customers will be doing,' he
said. However, that uncertainty was offset by new contracts for Japanese car
manufacturers such as Nissan, Honda and Toyota.

FT  02 APR 92 / Fast talk needed to explain extent of problems
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MYSTERY shrouds the recent and rapid decline of MTM, the speciality
chemicals group and former glamour stock and MTM and its advisers have some
explaining to do if they are to save the company.
They will have to do it fast. Following the group's admission that it had
breached its covenants, its bankers yesterday gave the company a stay of
execution of only 30 days.
Before those 30 days expire, MTM and its advisers will have to explain to
the bankers the full extent of its predicament. In addition, the group,
together with the Postern Executive Group, its newly appointed corporate
management specialists, will have to demonstrate how it can escape its
present plight. It must also grapple with certain questionable transactions
that appear to have taken place last year.
The extent of MTM's difficulties will remain obscure until it publishes its
long-delayed audited full-year figures.
The present crisis was triggered when MTM's auditors, BDO Binder Hamlyn,
refused to sign off the company's results last month. They disputed the way
MTM appeared to have valued its assets.
The way MTM capitalised interest on construction projects was also
questioned.
Staff at MTM said that although the auditors had signed off the previous
year's accounts - which used similar methods - this year the accountants at
BDO Binder Hamlyn were less willing to sanction such methods for two
reasons.
First, the Leeds BDO Binder Hamlyn office conducting the audit was under
pressure from its London headquarters to be stringent following corporate
crashes which had involved lax accounting procedures.
Second, although such methods had been used before by MTM, they had not been
used on such a scale.
Staff say that Mr Richard Lines, the company's founder and executive
chairman, was under pressure to achieve a profits forecast of Pounds 23m
last month when the group was to publish its full-year figures.
If MTM could not achieve that total, the recent Pounds 62m acquisition of
Hardwicke, paid for by a rights issue, would dilute earnings. This would
have undermined the group's ability to return to the City for cash.
Insiders say the accounting methods, which were eventually challenged by the
auditors, were required to ensure the company reached that magic Pounds 23m
figure. Analysts now believe profits could be as low as Pounds 10m.
Once the asset values were challenged, the group's financial position
rapidly unravelled. MTM's breaching of its banking covenants was a direct
consequence of the auditors' decision to challenge its asset values.
With debts of about Pounds 70m, MTM's covenants were dependent on certain
debt and assets ratios.
The covenants were also dependent on certain income-to-debt ratios. Analysts
fear that if they have underestimated the company's debts, MTM may also not
have the income required by the covenants.
The most pressing problem facing MTM is debt reduction. Mr Alasdair Nisbet,
chemicals analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, believes the company will have to
make disposals, probably Hardwicke.
In the short-term, the company would be unable to raise money through a
rights issue because of the stock's low share price.
'If you ask the question whether MTM is going to file for receivership, the
answer is probably not yet,' says Mr Nisbet. 'But the management will have
to take some hard decisions pretty quickly if the group is going to
survive.'
Meanwhile, questions remain about how MTM managed to reach such a desperate
position. Whether the report, prepared by BDO Binder Hamlyn for MTM's audit
board, will be sufficient for critics remains to be seen.
The MTM mystery will clearly take time to decipher.

FT  02 APR 92 / MTM breaches banking covenants: Speciality chemicals group
may pay no dividend after two profits warnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MTM, the troubled speciality chemicals group, yesterday announced it had
breached its covenants with two banking syndicates led by Standard
Chartered, the Hong Kong-based bank and Chase of the US.
The company, which issued two profits warnings last month, is believed to
have debts of about Pounds 70m. Standard Chartered said its exposure to the
company was minimal.
MTM said it was finalising a standstill agreement with its bankers, for a
period initially up to April 30. The syndicate leaders are understood to
have agreed arrangements but are negotiating with other syndicate members.
MTM's shares fell 40p to 26p.
MTM's directors said they did not expect to be able to recommend payment of
a final dividend for the year ended December 31.
The company has also asked its auditors, BDO Binder Hamlyn, to prepare a
report on the reasons and circumstances surrounding the shortfall in profits
that triggered its present crisis.
MTM said it was unable to give a date when its audited final-year figures,
due on March 31, will be published. However, sources close to the company
said they were unlikely to be revealed before the end of April.
MTM's auditors refused to sign off the accounts last month after a dispute
about asset values. It was the revision in asset values that caused the
breach in the group's covenants with its bankers. The covenants were
dependent on certain debt and assets ratios.
Postern Executive Group, the corporate management specialists, has been
appointed to evaluate the group's financial and operational position. It
will also recommend options for MTM's future strategic development.
Mr Tom Baxter, finance director, has resigned with immediate effect, said
the company. Last month the company stated he would resign when the audit
was complete. Yesterday it said that although the audit was unfinished, he
had completed his contribution.

FT  02 APR 92 / Lonrho investors seek debt details
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONRHO, the troubled international trading group, is being pressed by some
of its largest UK institutional shareholders to divulge information over
debt and banking covenants in the wake of the collapse of its share price.
Directors will be asked to reveal the amount of debt and in which countries
it has been taken out.
Mr Rene Leclezio, Lonrho chairman, told shareholders at last month's annual
general meeting that net debt stood at Pounds 850m.
Shareholders particularly want to know whether this figure has been
calculated before or after the Pounds 177m was paid by the Libyans for the
one third stake in the Metropole Hotels.
Lonrho will also be pressed to give details of its banking covenants or
conditions.
Only if covenants are breached, can a bank apply the threat that a loan
should be repaid immediately.
One shareholder said: 'If our information about the group is correct then
the shares are seriously undervalued. But in the wake of the fall in the
share price we must have up-to-date information for us to make a judgment
about whether this is recovery stock or not.'
Mr Paul Spicer, Lonrho deputy chairman, refused to comment on the
relationship between Lonrho and its institutional shareholders, but added:
'There is nothing to be concerned about. Our debt is easily explained and is
being reduced.'
Lonrho's shares yesterday recovered a little to close at 71p, following
Tuesday's fall to 65 1/2 p, an eight-year low. Last November the shares were
worth about 250p.
Bankers said yesterday they were concerned about Lonrho's falling share
price. However, they are unable to apply much pressure on the company to
provide more information to them.
Lonrho's main banking facilities contain covenants that are 'almost
impossible for the company to breach', according to a banker.
Bankers are divided on the merits of the Libyan investment in Lonrho's
Metropole Hotels chain. 'At least it is bringing cash into the company',
said one. But another criticised the deal which he described as
'strategically wrong'.

FT  02 APR 92 / Glaxo's head of French operations leaves company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLAXO'S president of French operations, Mr Edwin Nathan, has left the
company, following a breakdown in relations between the British group and
the French government over the pricing of Imigran, its new migraine drug.
Glaxo refused to give reasons for his move. He was in charge of negotiations
with the French government for Imigran.
Last month, he told a French newspaper that in exchange for a high price for
Imigran, Glaxo would construct a FFr1bn (Pounds 100m) factory in France, set
up a research and development centre or co-market the drug with Sanofi, the
French pharmaceuticals group. Such deals are common in France though are not
normally referred to in public.
He told Les Echos, the French financial daily: 'The different ministers are
dragging out the negotiations, perhaps in order not to take risks before the
next elections.' He pointed out France was one of the last European
countries to license Imigran.
Two weeks later, the French government ordered an investigation into the
ethical, legal and medical acceptability of methods used by Glaxo to market
Imigran. It set up a commission to decide whether to ask the European
Commission to investigate possible abuse of market position.
French officials said they were concerned that Glaxo was generating public
pressure on the government to license the drug.
In particular, they were irritated by the number of articles about Imigran
in consumer magazines.
France traditionally has low pharmaceuticals prices, but has among the
largest per capita consumption of drugs in Europe. France spent 8.7 per cent
of its GNP last year on healthcare, the second highest spending in Europe
after Germany. Drugs represented 17.3 per cent of its health budget.
Glaxo has a strategy of charging high prices for innovative products. The
group, like other pharmaceuticals companies, is finding it hard to maintain
prices for existing products in Japan and Europe. In the US, many have been
forced by political pressure to introduce voluntary price freezes or
promises not to increase prices above the rate of inflation.
Mr Nathan is to be replaced by Mr Christopher Adam, Glaxo's commercial
director. He was Mr Nathan's predecessor in France.

FT  02 APR 92 / Harrisons &amp; Crosfield pays Pounds 67m for Unilever unit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
HARRISONS &amp; Crosfield, the UK conglomerate, is paying Pounds 67m in cash for
BOCM-Silcock, Unilever's animal feeds business. It will be merged with Pauls
Agriculture, H&amp;C's animal feeds subsidiary. Unilever will suffer a loss on
the deal as BOCM is valued at Pounds 85m in its books, having been written
down from more than Pounds 100m.
H&amp;C, which has interests in chemicals, timber and building supplies, and
plantations as well as animal and human food, announced the purchase with
its 1991 results which showed a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 106.1m
to Pounds 71.2m. It also maintained its annual dividend at 9p although it is
not covered by earnings per share of 7p, down from 11.6p.
Unilever put most of its agribusiness division on the market in February,
and said losses on disposals would be covered by a Pounds 60m extraordinary
charge made in the 1991 accounts. BOCM-Silcock, which has 22 feed mills in
the UK, is the largest of the businesses Unilever is selling.
The sale to H&amp;C includes Unitrition, an oil miller, and Fulmar, a Scottish
fish-feed maker. The combined businesses had sales of Pounds 300m in 1991
and made pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.1m.
However, H&amp;C said on its accounting policies the business would have made
Pounds 11.1m, because Unilever charges the subsidiary for head office
services. On this basis, the multiple H&amp;C is paying is 9.3 on a 35 per cent
tax charge. Mr George Paul, chief executive of H&amp;C, said Unilever had spent
heavily on its mills but they were working below full capacity.
He said combining the 22 Unilever mills with the 11 which H&amp;C owns would
mean closures but would give H&amp;C market leadership and economies of scale.
He said BOCM had 15.5 per cent of the market while H&amp;C had 8.5 per cent.
The deal is subject to clearance by the competition authorities.
Mr Paul expected the deal to add 0.3p to H&amp;C's earnings per share in 1992,
after financing costs, when it would own BOCM for seven months, and 1.3p to
earnings in 1993. The purchase would increase H&amp;C's gearing from 38 per cent
at the end of 1991 to 52 per cent. H&amp;C planned to sell non-core businesses
bringing gearing down again.
Unilever shares fell 2p to 896p while H&amp;C shares rose 2p to 126p.

FT  02 APR 92 / The Lex Column: LWT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A 22 per cent jump in 1991 pre-tax profits at LWT (Holdings) was more than
the market was expecting, and offers a brighter picture than other ITV
companies which have reported of late. LWT's strong franchise is well
reflected in its 0.5 per cent increase in advertising revenue - against a
1.6 per cent drop for the industry as a whole - while a Pounds 15m fall in
programming sales to the domestic network and overseas customers was offset
by a reduction of Pounds 17m in transmission, sales and administrative
expenses.
Yesterday's results help edge the company's 50 or so golden-handcuffed
executives closer to their much publicised Pounds 43m jackpot, payable if
the company's shares reach 279p by November next year. The price last night
closed at 263p, up 5p. To many, the rewards will still seem absurd relative
to the risks, but as an example of identity of management and shareholder
interest the incentive scheme has proved hard to fault. It prevented
overbidding for the franchise and encouraged early and effective cost
cutting, leaving LWT among the best placed to face the early rigours of the
new licence system and the chill wind of satellite and cable competition.
The shares would seem to be worth staying with, at least until the handcuffs
are unlocked.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Three years ago, Harrisons &amp; Crosfield's then chairman proclaimed that the
main objectives of the business were consistent growth of earnings per share
and a dividend on average twice covered. That petard duly blew up when
yesterday's annual results showed the lowest earnings per share since 1983,
and a maintained dividend which was a mere four-fifths covered. Were it not
for the 10 per cent yield on its shares, H&amp;C might be in danger of finding
itself friendless at a vulnerable point in the economic cycle.
Granted, last year saw vigorous cost-cutting and a cash flow strong enough
to justify the pay-out. Barring a sudden recovery in the economy, that trick
will be harder to pull off this year. More disposals will be needed to
generate sufficient cash for another 9p dividend, especially after the
Pounds 67m acquisition of BOCM-Silcock from Unilever. H&amp;C management clearly
wants to play to its strengths in agriculture. The deal looks good value,
even though it takes gearing to an uncomfortable 52 per cent.
The question for shareholders is whether it will pay to wait around until
the cyclical chemicals and building materials businesses are making a better
return. Long-term holders have seen their investment decline by more than
half relative to the market since 1982, but have also stumped up money for a
steady flow of acquisitions. Now they must regard the shares as a
fixed-income investment at least until the end of next year.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The revolving door continues to spin at Mountleigh, a property company in
rather more urgent need of revolving credit. Mr Steven Gerard, the new chief
executive, is not a bank appointee. But as a former senior executive at
Citibank, one of Mountleigh's main lenders, he looks suspiciously like the
next best thing.
Somewhat unnervingly for investors, Mr Gerard felt compelled to mark his
appointment yesterday by promising a strategically focused operating and
financial plan 'which will be satisfactory to all creditors'. He also
undertook to maximise value for shareholders. In this regard, he could begin
by updating them on progress made so far in completing the Pounds 125m sale
of the Merry Hill shopping centre, first announced in January. No news is
not necessarily good news.

FT  02 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Sterling effort required
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If we are to believe the City consensus, the greatest threat to financial
markets in this election comes from a hung parliament. The polls released on
Tuesday were the first to predict an absolute majority for any single party,
albeit Labour. So it is curious they should have produced such an attack of
nerves in equity and gilt markets yesterday. All the more so, since sterling
fell only half a pfennig. The foreign exchange markets were hardly
displaying alarm at the prospect of a majority Labour government committed
to the ERM. That in turn should reduce the threat of a post-election
increase in base rates.
Of course, things are never as simple as they seem. Last night's Gallup poll
had a different message. The outcome may still be a hung parliament after
all. The exchange markets are treading water ahead of tomorrow's US
unemployment figures and may have deferred judgment on the election. But a
feature of trading was reluctance to sell the UK currency after its initial
fall. Though sterling was held up by higher money rates, higher base rates
are by no means automatic. That would only become inevitable if the market
distrusted Mr John Smith enough actually to drive sterling through its
D-Mark floor. On balance after yesterday, it looks as though there is enough
faith in his ERM commitment to make that a risky course even for the
hardiest speculator.
The prospect of a maintained parity and stable interest rates ought to be
some consolation to both equities and gilts. Indeed, with receding
devaluation risk, the 10-year gilt starts to look attractive even against a
backdrop of rising government borrowing. The yield is more than two
percentage points above its German equivalent.
It is different for equities. Political uncertainty is compounded by worries
over Japan, not to mention the property and banking sector. After their 11
per cent fall since last Friday, Barclays Bank shares now yield nearly as
much as gilts. That would make them cheap if there were signs of an end to
the property woes which are playing havoc with its loan book. Unfortunately
this is all the more unlikely given the deflationary pressure of ERM
membership. That would limit the upside for shares even in the increasingly
unlikely event of a Tory victory.
It will be compounded in Labour's case by short-term shock to the economy as
consumer wealth is redistributed away from the south-east. Mr Smith will
need firm credentials from the gilts market. A weak economy may make him a
bigger-spending customer than he has yet let on.

Sir, Barry Riley's piece on Office Block Mania ('Canary that could not fly',

Could you please look up your records to see whether Barry Riley's

To those of us inhabiting the shallows of the small business community it is

FT  02 APR 92 / Letter: Extension to Jubilee Line a priority for future of
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL PICKARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was surprised to read David Weeks's letter (March 31) suggesting that
the Jubilee Line extension can be delayed, on the grounds that it serves
only London's Docklands. In addition to improving Docklands access, this
line will provide a new high-quality central London rail link to east and
south-east London, serving not only the Docklands area, but also the
residents and businesses of Waterloo, London Bridge, North Southwark,
Bermondsey, Greenwich, Canning Town, West Ham and Stratford.
It will also relieve several of the most congested parts of the central
London rail network. Passengers on the Central Line between Stratford and
Holborn, the District and Circle Lines between Monument and Victoria, and
Bakerloo Line between Paddington and Oxford Circus on the Network SouthEast
between Stratford and Liverpool Street, will all experience significant
improvements in journey comfort.
The London Docklands Development Corporation has recently engaged in
discussions with Westminster City Council with a view jointly to promoting
London to ensure that it retains its position as the premier commercial city
of Europe. In achieving this, Docklands will complement the City and West
End.
The Jubilee Line will play a key role in providing high-quality access
between these centres and also in giving access to the Channel tunnel train
services at Stratford. It will combine with and reinforce other ongoing rail
improvements to provide London with an effective public transport system to
compete internationally in the future. For all these reasons the Jubilee
Line extension should continue to be supported as a priority project for
London Transport.

FT  02 APR 92 / Letter: Fair view of Names' losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr K J LEONARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You continue to suggest (Survey of Lloyd's of London, March 30) that
external Names will bear a significantly greater share of the 1989
underwriting account losses than vocational, or so-called 'insider' Names.
A comparison of the performance of individual Names should be based on the
bottom line result of each Name's overall premium limit rather than on a
small selected sample of syndicates. That is, the result should relate to
each Name's overall premium limit and syndicates should not be compared in
isolation.
On this basis, for the 1989 underwriting year we are responsible for
accounting to 1,617 Names who have a combined capacity of Pounds 658m. At
this juncture our forecasts show that average losses of our external Names
are only 0.4 per cent worse than the estimated loss of working Names through
this agency.
This position was also reflected in the actual figures for the 1988 account.
Statistics can be manipulated to emphasise a particular point, but it should
be clear that the above is the only equitable measure of performance
comparison.

FT  02 APR 92 / Letter: Minimum wage can safeguard skills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr SIMON HASKEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, During the last century, when faced with children going to school
instead of working long hours in their factories, the Spinning Masters
forecast loss of work and business going abroad. We had the same dire
warnings about the minimum wage from today's textile employers ('Election
1992' March 30).
We are a relatively small textile company with modest factories in Leeds,
High Wycombe and South Wales. Nobody working in this company is paid less
than Pounds 3.40 per hour because, in normal times, to keep our skilled
staff and attract new good calibre people into the company, we have to pay
more than the proposed minimum wage.
We will succeed in the single European market only by being quicker and more
effective than the competition, and to achieve this a better trained and
more skilled workforce is essential. If the minimum wage acts as an impetus
to improve the skills, versatility and training of the workforce this will
be welcomed by the industry generally.
It would be helpful if this could be introduced in a way which gives firms
time to upgrade their manufacturing processes but Labour's incentives to
better training and more investment will help.
A minimum wage has operated in the US for over 30 years and your
correspondent Edward Balls ('Higher minimum wage, more hamburger') doesn't
think that it has done them much harm.
I wonder if the real worry is not the effect of the minimum wage on
controlling costs by eroding the easy 'hire and fire' regime we have in this
country.

Sir, Edward Balls reports ('Higher minimum wage, more hamburger', March 30)
findings from the US that increasing minimum wages increases employment.
Such results are not confined to the US. Recent research we have done on the
UK wages councils (Minimum wages, wage dispersion and employment, Centre for
Economic Performance, London School of Economics) finds there is no evidence
of a negative relationship between employment and minimum wages.
If anything, rises in minimum wages seem to increase employment, an effect
that seems particularly strong in the catering industry.

BACKLASH: THE UNDECLARED WAR AGAINST WOMEN By Susan Faludi Chatto and
Windus, Pounds 9.99
THE WAR AGAINST WOMEN By Marilyn French Hamish Hamilton, Pounds 9.99
When the nuclear bomb testers were waiting for the result of the mission to
bomb Hiroshima, they expected a coded message. If the mission was
successful, the message would read: 'It's a boy.' But if the bomb was a dud,
it would read: 'It's a girl.' In that code lies a clue to the desire of
families all over the world to produce boys not girls, to selective abortion
of girls, to infanticide of female children, and to gradual starvation of
women in areas of the Third World, where men get first share of the food.
Both Marilyn French and Susan Faludi write of the war against women. For
Marilyn French, feminism was the first philosophy to challenge patriarchy
per se. The anger of 'men-as-a-caste' at this challenge partly explains the
war they are now waging. She cites many examples of this: domestic violence;
the abandonment of women and children by men who fail to support them;
attitudes to work and food in much of the Third World; employment law and
practices; the denial of abortion rights; and the growth of fundamentalism.
Her text is passionately argued and largely convincing. But it sometimes
lacks accuracy, rendering it less compelling than Susan Faludi's
meticulously researched Backlash. Time after time Faludi takes a piece of
well-reported research, and re-examines it. While Marilyn French recites a
litany of wrongs done to women, and argues, somewhat loosely, that women are
fighting back, Faludi records cases of discrimination and the reporting of
them, while interviewing the people involved, showing that things are not as
they seemed.
For instance, Marilyn French reports that women and their families are on
average 73 per cent worse off after divorce in the US. The backlashers, who
want to toughen the divorce laws, use that evidence to strengthen their
argument. But Faludi shows that the figures usually quoted, published by
Lenore Weitzman in 1985, were almost certainly inaccurate. Two economists,
Hoffman and Duncan, found that their work on divorce statistics suggested a
much smaller decline, of about 30 per cent. And, they suggested the average
woman's living standard, five years after divorce, was actually slightly
higher than when she was married.
When they published their findings, there was only one brief item on them,
in the Wall Street Journal's inside-page demography column. Weitzman's
figures still tend to be quoted because they suit two discrete groups: those
who wish to beat up men for abandoning their families, and those who wish to
say that divorce is having the most disastrous effects on the economic
circumstances of families, and should be made more difficult. This
'evidence' is at the heart of the backlash line: that women are better off
'protected' than equal.
Faludi's most telling arguments come from her accounts of women trying to
use anti-discrimination legislation to get better working conditions, pay
and promotion prospects. The cases of female employees at Sears Roebuck and
ABC Television who attempted to use the legislation to improve their lot
make depressing, infuriating reading. And the fact that one of the biggest
critics of the ABC tactics, Rita Flynn, a former seasoned CBS reporter,
first found her career on the skids and then found herself unemployable when
she moved west suggests that in the US, as in the UK, it does not always
work to one's benefit to take issue with the company discriminating against
one.
Susan Faludi has written a cogent, compelling account of the change in
climate for feminism in the US. The UK is different in many respects; the
English additions to the original US edition do not work because some of the
arguments need modification for the UK and European scene. But Faludi's note
of optimism at the end, with her assertion that 'there really is no good
reason why the 1990s can't be their (women's) decade', is one we would do
well to echo. There is indeed no good reason, but what is needed, propounded
by neither Faludi nor French perhaps because of their American world-view,
is a different attitude to children. They need to be recognised as a public
concern and the nation's future - not a private (women's) matter, with
properly funded childcare and child protection - alongside generous
maternity rights and benefits.
The UK is poor on these issues in comparison with the rest of Europe, and
has resisted protection of part-time employees (blocking the EC directive on
part-time work), 86 per cent of whom are female. These are matters that
should come to the fore in the last week of the election campaign. Then
women voters could use their political power to vote for the party that
promises the most for women and children. No party has pledged enough.
The reviewer is a rabbi. Her book, Whatever's Happening to Women?, was
published last year.

FT  02 APR 92 / Trade talks fall on deaf ears: The Uruguay Round is
deadlocked, but is too important to fail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Negotiators in Geneva are likely to miss their Easter deadline as they
struggle to break the 15-month deadlock in the Uruguay Round of talks on
world trade liberalisation.
Officials at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) talk of
paralysis, as the political will to make compromises among central players
such as the US and the European Community appears to ebb away.
Fear that the talks face imminent collapse prompted US President George Bush
last week to call for 'a political push from whatever source' to rescue
them. He declined, however, to offer further US concessions. American
officials in Geneva say 'a minor miracle' is needed to achieve a
breakthrough.
At the same time, farm ministers from the 24-nation Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) meeting in Paris on Friday
called for a swift and successful end to the negotiations. They warned of
'significant downside risks for the world trading system, and costs for the
world economy' if the talks fail. They too offered nothing.
The risks of failure are already apparent, as recession in 1991 led to a
third successive year of faltering world trade growth: the value of trade
rose by a meagre 1.5 per cent to Dollars 3,500bn - the smallest gain since
1985, according to the Gatt. Without the boost to trade that a successful
conclusion to the round should bring, recovery is likely to be retarded.
The collapse of the round - launched in 1986 to break down barriers to trade
in services, agriculture and textiles, to boost international respect for
patents and copyright, and to improve mechanisms for settling trade disputes
 -has been looming for a long time. A summit held in Brussels in December
1990 broke up in acrimony after the EC and US failed to agree on farm trade
reform. A compromise reform package, known as the Final Act, was drawn up by
Mr Arthur Dunkel, director-general of Gatt. It was tabled late in December
1991 and was intended to break the deadlock. All of the 108 countries that
have signed up to the Gatt expressed reservations with elements of the
package but, with the exception of the EC, have agreed that it is is too
important to the world economy to be rejected.
The issue which continues to jeopardise any agreement is farm trade, in
particular the EC's Common Agriculture Policy (CAP). Reform of farm trade is
essential to successful completion of the round because many participants in
the developed and developing world are seeking an end to protective farm
subsidies in the EC and the US, in exchange for freeing their domestic
markets to outsiders.
Mr Dunkel proposed cutting agricultural subsidies by 20 per cent by 1999,
converting farm quotas and other protective devices into tariffs and then
cutting them by 36 per cent by the same date. He also sought reductions in
subsidised farm exports.
The EC rejected the plans in January. Mr Dunkel has refused to reopen the
Final Act for fresh negotiation. He has instructed the EC to settle
differences over farm trade with other negotiators - principally the US -
and bring back a compromise acceptable to all.
Such a compromise would seem to be in the interests of the EC and the US.
They spend billions of dollars a year supporting the prices farmers get for
their crops, paying for storage of excess production, and subsidising the
price of farm products being dumped on the world market. Such policies place
a heavy burden on taxpayers and consumers in the west, and damageagriculture
in the Third World by depressing world prices for meat and cereals in
particular.
Although the EC has made some concessions over the past few months, two
contentious issues remain: EC demands to 'rebalance' its protective regime
by raising protection against the import of cereal substitutes in exchange
for lowering protection for other farm products;
EC demands that compensation payments to farmers (seen as the centrepiece of
plans to reform the CAP) should not be regarded by the Gatt as a distortion
of trade.
Today, compromise on both these issues appears possible, with the EC
suggesting it could drop its demands for 'rebalancing' in exchange for
compensation payments to farmers which do not distort trade. One EC
spokesman in Geneva said that the remaining differences between the EC and
the US are 'more a matter of presentation than substance'.
Many observers of the tortuous manoeuvrings within the Gatt find it hard to
understand why the entire accord is being put at risk over the issue of CAP
reform when the potential gains from an agreement are immense.
For the first time, trade in commercial services - worth Dollars 680bn in
1989, the latest year for which the Gatt has figures, accounting for about
19 per cent of world trade - would fall under the Gatt umbrella. A timetable
would be set for the markets of all Gatt signatories to be opened to foreign
banks, securities houses and insurance companies; national monopolies in
telecommunications would be dismantled; liberalisation of shipping and civil
aviation would begin. Detailed country-by-country negotiations on opening
these markets are currently stalled, with the EC and others blaming the US
for seeking to limit the scope of liberalisation. But there is a general
assumption that progress on the farm subsidy issue would yield US
concessions.
In addition, respect for patents and copyright - vulnerable to piracy in
many developing countries - would also be built into an agreement on
intellectual property rights. Trade in textiles and garments would be
brought into Gatt, after having defied liberalisation for 40 years. Over 10
years the labyrinth of bilaterally negotiated quotas that determine textile
trade would be dismantled, and replaced by tariffs.
Moreover, reinforced Gatt dispute settlement rules would be expected to
check the destructive proliferation of rows over goods that are allegedly
subsidised, or 'dumped' in export markets. They would tackle the abuse of
technical or industrial standards, which are frequently used as a block to
imports.
Perhaps most important of all, a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round
would secure the participation of much of the developing world in
multilateral trade agreements. Since 1986, more than 60 countries from the
developing world and former communist bloc have adopted policies of
reductions in tariffs and quotas. The prospect of reduced barriers to their
exports - which depend on the completion of the Uruguay Round - have been an
important incentive.
Although deadlines in Gatt negotiations have often been missed, the current
stalemate is creating a growing sense of urgency. Beyond April, there are
not enough days in the US congressional calendar to get an agreement
ratified ahead of the US presidential elections in November. Officials in
Geneva, including those from the US, are already talking of what might be
done to minimise 'backsliding' from compromises already made in the areas of
services, patents and copyright, and tariff cuts if negotiations have to be
postponed until January 1993.
In spite of a consensus that further delay is inevitable, no one is willing
to contemplate outright failure. As Ambassador Bal Krishan Zutshi, India's
long-standing Gatt representative, commented: 'No one can afford to abandon
what has been achieved out of the round so far. Negotiators will come back
sooner or later and settle it.'
Even delay carries with it grave dangers:
Protectionist lobbies in the US in particular have been held at bay largely
because of the promise that trade grievances would be dealt with more
speedily in the Gatt by new trade dispute procedures. If the round is put on
hold, it will be hard for President Bush's administration to resist demands
for unilateral action against 'unfair trade'. June 1 is a critical date, on
which a two-year US Farm Bill expires. With it, commitments not to match EC
farm export subsidies on a tit-for-tat basis also expire. In fact, the US
administration will face a formal commitment to relaunch a subsidy war with
the EC on exports of farm products. Such action would almost certainly
trigger retaliation. The multi-fibre arrangement which controls world trade
in textiles and garments expires in December. With no Uruguay Round in
place, awkward renegotiation of rules for trade in textiles and garments
would be needed.
Long-sought improvements in Gatt's rules for settling trade disputes would
be held up. Countries frustrated with how Gatt currently deals with trade
disputes - the US foremost among them - may resort to bilateral sanctions,
which again could trigger retaliation.
Delay would also hamper attempts to address new problems - such as
reconciling free-trade principles with environmental concerns, and bringing
competition policy under the rubrick of the Gatt.
There is a growing feeling among critics that it is time for the world's
leading industrial powers to set an example to newly liberalising countries
in the Third World. They should set aside narrow domestic political
considerations in favour of improving the world trading system.
An old joke about Moses might prove instructive. He was sent by the
Israelites to the top of Mount Sinai to negotiate with God over the
commandments. He came down exhausted after 10 days with a list of 310
commandments. The Israelites angrily sent him back to negotiate a better
deal. Three more days passed before a gaunt Moses reappeared: 'I have good
news, and bad news,' he said: 'The good news is I've got the list down to
10. The bad news is that adultery is still in.'
For negotiators in Geneva struggling with ennui and exhaustion after six
years of non-stop haggling, such a spirit of compromise could be timely.

FT  02 APR 92 / Leading Article: Science matters
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR A professional group, scientists show extraordinary hostility to the UK
government. The election campaign has brought out the antagonism  - in
letters to newspapers from senior researchers lamenting the decline in
British R&amp;D, and in well-attended election meetings held by Save British
Science, a lobby group.
The researchers are justifiably angry with the Conservative party's
selective use of statistics to show real growth in government funding of
basic science. The five research councils have indeed increased spending by
24 per cent since 1979, but this has been offset by a decline in public
support for research from other sources.
Foreign scientists are also concerned about the erosion of UK public
investment in research. On a visit to London last month, Mr Allan Bromley,
President Bush's science adviser, deplored the planned closure of Daresbury
Nuclear Structure Facility in Cheshire, which he said 'has established an
absolutely enviable reputation for excellence'.
Although industrial R&amp;D has increased since 1979, it has not made up for the
shortfall in government R&amp;D. The UK was the only OECD country in which the
percentage of GDP devoted to civil R&amp;D declined during the 1980s.
The decline in British science may reflect the fact that no Conservative
politicians really care about research. Margaret Thatcher once worked as a
research chemist, but her governments had no champion of science and
technology like Heinz Riesenhuber in Germany or Henri Curien in France.
The complaints of the scientists, who are not traditionally a vocal lobby
group, cannot be dismissed merely as self-interested pleading. The health of
science matters for several reasons. As the Conservative election manifesto
says, research 'enriches the quality of our lives and provides the feedstock
of innovation'.
An important aspect of science is cultural, even romantic. This is rooted in
the origins of the subject as natural philosophy. Unfortunately, some of the
questions asked by today's natural philosophers - for example 'how did the
Universe start and how will it end?' - cannot be answered without investing
billions of pounds in atom-smashers and astronomical observatories. The UK,
as a culturally advanced nation, must pay for its share of international
facilities such as Cern, the European centre for particle physics.
But politicians inevitably see science mainly as a source of inventions for
industry. There is a link between a nation's scientific excellence and
industrial success, though it operates on a timescale of decades. Japan
should not be seen as a counter-example - for several years Japanese
industry and government have been investing heavily in research as the
foundation for industrial pre-eminence in the next century.
Science deserves better treatment from the next government. And the physical
sciences - already in worse shape than biomedical research and vulnerable to
the run-down in defence R&amp;D - will need particular attention.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA's reformers have been understandably frustrated by the slow response
of the west to their pleas for help; but yesterday's package was worth
waiting for. Western money alone cannot solve the economic problems that the
ex-Soviet states are facing. But they have little chance of solving these
problems without it.
What the Russian government has wanted most in recent weeks has been a
positive signal of support from the west. The proposed Dollars 18bn package
of aid and trade credits and a further Dollars 6bn stabilisation fund
together provide an unexpectedly generous show of support. They will prove
an invaluable weapon for Mr Boris Yeltsin and his allies in their efforts to
prevent their reforms being derailed by the growing internal opposition.
But Mr Yeltsin needs more than promises. While the western governments, and
particularly the US, have been agonising over how to respond to cries for
support, the economic situation in Russia has been deteriorating rapidly. In
the weeks following the January price liberalisation, it appeared that
inflation had been brought under control. But monetary policy has been
relaxed in recent weeks and inflation is rising.
Maintaining the momentum of reform is essential. The next phase of
liberalisation, planned for the end of April, will free almost all prices,
including energy prices. The impact on living standards will be severe. But
the pain will be even greater if the current, grossly-undervalued exchange
rate, continues to depress real wages.
To attempt this next phase of liberalisation without first putting the
stabilisation fund in place would be foolhardy. Unless the rouble is first
stabilised at a more realistic rate, the likely outcome of raising prices
will be an offseting rise in wages and a wage-price spiral. The group of
seven industrialised countries must deliver on its stabilisation fund pledge
by the begining of May, if not earlier.
In short, the G7 cannot afford to wait for Russia's full IMF membership to
be approved. The G7 is quite right to require IMF approval for the Russian
stabilisation plan. Moreover, IMF officials must be in place to monitor its
implementation from the outset. But to delay stabilisation support until
June or even later would be both damaging and unnecessary.
A well monitored macroeconomic stabilisation programme is only part of the
solution to Russia's economic mess. Aid should be conditional on a rapid and
radical reform of the tax system and a greater effort to speed the
privatisation programme. Even then, the collapse of the Russian economy will
not be checked until intra-republican trade is revived. Autarky is not
economically viable, for Russia or any of the other republics; but the lack
of co-operation among the republics remains a formidable obstacle to reform.

FT  02 APR 92 / Leading Article: Airbus deal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE IMMEDIATE verdict on yesterday's settlement of the long-running dispute
between the US and the European Community over Airbus financing is that it
is a triumph for good sense. The longer-term question is how far it will
succeed in its aim of preventing similar trade rows from breaking out again
in the future.
In the end, the agreement stemmed from the realisation that neither side
could afford to pursue brinkmanship to its conclusion. So dependent is the
aircraft industry of each on the other's market that both would have
suffered unacceptably heavy damage had the dispute degenerated into an
all-out trade war. That is encouraging at a time when the Uruguay Round
trade negotiations hang in the balance: at the least, it suggests that
should the Round fail, countries would think again before plunging into
unilateralism.
In this instance, the concessions by both sides seem about equally balanced.
Direct government support for existing Airbus programmes will be allowed to
continue, but aid for future projects will be limited to about 30 per cent
of total cost - lower than Brussels wanted, but higher than Washington had
demanded. The US, meanwhile, has acknowledged for the first time that its
commercial aircraft makers benefit indirectly from government spending on
defence and space projects and has agreed to limits on such aid.
Though full details of the agreement have yet to be disclosed - and ratified
by governments - it is clear that it will only work if the parties involved
are prepared to co-operate in good faith in its implementation. In
particular, that will depend on the US and the EC disclosing far more
information about the financing of commercial aircraft programmes than they
have so far done.
It is also vitally important that the agreement be enshrined in the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. First, because an independent mechanism is
needed to adjudicate disputes. Second, because any international concordat
on government subsidies will be short-lived unless it is also subscribed to
by other countries, notably Japan and South Korea, with ambitions to develop
commercial aircraft industries.
Nonetheless, there is a limit to what even the most carefully-crafted system
of multilateral guidelines can achieve in an industry which involves immense
risks, brutal competition and huge investments of cash and national
prestige. With so much at stake, there will always be a temptation for
governments and producers to seek advantage by bending the rules if they
think they can.
In the last analysis, countries' crude self-interest is the most effective
discipline. The real lesson of yesterday's agreement is that though
nationalism may still colour the politics of commercial aerospace, its
economics are increasingly driven by the growing international
inter-dependence between producers and customers. The continuing
globalisation of the industry is the best guarantee of fair trade in the
future.

When the state executes people for murder ('Pre-meditated killing is wrong
and so, after much deliberation, we are going to kill you'), mistakes will
be made and innocent people put to death. That alone is reason to abjure
capital punishment, as the notorious A6 murder case demonstrates.
True Stories begins a new series (10.00 C4) by reconsidering the execution
of James Hanratty for the murder of Michael Gregsten in 1962. Nobody who has
read Paul Foot's excellent book 'Who Killed Hanratty?' will need convincing,
but it is as well to keep reminding ourselves that we, society, hanged the
wrong man.
Another series which has done outstanding work in revealing miscarriages of
justice, and not only in the courts, is Taking Liberties, which returns to
BBC2 (8.00). Today David Jessel reports on the dangers of general
anaesthetics at the dentist's. There have been warnings, it seems, for 25
years, yet people, mostly young, go on dying. Also back with a fresh batch
is Harry Enfield's Television Programme (9.00 BBC2), the series in which the
'Loadsamoney' comedian has established a whole raft of new comedy
characters.

FT  02 APR 92 / Arts: Adelaide Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lithuanian actors throwing sugar lumps around the stage; Japanese actresses
ensnaring each other with scarlet cords; Australians gang-banging an
Aboriginal girl - it must be an arts festival. Indeed it is, and still one
of the leading runners in an over-crowded field.
The Adelaide Festival has been around long enough to get most things right.
It happens every two years, which allows time for anticipation; it changes
its director each festival, which stimulates fresh ideas; it is held in a
city with a reputation for puritanism, which encourages creative conflict;
and it takes place in a beautiful place in late summer, which ensures the
enthusiastic co-operation of international artists.
This year's director, Rob Brookman, reckons that Adelaide has the edge over
Edinburgh. It is certainly larger - a turnover of ADollars 8.5m finances 700
performances - than its northern rival, but it does not quite have the same
buzz.
Its fringe is smaller and less effervescent, and Adelaide does not attract
the street performers, the specialist book, film, and television festivals
running in tandem, the foreign tourists, the excesses which make Edinburgh
supreme.
But on three successive nights in Adelaide I saw plays which for intensity
and variety could not be matched anywhere in the world.
The Square, by the State Theatre of Lithuania, seems at first to be a
caricature of East European drama. It is set in a Gulag, features an
unnamed, uncharged, prisoner, and even has a goose-stepping, klaxon-honking
guard to dictate the stage. Then there is the girl, who perhaps exists in
his fantasy, whom he somehow communicates with, who eventually comes to
visit him.
There is thankfully little respect for reality in Woven Hell by the Japanese
writer Rio Kishida, which pursues a fascinating path between the arcane
ritual of Noh and Kubuki and modern Japanese drama which has drunk deeply
from western Expressionism.
From the mesmerising music, through the darkness penetrated by spotlights on
the actors faces, with poetic repetetive chanting, a tale of revenge is
enacted in another prison, this time a silk factory where young women are
forced to weave by day and entertain men by night. Into this mysterious
dungeon wanders Cocoon, a young women clutching a knotted cord. Undo the
knots and you regain your memory, and control over your life.
Cocoon is seeking her mother among the spinners, but as she manages to
unravel the cord she remembers that her mission is to kill her mother in
revenge for the murder of Cocoon's lover.
The linguistic metaphors may be lost on westerners, although the plangent
music and knell like voices convey enough symbolic meaning, but the visual
metaphors are very powerful as Cocoon offers the cord to the trapped and
numbed women.
Eventually it is grasped by her mother, who, as Cocoon pulls her
remorselessly towards her, remembers her crime. The cord becomes a cats
cradle that suffocates the mother, and eventually the guards, as the women
recover their histories and their freedom.
There is no interval either in funerals &amp; CIRCUSES: instead the audience is
treated to a talent contest complete with raffle. This is a good example of
the Australian love of walkabout, a peripatetic performance of a play by the
aboriginal Roger Bennett to music by Paul Kelly, reckoned to be Australia's
leading contemporary singer-songwriter.
We start at the bar of the tiny Theatre 62 then jostle into a room decked
out as a chapel where Ben Bean, played by Bennett, is to marry his young,
white girlfriend, much to the disgust of her policeman father and the other
residents of a small outback town. Then it is back to the main auditorium.
What follows is a dissection of Australian society you don't see on the
television soaps: the racial conflict on the edge of the bush with the
aboriginals very much the outsiders.
While the whites enjoy their circuses, the blacks put all their life into
funerals as the body of a murdered youth is carried, with ritualistic
moaning, back to the 'chapel' for another ceremony. Some of the performances
were soft; the plot was pretty predictable (very black and white), but the
emotions underlying the piece obviously gripped the players and the
audience.
All three plays should travel the world. They demonstrate Adelaide's success
in delving below 'high art', capturing ground from the so called 'Fringe'.
Perhaps in reaction the Fringe here goes totally ape, forming a boisterous,
convivial, non-stop party, based around the Lions Arts centre. Here you find
familiar Edinburgh faces such as Dillie Keane, Lily Savage, and Stomp, along
with acts preparing for Edinburgh like Syudney Front, a performance art
troupe which threatened to go beyond the limit but actually stayed very
structured. OK, so in its version of Don Juan, an actor stands naked while
an actress powders and primps his penis while an actress strips off
beseeching someone to ravish her.
But all the time the audience is shepherded carefully around the acting
space and the barrier between performers and punters is never bridged. When
a member of the audience is persuaded to strip naked and stand stationary
for two minutes while the cast disappear for a break the feeling of control
becomes paramount. The confined space, the darkness, the physicality of the
players, promise tension but, performed against a distorted recording of
Mozart's Don Giovanni, what begins as a threatening experience degenerates
into an organised walk.

The military are to be drafted in to make the trains run on time on the
troubled Docklands Light Railway. Ownership of the notoriously unre-liable
DLR was yesterday transferred from London Transport to the London Docklands
Development Corporation following lobbying by Olympia and York, the
beleaguered developers of the huge Canary Wharf office complex.
The new chairman of the DLR, Sir Peter Levene, has turned to the ministry of
defence where he was chief of defence procurement from 1985-91 for three of
four top managers.
Major-General Malcolm Hutchinson becomes managing director, after a 'long
and distinguished career in defence procurement'. Currently a member of the
Defence Prospect Team, much of his career was spent in REME, the army's
engineering corps. He was director of procurement strategy at the MoD from
1986-88 and vice master-general of the ordnance from 1988-90. President of
the Institute of Electronics and Electrical Incorporated Engineers,
Major-General Hutchinson is a member of the council of presidents steering
group for the unification of the engineering profession.
The new planning director also comes from the MoD; Stephen French is to be
seconded from his work in project finance, public procurement and strategic
planning.
The third board member to be appointed yesterday comes from United
Scientific Holdings which Sir Peter Levene headed before moving to the MoD.
Anthony Jackson, finance director at USH, will be the new finance director.
Another secondee from the defence department, Stephen Gibbs, will head the
projects organisation. Gibbs is currently a scientific adviser to the army
on research and technology programmes under the title of director science
for land systems.
His experience in radar, communications systems, guided weapons and
'stealth' bombers will no doubt be invaluable in sorting out the DLR's
operating problems, which appear to be largely technical rather than
manag-erial.

FT  02 APR 92 / Business Law: Lessons from Brent Walker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN MAPLES, PHILIP BULLEY and DAVE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The complex restructuring of the Brent Walker leisure group over the last 17
months was the biggest corporate rescue ever undertaken in the UK.
Little more than 18 months go, Brent Walker employed more than 14,000 people
and had an annual turnover of Pounds 1.76bn.
The forces that almost drove Brent Walker into receivership are easy to spot
with hindsight - the 'deal too far' to acquire the William Hill betting
shops, over-exposure to the property sector and the impact of rapidly rising
interest rates on its debt built up to finance acquisitions in good times.
Emergency measures to deal with the inevitable liquidity crunch - raising
Pounds 103m by a bond issue, the use of off-balance-sheet financing
techniques and concentrating business operations on the generation of
short-term cash - side-tracked and exhausted Brent Walker's management. They
had only known good times and the rapid change in the company's fortunes
quickly turned their apprehension into demoralisation.
The problems facing lead bank Standard Chartered and its advisers were
quickly identified. These are, to varying degrees, present in most
restructurings of substantial UK corporations:
the need to tackle public debt with the attendant onerous requirements for
public communication and no certainty that the rescue will ultimately
succeed;
the need to assess the qualities of existing management, with the
consequence that incumbents may have to move aside in favour of a new team
better able to manage a crisis;
the selection of a cohesive steering committee of banks which can assess at
an early stage the full extent of the problems (not always easy where the
patient's record-keeping has not been up to scratch) and determine whether
the subject of the rescue is a suitable case for treatment or whether some
form of insolvency procedure is inevitable. Brent Walker is proof of the
belief common among lenders that a controlled wind-down of unprofitable
businesses outside the insolvency framework is to be preferred to a
receivership or administration where the lenders' direct control would be
curtailed;
the need for a breathing space which will allow for the preparation of a
business plan and during which the patient will almost certainly require
feeding with new money just to maintain the status quo. This is often the
price banks have to pay in order to obtain the security required to put them
at the top of the creditor tree.
All of these issues had to be confronted in Brent Walker, but, in addition,
there were four specific business problems that had to be resolved:
the Pounds 50m due to Grand Metropolitan from Brent Walker arising from the
original purchase of William Hill;
an unwinding of the ill-fated Walker Power joint venture that owned, among
other things, the Trocadero in Piccadilly, London;
Brent Walker's wish to exploit opportunities presented by the regulatory
changes to be introduced in the UK pubs sector. It proposed to enter into a
complicated deal with Allied Breweries for the leasing of 734 pubs to
Pubmaster Limited. The Brent Walker lenders were, therefore, faced with the
unusual problem in a rescue of the patient wishing to develop a core
business while in financial difficulties).
the bond holders who had put up Pounds 103m in 1990.
All this was being handled against a background in which the Bank of England
was playing a less central role than formerly, relying to a much greater
degree on the experience which had been built up among UK clearing bankers
and the greater awareness among bankers in the London market of the need to
follow 'the London Rules'.
The principal novel feature of the Brent Walker refinancing strategy was
that it had to be agreed in stages. With so many interested parties with
entirely separate concerns, it was impossible for Brent Walker to satisfy
them all at the same time.
Standard Chartered's masterstroke was to tackle the problems one at a time.
Everyone was anxious to ensure that no stone was left unturned, no potential
for a negligence action left open. Despite this anxiety, lawyers not usually
attuned to the flexibility needed to enable such a step-by-step approach to
succeed were able to do so on this occasion.
It became vital in the process to limit the areas which had to be returned
to on completion at a later stage. It was essential that only the chief
commercial points were understood to be agreed at any stage, and yet that it
was also understood that the parties had agreed to agree the minor issues
without revisiting major ones.
The process has taken 17 months, while at the same time repairing the
enormous damage of the final battle by Brent Walker for survival in
something like its original form. The company has undergone a Serious Fraud
Office investigation and even managed to implement some of the strategies
for the future, such as the deal with Allied Lyons. This deal is itself a
first for a company still on its back.
The banks led by Standard Chartered finally agreed to waive their previous
requirement that a settlement be reached with Grand Metropolitan prior to
completion of the restructuring. The decision was, in effect, to let
sleeping dogs lie provided that the ultimate downside could be assessed and
contained. This exemplifies another classic lesson in rescues.
One of the last knots was unravelled when Power Corporation acquired the
Walker part of the Trocadero and released Brent Walker from its obligations
to Walker Power.
The Brent Walker Group has at least until March 1994 to jump its next
hurdle, which is the possible refinancing of the William Hill Group.
At the beginning of a rescue, a company's management are exhausted. They
have already fought a battle to preserve the company's business and lost.
The overriding imperative of those involved in a rescue is to put the
company into a position where it can resume operations on a realistic basis.
All else must be subordinated to this purpose. It is the touchstone against
which solutions to every problem must be tested. Any solution which
endangers this paramount requirement must be discharged. Experience of
rescues, large and small, shows that the two most important ingredients of a
rescue are likely to be the agreement of the creditors to hold the ring and
a change at the company's helm.
Chairmen and chief executives will normally insist that they are the ones to
lead the company to better things and it is almost inevitable that, other
things being equal, they will be given that chance. Sadly, the record of
rescues shows that they were usually wrong to have tried. In this case, the
chairman and chief executive voluntarily agreed to relinquish the chair to
Lord Kindersley.
From a legal point of view, the plan which had been agreed to many months
before could not be implemented until this week. But that was never
important. As all discussion inevitably took place under the shadow of the
grim reaper of commercial endeavour it was more important that everyone
understood at the relevant stage what they would eventually be expected to
agree.
Perhaps the last word should be left with Lord Kindersley who concluded his
latest circular letter to the group's shareholders by saying of the
restructuring: 'It would have been a phenomenal achievement at any time, but
it is little short of miraculous against the background of the deepest and
longest recession of post-war history.'

<TEXT>
Steven Gerard, the new chief executive of Mountleigh, is used to the
problems of over-borrowed companies - but from the other side of the desk.
His experience stems from his stint as Citibank's senior managing director
responsible for all credit, portfolio and risk management in Europe, North
America, Japan and Australia. But the strong link between Mountleigh and
Citibank - one of its lead banks - did not influence Gerard's decision,
according to Mountleigh.
Gerard sees Mountleigh as a 'company with significant economic value which
is hampered by the well-documented problems in the property market and an
inappropriate debt structure'. Indeed, Mountleigh has had a turbulent ride
over the past few years as excessive borrowings and difficulties in making
property sales hindered its ambitious plans. A Pounds 96m rescue rights
issue last year sparked controversy because of its unconventional
underwriting structure.
Gerard aims to implement a 'strategically focused operating and financial
plan which will be satisfactory to all creditors and which will result in
maximising value for shareholders'. It would include unlocking the value in
its property assets and in Galerias, the Spanish department stores.
Now 46, Gerard joined Citibank in 1976 from the American stock exchange
where he headed the securities division. At Citibank, he was also head of
the national corporate finance division, head of the institutional recovery
management group and national head of the leverage capital division.

Johnny Pierre Nicholas Mengers, the colourful pony-tailed chairman of DAKS
Simpson, has left the Piccadilly clothing store after 40 years' service. His
departure comes just over a year after Simpson's was bought by Sankyo Seiko,
the Japanese clothing group.
Mengers was due to retire on reaching 60 next year and his early departure
fuelled speculation that there had been some friction between him and the
Japanese shareholders. The company yesterday played down the suggestion and
said Sankyo Seiko had lived by its promise at the time of the takeover
largely to preserve the autonomy of the British management.
Mengers was yesterday unavailable for comment. No announcement has been made
about his successor.
*****
Ralph Browning, the UK-based chairman of REMY &amp; Associes until its merger
with Pavis last December, has retired from his executive responsibilities
with the group. He will remain a director on the main Remy Cointreau board.

FT  02 APR 92 / Technology: Smokers sticking to nicotine patch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR and CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Federal health experts in the US estimate that 1,000 Americans die each day
of smoking-related diseases. According to a former surgeon general, the
nation's 50m regular cigarette smokers are caught in the grip of an
addiction more powerful than heroin. Nicotine patches attached to the upper
arm are the latest candidate for a miracle cure.
Unaided, fewer than 4 per cent of smokers kick the habit, according to some
estimates. The advent of hypnotism, nicotine-impregnated chewing gum,
acupuncture and behaviour-modification therapy have improved the odds, but
most would-be ex-smokers still fail.
Nicotine patches, which have been on the market for less than four months,
are selling almost as quickly as they can be made. Alza, which makes the
Nicoderm patch, said its plant has been operating 24 hours-a-day, seven
days-a-week since January to meet demand. In only two and a half months
Nicoderm chalked up Dollars 60m (Pounds 35m) in sales. 'We knew that there
would be a strong reaction,' a company spokeswoman said, 'but we did not
expect such amazing demand for the product.'
The technology behind patches is young, but not new. A patch for motion
sickness has been available in the US since 1981. The product looks like an
ordinary sticking plaster. It usually has a reservoir to hold the drug,
which enters the bloodstream by permeating the skin at a regulated rate.
With traditional tablet medications the drug quickly passes from the
intestine to the liver, where enzymes often digest most of the medication
before it has had a chance to work. As a result, tablets often contain high
concentrations of medicine. Drugs administered through a patch reach the
liver at a slower rate, after they have already started to work.
Consequently, lower doses can be administered, generally with fewer
side-effects.
While nicotine is the addictive ingredient in cigarettes, the biggest risks
are associated with the nitrosamines, tars and other particulates unleashed
when a cigarette is lit.
By providing smokers with nicotine in a less toxic form the patches give
smokers time to change their behaviour and give up cigarettes without
suffering the irritability, lack of concentration and other symptoms of
nicotine withdrawal.
The overriding advantage of patches over nicotine-impregnated chewing gum is
that they are easier to use. While gum allows patients to regulate the
nicotine intake, in practice many people trying to give up tend to chew gum
maniacally, releasing too much nicotine too quickly and making themselves
ill.
The Food &amp; Drug Administration has approved three nicotine patches for
prescription sales - Habitrol marketed by Ciba Geigy, Nicoderm by Marion
Merril Dow and ProStep marketed by American Cyanamid's Lederle unit. A
fourth patch, to be marketed by Warner Lambert, is waiting for approval.
The main difference between the competing patches is the mechanism for
controlling entry into the bloodstream. Some, like Nicoderm, have a special
membrane which controls the flow of nicotine. Others use the skin itself to
control the drug's flow into the bloodstream. The doses also differ; ProStep
comes in one strength only, while Nicoderm and Habitrol offer patches with
increasingly reduced doses.
The patches seem to be effective. A study of Nicoderm's product, presented
last December in the Journal of the American Medical Association, showed
that it had a six-week success rate of 61 per cent compared with 27 per cent
for the placebo.
After six months, 25 per cent of the patients originally treated with
patches were still not smoking compared with 11 per cent of the placebo
group. The patches work best for heavy smokers and are not recommended for
those who smoke less than one pack a day.
They are also most effective in conjunction with behaviour-modification
therapy. ProStep offers free phone therapy from smoking-cessation experts;
Lederle has offered to reimburse pharmacists for time spent educating
patients.
Stephen Rennard, one of the chief investigators in the transdermal nicotine
study group, is enthusiastic about patches as a means of nicotine
replacement, but cautions that 'this won't cure everybody'.
DynaGen, a Massachusetts biotechnology company, is starting clinical trials
of an injectable non-nicotine material called NicErase, which it claims will
do the same job as the patches. It 'eliminates the need for the harmful and
addictive nicotine,' says Indu Muni, DynaGen president.

FT  02 APR 92 / Technology: Clash of the titans - The software battle
heating up between IBM and Microsoft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two titans of the computer industry are gearing up for a global marketing
battle. With the launch this week of a revamped version of OS/2,
International Business Machines is taking on Microsoft in a struggle to
wrest control of PC operating systems from the software leader.
For once, IBM is in the role of challenger. Microsoft currently holds a
monopoly in the market for the programs that control the basic functions of
a personal computer.
Ironically, it was IBM's choice of Microsoft's Dos operating system in the
early 1980s that set the software company on a growth path. Almost every
IBM-compatible personal computer in the world now comes equipped with Dos.
Microsoft reaffirmed its position as the prime supplier of PC systems
software with 'Windows 3.0', a hugely successful program that works with Dos
to give IBM-compatible PCs ease-of-use features similar to the Apple
Macintosh. It also helped develop IBM's OS/2, an easy-to-use operating
system launched in 1987 which, to IBM's chagrin, failed to gain momentum as
the successor to Dos.
Microsoft claims to have sold 10m copies of Windows 3.0 since its
introduction in June 1990. What is more, Microsoft will next week begin
shipments of an upgraded version, called Windows 3.1, amid a barrage of
advertising.
On the face of it, IBM seems to be attempting the impossible; unseating
Microsoft from its entrenched position as the dominant worldwide supplier of
PC systems software. Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman, dismisses OS/2 as a
weak challenger. He says Microsoft will sell at least 1m copies of Windows
3.1 over the next month.
Yet being the underdog seems to have energised IBM. The computer giant is
arming all of its 344,000 worldwide employees with promotional materials and
asking them to proselytize friends and acquaintances. IBM will also unleash
a multi-million dollar advertising campaign this month and have its top PC
executives campaigning like US presidential candidates.
Amid all of this hype and hoopla, personal computer users will be faced with
confusing claims and counterclaims making it difficult to determine the
merits of each of the competing programs, or whether indeed they need
either.
The decision is made more difficult by the fact that OS/2 and Windows at
first glance look remarkably alike. Both present the personal computer user
with a graphical interface; a screen with pictorial 'icons' that represent
functions and applications that can be executed with the click of a button
on a computer 'mouse'. Both also have 'pull-down menus' offering the user a
choice of actions.
But the true advantages of this new generation of personal computer
operating systems lie in their ability to tap the power of the
high-performance microprocessors that drive the latest models of PCs.
With either OS/2 or Windows it becomes possible to run more than one
application simultaneously. This 'multitasking' capability maps the
functions of a personal computer more closely to the way that people work.
Thus, for example, you might be printing out the results of a spreadsheet
analysis while writing a cover letter to go with it and glancing at an
incoming facsimile message at the same time.
'OS/2 will enable you to unleash all of the power trapped inside your
personal computer,' James Cannavino, president of IBM's personal systems
division, promises. But multitasking is not unique to OS/2, it is also an
important feature of Windows. Where the differences lie is in the degree of
difficulty that users face in configuring a collection of programs to
perform multiple applications simultaneously.
With Windows, that depends to a large extent upon whether the applications
programs are designed specifically for Windows, or whether they are older,
but perhaps familiar, Dos applications. IBM claims that OS/2 will run
applications programs designed for Dos, or Windows, or OS/2 with equal ease.
Another differentiating factor is hardware requirements. For OS/2, IBM
recommends a 386 or more powerful microprocessor, with at least four or
preferably eight Mbytes of internal memory, and an 80 Mbyte hard disk drive.
About half of the personal computers sold this year, or about 10m machines,
will meet these specifications, IBM estimates. Of the installed base of
personal computers, another 10m-20m are capable of running OS/2 according to
industry estimates.
Windows will run on lower-cost 286-based personal computers with 2Mbytes of
memory. However, the operating system performs best on a 386 with about
4Mbytes of memory. For both operating systems, the minimum hardware
requirements depend to a great extent upon how many applications are used
and the memory requirements of those programs.
For IBM, any operating system that requires users to upgrade their hardware
presents an opportunity for increased hardware sales. 'I believe that as the
industry moves forward it will provide an opportunity for all hardware
vendors to make PCs richer and in that environment IBM will do very well,'
Cannavino acknowledges.
Indeed, the forthcoming operating systems market battle bodes well for the
entire personal computer industry, promises to boost stagnant personal
computer sales.
The market battle between IBM and Microsoft will also, however, present
personal computer users with software bargains. IBM will offer its OS/2 in
the US for Dollars 139 to first-time buyers, or Dollars 99 to current Dos
users and Dollars 49 to users of Microsoft Windows 3.0.
Microsoft's Windows 3.1 upgrade price is Dollars 50. The true costs of
converting to either of the new operating systems will, however, include the
price of memory upgrades, if needed. To take full advantage of the systems
software, users may also decide to upgrade to Windows or OS/2 versions of
applications programs.
Another consideration for personal computer users is the anticipated
introduction later this year of 'Windows NT', yet another new Microsoft
operating system that will be a true competitor with OS/2. Only with its
'NT' version of Windows will Microsoft match OS/2's ability to tap the
32-bit processing power of the Intel 486 microprocessor that powers the
latest generation of personal computers.
While Microsoft can build upon its past success with Windows 3.0, IBM must
recover from the dismal failure of earlier versions of OS/2. Even IBM cannot
afford to lose such a high-profile marketing battle.
Why then is the computer giant risking its reputation upon a personal
computer program that will surely not reap high profits? The answer lies in
IBM's determination to find ways to differentiate its personal computers,
which currently represent about half of the computer giant's revenues, from
the myriad of 'clones' that have transformed the personal computer business
into a price-driven 'commodity' market. The company that controls the
systems software will to a large extent determine the future direction of
the entire PC industry.

FT  02 APR 92 / Technology: Seizing virtual reality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few subjects in the computing world have generated more hyperbole than
virtual reality.
Most of the excitement has revolved around so-called immersive VR in which
the human subject interacts with a computer-generated imaginary world via a
special headset with an internal display screen and a 'dataglove'.
In this form VR is rather like an exotic arcade game played on a
personalised simulator which 'tricks' the brain into thinking it is in the
'virtual world'.
But immersive VR has serious drawbacks, not least the fact that using the
equipment for more than a very short time generates a type of nausea dubbed
'simulator sickness'.
Of more immediate practical interest is the appearance of desktop VR systems
which will run on ordinary PCs equipped with standard high-resolution
screens. These systems have many potential applications in design work,
medicine, remote handling, and training - as well as for entertainment.
One indication that VR is moving out of the laboratory and into the world of
real applications is that public conferences and exhibitions are beginning
to be held on the subject. The latest, organised by Meckler, a conference
and exhibition organiser on information technology, began in London
yesterday.
The two-day meeting, designed to examine the impact and applications of VR,
is covering a wide range of topics including the use of VR in mental
therapy, in the treatment of phobias for example. This subject is being
explored by Peter Ward, director of the information modelling programme at
Leeds University's School of Medicine.
Other speakers include Myron Krueger, one of VR's founding fathers, and
Robert Stone of the UK National Advanced Robotics Research Centre.
Among the exhibitors at the conference is a UK company called Dimension
which offers a desktop VR system for Pounds 12,057.
The Berkshire-based company supplied one to West Denton School in Newcastle
where the children are experimenting with it as part of a project funded by
the Department of Education.

FT  02 APR 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Serving up chips on
a plate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is relatively easy to promote consumer brand loyalty if the product is
soap powder or a car. But if it is a small, albeit vital, component buried
deep in the guts of a machine, it is much harder.
Intel, the US semiconductor manufacturer, faced exactly this problem when it
decided to promote its microprocessor 'chips' which provide the 'brain
power' for most personal computers.
Last November, Intel launched a campaign aimed at the ordinary customer  -
not the hardware manufacturer - but which advertised a vacant slot deep
inside a computer, rather than the machine itself.
The message Intel was trying to deliver was make sure the computer you buy
has an Intel chip - and a spare Intel socket - inside it.
The television advertisement features a science-fiction 'flight' through the
innards of a computer - filmed using a fish-eye lens inside a real computer
 -ending up at the empty chip slot with a bright neon arrow sign flashing
over it marked 'vacancy.'
The Intel marketing campaign is part of a solution to an unusual problem
faced by Intel - its design engineers roll out new products faster than the
market can absorb them.
Companies, which are the main purchasers of personal computers, usually
write-off their equipment over five years.
But the electronics engineers working for the California-based chip maker,
which controls 85 per cent of the world market for microprocessors, produce
a hot new product in about half that time.
The solution Intel came up with was to offer the user a way to improve the
performance of an existing machine.
Intel told manufacturers who use Intel chips in their computers to build in
a spare chip socket next to the main processor.
The company then launched the Dollars 100m European advertising campaign.
Intel is still analysing the results of the first phase of the campaign but
says the initial response was 'encouraging'. Last month the company unveiled
the 'overdrive' chip which is designed to fill the vacant slot at the start
of March.

FT  02 APR 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Eating seaweed and
submarines - Moves in Tokyo to promote the humble sandwich
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the average Tokyo office worker, lunch is an obento, a lacquered box
with quaint little compartments housing a pile of pickled vegetables, salted
salmon, dried seaweed and a slice of bamboo shoot, with rice and maybe a
fermented bean soup.
The brown-bag luncher does exist, but the humble sandwich has an image
problem, as the fillings are bland and the bread is often too sweet.
However, Suntory, the brewer, and Subway, the US submarine sandwich chain,
last week launched a venture to make the gourmet sandwich socially
acceptable in Japan.
Suntory was inspired by the scent of large profits in a still expanding fast
food market. US chains, including McDonald's and Kentucky Fried Chicken,
have long been catering to changing Japanese tastes, while local competitors
have crowded into the market, including DomDom, MosBurger, Lotteria, Love,
Bikkuri Donkey, and First Kitchen, a burger chain also run by Suntory.
Across the industry, sales grew by an estimated 11 per cent last year, but
profits were only 2.9 per cent higher, reflecting rising personnel and
advertising charges.
The intense competition has prompted companies to experiment with lunch and
evening menus. McDonald's is now running a Chinese dim sum special called
McChao, and the other chains are offering 'healthy burgers' on rice-based
buns, and a burger version of the traditional crumbed pork cutlet.
Suntory's purchase of the Subway franchise followed inadvertent test
marketing of the product in Guam and Hawaii, where Japanese tourists showed
a liking for the submarine sandwiches which, in Tokyo, range from the Cold
Cut Combo at Y690 (Pounds 3) to the Subway Club, with roast beef, turkey,
ham and assorted vegetables, at Y900.
The first of five Subway stores opened last week on a former First Kitchen
site in Akasaka, a central Tokyo office and nightlife district. The
competition is close by, with a McDonald's across the street, four noodle
stores within a minute's walk and a First Kitchen outlet two minutes away.
One of the most controversial points of the fast-food debate is whether
western ingredients need to be tailored to suit the prejudices of the
Japanese palate. Fred Deluca, the founder and president of Subway, which has
about 6,300 franchised outlets internationally, said that the subs served in
Tokyo are exactly the same as would be bought in a New York store.
'We don't want to try to second guess the market. We are selling exactly
what we sell elsewhere. We were pretty confident that Japanese would try the
product and like it.
'Japanese tourists in Hawaii and Guam seemed to like the freshness and the
fact that the sandwich is made in front of you. We have been helped by
McDonald's. They have educated people how to eat with their hands.'
The decor of the Tokyo store is similar to other Subway outlets, although a
standard mural failed to meet Tokyo fire codes. The stores require less
space than a conventional burger restaurant, an important consideration
given Tokyo land prices.
A second reason for embracing the sandwich is that Japan's service sector is
still short of workers and Subway will allow a cut in staff by a third from
a First Kitchen store of the same size.
In the US, Subway stores with a high turnover generally use a
production-line method, with one staff member cutting the bread and others
responsible for meats or lettuce. Low-volume outlets have one staff member
make the sandwich and serve it. However, Jotaro Fujii, president of Subway
Japan and an architect of the 82-restaurant First Kitchen chain, chose the
latter method even though the Akasaka store has a high turnover.
He reasoned that Japanese shoppers like attention. The continuous contact
with one assistant allows a polite greeting and a short conversation during
the making of the sandwich. While the Subway store and the previous First
Kitchen store both serve fast-food, there has been a sharp turnaround in the
ratio of take-aways to eat-in business. At the First Kitchen store, about 60
per cent was eat-in, but for Subway the figure is 25 per cent.
The dual personality of the Akasaka area works in its favour. The lunchtime
office demand is strong, and the district is a famed bar and entertainment
area, creating demand until late into the evening. Apart from displacing the
obento lunch, Fujii would like a submarine sandwich to replace the steamed
rice and raw egg breakfast.
'We are encouraging people to have a sandwich before they start drinking in
the evening, and then to buy a Subway sandwich on the way home. In the
morning, when they are in a hurry, they can eat the sandwich and then go to
work.'

FT  02 APR 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Showman on a magic
carpet ride abroad / A look at how one Indian entrepreneur made his name
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOUSEGO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As India heads down the path of export-led growth, it is running up against
the same problem that beset Japan, Korea and Taiwan in their early years of
expansion - a reputation for shoddily-made, ill-designed goods.
One of the few Indian companies to have succeeded in selling high-quality
products abroad under its own brand name is Shyam Ahuja. A Bombay-based,
family-owned concern that began by making durries (flat woven rugs) it now
sells hand-made furnishing fabrics through more than 80 up-market stores
from New York to Tokyo, Hong Kong, London and Sydney.
When Shyam Ahuja, a flamboyant showman with a taste for self publicity, set
up his own business supplying durries, he aimed at the top of the range:
designers like David Hicks and stores like Ralph Lauren in the US and
Liberty in London. An inveterate dropper of famous people's names, he claims
that Sonia Gandhi, George Bush and Margaret Thatcher own his durries.
Unlike most other Indian companies, he recognised the importance of having
his own brand name, and marketing it hard. He spends three-quarters of the
year travelling abroad, keeping in touch with international tastes, talking
to buyers and making his presence felt at international trade exhibitions.
By selling under his own name - as opposed to most Third World manufacturers
which supply goods to chain stores that market them under their own labels -
Shyam Ahuja has ensured that profit margins are high. His reputation for
quality and design enables him to charge higher prices than other
manufacturers producing similar goods. 'I see what the market can pay,' he
says, admitting in the same breath that his production costs are relatively
low. Retail prices abroad are about four to five times higher than the cost
of a fabric at shipment from India.
Shyam Ahuja claims responsibility for introducing Indian durries to the West
in the 1970s. He took the traditional floor covering and added new designs
and lighter, pastel colours. He also used finer cotton or wall yarn and
ensured it was well finished. He now complains that other Indian
manufacturers flooded the market with poor-quality copies of his designs -
destroying the image of the durrie abroad.
In 1983 he made another breakthrough when Ralph Lauren bought his floor
coverings - but on the basis of designs supplied by Lauren. More recently he
has become restless at manufacturing for another brand name and is anxious
to break the link.
He does not always get it right. He says that Liberty, his main London
outlet, last year told him that sales of pastel colours, which have
symbolised his designs, were plummeting. The result has been a new
collection based on bold reds and using themes from American Indian culture.
The difficulty of producing hand-made products in India is maintaining
quality. Shyam Ahuja reckons that he has 18,000 weavers working for him  -
equivalent to the workforce of a large steel mill. Most work from home and
are paid on piece rates.
The company supplies the weaver with raw materials - cotton, dyes, wool - to
ensure consistency. Of the 250 permanent staff on Shyam Ahuja's payroll, a
large number are involved in inspecting goods at different stages of
manufacture. Shyam Ahuja claims that he rejects 30 per cent of the products
that arrive at his Bombay headquarters.

FT  02 APR 92 / Shake-up at Royal Mail is completed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL MAIL, the letters arm of the Post Office, yesterday put in place the
final pieces of a reorganisation which has cut management and administrative
staff by 3,500 and forced a further 9,000 managers to reapply for their
jobs.
The number of reporting levels between the managing director and the postal
worker delivering letters has been cut from nine to six. Headquarters staff
have been reduced from about 2,000 to 160.
The shake-up will result in annual savings of Pounds 60m to Pounds 70m.
Royal Mail says the savings are a 'secondary spin-off', however, and the
main purpose of the restructuring is to 'sharpen focus on the customer' by
devolving functions and responsibilities to a local level.
The UK's 64 former district head postmasters, for example, were replaced
yesterday by 88 area managers who are responsible for local customer
relations. Nine divisions, each with average turnover of Pounds 300m, have
replaced four territories and 64 districts. Each division is responsible -
'without excessive control from headquarters' - for sales, profit-and-loss
and local customer relations.
The shedding of management jobs has been completed without compulsory
redundancies. The top 1,000 managers have been through an assessment
programme run by Coopers and Lybrand Deloitte, the accountancy and
management consultancy firm. The rest have been assessed at the Post
Office's own management college at Rugby. Some have been demoted without
loss of pay while others have needed training.
Districts under the old structure had operating budgets, but were not
expected to generate revenue. Divisional directors and general managers are
now 'empowered to create profit', says Royal Mail. That could be done by
tailoring new services for local markets and by selling expertise and
innovations to the Post Office's other divisions.

FT  02 APR 92 / Labour silent on cash aid to Jubilee Line
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE LABOUR party yesterday expressed support for extending London
Underground's Jubilee Line to Docklands. But it stopped short of offering to
provide funds if Olympia &amp; York, the property developer, failed to provide
its share of the finance.
O&amp;Y agreed under a proposal announced by the Department of Transport in 1989
to contribute Pounds 400m to the cost of the Pounds 1.3bn project, with the
rest coming from the government. There is also thought to be a smaller
contribution due from British Gas.
Ms Joan Ruddock, a shadow transport minister, said: 'We are not seeking any
variation of the proposals. The plan (for the extension) is there ready to
start. We want O&amp;Y to come up with the money.'
O&amp;Y, which is holding debt-restructuring talks with its banks, failed on
Tuesday to make its first scheduled contribution of Pounds 40m to the
project.
Ms Ruddock would not be drawn on any detailed response to reports that O&amp;Y
and its banks might seek to reduce their contribution to the project - a
move that would almost certainly shift the onus to the Treasury. 'We still
expect Olympia &amp; York or its bankers and British Gas to honour their
financial commitments to this scheme,' Ms Ruddock said. 'Clearly we want to
see whatever is on offer and see how best the contract can be drawn up.'
She added that, if O&amp;Y came up with its share, there was 'no reason why the
extension should no go ahead within the original timetable'.
Last week Mr John Prescott, Labour's senior transport spokesman, said the
project would be thrown into the hands of the public sector because the
private sector had failed to live up to its agreement.
The cautious line adopted by Labour yesterday is based partly on the hope
that O&amp;Y and its bankers will eventually rally round the project because
failure to do so might jeopardise the future of the company's Canary Wharf
development.
Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary and Labour's campaign
co-ordinator for London, said yesterday:
'The growing doubts over the Jubilee Line are only one symptom of the wider
failure of Conservative policy in the nation's capital.'

<TEXT>
A SENIOR Tory figure in the north-west has made a coded attack on
Conservative Central Office over the party's election campaign, Ian Hamilton
Fazey writes.
Mr Andrew Pearce, who is fighting the marginal seat of Ellesmere Port and
Neston, said yesterday that candidates were looking for 'some zing and zap'
from the leadership to turn the campaign. He wanted more vision displayed,
harder attacks on Mr Neil Kinnock and the union card played strongly.
The former Euro-MP also wants Labour's attitude to asylum for refugees
questioned. 'We don't want a great flood of extra immigrants into this
country. I'm very sorry if people are having a hard time in their own
countries, but they are not our problem.'
Mr Pearce refused to directly criticise Central Office, but added: 'Michael
Heseltine has been forgiven for challenging Mrs Thatcher and he should be
used to the full. I also want to see Norman Tebbit and David Mellor savaging
Labour and particularly Kinnock.'

FT  02 APR 92 / Companies more hopeful than Continental counterparts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMALL and medium-sized businesses in the UK are more optimistic about
prospects for profitability than their counterparts elsewhere in Europe,
according to a survey covering five countries, Charles Batchelor writes.
Companies throughout Europe were pessimistic about the general economic
outlook but UK companies were more hopeful than their counterparts in
Germany, France, Italy and Spain. Just over 1,400 companies were polled as
part of the first five-country European Enterprise Index carried out by 3i,
the venture capital company, and the Cranfield School of Management.
The French businesses questioned were the least positive, both about overall
conditions and their own prospects. German confidence in the economic
climate had deteriorated sharply over the preceding six months, but German
companies remained the most confident of those surveyed about their own
future.
In spite of their optimism about profits, British companies were less
hopeful about prospects for increasing sales and recruiting or retaining
employees. British companies' plans for capital investment and for spending
on training and research and development were also less expansive.
Only 15 per cent of British companies questioned said they intended to raise
additional outside finance in the next six months. That compared poorly with
France, where 28 per cent of companies planned fund-raising; Germany with 31
per cent; Italy 38 per cent and Spain 40 per cent.
The survey also showed that wages and prices were expected to increase
across Europe.

FT  02 APR 92 / Election 1992: Most fund chiefs see hung result
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A POLL of City fund managers found that 89 per cent expect the election to
result in a hung parliament. Labour will be the single biggest party,
according to 48 per cent, while 41 per cent think the Conservatives will
have the most seats.
Most - 46 per cent - think the Liberal Democrats have conducted the most
impressive campaign. None consider the Tory campaign the most impressive,
while 30 per cent chose Labour. However, 80 per cent think the Tories have
the best long-term economic programme.
The survey was conducted by Gallup for Smith New Court, the securities
house. The number of people voting by post and proxy is higher than ever
before. About 10 per cent of the population are entitled to vote in this
way, but in no constituency has 5 per cent previously been reached.
Figures compiled by Labour indicate that the 5 per cent figure has been
breached in seven key marginal seats, and suggest that nationwide there are
more than 1.3m postal and proxy voters compared with about 901,000 in 1987.

FT  02 APR 92 / Election 1992: Rumbold campaigns on animal rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANIMAL WELFARE seemed an odd issue for the Conservatives to highlight on a
day when Tory strategists were desperate to close the opinion poll gap on
Labour, but Mrs Angela Rumbold had a go.
The formidable Home Office minister insisted at a London news conference
that the Conservatives had a much better record on animal welfare than any
other party.
Animal welfare is a particularly sensitive issue for the Tories because of
the vehemence of views on bloodsports and factory farming.
Mrs Rumbold pledged a Conservative government would oppose a resumption of
the trade in ivory or elephant products, urge Britain's EC partners to bring
welfare standards up to UK levels, and press for higher EC standards for
keeping battery hens.
She seized on reports that Mr Neil Kinnock, Labour leader, had promised a
ban on foxhunting as 'possibly another instance of Labour being unable to
hold to their manifesto pledges.' The Tories believed the issue was one for
individual conscience.
Dr David Clark, Labour's agriculture spokesman, said later animal welfare
would be a high priority for a Labour government, and measures would include
banning the testing of beauty aids on animals. Mr Simon Hughes, Liberal
Democrat environment spokesman, promised a watchdog body, the Animal
Protection Commission.

FT  02 APR 92 / Election 1992: Shoppers tell parties to get on their
trolleys
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S vote-seeking politicians were yesterday given a comprehensive
thumbs down by that driving force in any election, the blue-rinse brigade of
Sainsbury shoppers.
Trolley-pushing voters in six safe southern Tory seats - Carshalton, Sutton,
Epsom, Horsham, Worthing and Hove - granted John Major a narrow vote of
confidence.
In an exclusive FT poll of blue-clad middle-aged lady shoppers outside
Sainsbury stores there was one overwhelming message to the politicians: head
for the electoral checkout and get it all over with as quickly as possible.
Out of the small but scientifically chosen sample of women shoppers wearing
blue coats or pullovers - two in each constituency - five said they would
vote Conservative, two each gave their allegiance to Labour, the Greens and
the Liberal Democrats, with one saying she would abstain as a protest. Their
overriding comment was of boredom or outrage at the politicians' antics.
Outside Sainsbury's, Wallington, in the Carshalton constituency (majority:
14,409), Mrs Mary Cunningham, in a bright-blue coat, said she was a
traditional Conservative but had hesitated in making up her mind this time
before being pushed back to the Tory camp by fury over Labour's health
broadcast last week. 'I'd like to punch Neil Kinnock on the nose,' she said.
In North Cheam, in the Sutton constituency (majority: 15,718) Mrs Jacqueline
Brown said she would vote Liberal. 'None of them are coming over very well.'
Mrs Ida Cass, wearing turquoise with a mauve tint to her hair, said she was
Green 'because of what they're trying to do for the world.'
In Epsom (majority: 20,761) Mrs Evelyn R, a lifelong Tory in a blue anorak
said that for the first time she would not be voting. She was 'disgusted' by
the Conservative performance. 'Education, employment - you name it, they've
messed it up.' She did not want her name quoted because friends in the Tory
party would think she was 'a renegade'.
In Horsham (majority 23,907) Mrs Doris Whitehead said she would opt for the
Tories but without enthusiasm. 'I can't see it getting any better.' Mrs Dora
Silver would also vote Conservative. 'I'm sick to death of the politicians
on TV. They go on and on and on. But I don't like Mr Kinnock as a man,' she
said.

double

<TEXT>
OVERSEAS orders won by South Korean construction companies more than doubled
during the first three months of this year compared with the corresponding
period last year.
The companies were aided by a very large contract in Singapore. Construction
investment is rising sharply throughout Asia as countries take advantage of
their growing economic strength to improve infrastructure particularly in
transport and water.
As a result the region is one of the fastest growing construction markets in
the world. South Korean construction companies along with the Japanese
provide some of the largest construction companies in Asia.
Figures published yesterday by the Overseas Construction Association of
Korea revealed that South Korean contractors won 16 major international
contracts worth more than Dollars 870m (Pounds 500m) during the first three
months of this year. The value of the work was more than double that won
during the corresponding period last year. Almost 90 per cent of the work by
value was won in Asia.
The largest single contract worth Dollars 622m was for an urban development
project in Singapore won by Hyundai and Ssangyong construction companies,
said the association. Daelim Engineering also won a hydro electric project
in Pakistan worth Dollars 98m.
The association said that South Korean companies expected shortly to win
other large overseas contracts in Asia.
South Korean construction companies which have been strong international
competitors, notably in the Middle East, have traditionally earned much of
their sales overseas.
More recently companies have been concentrating efforts on the domestic
market where construction output, as in other Asian countries, has risen
sharply in recent years. Cement sales, a good indicator of construction
activity, rose by 20 per cent in South Korea last year to 44m tonnes,
equivalent to 1.02m tonnes for each of the country's 43m population - the
highest cement sales per capita in the world, according to the Korea Cement
Industrial Association.

ASEA BROWN BOVERI, the Swiss-Swedish engineering group, has won a Dollars
305m contract to supply equipment for a 650MW combined cycle power plant to
be built in India by a consortium involving Japan's Marubeni and Kawasaki
Heavy Industries. The deal illustrates the growing trend for partnerships
between western power equipment suppliers and Japanese companies to exploit
fast-expanding Asian demand for power generating capacity.
The contract, for a project at Gandhar due to come on stream in 1995, also
illustrates importance of local manufacturing content for western suppliers
in competitive markets.
ABB in Germany will be the main supplier, together with ABB India, of three
GT 13E gas turbines and accompanying steam generator and associated
equipment. Marubeni will supply waste recovery boilers.
The project is funded by Overseas Export Co-operation Finance (OECF), the
Japanese export credit agency.

<TEXT>
JAPAN lifted its long-standing quotas on orange juice imports yesterday, and
Florida citrus officials were on hand to extend their congratulations - and
sales pitches, AP reports from Tokyo.
Japan abolished the quotas under a 1988 trade agreement with the US, opening
the way for free competition in a fast-growing market that Florida officials
estimate will be worth Dollars 1bn by the year 2000.
Japan already is the largest importer of US agricultural products. American
orange juice, most of which comes from Florida, now accounts for about
one-fourth of the Japanese import market, with lower-priced Brazilian juice
accounting for most of the rest.
But Florida citrus officials say the quality of Florida juice is higher, and
this will help them capture a greater share of the market.
Florida juice is in a better position to compete on the basis of quality
rather than price because of a growing preference in Japan for premium 100
per cent juice.

FT  02 APR 92 / World Trade News: Hong Kong airport costs increase 13.8% in
real terms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE estimated cost of Hong Kong's new airport and associated infrastructure
projects has risen by 13.8 per cent in real terms in less than a year, the
Hong Kong government said last night.
The airport, which last July was estimated to cost HKDollars 96.8bn (Pounds
7.2bn), will now cost an estimated HKDollars 112.2bn in March 1991 prices -
the best attempt by the government to quantify the cost of the entire
project. In today's money the value equates to about HKDollars 122bn.
Mr Hamish MacLeod, the colony's financial secretary, said the HKDollars
15.4bn overshoot would not, however, be borne by the Hong Kong taxpayer -
the government's share has remained at HKDollars 59.3bn, implying a fall in
real terms - but will be paid for by private developers and their lenders.
'We are confident that the project costs will be kept under control,' he
said. 'We have put in place a specially designed project management and
cash-limiting cost-control system, and we are also using fixed price lump
sum contracts as far as possible.'
The new estimates were given to Beijing midway through last month. Under the
terms of the airport agreement Britain and China signed last September, the
Chinese government's approval is needed because the project will extend
beyond June 1997, when China resumes sovereignty over Hong Kong.
A speedy approval by the Chinese is being sought by the government so that
it can get on with letting contracts for the airport and airport railway.
China's approval is not thought necessary for the construction of the Tsing
Ma bridge.
Early indications are that the Chinese want more details on the funding of
the project; there are some suggestions that they are concerned about the
cost of the airport railway, although the government is confident it can
allay those concerns.
The railway is the main reason for the cost overrun. The plan calls for a
high speed railway link between the airport - situated on the island of Chek
Lap Kok, north of Lantau Island - and the central district of Hong Kong.
The railway was estimated to cost HKDollars 12.5bn. This estimate has been
raised to HKDollars 22.1bn to take account of station modification, a change
in the location of a depot and the provision of deeper tunnels and
foundations on reclaimed land.
The Mass Transit Railway Corporation will bear responsibility for the
increased costs - the government has in fact cut its proposed equity
injection by HKDollars 800m to HKDollars 3bn - but it is confident that it
will be able to finance the rail link.
The government has vested in the MTRC an unprecedented 60 hectares of land,
around the proposed rail tracks and above stations, for redevelopment. If
the MTRC follows past practice it will develop the land in conjunction with
a property company which will bear the cost of the land's purchase and share
the profits post development.
The MTRC has briefed international banks and credit rating agencies about
the project.

steelmakers
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRUSSELS yesterday warned the US not to use the end of its quantitative
curbs on steel imports to launch anti-dumping and subsidy suits against EC
steelmakers.
Such action would endanger remaining hopes for the EC, the US and more than
20 other steel-producing countries to conclude a Multilateral Steel
Agreement (MSA), disciplining world trade in this commodity. The planned
deadline for an MSA - to replace the expiring 'voluntary restraint
agreements' (VRAs) on steel exports to the US - ran out on Tuesday, but
negotiators have agreed to meet again.
Dumping actions had been used by the US in the past to 'bomb' countries into
agreeing to VRAs, an EC official said. The dollar's weakness against
European currencies has put 'a number of EC steel exporters, particularly
those selling into the American market on long-term contracts, in a
situation of technical dumping' (selling abroad more cheaply than at home),
the official said.
But US companies would have great difficulty proving they had been injured
by imports from the EC, which had fallen back to 5-6m tonnes a year from
their 1989 peak of 7m tonnes, rather than slump in the US, he said. The EC
had so cracked down on state aid to European steelmakers that American
anti-subsidy action, in the form of countervailing duties, might only
succeed in the case of a very few Spanish and Italian companies. For this
reason, Italy is the only EC country to say it would prefer the US to
continue VRAs on steel imports, if the alternative is to let the Washington
trade lawyers loose.
By the time the MSA talks ended on Tuesday, EC officials say negotiators had
agreed on zero tariffs and on a long list of forbidden non-tariff barriers,
with the exception of public procurement restrictions which the US refused
to waive.
Negotiators had also agreed, in principle, to permit state aid to steel
companies for R &amp; D, environment, and plant closure purposes. But the US
refused to exempt such aids from possible anti-subsidy action under its
national trade law.

THE United Nations yesterday strengthened efforts to bring order to
Cambodia, sending Indonesian soldiers to monitor a ceasefire in the centre

troops and police in the next few weeks.
The announcements by Mr Yasushi Akashi, head of the UN Transitional
Authority in Cambodia, and Lt Gen John Sanderson, the commander of UN
forces, were welcomed by diplomats and aid workers.
Fighting since January around Kompong Thom in central Cambodia between
leftist Khmer Rouge guerrillas and the Vietnamese-installed Cambodian
government had raised fears for the future of the peace accord signed in
Paris last year, and for the programme to repatriate 375,000 refugees from
Thailand.
A meeting yesterday of the Supreme National Council, a body which brings
together leaders of the main Cambodian factions agreed that returning
refugees would not be prosecuted.
Officials of the UN High Commission for Refugees, meanwhile, said they would
be allowed to visit Khmer Rouge-controlled territory in Battambang province
for the first time next week to look for suitable land for returnees.

FT  02 APR 92 / Algeria struggles to find new direction: Despite the freeing
of prisoners and prices, clear policies have yet to emerge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY THREE months after the cancellation of Algeria's first multi-party
general election, the country's leaders continue to fly by the seat of their
pants, and without much sense of direction.
This week has seen the freeing of 400 fundamentalist supporters, including
the deputy spokesman of the banned Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), Mr Rabah
Khebir. However, more than 6,300 still languish in harsh desert camps, and
the government has this week dissolved nearly half the 450 town councils won
by the FIS in June 1990.
Algeria's leaders have also announced the freeing of all prices except those
of semolina, flour, milk and bread. This will bring about a big cut in
overall price subsidies.
This follows the unveiling last month of a plan for economic recovery.
However, few outside the country are aware of its contents, let alone its
philosophy. Those who have read the document say it lacks substance.
The government has restored law and order, but continuing assassinations of
security and judiciary personnel suggests that calm may not prevail. Last
month, the clandestine FIS leadership vowed to fight until an election was
held.
They described the seven members of the High Executive Council as a 'handful
of despots'. The council is chaired by Mr Sid Ahmed Ghozali, the prime
minister, but General Khaled Nezzar, the defence minister, is regarded as
the key member. The council seized power after Mr Chadli Bendjedid was
forced out as head of state on January 11.
Between 1965 and 1979, Mr Ghozali did a remarkable job of building the
national oil company, Sonatrach. Today he seems to some to be a prisoner of
his managerial past.
The freeing of prices suggests he may have concluded that a bold policy
aimed at restructuring and probably privatising some of the many inefficient
state companies is unavoidable.
The next few weeks will tell whether Mr Ghozali can rise to a stiff
challenge. Many Algerians and not a few foreign partners of Algeria are
disenchanted with the prime minister. Their feelings appear to be shared by
the 73-year-old Mr Mohamed Boudiaf, brought back in January from 28 years'
exile to chair the ruling council.
It is unlikely that Algerians will trust any leader until the more blatant
cases of corruption and self-enrichment are dealt with. Trials may be a
risky way of going about rebuilding confidence, if only because so many
senior Algerians, civilian and military, have helped themselves. Yet
alongside clearly enunciated reforms, some shock therapy appears
unavoidable. Whether senior army officers would allow it must, however, be
in doubt.
Algeria's room for external financial manoeuvre remains limited but support
has been forthcoming from western countries, most notably Italy and Japan,
and recently France. Commercial arrears have declined dramatically.
But while the government has promoted a more liberal oil exploration and
production policy, which is tempting some international oil companies to
invest, it continues to block some of the bold reforms unveiled in 1989 by
Mr Mouloud Hamrouche, the former prime minister, whose aim was to liberalise
imports of sugar, coffee and dairy products. Algeria pays at least Dollars
1bn a year for such commodities, about a fifth more than necessary, because
of entrenched interests.

LI PENG, the Chinese premier and the man most closely associated with the

Li's insistence that the country's growth rate be held to 6 per cent this
year has been openly criticised in a session of the Chinese parliament, now
meeting in Beijing.
Such criticism is unprecedented for the National People's Congress, whose
3,000 delegates traditionally rubber-stamp government decisions without
question.
An NPC deputy, quoted this week by the official Xinhua news agency, compared
the proposed growth rate with last year's figure of 7 per cent, and said it
was out of tune with the 'spirit of speeding up economic development'.
A campaign to accelerate China's economic restructuring with an infusion of
capitalism was launched by Deng Xiaoping in booming Shenzhen on the Hong
Kong border in January.
The 87-year-old patriarch, no stranger to power struggles with Maoist
ideologues, criticised by name a number of Li's hardline backers who have
dominated the political scene since the military crackdown in Beijing.
Deng's message, blocked by opponents of capitalist-style changes, was kept
out of the leftist-controlled national media until this week when it was
splashed over front pages with full colour pictures of Deng himself.
Lengthy extracts were read on national television and the news carried
footage of Deng in Shenzhen accompanied by one of his daughters.
The media blitz brings Mr Deng's views to the Chinese population for the
first time and marks a turning point in his campaign to outwit his
conservative opponents and a setback for the increasingly isolated Li and
his ageing backers, led by Chen Yun, 86.
Sensing a shift in the political wind, Li has tried to present himself to
the NPC as a reformer. In his government report to the congress he backed
shareholding and reiterated Deng's calls to 'emancipate our minds in reform
and opening to the outside world and absorb what has proved effective in
capitalist countries'.
But he pointedly failed to condemn the leftism which has caused China so
much suffering in the past, and to assert, with Deng, that the greatest
danger to China came from the conservative Marxists rather than rightists
favouring market economics and democracy.
The pro-Beijing Hong Kong newspaper Ta Kung Pao reported NPC delegates
complaining of 'something inadequate' in Li's government work report because
of its failure to address the need for vigilance against leftism.
Ta Kung Pao and reports in Beijing said yesterday the secretariat of the NPC
had added to Li's report a reference to the greater threat being from the
left. It said the words 'Eliminate all interference, be vigilant against the
right but especially guard against the left' were inserted.
Articles are beginning to appear in the Chinese media obliquely aimed at the
prime minister. 'Maybe by ousting one person we can set a new course,' said
the Economic Daily.
Because of his close association with the order to fire on demonstrators in
June 1989, Li is extremely unpopular, and said to be seen by Deng as
unimaginative and mediocre. His five-year tenure of office ends this year.
His future grows more uncertain as the pro-reform forces gather strength in
the run-up to the crucial 14th party congress later this year.
If Mr Li falls, Zhao Ziyang, the part boss sacked after the Tiananmen
crackdown, could be rehabilitated. His economic policies are now moving back
into the ascendant.

FT  02 APR 92 / Current account deficit falls sharply in Australia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S current account deficit for the year to June is likely to
undershoot the budget estimate of ADollars 14bn (Pounds 6.1bn) following
improvement in the last three months.
The seasonally adjusted deficit fell to ADollars 667m in February, from a
revised ADollars 904m in January and ADollars 767m in December, the
government statistical service said. The deficit in November was ADollars
1.6bn.
The seasonally adjusted deficit for the first eight months of the year was
ADollars 7.45bn, suggesting the full year result may be less than ADollars
12bn, compared with ADollars 15.7bn last year.
In headline terms, the deficit for the first eight months was ADollars 8bn,
an improvement of 34 per cent on the same period last year. Merchandise
exports increased by 7 per cent over the period, while merchandise imports
fell by 1 per cent.
Most private economists said the series of good results removed much of the
risk that the end of Australia's 18-month recession would lead to a surge of
imports and a renewed current account crisis. But some felt the improvement
would be short-lived if the economy grows by 4.75 per cent in 1992-93, as
forecast in a government economic statement in February.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Hong Kong government was yesterday forced to cut taxes for middle and
lower income groups in next year's budget after a constitutional crisis had
been threatened.
A chastened Mr Hamish MacLeod, the colony's financial secretary, told Hong
Kong's legislature that if it passed his 1992 budget, he would increase
personal allowances and review personal tax bands in time for implementation
next year.
The Legislative Council voted 36-18 in favour of Mr MacLeod's budget. But
the vote indicated the desire of conservative members not to plunge the
administration into crisis rather than an endorsement of the budget as such.
The fight over the budget is more than about who controls the purse strings
in Hong Kong. Members of the Legislative Council, especially those who were
elected last September rather than appointed, believe they possess a popular
mandate and are demanding more say in policy making.
After the vote both elected and appointed council members vowed to keep up
pressure and said they would vote against a budget proposal to raise
property rates.

FT  02 APR 92 / An IADB in brighter mood: Problems remain, but much has been
achieved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE the region it was formed to serve 33 years ago, the Inter-American
Development Bank (IADB) languished throughout the 1980s. Now, optimism is
high over prospects for the economies of Latin America and over the role
which the bank carved out for itself in the 1990s.
Four years ago, the relevance of the institution to Latin America's deep
economic problems was being questioned. In 1988, its lending fell below
Dollars 2bn: a drop in the ocean compared to the billions of dollars being
transferred out of the region.
The bank's management and its largest shareholder, the US of the Reagan
years, were consistently at loggerheads. It was used by Latin American
governments as a way of rewarding faithful servants with sinecures. As a
result, it was inefficient and ineffective.
The bank, which is preparing for its annual meeting next week in the
Dominican Republic, has not solved all these problems. But it has come a
long way.
The change dates back three years, to the laboriously negotiated capital
increase settled amid much acrimony. This widened the bank's role beyond
that of a traditional project-lender, helping the bank's lending nearly to
triple.
The bank was put at the centre of President Bush's Enterprise for the
Americas initiative, which foresaw increased economic and trade co-operation
between North and South America. The initiative was seized upon with
enthusiasm (which appeared to bemuse the US) by many Latin American
governments, which saw the end of superpower rivalry as necessitating new
relationships within the hemisphere.
The man who helped to transform the image of the bank is its president, Mr
Enrique Iglesias, a well-connected, outgoing Uruguayan diplomat and
architect of the current Uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations.
Mr Iglesias was not, however, the man to reform the internal administration
of the bank, whose staff now totals 1,700. That task fell to his deputy, Mr
James Conrow. He was seen initially as Washington's 'hard man,' but this
bluff, bearded American cut a more sympathetic figure while still being
effective in restructuring the bank. A large part of that restructuring is
complete. Some departments are now under review - the public relations,
legal and secretariat sections - and the auditing and control functions are
also to be examined.
The bank is again beginning to talk about raising more capital. The increase
agreed in 1989 expanded capital from Dollars 15.7bn to Dollars 26.5bn and
allowed for a Dollars 22.5bn lending programme in the four years 1990-1993.
This has put the IADB on a par with the World Bank in terms of new loans
made to the region and may lead the IADB soon surpass it: despite the new
ability of some countries to attract private capital, the region's
investment needs are huge.
Although not on the formal agenda at next week's meeting, a central element
of the discussions over a capital increase will be the question of whether
the bank should break with the past and lend directly and without government
guarantee to the private sector. Some governments, such as Mexico's, have
opposed this in the past, in part because they say that the bank is not
equipped to assess commercial risk.
On the other hand, governments such as Chile's worry that, if they hand over
large parts of infrastructure development to the private sector, they lose
access to IADB capital for infrastructure development. The meeting will
assess, however, whether to expand the bank's capacity to make balance of
payments, as opposed to project, loans.
The bank has been able to make such sector-loans - meant to encourage
reforms in specified sectors of the economy - since the last capital
increase. The idea was that about 25 per cent of its lending should be in
sectoral loans over 1990-93.
The 1991 figure was 37 per cent of total lending (without significant
lending to either Brazil or Argentina), and the bank wants to formalise an
increased share for sector-lending. It wants this in part to encourage
reform in its smaller member-countries, in which the World Bank has less
involvement but to which the IADB must make 35 per cent of its loans. It has
also been asked to contribute finance to Brady-style bank debt
restructurings, from its sector-lending programme. It is also seeking more
autonomy from the World Bank in this area.
The bank also sees itself as increasing its role in the alleviation of
poverty and in the socalled social-investment sectors such as health and
education that have been badly neglected in many countries through the
austerity of the 1980s.
Mr Conrow says he reckons the bank 'is very far along the renewal process.'
He believes that, by the time of the bank's 1993 meeting, a consensus should
be emerging for a capital increase. After all, member governments only pay
in 2 1/2 per cent and the rest is callable, the bank raising the money from
the capital markets. However, he would like to see consideration of an
expansion of the bank's concessional loans through its co-called Fund for
Special Operations. This fund stands at Dollars 1.8bn, which allows only
Dollars 200m of new lending every year.

FT  02 APR 92 / Politics restricts response from Bush
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN PONDERING his response to the changes in the former Soviet Union,
President George Bush's habitual caution has been reinforced by a powerful
political force: the fear that foreign aid of any kind would prove
politically unpopular in an election year dominated by domestic concerns.
In recent weeks, however, the Bush administration has come in for a steady
barrage of criticism from those who charge that it is botching an epochal
opportunity to shape the world for the better.
Criticism from Germany, which has complained that the US has not borne its
fair share, may have little impact in domestic terms. But the efforts of a
group of senior congressmen from both parties, led by Senator Sam Nunn of
Georgia and Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana, won an extra edge when former
president Richard Nixon criticised the US's 'pathetically inadequate
response'.
There has been a serious debate in the US over whether financial aid to the
former Soviet republics should come from government or from the private
sector; over the balance between helping Russia and helping the other
republics; and over the likelihood that money poured into the former Soviet
Union at this uncertain moment will simply disappear, leaving no lasting
trace. Mr Nixon's intervention, however, appears to have played a critical
role in refocusing the debate onto the adequacy of President Bush's
leadership. President Bush sought to meet the challenge yesterday by
announcing a package of measures designed to help Russia and the other
former Soviet republics. But the crucial test of his leadership, at what he
yesterday called 'a defining moment in history', will come in the
follow-through.
The administration has repeatedly sent legislation to Congress on several of
the measures Mr Bush announced, notably on the US's Dollars 12bn (Pounds
6.9bn) contribution to the International Monetary Fund's capital increase.
It has been criticised, however, for its limp efforts to ensure passage.

FT  02 APR 92 / IMF timing crucial for Yeltsin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE TIMING of the announcement of an IMF quota larger than that originally
offered, of imminent membership of the IMF itself (and thereafter the World
Bank) and of Group of Seven support for the rouble is crucial to the future
of Mr Boris Yeltsin's government.
It comes just before the Congress of Peoples' Deputies which opens on
Monday: and Mr Yeltsin, Russian President and his economic reform team led
by Mr Yegor Gaidar, the deputy prime minister, badly need something which
they can announce with eclat.
That the IMF should act in this way is easily understood. For its officials,
the Russian government is not perfect but is seen as by far the best
interlocutor they are likely to get.
There have been fears that Mr Yeltsin might be listening to those who want
the government to go. Those fears were partially allayed yesterday when Mr
Yeltsin told the official news agency Itar-Tass that 'we cannot sacrifice
the reformist government, which is truly reformist. It is a bold, cohesive
and young team.'
That Mr Yeltsin felt obliged to put a shot across the bows of those deputies
who feel that the team should be disbanded shows he anticipates a struggle.
Although, his vice-president, Mr Alexander Rutskoi, appears to have been
brought into line by Mr Yeltsin: yesterday, he said he would support the
government continuing in office.
Russia's deputies are split into three camps: those who support the
government's hard line; those who do not wish to see it dismissed but want
it to soften the line; and those who want the government to go. There is
presently no way of testing the relative strengths of the three groups.
Among those offering 'constructive' opposition is Professor Yevgeny Yasin,
chief economist for the Russian Union of Industrialists and himself employed
by the government sage to the parliament. He supports the government's broad
policies, and thinks it important to sustain them, but he believes the
government must heed the cries of the industrialists. 'The government should
loosen the tight credit policy. It must see that it cannot at the same time
succeed in liberalisation of the economy and stabilisation of the currency:
and liberalisation of the economy is more important.'
The 'destructive' opposition, on the other hand, will take a variety of
forms. Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the leader of the parliament, has on every
occasion voiced his critique of the government and insistently calls for its
dismissal. He has promoted the views of Mr Nikolai Petrakov, the former
economic adviser to Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, who believes that the economy
cannot recover from the shocks now being administered to it.
He will find support from deputies who fear an executive appointed without
their consent (since they gave Mr Yeltsin the right to appoint the cabinet
without reference to them) and who resent what they see as the arrogance of
the ministers - especially Mr Genady Burbulis, the first deputy prime
minister. Their pressure has already removed Mr Sergei Shakhrai, a deputy
prime minister who fell foul of a law which prohibits deputies from holding
government office or leading political parties. Three other ministers or
senior government officials are in the same position.
Mr Burbulis, in an interview yesterday with the weekly Moscow News, did
nothing to win popularity by dismissing many of the deputies' concerns as
self-interested and narrow minded - arguing that all alternatives to the
economic course taken by the cabinet must be understood to be 'artificial
and senseless.'
The lines are being drawn for the struggle: it will be intense, since the
process through which Russia is passing is intensely painful.

GERMAN companies are expecting the current downturn in the domestic economy
to come to an end next year, according to a poll of 401 mainly large
companies conducted by the IFO, the Munich-based economics research
institute.
The details of the poll, published today, suggest that German businessmen
are confident that by the summer of next year they will have put high
interest rates, poor profitability and high wage demands firmly behind them.
Manufacturing companies are expecting a nominal 4 per cent growth in
domestic sales and a 7 per cent rise in exports for the whole of next year.
To help meet expected demand they are planning to increase investment by 7
per cent next year, compared to just 1 per cent planned for the current
year.
The poll shows that German companies expect net production to fall by 2 per
cent during the first and second quarters of the current year.
Mr Helmut Tietmeyer, Bundesbank vice-president, yesterday voiced anxiety as
to whether there was enough political will in Europe to ensure the success
of economic and monetary union. He predicted that widely divergent financial
policies among EC members could test monetary policy and Emu 'to the limit'.

A MEETING designed to promote new areas of defence co-operation between Nato
and its former Warsaw Pact adversaries yesterday failed to break the
deadlock between Ukraine and Russia over the remaining stockpiles of
tactical nuclear weapons on Ukrainian territory.
Nato defence ministers expressed continuing concern over the dispute. Mr
Dick Cheney, US defence secretary, held separate talks in Brussels with
ministers from both countries as well as representatives of Belarus and
Kazakhstan, the other two former Soviet republics where nuclear arms are
stationed. He said all four had reiterated their 'basic commitment' to the
principle that nuclear weapons should be concentrated in Russia and the
stockpile reduced.
'I'm inclined to take them at their word until I have evidence to the
contrary,' he said.
General Konstantin Morozov, Ukrainian defence minister, said shipments of
tactical nuclear arms to Russia, which were suspended last month, would not
resume unless Russia agreed to place the dismantling of the weapons under
international supervision.
But General Pavel Grachev, representing the Russian president, Mr Boris
Yeltsin, said this was not part of the agreement reached between the four
republics at Alma Ata, Kazakhstan, last December.
Kazakhstan has already transferred all its short-range tactical weapons and
Belarus about 70 per cent.
Ukraine says it had shipped 57 per cent of its stockpile, reckoned to be
more than 2,000 warheads, when it halted transfers. All three also have
strategic weapons sites.
Both the Russian and Ukrainian ministers said they hoped the dispute could
be resolved in time to complete the transfers of tactical arms by the July 1
target date.
Mr Tom King, UK defence secretary, said Nato expected all the non-Russian
republics to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. If there was any
departure from these assurances, he said, assistance to these countries
'could be put in jeopardy'.

THE embattled French government has agreed on the details of a much
scaled-down version of controversial plans for a restructuring of the
state-owned electronics industry.
It is understood that under the revised scheme, the CEA-Industrie nuclear
energy and reactor building group would take minority stakes in the
loss-making Thomson Consumer Electronics video and audio equipment maker,
and in SGS-Thomson, the semiconductor group jointly owned with the Italian
state sector.
The original version of the plan, launched last December, envisaged a
complete merger between CEA-Industrie and the civil electronics businesses
of Thomson. However, this ran into resistance from CEA-Industrie's
management.
This compromise is the result of arbitration by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, the
powerful director of the French Treasury, who was called in to resolve the
deadlock.

FT  01 APR 92 / Kuwait to bail out banks with bond sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON, Middle East Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KUWAIT's consultative assembly yesterday approved a plan to clear the
emirate's commercial banks of Dollars 20bn (Pounds 11.5bn) of bad debts
through an exceptional sale of government bonds.
The National Council's long-awaited approval, by a vote of 41 to 14 with two
abstentions, has no legal power in itself, but had been sought by the
government to give the debt buy-out political credibility.
Kuwait's banks and companies have been waiting for final clearance of the
plan before they can produce accounts for the period since Iraq's invasion
in August 1990. It is widely seen, therefore, as a prerequisite to
kick-starting Kuwait's post-war economy.
About a quarter of the debt has lain on the books of Kuwait's commercial
banks since the catastrophic crash of the informal Souq al Manakh stock
market in 1982.
Under the plan, the banks will receive bonds to the value of the debt, which
will then be taken over by the government. Debtors will then have 20 years
to repay.
However, each debtor will have to produce accounts to allow an assessment of
their ability to repay, and at what rates of interest.
Critics of the plan say this will discourage debtors from revealing their
full assets while at the same time doing nothing to trim the vast
bureaucracy in Kuwait's financial system which has been struggling with the
Souq al Manakh bad debts for the past decade.
Force may be needed to make Iraq respect Kuwait's border, the emirate's
envoy to the United Nations said in a recent newspaper interview, Reuter
reports from Kuwait.
Mr Mohammed Abu al-Hassan told the Al-Anbaa daily Iraq had set up several
border posts inside Kuwait's territory in a clear breach of the Gulf War
ceasefire agreement.

daughter Archina were killed by two militants who visited their house asking
for food and shelter for the night. Senior police officials confirmed
yesterday that both women had been raped.
The incident is the first in more than nine months in which Moslem militants
have apparently deliberately chosen a Hindu family as their target and it
could provoke a further Hindu exodus from the Kashmir valley. It is also
bound to revive charges that Moslem extremists are deliberately trying to
drive Hindus from the valley.
Moslem mourners at the cremation service yesterday expressed disgust at the
killings and an increasingly commonly heard weariness with the
two-and-a-half year insurgency. 'People are fed up with militants,' said a
Moslem neighbour who knew the family well.
Moslem neighbours felt particularly upset by the triple murder, having long
pressed the family to remain in the valley when other Hindu families were
leaving.
The killing comes at a time when the government is seeking to revive
political activity in the state by releasing detained opposition political
leaders. The five leaders, most of whom have been detained for two years for
supporting Kashmiri separatism, are expected to return to Srinagar today.
The Hizbol Muhajideen, the main pro-Pakistan Islamic militants group,
strongly condemned yesterday's killings. Mr Maqbool Elani, the group's
commander in the Srinagar region, said in an interview yesterday: 'We are
totally against this. They are our Hindu brothers.' He spoke at an interview
on the outskirts of Srinagar with a dozen of his followers, all carrying
automatic weapons.

THE United Nations special envoy on Afghanistan, Mr Benon Sevan, made an
unscheduled trip to Kabul, the Afghan capital, yesterday after holding talks
with Pakistani and Iranian ministers in Tehran, Reuter reports from Kabul.
Mr Sevan went straight into talks with Afghan President Najibullah. UN
officials refused to comment on the meeting.
Diplomats in Kabul said the visit could indicate new developments in his
efforts to convene an assembly of prominent Afghans next month to end 14
years of civil war. UN and mujahideen officials in Pakistan say he is trying
to speed up the peace process for fear of growing instability in Kabul and
northern Afghanistan.
Earlier this month Mr Najibullah announced he would play no part in Mr
Sevan's Afghan assembly and was ready to hand over all government powers if
it could agree an acceptable interim government to take office in Kabul. His
announcement coincided with Kabul's loss of the northern city of
Mazar-i-Sharif to mujahideen guerrillas.

CABOT Corporation of the US, the world largest producer of carbon black, has
set up a joint venture with Czechoslovakia's only coal tar processor to
produce carbon black, a raw material used in the manufacturing of tyres and
rubber products.
The joint venture, worth about Dollars 90m and 52 per cent owned by Cabot,
yesterday received a Dollars 20m loan from the International Finance
Corporation (IFC), the private sector arm of the World Bank.
This is IFC's first loan in Czechoslovakia. In January, the company approved
a 12 per cent equity investment worth Dollars 6.5m in Zivnostenska Banca,
the country's oldest bank which will be partially owned by Berliner Handels-
und Frankfurter Bank (BHF) of Germany. IFC is considering other investments
in the cement and automotive industry. The new joint-venture, called
CSCabot, will modernise a plant of Deza, a large chemical company in Moravia
and build two new carbon black production units with a capacity of 25,000
tons per annum. The project should be completed by early 1994 and will have
a total production capacity of 80,000 tonnes per annum.
The company will produce carbon black, a raw material used in the making of
tyres and plastic products and will be in a lead position to supply the
country's modernized automotive and trucks industry.
Baroum, Czechoslovakia's monopoly producer of tyres is currently negotiating
with Continental of Germany. Skoda, the Czech car company, last year teamed
up with Volkswagen of Germany and the country's three truck companies set
joint ventures with Mercedes of Germany and Iveco of Italy earlier this
year.

AIR traffic has recovered strongly from depressed Gulf War levels,
International Air Transport Association (IATA) data released yesterday
showed, Reuter reports from Geneva.
IATA said passenger traffic on international scheduled services jumped 46
per cent last month from February 1991, at the height of the Gulf War.
IATA, always careful to report the financial difficulties of its 205 member
airlines, cautioned that passenger traffic in January-February was only 10
per cent higher than in the same period in 1990.
IATA says it will soon be painting an even more gloomy 1991 profit picture
than before. It now believes that its members lost more on international
scheduled services last year than the Dollars 3.7 billion estimated
originally.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S floundering cable television industry is making a desperate attempt
to attract more viewers by slashing its subscription rates.
The French cable operators, who are struggling to build an audience, have
reached agreement with France Telecom, the state-owned telecommunications
group that provides the technology for cable, to cut subscription rates by
about 15 per cent. The price cutting ploy will form part of a relaunch
programme for the whole system.
France Telecom has agreed to waive part of the fees it receives from the
operators as a cable provider, to meet the cost of the rate reduction.
Meanwhile the French government, which was responsible for the launch of
France's ambitious plan cable 10 years ago, plans to table legislation to
speed up the cabling of apartment blocks in the next session of parliament,
which starts this Thursday. When the plan cable was introduced, the
government envisaged developing a system with at least 1.25m subscribers by
the end of this year.
Instead, the cable industry has been bogged down by financial problems and
arguments over technology.
It has also suffered from fierce competition by Canal Plus, the successful
pay-TV channel. As a result it is currently subscribed to by fewer than
700,00 French homes.

FT  01 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Speyhawk tumbles on results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and COLIN MILLHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEPRESSED property sector was dealt a further blow as developer Speyhawk
delivered catastrophic interim results which included a Pounds 217m loss, a
huge financial restructuring and a warning from the chairman that no
dividends would be paid 'for some time'. The shares collapsed to end 8 1/2
down at 2 1/2 p in heavy turnover of 5.4m.
Although bad results were anticipated, the scale of the company's
write-downs surprised many in the market. Mr Gary Baker at County NatWest
said: 'Speyhawk overextended itself and was crucified by its central London
office developments. Probably the most amazing thing is that the banks are
still supporting a company with a negative net worth of over Pounds 5 per
share.'
He added that other developers were also suffering like Speyhawk and that a
number could be counted as in 'de facto' receivership.
Speyhawk is only the latest in a number of news items which have hit
sentiment in the property sector. Worries over Olympia &amp; York, Heron,
Control Securities and also the prospect of a Labour victory in the general
election have all acted as a drag on shares.
Yesterday, City Site lost 6 to 60p, Hammerson ordinary 9 to 442p, MEPC 6 to
306p and Slough Estates 7 to 168p.
Lonrho hit again
Confirmation that UBS Phillips &amp; Drew had resigned as joint brokers to
troubled conglomerate Lonrho sent the shares crashing to an 8-year low on
their last day as a FT-SE 100 constituent.
The shares fell by more than 17 per cent, giving up a further 13 1/2 to 65
1/2 p, their lowest level since January 1984, and turnover rose to more than
11.5m.
The possibility of UN sanctions against Libya as a result of its alleged
role in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing continued to overhang the day's business,
with speculation mounting that 9.81 per cent stakeholder Fidelity, of the
US, would sell its holding if sanctions were imposed. Last week Lonrho sold
a third of its Metropole Hotel group to the Libyan Arab Foreign Investment
Company for Pounds 177.5m.
Pharmaceuticals company Wellcome was one of the strongest performers among
the FT-SE 100 constituents. The group announced the brokers for its vaunted
share flotation and two securities houses reiterated their buy stance.
Wellcome said Robert Fleming was to co-ordinate the flotation, stockbrokers
Cazenove and SG Warburg were to handle the flotation in the UK, and Morgan
Stanley, Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch would handle the US side.
The market was pleased that some of the uncertainty surrounding the
flotation was out of the way and the shares jumped 27 to 1049p. Both Fleming
and Smith New Court repeated their buy recommendations.
The clearing banks continued to suffer from their exposure to the Olympia &amp;
York and Heron International debts. Barclays, which is seen as having lent
the most cash and is also believed to have an exposure to Speyhawk, fell 10
to 307p, making a drop of 28 over the past three days. It was also one of
the most heavily traded stocks yesterday as more than 8m shares went through
the Seaq electronic ticker.
Midland Bank retreated 8 to 349p in spite of the potential value in its
prospective merger with Hongkong and Shanghai Banking. Lloyds lost 7 to
377p.
Royal Bank of Scotland, down 8 at 154p, suffered from receding bid hopes and
further consideration of its prospects following recent profit forecast
cuts.
Nervousness ahead of its annual figures tomorrow left Sun Alliance 7 off at
267p. James Capel is forecasting a loss of Pounds 450m.
Confirmation that SmithKline Beecham had launched a vaccine in Britain for
Hepatitis A, an infectious liver disease, and a more positive recommendation
from one analyst helped the 'A' shares to remain firm against the market and
close 3 up at 855p. SmithKline's Units rose 35 to 3915p.
The shares received a further push after Nomura Research upgraded its stance
on the stock from a hold to a trading buy. Mr Didier Cowling, Nomura's
pharmaceuticals specialist, said the shares had underperformed recently and
the new vaccine was likely to be a 'noticeable improvement over existing
therapy'.
Specialty chemicals group Croda International forged ahead 17 to 163p on
consideration of the company's full-year results. The profits were in line
with expectations but analysts liked the confident statement. Kleinwort
Benson raised its 1992 forecast by Pounds 1m to Pounds 27.6m.
Regional brewers provided most interest in the drinks sector. JA Devenish
gained 11 to 250p on renewed speculation about a bid. Boddington, holder of
a 20 per cent stake in Devenish, slipped 2 to 168p.
Morland has announced it is having talks with a possible bidder, but lost 10
to 433p yesterday as speculation about a Devenish bid faded.
Siebe, which today becomes a FT-SE 100 constituent, was 7 up at 646p on the
prospect of a US economic recovery. The company derives 45 per cent of its
sales from the US. Johnson Matthey, 12 ahead at 386p, was also boosted by US
recovery hopes.
Wholesaler Nurdin &amp; Peacock fell 8 to 156p. Profits in 1991 rose to Pounds
27.6 from Pounds 25.8m and Nurdin said sales were up on the previous year
but margins were under pressure.
Stores group Kingfisher renewed its slide to end 12 lower at 471p on
profit-taking after recent good figures.
A big placing in Queens Moat Houses saw the hotel group edge ahead 1 1/2 to
77p in turnover of 7m. Battery Marche, the US brokerage, is believed to have
sold a block of 3.4m shares into the market at 75 1/2 p, most of which was
later placed with institutions by a leading house at 76p. The stock had been
overhanging the market since last week - when it was being offered at 80p -
and has been undermining the share price.
News from Pearson on Monday that BSkyB would be profitable by the second
half of 1993 lifted another BSkyB shareholder, Granada Group, 10 to 230p.
Pilkington, Europe's biggest glassmaker, was in demand following a
well-received institutional meeting on Monday. The company announced
yesterday that it had licensed a part of its low-emissivity technology to a
big US glass manufacturer. The shares edged up a penny to 125p in busy
volume of 3.9m.

FT  01 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSY trading in the deriv-atives markets, fuelled by the expiry of the March
contract on the FT-SE, lifted sentiment only to see support dissipate as
equities drifted lower, writes Christopher Price.
The March future opened at 2,460 before being squeezed to 2,465 as traders
moved to close positions. After that initial spurt, March came to a limp
end, expiring at 2,450.5. As March closed, the June contract stood at 2,478,
a 10-point premium to estimated fair value of around 28. June dipped and
then rallied before trading in a tight range of 2,472-75 in the afternoon.
The June future contract finished at 2,473, a drop of 17 on the previous
day's session, but still a six-point premium to fair value. Volume was heavy
with almost 10,000 contracts traded by the termination of after-hours'
dealing.
In the traded options market, there was active business in the FT-SE 100
option, which recorded a day's total of 16,375 lots. Barclays was the
top-traded equity option, with the September 330 calls particularly active.
Troubled conglomerate Lonrho was also in demand, with the June 70 puts
prominent. Yesterday's total turnover was 31,794, up 4,332 on the previous
session.

FT  01 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Property news alarms equity market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE alarming news on the UK property front proved a considerable drain on
the equity market's confidence and triggered a widespread decline in share
prices yesterday. The FT-SE 100-share index closed a net 12.8 down at
2,440.1.
News of a sharply increased Labour lead over the Tories in the latest
opinion polls only emerged during the early evening and therefore had no
impact on the UK market, but these are expected to cause considerable unease
this morning. There was no real response to the poll news on the big UK
stocks traded in New York.
Another steep slide for Lonrho shares, after one of its joint brokers, UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew, withdrew from representing the company, was another reason
cited for the market's lacklustre showing.
The session commenced with prices being marked modestly higher, partly
because of the lack of any substantial poll news and partly because of
underlying support for the Footsie future ahead of its expiry in
mid-morning. However, news that Speyhawk, the property development group,
had incurred a heavy Pounds 216m loss, passed the final dividend, and
restructured its debts after talks with bankers and backers, prompted a
sharp about turn in sentiment.
Coming so soon after worries about Olympia &amp; York, developers of London's
Canary Wharf, and problems at Heron International, the news was very badly
received. Bank shares, especially, were given a thorough mauling as
investors backed off from expected big provisions associated with Speyhawk.
The expiry of the March futures contract coincided with the downturn in the
cash market. Turnover in the futures was much higher than in recent sessions
but petered out after the expiry.
Opening 6.5 higher, the Footsie improved rapidly to reach a day's best of
12.7 points ahead, before commencing a slide which saw the index down 13.1
at 2,439.8 at its worst.
The withdrawal of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew as broker to Lonrho and persistent
fears that Fidelity, of the US, may sell its near 10 per cent stake into the
market were behind the latest slide in Lonrho, which from today will be
dropped from the FT-SE 100-share index.
Other companies being removed from the index also lost ground, including
Royal Insurance and Tarmac. Their replacements, on the other hand, attracted
considerable support, notably ECC Group.
Turnover in equities was 475.1m shares, well ahead of Monday's 402.7m, and
boosted by at least four small-scale trading programmes.
Equity strategists are increasingly wary of the market as the general
election campaign moves into its final phase. Mr Nick Knight, at Nomura, the
Japanese-owned securities house and a long-time bear of the market,
published a note yesterday highlighting a rise in the public sector
borrowing requirement.
He said: 'The speed and scale of deterioration in the government's finances
is of truly mind-blowing proportions; such progression carries extremely
negative implications for equities and bonds.'

FT  01 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Sell programs erase rise on
good economic data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street
US STOCK markets ended little changed yesterday after late sell programs
erased gains made earlier in the session on the back of positive economic
news, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed just 0.23 up at 3,235.47. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended only 0.69 ahead at 403.69, while the Nasdaq
composite index of over-the-counter stocks gained 1.70 at 603.77. New York
SE turnover was a modest 182.7m shares, but well above Monday's 134m.
The late reversal was put down to computerised sell programs, although
market analysts said it was too early to tell if the trading was attempts by
big investors to cash in on profits at the end of the first quarter.
Prices had been firmer for most of the day, with the Dow registering a
22-point rise only one hour before the close. The advance had been achieved
in the wake of fresh evidence that economic activity is picking up, albeit
slowly.
That evidence consisted of a rise in the Conference Board's March consumer
confidence index to 54.0 per cent from the previous month's 47.3 per cent;
solid increases in purchasing managers' reports from Chicago and Detroit;
and an 0.8 per cent rise in leading economic indicators.
Corning put on Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 33 7/8 after reporting that
first-quarter net income jumped to Dollars 78.1m from the Dollars 48.4m
recorded in the same period a year ago. Earnings in both quarters, however,
were affected by extraordinary gains. Corning stock has suffered in recent
months because of controversy surrounding silicone breast implants produced
by Dow Corning, a joint partnership between Corning and Dow Chemical.
Orion Pictures, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in
December, enjoyed a rare gain early on, firming Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 2
7/8 as investors reacted positively to the triumph of the company's Silence
of the Lambs motion picture, which swept the four top awards (Best Picture,
Best Director, Best Actor and Best Actress) at the Oscar ceremonies on
Monday night. The stock, however, got caught up in the late sell-off and
ended unchanged at Dollars 2 5/8 .
Dime Savings Bank dropped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 3 1/2 in active trading
after announcing a fourth-quarter loss widened to Dollars 8.54 a share from
a deficit of 55 cents a share a year earlier.
Raychem slipped Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 33 3/4 after the company said it
expected fiscal third-quarter sales to be flat compared with those a year
ago.
Chicago &amp; North Western, one of the country's main railway companies, made
its debut on the NYSE yesterday. The public offering of 8.75m in common
stock was priced at Dollars 20.50 a share, and at the close they had firmed
to Dollars 22 in turnover of 3m shares.
TRC, the environmental consultancy and research group, dipped Dollars 3/4 to
Dollars 13 1/2 after Kidder Peabody and Raymond James, two broking houses,
downgraded the stock.
Another stock hit by a downgrading was the specialty stores group TJX, which
declined Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 18 5/8 after Mr Richard Baum, analyst at
Sanford C. Bernstein, lowered his rating on TJX from 'outperform' to 'market
perform' because he believed recent gains in the stock had taken it close to
its fair valuation.
Canada
TORONTO finished mildly firmer after moderate volume, with the gold and
silver sector regaining almost a full index point and the financial group
slightly better.
The composite index improved 5.4 to 3,412.1 and rises outscored falls by 325
to 273 after turnover of 28.5m shares worth CDollars 234.2m.
Gulf Canada Resources, affiliate of the financially troubled Olympia &amp; York
Developments, rallied CDollars  3/4 to CDollars 6 3/4 on volume of 305,745
shares.

disappoints Tokyo

Tokyo
THE NIKKEI average fell to a new five-year low yesterday as the government's
economic stimulus package disappointed the market and the Bank of Japan's
delayed for a day its discount rate cut, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average lost 323.36 to 19,345.95, the lowest close since 20
January 1987. The index hit the day's high of 19,914.69 in the morning
session on residual window-dressing on the last day of the fiscal year.
However, the Nikkei later dropped to an intraday low of 19,343.34 as the
futures market weakened.
Volume picked up moderately to 220m shares from 170m. Institutional
investors, who were expected to boost prices on the last day of the fiscal
year, remained inactive. Declines led advances by 550 to 386, with 189
issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks weakened 11.63
to 1,418.52, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index ended 3.85 firmer at
1,112.30.
Market participants were sceptical of the government's seven-point emergency
economic package, which included: front-loading public works projects for
fiscal 1992; increasing capital expenditure for public utilities; promoting
fewer working hours to boost consumer spending and housing investments;
promoting labour-saving investments with loan extensions; supporting small
and medium-sized companies; restructuring financial markets for smoother
corporate funding; and implementing a more flexible monetary policy.
Miss Kathy Matsui, strategist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said: 'There was
nothing the market did not know already.' She added that the only stock
market beneficiaries would be public works-related issues.
Foreigners were seen selling in small lots. Mr Nick Cant at Baring
Securities said that due to the continued weakness in the Tokyo market,
there was a danger that foreign asset allocaters could review their exposure
to Japan.
Investors ignored published predictions, later proved correct, that the Bank
of Japan would cut the official discount rate by 75 basis points today.
Declines in blue chips reflected the general bearishness. Nippon Steel shed
Y7 to Y313. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, a gauge for market sentiment,
ended the fiscal year down Y5,000 at an all-time low of Y636,000.
Speculative issues fell on heavy selling and renewed concern over a
bankruptcy of a leading speculator. Minebea, the most active issue of the
day, tumbled Y25 to Y464 and Clarion Y70 to Y940.
Financials were lower on worries about increasing bad loans at many of the
leading banks. Moody's Investor Services yesterday lowered the long-term
ratings of three banks and the short-term rating of a regional bank.
Industrial Bank of Japan dipped Y20 to Y2,220 and Mitsubishi Bank dropped
Y110 to Y1,950.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 100.98 to 21,060.91 in volume of 242.5m
shares.
Roundup
PACIFIC Rim markets were mixed yesterday as the weakness in Tokyo weighed on
sentiment.
HONG KONG was pushed lower by rumours that a leading company was about to
make a rights issue. The Hang Seng index retreated 39.97 to 4,938.30 in
turnover of HKDollars 1.95bn.
Among the most active stocks were Cheung Kong, off 50 cents at HKDollars
21.30, HSBC, down 50 cents at HKDollars 39.75, and Hutchison Whampoa, 10
cents easier at HKDollars 15.20.
SEOUL rose in late trading as institutions increased the value of their
holdings on the last day of the fiscal year. The composite index climbed
8.63 to 606.32 in turnover of Won388bn.
KUALA LUMPUR fell as investors reacted to the economic statement released by
the central bank after the market closed on Monday. The composite index shed
4.48 to 593.21 in volume of 35m shares.
SINGAPORE weakened further. The Straits Times Industrial index fell 11.48 to
1,414.26 in turnover of SDollars 676m.
TAIWAN receded on late selling of financial issues. The weighted index lost
32.53 to 4,800.94 in TDollars 16.9bn turnover.
BANGKOK eased on profit-taking as investors waited for the formation of the
new government. The SET index finished 4.52 down at 822.72 in turnover of
Bt7.4bn.
AUSTRALIA was supported by window-dressing at the end of the quarter. The
All Ordinaries index put on 9.2 to 1,582.6 in turnover of ADollars 235.5m.
BOMBAY reached its second successive record high, the BSE index adding
193.57 at 4,285.00. Export-related shares were boosted by rumours that the
government would allow export houses to convert their entire foreign
exchange earnings at the market rate.

FT  01 APR 92 / Money Markets: Rates still stable
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK money market was in a lacklustre mood again yesterday as one opinion
poll showing a Labour surge in the marginal Birmingham, Northfield,
constituency caused only a flicker of interest.
Mr David Coleman of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce said: 'It has
given the market a bit of a fright, but otherwise it has been a very quiet
day.'
The survey, conducted for the Birmingham Evening Mail, showed a 14 per cent
swing to the Labour party.
In spite of the poll, dealers continued to fret over the prospect of a hung
parliament. Although sterling remains at the bottom of the European exchange
rate mechanism grid, some comfort was being drawn from the currency's
continuing stability. Analysts said this reflected growing confidence in the
market that the pound would not be realigned within the EMS, whichever party
won the election.
At the short end rates remained soft, with the key three-month interbank
rate moving fractionally from 10 13/16 - 3/4 per cent to close at 10 7/8 -
13/16 . At the longer end, the one year rate stayed locked in at 11 1/8 -11.
The June sterling contract opened two basis points up at 89.08 but drifted
down during the day to 89.03.
The Bank of England forecast an initial shortage of around Pounds 350m but
later revised it to around Pounds 500m. It did not operate in the market in
the morning but bought bills totalling Pounds 210m in the afternoon,
including Pounds 185m of band 1 bank bills and Pounds 25m of band 2 bank
bills at 10 3/8 per cent. The Bank provided late unspecified assistance of
around Pounds 280m, so that by the close it had more or less taken out the
shortage with total help of Pounds 490m.
The overnight rate dipped to 9 per cent during the day but finished at
around 10 per cent.
German call money was steady to firmer on the last trading day of March.
Banks quoted rates of between 9.60 and 9.75 per cent, after 9.60/70 on
Monday. Traders said the Bundesbank would keep call money around 9.50/60 as
April began.
The US Federal Reserve refrained from reserve management operations
yesterday. The Funds Rate traded at 4 per cent, the Federal Reserve's
presumed target, at the usual operations time. Economists had anticipated
little chance of a reserve addition.

FT  01 APR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Good news fails to lift dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOOD NEWS on the US econ-omy failed to push the dollar through a DM1.6510
ceiling in London yesterday, writes Emma Tucker.
Consumer confidence in the US in March rose to a rating of 54.0 from a
revised 47.3 in February, the highest reading since October. Meanwhile, the
Chicago Purchasing Management index climbed to a seasonally adjusted 51.1
per cent in March from 48 per cent in February.
However, both sets of data, along with a 0.8 per cent rise in February's
leading indicator, were broadly in line with expectations and failed to
excite the currency markets.
After spending most of the day at DM1.64, speculative buying along with the
three pieces of good economic news pushed the dollar to a peak. But a big
sale order coming out of New York knocked it back to close at DM1.6450,
little changed from its DM1.6440 start.
In late Asian trading the dollar had eased slightly against the yen and the
D-Mark. A dealer at a Japanese bank in Hong Kong said the market had lacked
a trend all day, with the closing movements amounting to minor adjustments
ahead of Japan's new fiscal year that begins today. The US currency closed
in Tokyo at Y133.05 and DM1.6485.
In New York yesterday the dollar traded in a narrow range, opening at
DM1.6430/35 and Y133.10/20 and ending at DM1.6425/35 and Y132.70/80,
compared with Monday's close of DM1.6455/65 and Y132.90/95.
The Italian lira encountered light selling amid political uncertainty.
Similar to Britain, Italy is poised for a general election, the latter's to
be held at the weekend. Investors will be looking for a commitment from the
new government to reduce the country's big public sector deficit.
An economist said: 'If the prospect of a strong coalition seems in doubt,
the pressure could pile on the lira in the coming weeks.'
Mr Peter Luxton, senior economist at Barclays, said he believed there was
pent-up demand for sterling and the lira and that talk of a sterling crisis
after the election was overdone, particularly given the constraints of the
ERM. 'Once the elections are out of the way, we expect to see both
currencies bounce up.'
The lira weakened against the D-Mark to L754.80/90 from Monday night's
L754.60/70.
Sterling drifted through another lacklustre session. With only nine days
left until polling day the market had no firm indication of who is going to
win the election.
Said one UK bank trader: 'People have postponed their investment decisions
until the future shape of the government becomes clear, and sterling's
uneasy stability reflects this.' The pound closed  1/2 pfennig down at
DM2.8550.
In spite of political jitters in France, the French franc held a steady
tone.

FT  01 APR 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries ease as consumer confidence
shows upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

US TREASURY prices eased at the long end but held firm among the
shorter-dated issues yesterday, with the release of a mixed bag of economic
statistics - which were, on balance, unfavourable to the market.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  7/32 at 100
3/8 , yielding 7.960 per cent. The two-year note, however, was up  1/32 at
100 9/32 , yielding 5.582 per cent.
Prices had traded weaker early in the day in anticipation of the economic
figures. When news of a rebound in consumer confidence and an improvement in
some regional purchasing managers' reports came through, the market did not
flinch because the data had already been discounted.
The statistics backed up recent evidence that economic activity and
sentiment was slowly picking up. The Conference Board's March consumer
confidence index showed a rise from 47.3 per cent to 54 per cent, although
the board warned that this level was still 'less than reassuring'.
Purchasing management indices from Chicago and Detroit also showed
increases, as did February leading economic indicators.
Trading throughout the day, however, was quiet, with many participants
staying on the sidelines until Friday's key employment report for March.
A REPORT that Mrs Edith Cresson, the French prime minister, had tendered her
resignation gave a boost to the French government bond market yesterday and
helped set the tone for other European markets during the day.
The market had been looking for Mrs Cresson to be replaced for some time,
and gained further confidence from speculation that she would be replaced by
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the finance minister.
Though not confirmed during trading hours yesterday, the report helped to
push French bonds up by  1/4 point on the day, with the June bond future
closing at 107.62, up 0.24 on the day.
With the yield on 10-year German bonds static at just over 8 per cent, the
yield spread between the German and French markets narrowed on the day. From
72 basis points, equal to its high of recent weeks, the spread tightened to
67 basis points.
Confirmation of the news would push bonds further ahead, analysts said, with
the general view being that the spread over bunds would come down quickly to
around 60 basis points or below.
GERMAN government bonds were supported by the strength of the French market,
with cash bonds ending generally slightly firmer on the day. The bund market
was unnerved early on by inflation figures reported by Bavaria (among the
last four states to report March inflation figures). These showed a 0.3 per
cent rise on the month, to an annual level of 5 per cent, a figure that
caused some consternation.
However, the month-on-month rise was in line with the expected national
average, and there is expected to be confirmation today that the overall
rise during March had taken inflation to 4.7 per cent, in line with market
expectations.
POLITICAL concerns continued to stalk the UK government bond market, with
long gilt futures falling early in the day on a report that government
finances were in a worse state than either main political party was
admitting, and again later on a report that the latest opinion poll had
shown a marked increase in the showing of the opposition Labour party.
STRONG reports that Japan's long-expected official discount rate cut would
finally come today - and that, at 0.75 percentage point, would be larger
than generally expected - gave the Japanese government market a strong start
to the day. However, from an opening yield of 5.27 per cent on the benchmark
no 129, prices fell during the day, with the yield rising to 5.315 per cent
by the close.

disappoints
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NANKAI Electric Railway of Japan yesterday saw a muted response to its
substantial Dollars 300m five-year warrant bond issue, The deal,
lead-managed by Daiwa Europe, was issued at par, but traded down to 98 1/4
bid by the close of trading, just inside full fees of 2 1/4 per cent.
The deal will be watched by other Japanese companies looking to raise
funding to refinance maturing warrant and convertible bond issues.
In total, Dollars 36bn warrant and convertible bond issues by Japanese
companies will mature this year, rising to Dollars 84bn in 1993. Up to 80
per cent are currently 'under water' - the exercise price is above the share
price.
Where the warrants to buy new shares are not exercised, the companies will
have to repay the bonds either out of cash flow or by raising additional
finance.

FT  01 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Jenkins named to new post of
Fox chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michael Jenkins, chief executive of the London International Financial
Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe) since its inception in 1981, is to take
up a new position as non-executive chairman of the London Futures and
Options Exchange (Fox), the troubled commodity futures exchange.
Mr Jenkins was one of the driving forces behind Liffe's long-awaited merger
with the London Traded Options Market recently. With the completion of the
merger, which had been dogged by disagreements, and Liffe's move to new
premises, Mr Jenkins felt he 'needed a change'.
Although it is not a full-time job, his new post is unlikely to prove more
tranquil. The London Fox was thrown into disarray last autumn by revelations
that the exchange had artificially boosted trading volume in some contracts.
Mr Andrew Large, who temporarily took over as chairman in the wake of the
scandal, is taking up the chairmanship of the Securities and Investments
Board on June 1. Mr Jenkins is to join the Fox board immediately and will
become chairman shortly before Mr Large's departure.
However, Mr Jenkins will remain chief executive of Liffe until his 60th
birthday in October. A small group of Liffe board members has been given the
task of finding a successor, whose most difficult challenge will be to
revive the UK equity options market following the merger with LTOM.
The Fox board will now focus on the search for a new chief executive, a
position held on a temporary basis by Mr Phillip Thorpe. An internal review
of the exchange's business is currently in progress.
The exchange lost some ground to New York following the scandal. Since then,
the exchange's policy has been to concentrate on core products in soft
commodities such as cocoa and sugar contracts. This emphasis on soft
commodities is expected to continue under the new leadership.
'There is room for a soft commodities exchange in Europe, and Fox is the
only candidate,' said Mr Jenkins.
The property futures contract at the centre of the rigging scandal may yet
be revived by Liffe. Liffe is currently in discussions with a group of
property market participants to decide whether the contract is viable.
However, speculation that Mr Jenkins' appointment suggested that Liffe and
Fox would ultimately link was rejected by both exchanges.
Liffe has announced a further rights issue designed to increase the number
of trading permits available for dealing in the exchange's futures
contracts.
The shortage of trading permits has been exacerbated by growing activity
this year, and Liffe's move to its new Cannon Bridge headquarters at the
start of the year has provided more room for new traders.
The exchange is to issue 466 E shares, which will authorise trading in
mainly non-sterling interest rate products. The aim is to free up existing A
shares for use in trading sterling products.
The new permits are expected to be available before the launch in May of the
exchange's three-month Eurolira contract, for which a designated broker
system has now been put in place.

FT  01 APR 92 / International Company News: EC may take some fizz out of
Perrier deal - Concern over Nestle's share of the French bottled water
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NESTLE may have won the takeover battle for France's Source Perrier, the
world's largest mineral water company, but the Swiss food group faces as
much as four more months of uncertainty while European Commission
competition authorities decide how much of its prize it may keep.
Brussels' main concern is the French market, where the deal would almost
double Nestle's share of mineral water sales to around 40 per cent. Although
the company has agreed to sell Volvic, Perrier's second largest brand, to
BSN, France's leading food manufacturer, that does not solve the competition
issue because it would leave Nestle and BSN together controlling about
three-quarters of French mineral water sales.
Nestle already owns the Vittel brand in France, Blaue Quellen in Germany and
Ashbourne in Britain, while Perrier and BSN have sizeable water interests in
Italy. But nowhere in Europe except France would the deal give either
company a share of much more than 20 per cent.
Whether the deal will pitch Paris and Brussels into another confrontation
over competition policy remains to be seen. But Nestle seems confident that
it can square any objections by disposing, if necessary, of some of
Perrier's other interests.
Mineral water production is one of the world's simplest businesses. The raw
material is free and requires no manufacturing: the technical skill  - and
profit - lies largely in knowing how to run bottling plants at close to
capacity.
Yet few other food or drink sectors have enjoyed such high growth and
buoyant profitability in recent years. Since the mid-1980s, worldwide sales
volumes have risen by around 10 per cent annually. Margins of the larger
water producers are typically between 15 per cent and 20 per cent.
In some cases, demand has outstripped supply. Sales have remained robust,
even though advertising budgets have been cut and bottle sizes reduced in an
effort to conserve supplies. Evian, BSN's best-selling still water, is
expected to hit production constraints in 10 years.
BSN has several other untapped springs and is in the process of launching a
sparkling water, La Salvetat, from one of them. However, introducing new
products is an expensive way to grow in a business where competitive
advantage depends heavily on advertising and marketing support.
Hence BSN's eagerness to snap up Volvic, a successful brand with ample spare
capacity. Mr Sylvain Massot, drinks industry analyst with investment bank
Morgan Stanley, says: 'To expand in mineral water, you have to acquire.'
Although recession has recently slowed the industry's sales growth, the
longer-term outlook remains appetising - particularly in the Anglo-Saxon
world where there is plenty of demand waiting to be tapped.
Prospects are bright in the US, where mineral water has begun to carve out a
niche in a country long addicted to colas. Bottled waters account for only
11 per cent of US soft drinks sales, but volumes have been growing by 6 per
cent a year, twice as fast as the total market.
Perrier is already the leading supplier in the US, and Nestle is expected to
commit substantial extra resources to strengthening its position. The
spearhead is unlikely to be Perrier's best-known product: though notionally
a global brand, high transport costs have severely limited US sales and
profits.
The most rewarding opportunities lie in building on Perrier's
locally-produced North American brands. These include Arrowhead, Great Bear
and Ozarka, purchased from Beatrice Foods in 1987, and Ice Mountain,
purchased from PepsiCo the following year.
By pushing these products through its sizeable US distribution system,
Nestle could get them on to more supermarket shelves, while making its own
offering more attractive to retailers.
Analysts estimate that such rationalisation could quickly add as much as
three percentage points to Perrier's 7 per cent profit margin in the US.
There should also be further improvements in Perrier's performance as it
continues to recover from the dent in operating profits caused by the
benzene scare two years ago.
All this adds up to a tonic for Nestle. EC competition authorities willing,
the Perrier deal should be just what the Swiss group needs to put some fizz
back in its performance after a flat spell in the second half of the 1980s,
when its annual increases in earnings per share averaged a meagre 3.5 per
cent.
