FT  23 JUN 92 / Technology: The Orbital comes full circle / Examining a
prototype engine capable of meeting strict emissions standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some ordinary-looking, but distinctly strange-sounding, Ford Fiestas have
been cruising the British country lanes of Suffolk recently. Beneath their
bonnets lie prototype engines which, if an evaluation programme just
beginning proves successful, are likely to form the bedrock of Ford's petrol
and diesel technology for the mid- to late-1990s.
The engines have been developed jointly by Ford and the Orbital Engine
Company of Western Australia. In the Fiesta, they have three cylinders and
work on the two-stroke principle, providing twice as many power strokes per
revolution as a conventional petrol engine - and thus having the smoothness
and flexibility of a six-cylinder unit.
Another advantage is that the engine has no valves and thus none of the
heavy and complicated components needed to operate them. It is half the size
of a conventional engine of similar capacity and saves about one-third the
weight of a conventional unit (equivalent to 30 kilogrammes in the Fiesta).
Size for size the engine is 10 per cent more powerful and 12 per cent more
economical than its conventional rivals.
Not least of its attractions, according to Ford development engineers, is
that it is already capable of meeting the most stringent exhaust emissions
standards currently in force.
The unit is now being assessed amid optimism that it will be able to qualify
as an 'Ultra-Low Emission Vehicle' under even stricter Californian
legislation due in 1997. To achieve this, Ford and Orbital claim to have
made a 'technological breakthrough' in terms of minimising emissions, but
are refusing to discuss the details.
Ford has just finished production of 25 Orbital prototypes, which are set to
enter service with police forces and other intensive users for a one-year
evaluation programme. As some doubt remains over the engine's durability, it
is hoped that during the test period each one will cover 100,000 miles.
A further 35 engines are to be manufactured at Ford's Dagenham plant before
the end of the year. Some of the test vehicles will enter service in Germany
as well.
If the programme does not result in any unexpected problems, Ford hopes to
have small, Orbital-engined cars in its range by as early as 1995. Although
initial applications are expected to be on small cars, Ford acknowledges
that it has other, long-term projects with Orbital covering a variety of
engines, including six-cylinder and supercharged units.
Indeed, Jaguar, now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ford of the US, has just
made the surprise disclosure of its own joint project with Orbital, of a 3.2
litre V6 engine. Prototypes of this type are 40 per cent lighter than
Jaguar's V12 engine but have the same power output.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Wales to get Pounds 28m jobs boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID HUNT, Welsh secretary, said yesterday that investment projects
totalling Pounds 28m were expected to create more than 840 jobs.
Automotive components, food production, electronic equipment, plastic
mouldings and the processing of motor insurance claims are among the 13
projects involved, which have secured regional assistance totalling more
than Pounds 7m.
The announcement failed to stem Labour protests about unemployment in Wales,
said by Mr Barry Jones, shadow Welsh secretary, to be set to rise above
124,000.
Mr Jones claimed that the decision to scrap the National Economic
Development Council had called into question the proposals for establishing
a Welsh Economic Council.
Mr Hunt insisted that the new projects would provide 'another tremendous
boost' for the Welsh economy, which had undergone a transformation over the
past 10 years.
He said: 'Our plans for a Welsh economic council continue and we shall
shortly be issuing a consultation paper.'
Commenting on the new projects, Mr Hunt said they demonstrated the
continuing success of Wales in encouraging existing companies to expand and
new companies to invest.
Mr Hunt told MPs that, subject to the consultation process and the
completion of the necessary statutory procedures, Anglesey and Radnor should
formally be designated as environmentally sensitive areas by the end of the
year.
It was hoped that Preseli and the Clwydian Range would be designated by next
June.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Change in law over pregnant women urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS and IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CITIZENS' Advice Bureaux are to press the government for tighter rules on
the protection of pregnant women at work.
The call follows evidence that women are being dismissed when their
employers find out they are pregnant, the National Association of Citizens
Advice Bureaux claims in a report published today .
The association is the latest group to lobby for increased legal protection
for pregnant women ahead of the European Council of Ministers meeting in
Luxembourg tomorrow, which is due to consider the issue. Both the Equal
Opportunities Commission and the Labour party yesterday urged the government
to agree to improvements in maternity pay at the meeting.
The association, which has collected evidence from its bureaux across the
UK, says that some employers' attitudes to pregnancy are 'hostile and
uninformed'. Its report cites cases of women who were allegedly sacked for
being pregnant or were denied their legal entitlement to maternity pay.
Mr Tony Blair, the opposition employment spokesman, was joined by MEPs at a
news conference to press the case for every mother in the EC having 16 weeks
paid leave, remunerated at 80 per cent of their regular salaries. The UK
government wants the payments to be at a lower rate, equivalent to statutory
sick pay levels.
The proposals on maternity pay are technically subject to qualified majority
voting in the Council of Ministers because they are designated part of the
European Community's workplace health and safety responsibilities. However,
it is thought unlikely that British objections will be overruled in a vote
tomorrow: either maternity pay at the lower sick pay rates are likely to be
agreed or the draft directive in its entirety could be scrapped.
The Equal Opportunities Commission also backed the call for 80 per cent pay,
saying that the issue would be a 'real litmus test of the government's
commitment to recognising and supporting working mothers'. The commission
said it objected to the proposed link between maternity pay and sick pay.
'Pregnant women are not sick. If the Council of Ministers should decide to
link maternity pay with sick pay, then . . . British women would end up with
only about 25 per cent of the average full-time women worker's wage', it
said.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Miners give warning on Scots pits
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Scottish deep mine industry will wither under privatisation, unless
linked with the country's opencast activities under a separate and
independent Coal Corporation, the Scottish miners conference heard yesterday
at Inverness.
Mr George Bolton, NUM area president, told delegates that a 'dire
consequence' of general election victory was the government's determination
'to ram through what they have called the ultimate privatisation, that of
coal'.
His call for a 'Scottish Coal Corporation, not a company' was unanimously
endorsed by the conference. It follows the union's submission to Mr Tim
Eggar, energy minister, stating that under any privatisation programme
Scotland's coal assets should be sold off separately and intact.
While opposed to privatisation, Mr Bolton viewed it as inevitable. 'It is
not enough just to issue militant sounding slogans, while others are
meeting, plotting, scheming and lobbying day and night to have their concept
of a private coal industry accepted,' he said.
Mr Arthur Scargill, NUM president, was rebuked for a 'decade of inactivity
at the negotiating table.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ANDREW KIMMINS, the jailed head of the failed Blade Group of futures and
equities dealers, yesterday lost an appeal against his 30-month prison
sentence for fraudulent trading.
Mr Kimmins, 33, had sought a reduction in his jail term. But Mr Justice
Simon Brown, sitting in the Court of Appeal with the Lord Chief Justice,
Lord Taylor, and Mr Justice Roch, said the sentence already fully reflected
the mitigation in the case.
Mr Kimmins of Henley on Thames was jailed on March 5 after admitting two
counts of fraudulent trading between 1986 and 1988.
He was alleged to have 'recklessly' carried on the activities of his Blade
Securities and Blade Investment companies when he knew they could not
survive without outside help. The net loss to investors was put at Pounds
1.6m.
His counsel, Mr Philip Singer, said yesterday lax accounting and bad
investment advice had contributed to the group's failure.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Poddington ex-chief jailed for two years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FORMER chairman of Poddington, a company that promoted the Poddington Peas
cartoon characters, was sentenced to two years in jail yesterday for rigging
the market in the company's shares.
An Old Bailey judge said that companies controlled by Mr Leonard Lee made
massive disguised purchases of Poddington shares, creating a false
impression in the market that there was far more genuine dealing in the
stock than had been the case.
The main losers were Barclays Bank and a number of firms of stockbrokers and
marketmakers, which between them lost about Pounds 3.4m.
Sentencing Mr Lee, who admitted an offence under section 47 of the Financial
Services Act, Judge Bruce Laughland QC told him: 'You were quite cynical in
this operation. It was carried out repetitively over a period of time. You
exploited your high reputation in the City and damaged the firms who trusted
you.'
Mr David Cocks QC, prosecuting, said Poddington had been brought on to the
third market in 1989 by Cleves Investments, which had been Mr Lee's
'creature'.
Mr Lee had then 'ramped' Poddington shares, artificially boosting their
market value by dealing in the stock though his own companies.
He had traded extensively on credit, rolling over his liabilities and
disguising from marketmakers and brokers his own massive holdings.
He had built up on credit a holding of two thirds of the issued Poddington
shares, in part by deceiving the market that there was genuine interest by
institutional and other buyers, when in fact it had resulted from
manipulation by Mr Lee through his own companies, Mr Cocks said.
Judge Laughland said Mr Lee's own companies had gone into the market and
purchased Poddington shares to support the price. When he and his companies
no longer had the resources to finance the purchases he resorted to
techniques known as 'cashing and newing' and 'selling and buying new time'
to defer payment.
Barclays Bank had 'surprisingly' increased Mr Lee's borrowing facility from
Pounds 500,000 to Pounds 1.6m - 'I say surprisingly because the advance was
made on a market which had already substantially fallen.'
The judge said that, in considering the losses Mr Lee had caused, he took
into account in Mr Lee's favour the fact that Barclays had to an extent
brought its loss on itself.
There had then been a sequence of rollovers from stockbrokers and others,
enabling Poddington shares either to be sold and bought again at the same or
at an enhanced price, together with commission and any premium or other
financial advantage to the stockbrokers.
'I am prepared to assume in your favour,' the judge told Mr Lee, 'though not
against them, that they either connived at the kind of manipulation in which
you were engaged or were naive or negligent about the way in which this kind
of deferment of payment was made possible by the facilities they provided.'

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Fernando Collor of Brazil has again tried to regain the political
initiative by denying allegations that he knew of corruption within his
government, writes Bill Hinchberger in Sao Paulo.
'The time has come to say enough. The people will not stand for the lies,
the falsehoods that have found shelter in the organs of the press,' Mr
Collor said in a Sunday night television broadcast.
Allegations of extortion and other wrongdoing by Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, a
businessman who was Mr Collor's campaign treasurer, originated with the
president's brother, Mr Pedro Collor, and triggered a row within the Collor
family. A parliamentary panel was set up to investigate the claims.
The local press has given much space to allegations by former officials who
have yet to testify before the panel. The magazine Veja reported at the
weekend statements by Mr Renan Calheiros, former head of the parliamentary
delegation for Mr Collor's National Renovation party (PRN), who said, among
other things, that he had informed the president about alleged corruption in
the government.

FT  23 JUN 92 / 'Gutsy governor' drops the gimmicks / Profile of the
independent policies of Connecticut's Lowell Weicker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HE is being called the 'gutsiest governor in America' and a precursor and
political role model for Mr Ross Perot's independent bid for the US
presidency.
Mr Lowell Weicker, the subject of these eulogies, is the governor of
Connecticut, a small New England state not normally associated with the
political cutting edge.
Yet Connecticut anticipated the nation's current distaste for mainstream
party politics 1990 when it elected Mr Weicker on an independent ticket -
making him one of only a handful of politicians this century to have won
state governorships without major party backing.
Mr Weicker kept Connecticut at the forefront of political consciousness by a
long battle with the Democrat-controlled legislature which eventually pushed
through the state's first income tax.
Locally, the move was extremely unpopular. Connecticut, a state of leafy
suburbs boasting one of the highest per capita incomes in the US, prided
itself on being among the few remaining states without a tax on income.
Mr Weicker, accused of breaking election promises, was spat on, hung in
effigy before a crowd 40,000, and became the butt of bumper stickers
demanding his impeachment.
Nationally, however, the tax tended to be viewed far more sympathetically:
as a rare example of a politician prepared to put his neck on the block by
taking tough, realistic action in a severe fiscal crisis. Time Magazine
labelled him the 'gutsiest governor ' while he recently won an award - named
after President John F. Kennedy - for political courage.
Such is Mr Weicker's national reputation that there have even been rumours
he could emerge as Mr Perot's vice-presidential running mate. The Governor,
however, insists there is absolutely no possibility of him quitting
Connecticut to stand on anybody's Presidential ticket.
Certainly, he and Mr Perot do not appear to have much in common apart from
their political independence and a plain-speaking manner. While Mr Perot is
a self-made businessman with no political experience, Mr Weicker has spent
30 years as a professional politician - including 18 years in Washington as
a Republican senator from Connecticut.
Aged 61, an imposing 6ft 6in tall, and a descendant of the family which
founded the Squibb pharmaceuticals group, Mr Weicker made a name as an
independent-minded Republican liberal in 1973 when he served on the Senate
committee investigating the Watergate scandal and aggressively grilled
President Nixon's White House staff.
His term as governor underlines some of the advantages and drawbacks of
independent candidates. Mr Weicker contends he only managed to get the
income tax bill into law because he was an outsider. 'Neither party was
going to lay claim to being the father of the tax,' he says.
But independent candidates offering sweeping change can also generate
unrealistic expectations of painless problem-solving, as the row over the
Connecticut tax demonstrates.
During the gubernatorial campaign Mr Weicker did not explicitly rule out an
income tax, but he did say such a levy would be like 'pouring gasoline on
the fire' of recession, and promised no new taxes if the state produced no
new fiscal surprises.
Defending himself against accusations of lying, he points out that by the
time he took office, Connecticut faced a fiscal deficit of Dollars 1bn on an
Dollars 8bn budget -the highest percentage shortfall of any state in the
union. 'I'd say that's very much a new problem.'
The income tax has been accompanied by a thorough reform of the state's tax
structure, including a reduction in punitive business rates which were
driving companies away.
However, the Governor insists he never set out to be quite such a
thorough-going reformer. He settled on the income tax after three weeks of
seeking alternatives which did not work. He was not prepared to go along
with the 'the accounting gimmicks, smoke and mirrors, crooked Ouija boards
and other apparatus of deception that had led to our fiscal crisis. We
resolved government would tell the truth to the people and attempt to fix
the problems for the long term rather than for the next election.'
The budget crisis has now eased following spending cuts and a shake-up of
the civil service which removed 10 per cent of its jobs and amalgamated many
services. Mr Weicker, however, is wary of the privatisation initiatives
being embraced by many other governors. 'There's a lot to be said for some
of it, but some of it is overblown.'
His top concerns now include reviving the inner cores of cities like
Hartford, Bridgeport and New Haven, islands of minority deprivation in
Connecticut's sea of affluence; and attracting business to an economy hit
extremely hard by recession and US defence cuts. The state is putting
together Dollars 200m of its own funds, together with a Dollars 1bn from the
private sector, to ease a credit crunch.
As for the cities, Mr Weicker argues that one reason so many US initiatives
fail is because they adopt a uniform 'one size fits all' policy which fails
to take account of the uniqueness of each urban area. He intends to pursue a
case by case approach.
All this is improving Mr Weicker's local popularity. A recent poll in the
Hartford Courant newspaper found that 41 per cent of the electorate thought
his performance was good to excellent, up from 33 per cent.
The governor puts this down to the fact that 'we faced up to reality. The
state of Connecticut was exactly like the United States (after) 10 years of
Reaganomics which said you can have it all and you don't have to pay for it.
In essence, what the state of Connecticut - not just its government, but a
group in the legislature, people in the street, said was: 'we know there's
no such thing as a free lunch.'
'Whatever the problem is, apply realistic answers, not political answers,
and the politics will take care of itself.'
Easily said, but the test of this benign view will only come this autumn,
when Connecticut's somewhat nervous legislators face re-election.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Iran seeks silken ties with its Central Asian neighbours:
Emphasis placed on trade revival and extension of transport networks to gain
regional influence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN President Hashemi Rafsanjani last month inaugurated work on a railway
between Iran and neighbouring Turkmenistan, an enthusiastic Iranian press
portrayed it as one more example of links being forged between Iran and its
Central Asian neighbours.
Mr Rafsanjani reminded his audience in the north-eastern city of Mashhad
that the railway would provide a link between landlocked Central Asia and
the 'open seas through the southern border of Iran,' also forming a 'bridge'
between Europe and Asia.
The Turkmenistan railway is not the only transport project used by Iran to
capitalise on its proximity to the Central Asian republics. Tehran recently
announced that it plans to spend Dollars 2.5bn upgrading and extending a
railway line from the Caspian Sea to the Gulf.
The main work left to be done is to extend an existing line from the town of
Sari in northern Iran to the Caspian port of Freydun Kenar. Both this port
and Bandar Abbas on the Gulf will have to be expanded significantly to cope
with an estimated 5m to 8m tonnes of freight annually.
Iran clearly regards its ability to facilitate trade to and from the
newly-emergent states as a key card in the evolving competition for power
and influence in the region.
Six former Soviet republics - Kirgizia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan,
Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan - plus Iran, Turkey and Pakistan,
recently gathered for a summit in Ashkhabad, the capital of Turkmenistan,
and intriguingly, called for moves to re-open the Silk Road.
This ancient route, stretching some 6,400km from China through South and
Central Asia, including what is now Iran, to the Levant, was pioneered in
the second century BC, and was one of the principal conduits for the
transport of silk to the Roman empire.
Iranian behaviour regarding its neighbours has thus far been exemplary,
diminishing initial fears that Iran would seek to export its own potent
brand of Islamic fundamentalism to the unsettled Moslem states following the
collapse of the Soviet Union.
Western officials in Tehran cite Iran's efforts to mediate an end to the
conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan in Nagorno-Karabakh and its role in
trying to calm the situation in Afghanistan as indications of its desire to
be seen as a positive force.
'Iran is not going to play the Islamic card all that vigorously,' said one
official. 'Iran is worried about the enormous power vacuum to its north, and
it will not wish to further destabilise the situation.
What worries Iran is that ethnic conflict will filter down to Iran itself.'
About half Iran's population of 58m are ethnic minorities, including big
concentrations of Kurds and Azeris in its northern regions.
In spite of the conventional view that Iran's intentions are fairly benign
in the states to its north, it would be naive to believe that the country's
theocratic leadership does not harbour ambitions to use religion as a means
of enhancing Iran's regional influence.
'Given the role of the Islamic republic of Iran in the region, our
responsibilities are manifold,' Mr Ali Akbar Velayati, Iran's foreign
minister, said recently.
'Iran shares the Islamic heritage with her neighbouring countries, and, in
view of the recent urge for independence in Central Asia, it has to fill the
existing cultural and economic vacuum in the region. Hence, all countries
that seek Iran's assistance in these realms will be welcomed.'
It is this sort of observation and a challenging description by Mr
Rafsanjani of the putative Economic Co-operation Organisation, grouping all
the states of Central Asia plus Iran, Pakistan and Turkey, as 'one great
Moslem family', 250m strong, that troubles the west and the US in
particular.
Iran's response to the collapse early in May of the conservative government
in Farsi-speaking Tajikistan (Farsi is the language of Iran) was also hardly
encouraging as far as western observers were concerned.
Tehran Radio hailed the triumph of the 'Moslem people of Tajikistan' who
were now engaged most importantly in a 'renovation' of their 'Islamic,
national identity.'
Mr William Taft, the US ambassador to Nato, observed recently that the
situation in Central Asia was fragile, and it was therefore very important
for the US to work closely with Turkey to ensure that the 'Turkish model'
prevails over the Iranian one.
Turkey, which has offered the Central Asian republics some Dollars 1.2bn in
credits, is fairly confident that it has the upper hand in the battle for
hearts and minds. In this, Turkey is being aided by the fact that Turkic is
the predominant language in the region and most people are Sunni Moslems,
the less confrontational form of Islam practised in Turkey and in the Arab
world.
But in a volatile situation no one can be sure how things will evolve, and
Iran, although constrained by its own deep economic problems and the huge
burden of post-war reconstruction, remains something of a wild card.
In Tehran, a Turkish official likened Central Asia to a laboratory. 'We
don't know what effect the various compounds will ultimately produce,' he
said.
'These people are going from communism to what? They have no real
understanding of democracy. As far as Turkey is concerned we want to
co-operate with Iran, rather than compete. These countries need so much
help.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THAILAND'S interim prime minister, Mr Anand Panyarachun, promised yesterday
that his government would ensure a clean and orderly election, while
pro-military political parties made apparently hopeless last-minute efforts
to avert a dissolution of parliament and the calling of a new poll.
Mr Anand said in a policy speech to parliament: 'The government will
maintain strict political neutrality without assisting or hurting any
political parties or groups.' Elections, which Mr Anand said would be
'orderly, clean and fair to all', are expected in September.
Mr Anand was appointed caretaker prime minister by King Bhumipol to resolve
a political deadlock. At least 50 pro-democracy demonstrators were shot dead
by troops last month, forcing the resignation of Gen Suchinda Kraprayoon,
the premier installed by the pro-military parties after elections in March.
Many people are still missing after the violence, arousing suspicions that
they were killed and their bodies secretly disposed of by the army.
Opponents of the military blame the outgoing coalition of pro-military
parties for failing to restrain the troops during the violence, but
politicians in the coalition are reluctant to relinquish power or to mount
another expensive election campaign so soon after the last one.
Buying votes with cash is common in the rural areas of Thailand where the
pro-military politicians hold sway, and members of parliament like to recoup
their investment by participating in the lucrative and often corrupt
business of government before spending any more money.
Some of the politicians loosely grouped in opposition to the coalition have
also been known to buy votes.
Mr Anand - who ran the country as caretaker prime minister between the coup
d'etat in February 1991 and the March elections - said he would continue to
promote free market economic policies, and would uphold civil rights and
press freedom.

<TEXT>
THE United Nations Development Programme yesterday raised pledges worth
Dollars 880m (Pounds 476m) for the reconstruction of Cambodia, far exceeding
expectations of Dollars 600m, at a Tokyo conference attended by 33 nations,
the European Community and 12 international organisations.
The success of the conference at raising funds, however, was overshadowed by
continuing doubt about the future of the UN peace process in Cambodia, where
the communist Khmer Rouge has refused to comply with the crucial second
phase of a programme calling for disarming and demobilising troops on the
ground.
The Khmer Rouge appeared isolated at the conference and was repeatedly
criticised for obstructing implementation of the Paris Agreements, aimed at
bringing peace to the country and which it signed last year. A meeting was
under way late last night between the factions to the Cambodian conflict,
the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, and representatives
of France and Indonesia, which chaired the Paris meeting.
Mr Georges Kiejman, the junior French foreign affairs minister, said the
meeting was aimed at convincing the Khmer Rouge there was no alternative to
the peace plan.
An immediate formal reply from the Khmer Rouge was, however, not expected.
It has refused to comply with the terms of the peace accord because it says
Vietnamese troops remain in the country. This was denied yesterday by Mr
Yasushi Akashi, head of the United Nations Transitional Authority in
Cambodia (Untac).
The Khmer Rouge has also objected to the disbursement of some funds for
essential services through the existing Phnom Penh government, on the
grounds that this will strengthen the government in elections scheduled for
next year. Mr Akashi said, however, that spending would be strictly
controlled by Untac.
Delegates appeared determined to push the peace process through even if the
Khmer Rouge continued to obstruct the agreement.
Mr Lawrence Eagleberger, the US deputy secretary of state, told the
conference: 'The peace process can go forward in their absence.'
The US threat was to halt disburse money to Khmer Rouge-controlled areas.
The way that money is spent has become a highly political issue because of
its possible impact on the voting in elections scheduled for next spring.
The UN is aiming to repatriate 370,000 refugees before the election, and how
they are settled could strongly influence the voting.
Japan was the biggest contributor, pledging between Dollars 150m and Dollars
200m, although some of this money had been previously pledged. The US was
second largest contributor with Dollars 135m, with France providing Dollars
57m, the EC Dollars 40.2m, and Britain Dollars 30m.

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN INTERNATIONAL treaty outlawing chemical weapons looks virtually certain
to be completed this summer, after negotiations lasting more than 20 years.
Mr Adolf von Wagner of Germany, current chairman of the ad hoc committee on
chemical weapons of the United Nations Disarmament Conference, yesterday
presented the committee with what he expects to be the final treaty draft.
If all goes according to plan, the treaty will be endorsed by governments
within the next seven weeks and approved by the UN General Assembly in New
York this autumn before a signing ceremony in Paris early next year.
The chemical weapons convention, the most ambitious multilateral disarmament
accord ever attempted, will ban the development, production, stockpiling and
use of toxic arms and require the destruction of all stockpiles and
production facilities within ten years of the treaty coming into force.
The chemical weapons ban will be policed by an international inspectorate,
to be based in The Hague, with wide-ranging and intrusive powers to enter
and search not only highly sensitive military installations, but also
civilian chemical plants making chemicals for peaceful uses such as
fertilisers that could be diverted for weapons production.
The negotiations in the 39-member disarmament conference have been slowed by
the difficulties of balancing the need for rigorous checks to uncover and
deter cheating with countries' desire to protect military and commercial
secrets. The US last year backed off its own proposal in 1984 for
inspections 'anywhere, anytime'.
This followed objections from the Pentagon that open access would allow
countries to snoop around military establishments developing, say, Stealth
bomber technology on the pretext of looking for chemical weapons.
The provisions for inspections now allow countries to protect military or
trade secrets through 'managed access' which would, for instance, enable
countries to shroud equipment, hide documents, shut off computers or
restrict individual inspectors to different parts of the site. Governments
will not be able to refuse access altogether, however.
Some Third World countries, notably China and Pakistan, have been reluctant
to allow any inspection of civilian facilities or undeclared military
installations. However, they are not expected to block the proposed treaty,
which requires a consensus of Disarmament Conference members.
About 50 countries, including all the members of the Conference on Security
and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), have said they will sign the treaty,
enough to bring into being the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical
Weapons which will administer it. The convention will come into force two
years after the signing ceremony, provided 65 nations have ratified it.
Western negotiators were hopeful that most countries would sign eventually.

<TEXT>
A POLITICAL initiative by EC leaders - most prominently Germany's Chancellor
Helmut Kohl - will be needed at the Lisbon summit later this week if the
Uruguay Round of world trade talks is to avoid collapse, negotiators in
Brussels and Geneva said yesterday.
The talks are 'totally and utterly blocked', senior staff at the
Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), said over the
weekend. This was due to a dispute between the EC and the US over reform of
world trade in farm products. Pessimism about a settlement has prompted
calls by some trade negotiators in Geneva for a ministerial meeting next
month formally to bury or resurrect the Uruguay Round.
After last week's failure in Geneva to reinvigorate the detailed
country-by-country negotiations on lowering tariff barriers, some countries
have apparently asked Mr Arthur Dunkel, director-general of Gatt, to call a
ministerial meeting of the trade negotiations committee to decide on the
future of the Round.
EC negotiators insist that no issues of substance now prevent a US-EC
agreement on farm trade: 'Things are no longer in the hands of negotiators,'
an EC official said. 'It has become more of a political problem, and much
will now depend on a prise de conscience from leaders of member states in
Lisbon, given that the commission is fairly divided on the issue.'
In a Lisbon agenda already thrown into disarray by concern over the
Maastricht treaty, negotiators are not confident EC leaders can muster the
will to push for settlement of the Uruguay Round. Officials look to
Chancellor Kohl because Germany takes up the EC presidency at the end of the
year, and because of Germany's pivotal influence on Europe's farm policy.
EC officials acknowledge that a common EC position on the Uruguay Round will
be formulated in Lisbon, but were unclear whether this prise de conscience -
or 'awakening' - would enable a US-EC settlement to be drafted ahead of the
summit of leaders from the Group of Seven industrial countries in Munich in
July.

ILVA, Italy's state steel company, yesterday signed an accord with Nisshin
Steel of Japan to co-operate on products for car exhausts in what is
believed to be the first direct investment by a Japanese steelmaker in
Italy.
The deal, although relatively modest, comes at a crucial time for Ilva. The
European Commission has taken an interest in recent capital increases and
the possible cancellation plans for a stock market quotation by the company.
Nisshin Steel, Japan's sixth biggest steelmaker, is buying 10 per cent of
Tubificio di Terni, which operates at Ilva's Terni steelworks in central
Italy. Ilva owns 75 per cent of the company, with the remainder held by
Sitai, a privately owned Italian steelmaker.
No value has been placed on the deal, as the precise figure is still being
studied, Ilva says. Following the transaction, in the form of a rights issue
reserved for Nisshin Steel, the stakes of Ilva and Sitai will fall to 67.5
per cent and 22.5 per cent respectively.
Tubificio di Terni was created three years ago in a restructuring at Terni
and makes stainless steel pipes for car exhausts. Demand for such products
is expected to rise with the growing popularity of catalytic converters on
new motor vehicles.
Nisshin Steel, Japan's leading producer of stainless steel pipes for exhaust
systems, will provide technical assistance for the next five years for the
Terni facility, where a new high-frequency production line is to be
installed next year.
Ilva has been looking for outside partners for a number of its operations,
to ease its financial problems and meet commitments to the European
Commission.
The group may also try to bring in a European steelmaker as partner in the
Terni tubes venture.

JAPAN yesterday pledged closer co-operation with the EC, in a wide-ranging
review of its relations with Europe, Stefan Wagstyl reports from Tokyo. The
review follows a similar paper published by the EC a month ago containing
sharp criticism of Japanese trade practices, and prompting a protest from
Tokyo.
The foreign affairs ministry has eschewed the chance to hit back in its own
review. Mr Hisashi Owada, vice-minister for foreign affairs, is taking a
conciliatory line. In response to EC demands for steps to improve foreign
groups' access to Japanese markets, the report said the requests should be
dealt with under Gatt's Uruguay Round trade talks.
The paper welcomed European companies' efforts to enter Japanese markets and
improve their competitiveness in high-technology industries. The reviews
follow the EC-Japan declaration on bilateral issues signed by Mr Jacques
Delors, EC president, and Mr Toshiki Kaifu, then Japan's premier. Mr Kiichi
Miyazawa, Mr Kaifu's successor, is to meet Mr Delors and Mr John Major, UK
prime minister and the next European Council of Ministers president, while
visiting Europe next month.

FT  23 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Brazilian economy paces Mercosur's tariffs
timetable / A look at prospects for a S American customs union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOUBTS are surfacing about whether Mercosur, the proposed customs union
which groups Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, can meet its ambitious
targets.
Under the March 1991 Treaty of Asuncion, which created Mercosur, member
countries began cutting tariffs last November as the first stage of a
step-by-step reduction of all internal tariff barriers.
They are scheduled to disappear by the end of 1994, when a customs union
should be in place with a common external tariff, likely to be above 10 per
cent. After that, negotiations are scheduled to start towards a common
market.
The Argentine economy minister, Mr Domingo Cavallo, raised a furore last
month when he voiced doubts about whether these targets could be met. The
big question, he suggested, was the ability of Brazil to stabilise its
economy.
Although the subsequent fuss forced the minister to backtrack on his
statement, the state of the Brazilian economy is Mercosur's biggest problem.
The Brazilian government's lack of success in bringing down inflation and
stabilising the economy suggests it will remain so for some time.
The concern is that an unstable Brazilian economy will be reflected in sharp
fluctuations in exchange rates and therefore in the competitiveness of
Brazilian industry. The impact of these swings on Brazil's trading partners
will be amplified by the abolition of tariffs.
The concern of some Argentine businesses is heightened by their government's
own exchange rate policy. Argentina has achieved a measure of economic
stability by fixing its currency to the US dollar since April 1991. With
Argentine retail price inflation running well above US levels, there are
worries anyway about Argentine competitiveness.
The Brazilian government position is still that 'the timetable is going to
be fulfilled.'
This is even though the potential advantages to the other members - Brazil's
economy is well over five times the size of the other three combined -
suggests Brazil's commitment to the customs accord may be weaker than the
other governments. As one senior Argentine official said: 'We have to
concede that Mercosur is probably much more important to us than it is to
Brazil.'
However, Brazil's new foreign minister, Mr Celso Lafer, has said: 'We think
of Mercosur as a platform for our competitive insertion into the world.'
Mercosur's importance, say senior officials, is as an instrument for
transforming the economy and improving competitiveness.
Brazilian officials insist that the timetable for tariff reduction is
already in place, and not for negotiation. They point out that a protocol on
dispute settlement was adopted in December, and that 1992 priorities include
practical issues such as hastening deregulation of transportation.
There are other difficulties, including fears that the impact of tariff
abolition is yet to be understood and that Brazil's industry constitutes a
threat to its neighbours.
The decision to aim for across-the-board tariff reduction, rather than a
product-by-product approach, was aimed at weakening the influence of lobbies
seeking protection for specific industries and at lending credibility to the
liberalisation policies.
However, according to Mr Winston Frisch, professor of economics at the
Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro: 'Given the existing productivity
differentials in some sectors, it is difficult to believe that the timetable
will be met in full as programmed. The likely outcome will be a revision of
the 1994 deadline to meet the structural adjustment problems of sensitive
products to a more realistic time frame.'
Mercosur has also decided to negotiate as a group with the US, with which it
has a framework agreement as a first step towards a free trade accord. There
are worries in Argentina that this means Brazil will slow the pace of the
group's negotiations on an FTA with the US. Moreover, the expansion of the
group to include Chile is likely to be delayed by Chilean worries about the
effect of Brazilian economic instability.
With or without Mercosur, general reductions of tariff levels are already
stimulating intra-regional trade. The potential for growth is significant:
only 15 per cent of Brazil's trade is with the rest of Latin America, of
which 9 per cent is with other Mercosur countries.
Brazilian officials expect trade between Brazil and Argentina to rise to
Dollars 4bn this year, up 30 per cent on 1991. Trade within the Mercosur
region expanded from about Dollars 1.6bn in 1985 to Dollars 4.9bn in 1991.
Brazilian exports to Mercosur countries totalled Dollars 2.3bn in 1991, up
77 per cent on 1990.

<TEXT>
IBM, the US computer maker, and Toshiba, the Japanese electronics group, are
planning to join forces in the development of a new generation of
microchips.
According to electronics industry executives in Japan, the two companies are
discussing a partnership in flash memory devices, a type of chip which could
eventually replace hard disk memories inside computers.
Such a development could greatly reduce the cost and weight of computers.
Unlike existing memory chips, flash memory devices retain information even
after the power to a machine has been switched off.
The two companies declined to comment on the discussions. IBM said it was
talking to various potential partners about the possible joint development
of various products, including flash memories.
Toshiba said it was discussing a possible partnership in flash memories with
another company and an announcement would be made 'soon'.
The partnership, if it goes ahead, would be an example of a growing trend
among electronics groups to pool resources for the development, manufacture
and even marketing of new products. Even for companies as large as IBM and
Toshiba, the investments needed for new products have become so daunting
that they are increasingly seeking to share risk.
Toshiba was among the first companies to develop flash memories but Intel,
the US microchip maker, was more successful in producing and marketing the
devices and has a world market share estimated at 80 per cent. Intel earlier
this year signed an agreement with Sharp, the Japanese electronics group,
for Sharp to make chips for Intel.
For both Toshiba and IBM, an alliance would create a large enough base to
challenge Intel. IBM was once reluctant to strike technology-sharing
partnerships with outside companies, but competitive pressures have forced
it to seek such alliances to stay abreast of the latest developments in
technology. IBM and Toshiba already co-operate in the production of colour
liquid crystal display screens.
Meanwhile, Toshiba is today expected to announce a separate partnership with
Apple, the US computer maker, in the field of multi-media, a business where
computer, audio and television technologies are combined to create
entertainment and business-use products.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Minimalist view of Euro-union: Former finance minister
Edouard Balladur voices caution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH and IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Edouard Balladur, the former French finance minister, leans against the
mantelpiece in his Parisian office and ponders the Maastricht Treaty on
European union.
More than a soupcon of scepticism hangs on the lips of the man who, if the
right wins next spring's legislative elections, is tipped by many to become
France's next prime minister.
A technocratic stalwart of France's Gaullist RPR opposition party, Mr
Balladur has argued for the treaty's adoption, but he takes a disdainfully
minimalist view of its impact. 'I don't think that things will happen in the
way described by the treaty. But we will apply the treaty - we will respect
our promises.'
Even if the treaty surmounts its ratification hurdles, and the EC succeeds
in patching up the problems caused by the Danish rejection, Mr Balladur says
that European monetary union - planned to take place by 1999 at the latest -
is by no means certain.
Whatever the language of the treaty, which talks of an 'irreversible'
commitment to a single currency run by a European central bank, Mr Balladur
emphasises that national parliaments will still have the final say.
'It is said that the process is irreversible. But the countries will have to
decide by unanimous voting on the rates of exchange for their currencies
against the single currency which will replace them. If this can only be
decided unanimously, then the process cannot be irreversible.' During his
period as finance minister between 1986 and 1988, Mr Balladur pressed the
cause of a joint European central bank. As officials at the Bundesbank have
long realised - and Mr Balladur himself now admits - this was all part of a
long-running French policy aimed at curbing the power of the German central
bank. Maastricht brought the French dream of Emu - European monetary union -
within reach. But Mr Balladur says the monetary union aspects of the treaty
would reduce the importance of the Bundesbank far less than many Maastricht
advocates hope.
Partly reflecting improved bilateral links between French and German
ministers and central banks, which Mr Balladur helped establish in 1987-88,
Franco-German monetary co-operation has been intensified during the last
five years. The experience has not, however, made Mr Balladur more
responsive to German views. He complains vigorously about the German
government's refusal to accept the name 'Ecu' (European Currency Unit) for
the planned single European currency.
'I think that the discussion (in Germany) is infantile. I don't see why one
should change the name under a German pretext. It's a French word
corresponding to an English acronym. I don't want to put the name into
question.'
Mr Balladur reacts acerbically to German insistence that the European
central bank should be located in Frankfurt to compensate the Germans for
the loss of the D-Mark. 'I don't want the European central bank to be in
Frankfurt. If we look at the question like this, then why shouldn't it be in
France?'
Additionally, Mr Balladur complains that the cost of German reunification is
helping to push up interest rates throughout the whole of Europe. 'If the
Germans had reduced their budgetary spending or raised their taxes rather
than increasing their indebtedness, German interest rates would be lower
than they are today.'
Mr Balladur also doles out criticism towards other EC countries. By opting
for the direct Maastricht route towards Emu, Mr Balladur believes that the
EC has taken the wrong course.
Europe would have been better served, Mr Balladur says, by agreeing to
proceed towards Emu 'on an experimental basis'. This would have involved a
European central bank issuing the Ecu in parallel to and in competition with
national EC currencies, leaving national central banks with their powers
intact.
This is similar to the course of action favoured by Britain in its
celebrated 'hard Ecu' proposals put forward in 1990. With the archness of a
man accustomed to handing out advice, Mr Balladur claims credit as one of
the sponsors of the 'hard Ecu' idea, which he says he suggested to Mr John
Major when the latter was Britain's chancellor of the exchequer. If Mr
Balladur does, after all, make it to the prime minister's office next year,
he and Mr Major may find they have time to exchange views on matters running
well beyond the Ecu.

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TODAY'S joint sitting of the two French houses of parliament for the
Maastricht vote, in the parliamentary chamber of the palace of Versailles,
is a rare event under the Fifth Republic which is now only staged for the
purpose of amending the constitution.
Since the Republic was founded in 1958, there have been only three previous
parliamentary sessions in Versailles; but all of these so-called congresses
were held to introduce technical reforms of the constitution, minor affairs
compared with today's heavily loaded session.
In 1963 the congress adjusted the dates of the annual sittings of
parliament; in 1974 it allowed parliamentarians to appeal to the
constitutional council; in 1976 it adjusted the rules for a presidential
election, to cover the death of a candidate during the campaign.
A much more important reform, to reduce the presidential term from seven to
five years, was launched by President Pompidou in 1973.
But after it had passed the national assembly and the senate, he allowed it
to lapse, because he did not think he could secure the necessary
three-fifths majority in the congress.
By contrast, the most important constitutional reform of the Fifth Republic,
the direct election to the presidency, was introduced by General de Gaulle
in 1962, through a popular referendum.
In the late 19th century, however, the Palace of Versailles was for a brief
period the regular seat of the French parliament. After the defeat of France
in the Franco-Prussian War of 1871, and the outbreak of the Paris Commune,
the French government and parliament retreated to Versailles.
At first the parliament met in the Versailles opera house, but in 1875 they
built a new assembly chamber in the Southern or Princes' wing of the palace.
After that the parliament met regularly there from 1875 until 1879, when it
moved back to the Palais Bourbon in the centre of Paris.
But the Versailles chamber remained in use during the Third Republic for the
parliamentary election of the president, and it continued to do so in the
Fourth Republic after the Second World War for the election of Presidents
Vincent Auriol (1947) and Rene Coty (1954).

FT  23 JUN 92 / French Maastricht vote today

FRANCE will today take a decisive stride towards ratifying the Maastricht
Treaty on European Union, when it completes the requisite revision of the
French constitution.
After six weeks of high-intensity debates in the National Assembly and the
Senate, the two houses of Parliament meet today in a special joint sitting
in the Palace of Versailles, amid general expectations that they will vote
heavily in favour.
Despite fierce resistance from a large section of the RPR Gaullist party,
and total opposition from the Communists, the constitutional amendments last
week secured large majorities in both houses.
The Senate voted 192 to 117, and the National Assembly 388 to 43.
The addition of these votes suggests the government should have no
difficulty in securing the necessary three-fifths majority in today's joint
session of 895 parliamentarians.
Coming on top of the big majority in last week's Irish referendum, a
successful vote in the French congress will be an important morale booster
for this week's European Community summit in Lisbon.
But even a comfortable majority in today's congress will still give no
guarantee that the treaty itself will be ratified when it is put to a
popular referendum in the autumn.
All recent public opinion polls have shown regular popular support for
Maastricht; the most recent survey, published over the weekend, gave 51 per
cent in favour and only 18 per cent against. This is a wider margin of
support than in previous polls, and should augur well for the referendum.
Government officials are acutely aware, however, that support for the treaty
could yet be jeopardised by the deep personal unpopularity of President
Francois Mitterrand. A weekend poll showed a further drop in Mr Mitterrand's
rating, with only 28 per cent approving of him and 58 per cent disapproving.
The only consolation for the government is that the Maastricht debate has
driven a deep split between the Gaullists and their regular conservative
partners in the Centrist and UDF parties.
These parties last week voted overwhelmingly in favour of the constitutional
revision, and their leaders have undertaken to campaign in favour of the
ratification of the treaty.
By contrast, the Gaullists are divided between those who are ambivalent over
the Maastricht Treaty, and those who are openly hostile; last week they
either voted against the constitutional revision (in the Senate) or
abstained (in the National Assembly).
This disagreement over the European Community, in which the Gaullists have
denounced their putative partners for 'collaborating' with the government,
is bound to continue at least until the referendum, and may handicap the
conservative parties in the run-up to the general elections next March.

<TEXT>
A SPLINTER group of protesting French farmers, Coordination Rurale (CR),
yesterday pledged to go ahead with its blockade of Paris from the early
hours of this morning, despite government warnings, writes William Dawkins
in Paris.
The group, formed late last year in protest against the growing moderation
of the main farmers' unions, plans to set up around 20 tractor road blocks
at strategic points between 30km and 50km from the centre of the capital.
They are angry at last month's European Community agreement to reform
agriculture policy by cutting prices and compensating farmers with direct
aid.
Mr Jacques Laigneau, the CR's president, said the roadblocks would stay
until the farm reforms were withdrawn or until the organisation judged it
opportune.
The signs are that the disruption will be limited, since the CR is in no
mood to confront the police after a warning by Mr Paul Quiles, the interior
minister, that the demonstration will not be permitted to impede traffic. Mr
Raymond Girardi, a CR leader, said yesterday that the organisation had
ordered demonstrators to avoid violence.
The main farming union, the FNSEA, is also unhappy with EC reforms, but
accepts that they cannot be abandoned and so prefers to negotiate.

THE European Commission has stopped Finaf of Italy and Procter &amp; Gamble of
the US from taking a dominant position in the lucrative EC market in baby
nappies, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels.
The two companies will be allowed to create joint ventures in Portugal,
Italy and Spain to exploit the market in sanitary protection products. But
at the insistence of the Commission, Finaf has said it will withdraw its
baby nappy activities from the deal and sell them. The bargain struck
between Brussels and the two companies should finally end the Commission's
long-running investigation, which began in November 1990.
Brussels cleared the deal last October on condition that minor changes were
made. That decision dismayed the two companies' EC competitors and consumer
groups which complained to the Commission that the joint ventures would
still give Procter &amp; Gamble and Finaf more than 50 per cent of the growing
EC baby nappies market. Two months ago, the Commission announced it had
changed its mind.

<TEXT>
RUSSIA was yesterday dragged further into conflict with other former Soviet
republics, as the violence round the edges of what had been a monolithic
Soviet Union deepened and intensified.
Mr Mircea Snegur, the Moldovan president, said his parliament must 'declare
war' on Russia, which he accused of directing the 14th Russian Army, based
in the TransDnestr breakaway 'republic' within Moldova, against Moldovan
forces.
Reports yesterday from the TransDnestr city of Bendery, which twice changed
hands between Moldovan and TransDnestr forces over the weekend, said
TransDnestr guards still commanded the centre of the town.
However, the Interfax news agency reported last night that tanks and
armoured vehicles were being moved up to Bendery from Moldovan bases, and
that MiG-29 fighter aircraft which had been handed over to the Moldovans
when the Soviet military pulled out were being readied for bombing raids on
the breakaway region.
Meanwhile, leaders of the South Ossetian region being besieged by the
military forces of Georgia, of which it is a part, said their only salvation
was in union with Russia.
Russia's parliamentarians view such a request sympathetically, but it would
put Georgia in direct conflict with Russia.
The South Ossetian leaders, talking to journalists in Vladikavkaz, the
Caucasus city which is the capital of North Ossetia - an autonomous republic
within Russia - said all possibility of a compromise with Georgia was over.
Mr Alan Chachiyev, deputy speaker of the South Ossetian parliament, said:
'The only chance we see is to join with North Ossetia in the Russian
Federation.'
Mr Akhsardek Galazov, the South Ossetian parliament's leader, said that if
Russia did not defend his people, volunteers would be gathered in North
Ossetia and sent down to fight the Georgians - 'and who knows where that
will end?'
At stake in these conflicts is the future allegiance of Russian, or
pro-Russian, minorities in regions under attack by forces of the countries
in which they live.
If Russia takes up arms in their defence - as both Mr Snegur and Mr Eduard
Shevardnadze, the Georgian leader, have accused it of doing already - it
opens the door for a host of other such actions, from the Baltics to Central
Asia.
Russian President Boris Yeltsin yesterday confirmed General Alexander
Rutskoi, the vice president, as the man in charge of these conflict areas,
an apparent sign of presidential approval of Gen Rutskoi's uncompromising
defence of the TransDnestrians and South Ossetians at the weekend, and of
his promise to assist them with Russian arms.
However, Gen Rutskoi's statements were roundly condemned by Mr Shevardnadze
and Mr Snegur yesterday as a 'declaration of war'.
Within Russia, the 'war party' seems to be gaining ground: Mr Sergei
Filatov, the deputy chairman of the Russian parliament, yesterday laid total
responsibility for the violence at the doors of the Georgian and Moldovan
presidents, and said that Russia should and would protect its army, its kith
and kin, and the peoples who wished to be allied to it.
The issue has become critical just as Mr Yeltsin and Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the
Ukrainian president, prepare for a session of talks today in the Black Sea
town of Dagomys.
These talks are expected to be prolonged to include discussions between Mr
Yeltsin, Mr Shevardnadze and the North and South Ossetian leaders tomorrow.
Mr Kravchuk yesterday called for the TransDnestr area - which has at least
as many Ukrainians as Russians in it - to be given federative status, the
first time he has leaned towards the Russian position on the issue.
However, the two presidents are expected to disagree sharply over the
division of the Black Sea fleet and of the status of the Crimea - which, if
Ukraine has its way, will not be discussed - as well as over division of
former Soviet property, which Russia will in its turn seek to keep off the
agenda.

FT  23 JUN 92 / France puts officials on trial over use of HIV-infected
blood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOUR senior French public health officials went on trial yesterday facing
charges of allowing the distribution of blood infected with HIV, as a result
of which 256 haemophiliacs have died of Aids during the past seven years,
writes William Dawkins in Paris.
The trial, expected to produce a judgment in October, was triggered by
complaints from haemophiliacs and bereaved parents. It could embarrass the
government, since the alleged offences took place in 1985, under the first
Socialist administration.
Around 1,300 haemophiliacs, including those who died from the mistake, were
infected, nearly 45 per cent of all haemophiliacs in France. Mrs Georgina
Dufoix, social affairs minister at the time - who has not been charged - has
admitted to being 'deeply responsible but not guilty'.
This is the biggest recorded disaster in French medical history and has
sparked off a complete reorganisation of blood distribution in France.
So far, the government and insurance companies have paid FFr200m (Pounds
20.3m) in compensation to victims, but this is only a small fraction of the
total expected bill.
The allegedly contaminated blood was distributed by the CNTS national blood
transfusion centre, which has a monopoly on blood supplies.
According to the prosecution, the four men allowed the blood to be
distributed, knowing that it was infected and that it could have been made
safe by a heat process already in use in the US, Britain and Germany. A
government report published last year suggests they were awaiting the
development of a rival French process. Two of the defendants, Dr Michel
Garretta, former director of the transfusion centre, and Dr Jean-Pierre
Allain, head of research and development there, are charged with deception
over the qualities of the blood they sold, for which they could be
imprisoned for up to four years.
The others, Prof Jacques Roux, the government's former director general for
health, and Dr Robert Netter, former director of the national health
laboratory, are accused of failing to help people in danger, which carries a
sentence of up to five years in prison.
Mr Garretta has argued on television that he and his colleagues are being
made scapegoats and that the government should widen the investigation.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Italian banks increase prime rate to 14%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERAL Italian commercial banks yesterday raised their prime rate from 13.5
per cent to 14 per cent in reaction to a series of increases in short-term
money rates by the Bank of Italy last week.
The central bank's moves were aimed at shoring up the lira. Pressure on the
lira eased slightly yesterday as the markets had time to take a more
measured judgment of the impact of the Irish referendum vote on Friday in
favour of the Maastricht Treaty.
Ever since the Danes rejected the treaty in a referendum at the beginning of
the month, businessmen and bankers have been concerned that the process of
closer European integration would be slowed and the resolve of the Italian
authorities to tackle the country's deteriorating public finances would be
weakened.
As a result the lira has come under heavy pressure and the bank has been
forced to intervene both in the foreign exchange markets by selling D-Marks
and by raising domestic interest rates. Yesterday the lira was being traded
at 755.9 against the D-Mark. This compares with the 765 floor against the
D-Mark permitted under Italy's commitment to the narrow band of the European
Exchange Rate Mechanism.
Early on Friday when the outcome of the Irish referendum was still
uncertain, the lira was being quoted at 757.8 against the D-Mark. Then as
the result clarified the lira strengthened slightly to 756.5.
The cost of the central bank's support operations in the foreign exchange
markets over the past two weeks is not known. However, in supporting in the
domestic market, the bank has been obliged to raise short-term interest
rates in the past two weeks by more than 2.5 points.
By last weekend the rates paid on short-term repurchase agreements with the
commercial banks had reached almost 15 per cent.
The delicate state of the lira and such high interest rates have added
urgency to the consultations of Prof Giuliano Amato, the deputy leader of
the Socialist party, to form a new government.
Prof Amato was given the job of forming a government last Thursday and hopes
to have a programme outlined to present to parliament by the end of this
week. Prof Amato will be obliged to come up with a quick mini-budget to cope
with the public sector deficit which has on current projections overshot the
1992 budget estimates.
Instead of a public sector deficit held down to L128,000bn (Pounds 58bn)
latest projections suggest this will reach L175,000bn by the end of the
year.
The new government is thus faced with devising means to find an extra
L47,000bn, either through raising revenues or by cutting spending.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Tilbury ferry faces royal displeasure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OPERATORS of one of the oldest ferry services in Europe have been told
to cease services or face the Crown's displeasure.
Ferries linking Essex and Kent across the Thames have operated continuously
since 1086. But lawyers acting for the Crown now say the service must stop
because it 'is a breach of our client's rights'.
The Crown Estate, which owns and purchases land and property on behalf of
the Queen, has demanded an immediate suspension of crossings between Tilbury
and Gravesend, currently operated by White Horse Ferries. White Horse has
decided to defy the order and continue services for the 250,000 passengers
who use the crossing each year.
The company, which is upgrading the route as part of its plans to operate
long-haul ferries into London, said it purchased rights to the crossing last
year when it bought the route from Sealink-Stena, the ferry operator.
The Crown Estate, however, claimed Sealink-Stena's route licence was
non-transferable and said it should not have been sold. 'We've told them to
cease operations. They don't have a licence as far as we're concerned,' it
added.
The Crown claims White Horse has the right to carry passengers in one
direction only, from Gravesend to Tilbury, but not back again. River
licences from Tilbury are issued at the discretion of the sovereign, who
inherited them in the 15th century.
Mr Peter Lay, joint chief executive of White Horse, fears that the Crown
Estate, which saw the value of its property fall by more than 12 per cent in
1990, is trying to extract a high price for a new Tilbury licence.
'Their motives are financial. They want to hold us to ransom,' he said
yesterday. The Crown Estate declined to comment on the possible costs of a
new licence but hoped talks could resolve the dispute before services are
suspended.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Survey on A-Z of Computing (27): Transfers move to the fast
lane - Z-Modem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GRUMBALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRANSFERRING files can be a nightmare. Consider this scenario:
After a long night grappling with the regional sales figures you have just
10 minutes to get them on to the MD's desk in New York. You have agreed with
a colleague in the New York office to transfer the file via a pair of modems
and you each have a terminal emulator running on your PC.
You dial and the telephone answers. The other end asks you how you would
like to transfer the file. It offers a bewildering array of names such as
X-MODEM, Y-MODEM-g, Compuserve Quick B+ and so on. You hit the 'PgUp' key
and your terminal emulator displays a similar list but with totally
different names. Sadly, you have no idea what goes with what or which is the
best.
In desperation you pick one but the program then indicates that it will take
an hour to transfer the file. You gulp but decide to go ahead. After 45
minutes, the line drops and the transfer fails. You have to start all over
again. Later, as you collect your P45, you wonder: 'Could I have done
better?'
File transfer between machines has a long and chequered history. The
earliest attempts used a simple cable between the two PCs and simply
squirted the data down. A simple checksum (usually just adding all the
characters together) indicated whether the data had arrived successfully. If
not, you started again.
For a lot of applications, this was enough. However, problems arose when the
receiving machine could not keep up with the sender. Developers then put in
'flow-control' so that the receiver could tell the sender to pause while it
wrote the data away. This was expanded to incorporate the detection of
errors and the receiver could then ask the sender to re-send a chunk of data
that had not transferred correctly. These were the first file transfer
protocols.
In 1976 Ward Christensen, an American, published a simple file transfer
protocol in a magazine. He called it X-MODEM and it allowed two machines
from different manufacturers to transfer files. Because it was free, it was
very widely taken up and is still in use today. It transferred data in
blocks of 128 characters and the receiver sent back a single character to
indicate whether it had received the data correctly. If not, the sender
would re-send the data.
X-MODEM was simple but it was relatively slow for large files. Various
people then extended the X-MODEM specification to make blocks longer and
dubbed them Y-MODEM. Unfortunately, there was a lot of divergence and there
were several Y-MODEMS.
Various vendors and services also introduced their own proprietary protocols
with different characteristics and names. All addressed different areas of
weakness. Being proprietary, the details were rarely if ever published, so
take-up tended to be slight.
Chuck Forsberg, another American, was commissioned to produce a new file
protocol which would be published for the benefit of the computing
community. He called it Z-MODEM and incorporated the ability to transfer
files using X-MODEM and Y-MODEM as part of it. Z-MODEM had a number of
advantages: it was very fast, it could re-start a transfer that had failed
and it could take advantage of modern error-correcting modems. Z-MODEM had
sophisticated error detection mechanisms and sensible recovery when an error
was detected. Above all, it was free and fully published.
While Z-MODEM may now be a standard in the PC world, the other computer
communities such as Unix also developed their own protocols such as Kermit
and UUCP. Many of these have implementations on the PC although the converse
is not true. As a result, communications between different families of
computers may still be difficult (especially with mainframes).
Companies need to ensure that they all have a common communications
standard. Some companies may choose to buy a single communications package,
possibly with its own proprietary protocols. However, it is unlikely that
this will cover all the permutations required in a typical set-up with a mix
of mainframes, minis and PCs.
The wise manager will ensure that any communications packages used have at
least one protocol common to all of them. This is likely to be Kermit
(developed by a US university), or X-MODEM. This gives a baseline, even if
it is not the most efficient or robust. Where the communications links are
heavily biased in a particular direction, such as PC-PC, a better
communications protocol such as Z-MODEM should be used as well. As with any
strategic decision, it needs to be communicated to all the staff involved.
Sadly, there is no reliable error detection/correction system available for
employees.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Survey on A-Z of Computing (26): New bugs play havoc in the
office - Yankee Doodle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BANKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF COMPUTER users had never heard of Michelangelo, by March 6 this year, the
name was firmly fixed in their minds. On this day, the anniversary of the
Renaissance painter's birth, the computing world held its breath as it
waited for the Michelangelo virus to activate and destroy data stored on
thousands of computers around the globe.
Computer viruses - so named because of their similarity to human viruses in
the way they enter and 'infect' the 'body' of the computer have become one
of the greatest problems facing users. With nick-names like 'Yankee Doodle',
they can be benign, doing little more than announcing their 'infection' of
the system with an on-screen message. At their worst, however, they can
cause incalculable damage to the information a corporate user holds.
As computers grow in power and sophistication, and as more business users
come to rely on systems for critical applications, the results of infection
by a virus have grown from being an annoying interruption to a major
catastrophe.
As a result of massive publicity of the virus, users were able to take
precautionary measures and the effects of Michelangelo were limited. But the
potential for disaster is still great.
A computer virus is usually a small program written in such a way that it
will be automatically transfered from one computer to another without the
users detecting it.
The two most popular methods of implanting a virus are by attaching it to
the boot sector of a floppy disk, or by making it work itself into another
application program.
Its effects can vary enormously. It may simply put a message on the screen
to announce its presence, or disrupt the information displayed - text can
break up on the screen or characters being keyed in may appear to fall into
a heap at the bottom of the screen. Such effects are annoying, but need not
be terminal to the computer system or the data it holds.
Others, however, carry with them what those in the virus-hunting business
refer to as a significant 'destructive payload'. One version of the 1701
virus is said to reformat a computer's hard disk on any day between October
1 and December 31 of any year except 1993. Reformatting removes all the data
stored on a disk.
Time bomb viruses are date-driven in this way, watching for the date and
time counters of the computer to come round to preset values before
activating their 'payload' - the Michelangelo virus waited for the birthday
of the artist to activate itself while 'Friday the 13th' wreaks havoc only
when the computer's date counter comes round to a 13th of the month that
falls on a Friday.
Like many human viruses, they infect by contact and their success is based
upon the willingness of individuals to share information and applications
programs with each other, usually by swapping disks. Once an application is
copied from a floppy disk to a hard disk, the system is infected and the
destructive payload is ready to be activated. As soon as another file is
copied to floppy disk, the virus goes with it to infect another computer.
This can even happen with what users would think are brand new, 'clean'
disks from established suppliers.
Novell is not alone in having had to withdraw disks from sale because it was
discovered they were contaminated. With the growth of public-access
electronic mail and Bulletin Board Systems (BBS), such as CompuServe and
CompuLink, a new method of infection has been found. The viruses which bury
themselves in applications programs, many of which are freely available on
these systems, can be readily distributed to a wide range of users if one
user uploads an infected file.
Many of those who write viruses view the task purely as an intellectual
exercise. Others, however, have malicious intent. Perhaps the most notorious
of these was the so-called AIDS virus, which was sent out embedded in disks
containing information on the disease. This was an alleged blackmail where
the virus, once run, would install itself in the computer and then demand
payment of Dollars 378 for the supply of an antidote.
There is much individual users can do to protect themselves from virus
infections, however. The most obvious step is to stop or cut down on disk
swapping and sharing, which may indirectly help reduce software theft and
illegal copying.
Several anti-virus packages are available, such as Norton's Anti-Virus from
Symantec and Dr Solomon's Toolkit from S&amp;S International, and their regular
use is recommended, especially after each new application is copied from
either a floppy disk or BBS.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Survey on A-Z of Computing (24): Distinctions are starting
to blur - Workstations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID TEBBUTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNTIL RECENTLY, workstations were easy to define. They were technical
computers aimed at high resolution graphical or computationally intensive
work. But workstation makers began to see new opportunities in the general
business market. As they began to push downmarket towards the high end of
the personal computer business, PC hardware and software companies pushed
upwards, blurring the boundaries between the two.
While all workstations are characterised by high performance graphics
screens, connection to a network and the ability to execute several tasks at
the same time, they can be put into three distinct groups - entry level,
technical and super workstation - differentiated by power, price and
expandability:
Power. The power of these machines is usually measured in SPECmarks.
According to Dataquest, the entry level machine in 1991 scored between 11
and 26 SPECmarks, the technical machine scored 24 to 72 SPECmarks and the
super workstation rated 50 to 159. Such is the pace of change in the
workstation market that the entry level machine is expected to reach 50
SPECmarks in 1992. No doubt those further up the scale will also increase in
power.
Price: Dataquest gives price brackets for the three groups as follows: entry
level - up to Dollars 15,000; technical - between Dollars 15,000 and Dollars
60,000; super workstation - from Dollars 60,000 to over Dollars 200,000.
These are based on 1991 figures and, as with all developments in the
computer industry, these may be expected to drop.
Expandability: Most workstations use a reduced instruction set computer
(Risc) processor. Risc processors deliver about twice the power of the older
complex instruction set computers (CISC) for the same price. This is done by
removing the 80 per cent of the little used instructions from the silicon.
The removed instructions can still be carried out by executing those
remaining in various combinations.
In terms of revenues and volume shipped, Sun has been the most successful
workstation maker. Its machines are based on its own SPARC chip which it has
licenced to other manufacturers in a bid to set a standard. Hewlett-Packard
presently has the most powerful processor in its Precision Architecture (PA)
chip, although Digital Equipment Corporation has announced its intention to
create an Alpha Risc chip with astonishing capabilities.
IBM has its RS/6000 series of workstations and has teamed up with Apple and
Motorola to create single-chip implementations of the RS/6000 processing
unit, to be called PowerPC. Like Digital's Alpha chip, this has yet to make
a public appearance.
One workstation manufacturer which has not yet announced a Risc-based
machine is NeXT, the company created by Apple founder Steve Jobs. Within the
company, there seems to have been some confusion about whether the machine
was to be sold as a high end Macintosh, as a developer's machine or as a
business workstation.
In the US, the present machine did well in the educational market. In
Germany it notched up considerable success as a UNIX-based business
workstation. NeXT computers UK, learning from the German experience, is
repositioning itself as a supplier of business machines.
Although the NeXT computer is powered by Motorola 680X0 CISC processors and
appears to be trailing in hardware technology, it is probably well ahead of
the game in software development tools.
One of the nightmares for any company using computers is the huge cost of
application development. One way to reduce this problem is to employ
re-usable code. This approach - Object Oriented Programming (OOP) - enables
new application developments to be bolted together from pieces of code
already written for earlier applications. Research suggests that this can
speed application development up to ten times.
NeXT already has an object-oriented developers environment - a collection of
programming and development tools - called NeXTstep. Apple and IBM recently
joined forces to form Taligent, a company whose first product will be an
object-oriented operating system. At a stroke, these companies have
legitimised the approach that NeXT committed itself to five years ago.
Sun intends to establish its Solaris application development environment on
both SPARC and Intel processors. Windows NT is expected to appear on
multiple platforms. And NeXTstep has been ported to, that is made to work
on, the Intel 80486 platform. Microsoft has the advantage of an large
existing user base which may want to stay with a Windows-type system, rather
than having to learn something new. Like Microsoft, IBM/Apple intends to
make the fruits of its labours available on multiple platforms.
Within three years, the distinction between low end workstations and high
end PCs will disappear.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Survey on A-Z of Computing (25): Think-tank kept from
limelight - Xerox PARC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP MANCHESTER

<TEXT>
XEROX HAS been on the leading edge of information systems technology for
more than two decades. Much of the original research came from Xerox's Palo
Alto Research Center (PARC) in California and spawned many of the key
developments in modern computing from Ethernet local-area networks, through
graphical user interfaces and windows, to laser printer software and
object-oriented design.
But in spite of its impressive record, Xerox has derived only limited
commercial benefit from PARC's innovations.
Apple Computer is more likely to get the credit for inventing the graphical
user interface as a result of the success of its Macintosh computer, and
software company Novell is the main beneficiary of the success of the
Ethernet technology used in local area networks.
Similarly, credit for the recent innovations in object-oriented design - a
new and promising approach to the design of information technology systems -
is destined to go to others.
This is partly because of Xerox's policy of supporting its employees in
research into commercial products. Many of the innovations from Xerox PARC
have been the basis of start-up companies which have gone on to gain
considerable success in the commercial market - with Xerox's blessing.
Xerox PARC was founded at the end of the 1960s as a think-tank and, during
the early 1970s, researchers at PARC developed a stream of technologies
which have had enormous influence on computing.
Xerox was keen to invest the huge profits from sales of its photocopiers in
maintaining an edge in the emerging office systems market. It effectively
gave the PARC teams a blank cheque with which to come up with technology
which would not only set the world on fire but also give Xerox a lead in the
new style of computing.
Xerox's researchers such as Alan Kay, one of the leading thinkers at PARC,
saw computing becoming increasingly 'personal' and set about devising ways
to make computers easier to use.
The results of this work led to the Xerox Star system - the first commercial
computer to use a mouse and a 'windows' graphical user interface (GUI). The
Star was introduced in 1981 but it was too expensive (and too advanced) to
become commercially acceptable.
Xerox saw the Star system as an extension of its concept of an entirely
automated office system. It was to be the 'window' into an electronic
network based on the Ethernet technology and incorporating computers,
communications and office peripherals such as photocopiers.
It was not until the mid-1980s, however, that this idea gained commercial
acceptability in the form of the Apple Macintosh - a personal computer which
embodied Star's technology at an affordable price.
Xerox PARC's contribution did not stop there, however. In 1982, John
Warnock, another Xerox researcher, left PARC to set up Adobe, a company
specialising in printing technology. Warnock spent four years at PARC
working on a powerful language which could be used to describe printed
material.
The language, Postscript, quickly became the standard method of passing
printing instructions from a computer to the new laser printers coming on to
market.
The combination of the Macintosh and Postscript (which Apple also adopted)
created a new type of application - desktop publishing.
Xerox PARC's influence has not waned and, if the promise of object-oriented
systems is realised, it will continue to be important well into the next
century.
Object-oriented design views information technology as a set of
self-contained 'objects' which combine both data and processes.
An example of an object in common use is the standard printer driver
programs, used on PCs.
A driver is a general-purpose software module which can be used by other
programs to access a peripheral device such as a printer or a display
screen.
Most personal computer programs use standard driver programs, which means
that the special code need only be written once, instead of being
incorporated in every program.
This concept of re-using standard code is central to object-oriented design.
The first serious use of this approach originated at Xerox PARC with a
software environment called Smalltalk. It was used as the basis of the
software for the Xerox Star systems and has had a persistent influence over
the development of object-oriented technology across the computer industry.
Object-oriented technology now looks set to become the basis for future
computer systems of all types.
Meanwhile, the ripples from Xerox PARC are not going to stop. Notebook
computers, one of the most promising new areas for the 1990s, also had their
origins at PARC. Alan Kay, who now works as an Apple Fellow, conceived the
idea of a powerful notebook computer called the Dynabook in 1968, but the
technology was not sufficiently advanced at the time to build one.
He says he expects notebook computers to look 'very much like the Dynabook
model' by 1995.
Sadly, Xerox is unlikely to derive much commercial benefit from this and
will have to be content with knowing that it was there first.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Survey on A-Z of Computing (23): Market's new kingmaker -
Value Added Resellers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE VALUE Added Reseller is the new kingmaker of the computer market. The
'added value' of the acronym refers to the intangible assets which go to
make a successful installation. These can include the supply of appropriate
software, bespoke adjustments, expert advice, and ongoing support to the end
user.
The commodity to which these things are added is usually the 'box' or
hardware. But the raw material with which the VAR works might include a
piece of software such as a database, on top of which the VAR has developed
a specific application.
So what differentiates the VAR from the good old fashioned dealer, or retail
outlet? The answer, certainly in the case of good VARs, is expertise. VARs
are often also developers, who have built up valuable experience in their
particular field. Some even employ consultants to analyse the needs of their
customers in specific 'vertical market' areas such as manufacturing, retail,
or banking.
Dealers, software houses, systems integrators and consultancies have
metamorphosed into 'VARs' by dint of forming alliances with particular
hardware suppliers, such as Olivetti, Unisys, ICL, DEC, and Hewlett-Packard.
In recent years, even IBM has come to rely on 'third parties', particularly
in the sales of its mid-range AS400 computer, which needs dedicated
applications .
The transition has been quickened by the spread of open systems, dating from
the advent of the MS-DOS PC operating system, and now perpetuated with Unix
for larger multi-user systems.
This gives software developers and their users a wide choice of equipment
under one operating system, on which their software will run with few or no
changes.
Alongside this development has come users' recognition that the software is
the most expensive part of the investment in a new system. It has to be
long-lived, allowing for enhancements and even tailored additions.
Accordingly, users look for experts who can understand their business
problems, and supply the right software to solve them, recommending a
reliable hardware environment in which to run it.
The hackneyed phrase for this single-source shopping is 'selling solutions',
an activity now fronted almost entirely by VARs.
Previously, hardware suppliers used to commission a software house to write
a suite of programs for its new computer, into which both user and developer
would then be locked.
Now, the VAR can operate with a chosen hardware supplier, but without being
locked in. This ongoing relationship usually includes volume discounts,
investment in training on the quirks of the hardware vendor's kit, and joint
marketing programs. It does not include exclusive loyalty: some VARs have
two or more regular sources of hardware, supplying whichever is more
appropriate or profitable in a particular installation.
Now that the hardware comes bundled with the application instead of the
other way round, VARs have become the axis of the software industry. On them
turns the decision of the end-users, who depend on VARs and their alliances
for a pre-selection of software environment and hardware.
The relationship between hardware vendors and VARs is complementary, as they
introduce business to one another. But the VAR now holds the balance of
power in a market where the developers and suppliers of hardware and
software no longer know who all their end-users are.
Far more than a middle man, the good VAR can more or less dictate the choice
of hardware to the user. The choice of a software environment takes as much
skill as hardware selection, especially as the VAR may have to integrate
standard packages in the area of accounting, and so on, with his own
specialist package.
Research among users carried out on various Software At Work topics in the
FT has shown a marked increase in the end-users' reliance on the VAR as a
single-source supplier. So how does the VAR choose the software, and the
end-user choose the VAR?
A good example is Integra, whose specialist packages include sports and
leisure centre administration. The Football Association, a discerning IT
buyer, chose Integra for its Sports-PRO software, but also wanted accounting
and electronic office systems. Integra has supplied Multisoft Premier
accounting software, with Uniplex office automation software, integrated
with its own package for the specialist business of fixture lists, players
registrations, and gate receipts.
The Pounds 200,000 contract, won in the face of competition from 14 other
suppliers, includes tailoring for the Unix and PC hardware, also supplied by
Integra. The Football Association's chief accountant, Mark Day, chose
Integra 'because they demonstrated a good understanding of our business.'
Integra, he says, played a critical role in the installation - 'we used them
completely: we have strong commitment to the concept of partnership.'
Integra in turn, has software partnerships. Originally an Altos reseller,
four years ago, it sought a database as the basis for new applications, and
chose Informix for performance, reliablility, and flexibility in tailoring.
Now Informix wins new users with every installation of Integra's Sports-PRO.
The point of these alliances are that the user gets the best possible
service, without the problems of integrating products from different
sources. Increasingly, the VAR is picking up the extra titbits that vendors
used to supply: consultancy, training, and business analysis.
As a market sector, VARs are now important enough to be served by their own
magazine, The VAR, a stylish glossy which concentrates on market trends,
innovations, and often comments on vendors' marketing incentives, or lack of
them. Vertical markets and business know-how are a constant theme.
Users trust the judgement of people who are closer to their businesses than
hardware vendors can ever be. It's not what you buy - but who you buy it
from that matters in the world of the Value Added Reseller.

leader - Unix
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BANKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH IT is now central to many applications of computing, the Unix
operating system has had a chequered history and arguably suffered from
decisions made by Bell Labs, in the US, and its parent company AT&amp;T.
Having developed Unix in 1969 as a multi-tasking operating system that could
be portable to a number of different computer architectures, Bell and AT&amp;T
decided to maintain rigid control over it. Licence fees were high - far
beyond the barrier of economic sense for most computer suppliers or users.
Few invested in it, to the point where universities, with their need to
enable many computer science students to work at the same time, were the
main Unix users.
If not for the fact that students liked the system, it might have died
through this marketing error. Working in industry after college, graduates
started demanding the system or, if they joined a manufacturer, developing
their own 'clones'.
The result was many operating systems, with names usually ending in 'ix',
that were broadly similar. Unfortunately, they were not similar enough,
creating big problems for the computer industry and its users.
Unix has, in theory at least, significant benefits, not least of which is
its theoretical portability to different computer architectures. But because
the initial marketing position was not changed until 1981, no single,
unified version was available.
Yet over this period, Unix developed into exactly what users wanted. Users
started to rebel against being 'locked in' to one computer architecture from
one manufacturer. No supplier, not even IBM, could furnish everything a user
might need, and users realised that, to get what they wanted, computer
systems had to be much more open.
The first step was to identify an operating system that was not specific to
a particular make of hardware, and the only real option was Unix. As
suppliers realised this was what users wanted, a growing number of alliances
and consortia were formed to fulfil these needs - such as Unix
International, Open Software Foundation and ACE.
The latest and most thorough incarnation of Unix - System V Version 4 (SVR4)
 -is for the first time a single, unified implementation of the operating
system. Now under the control of a separate company, Unix Systems
Laboratories, the prime advantage of SVR4 is that the same source code is
now available across the board. It is also relatively easy to port the
system to a wide range of computers.
This allows the possibility - not yet fully exploited by applications
software companies - of making an application available on a wide range of
different computer systems. Companies such as Oracle, Informix, Uniplex,
Lotus and Word Perfect are now moving this way.
A key advantage of Unix is its file structure, which allows large systems to
be built with full file protection when many users are working on the same
system. It is also well suited to driving high-resolution, high performance
graphics systems. This has been at the heart of the growth of Unix
workstations, initially in the CAD/engineering sectors, but latterly in
financial management work.
Unix can work equally well as a multi-user system or in a network. In the
latter role, it is relatively tolerant of other systems, such as PCs. In
fact, Unix can accommodate other operating systems by enclosing them in what
is termed a 'shell'. This connects it to the host Unix environment.
Unix has always been at the forefront of communications, particularly
Electronic Mail. This is still one of its strong points.
Unix's power and flexibility give it a leading role in network management
and it is significant that the leading PC network software supplier, Novell,
has been working hard to ensure connectivity with Unix. Its graphics
handling and performance also make it the preferred system in many desktop
applications, where the PC can be limited.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Survey on A-Z of Computing (21): The art of enjoying
homework - Teleworking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GRUMBALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMAGINE taking just 30 seconds to get to work. No traffic jams, no sweaty
tube trains. No fear of British Rail strikes or price rises. Teleworking
might be able to do this for your job.
In its simplest form, teleworking is a logical extension of executives
taking work home at the weekend. Many do it because it is the only way they
can finish work without interruptions.
The problem with taking work home is that the infrastructure of the office
is missing - the telephones, faxes and photocopiers. It still implies trips
into the office to deliver completed work and to collect the next batch.
Teleworking attempts to obviate visits to the office by working entirely
from home. To do this it needs to provide a communications system between
the worker and the central base. Several levels are possible. For some
professions, a telephone link may be enough. However, nearly every job needs
some paperwork and the fax becomes the next step. To avoid multiple
telephone lines, modern faxes allow intelligent switching between incoming
voice and fax calls and may also provide an answering machine.
Electronic mail (e-mail) is a better solution, especially where the company
already uses it extensively within its operations. An e-mail from home is
indistinguishable from one typed at an office desk. An effective teleworking
strategy almost always involves electronic mail at some level. Sadly, a lack
of standards has hindered the development of a dominant technology, unlike
the prevalent Group 3 fax. Even corporate electronic mail systems often lack
the ability to manage dial-in links effectively.
A number of companies are seeing the benefits of teleworking. Many of them
are technology-based companies such as computer manufacturers, but others
are traditional businesses such as solicitors. There are two principal
benefits to teleworking: the cost savings and the fact that employees love
it.
Costs may be reduced in a multitude of ways. The most obvious is the savings
in office rentals. Even with the slump in property prices, city rents remain
relatively high. Given that a single office worker needs a minimum of 100
square feet of space at say Pounds 12 a square foot, the savings start at
Pounds 1,200 a year. Then add in all the other facilities demanded by the
average City worker and the benefits mount. There are start-up costs, of
course. The new teleworker needs an extra telephone line and a fax. If
e-mail is involved the worker will also need a terminal or a PC. Usually,
they can simply take the one they already use.
Costs may also be diminished by employing cheaper staff. Once a London-based
company has set itself up to use teleworking, it could then recruit new
people in more distant locations, such as the North. Salaries become much
lower for the same quality of people. One US insurance company uses staff in
Ireland in this way, significantly reducing its costs and providing
employment to more deprived areas.
Women having babies traditionally faced a tough choice: they either had to
abandon their career or leave their children with paid strangers.
Teleworking enables mothers to combine a career and a family. The company
benefits by retaining the experience and the loyalty of its staff.
Teleworking is not without its own difficulties. Many jobs have a high
degree of face-to-face involvement. This is difficult to sustain in the
teleworking environment. Improvements in technology may reduce this soon
with the advent of the video-telephone.
Some jobs require attendance at a particular place. AA breakdown men would
be little use sitting in the comfort of their homes while drivers stand in
the pouring rain, head under the bonnet.
Some staff enjoy getting out of their homes - it is hard to imagine Rumpole
of the Bailey agreeing to work from home. In addition, there is a risk of
isolation and of loneliness among teleworkers. Companies that use
teleworking extensively stress the importance of regular meetings to
maintain morale.
Monitoring is a particularly fraught issue. Teleworking is very suitable for
activities that can be done as piece-work. It is much harder to manage where
work is less well defined. Managers worry about whether staff are actually
doing work or simply watching the Test match. The answer lies in structuring
work into measurable parcels or agreed performance levels. It is only an
extension of the problems faced in managing travelling sales staff, which
are already well known. Teleworking is a tool, not a panacea. It requires
management just like any business activity.
As technology improves and office costs continue to spiral upwards, it is
inevitable that teleworking will increase. It can significantly reduce
salary costs and allow companies to retain valuable staff. Once someone has
worked from home, it is very difficult to lure them back into the joys of
commuting.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Survey on A-Z of Computing (19): Functions the price paid
for performance - Risc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ACRONYM derived from the term 'reduced-instruction set computer', a Risc
is a special type of microprocessor offering high performance at the expense
of functions.
Risc microprocessors provide a limited number of so-called 'primitive'
operations, which give the best possible performance. They have become
established as the engines of the new wave of workstation computers from
companies such as Sun Microsystems and the Hewlett Packard-owned Apollo.
They are also being used increasingly by hardware manufacturers as the basis
for new ranges of computers.
Although the idea of Risc has existed since the beginnings of computing, the
first serious attempt to create a computer based on the principle goes back
to the early 1970s when IBM's Thomas Watson Research Center in the US set up
a team to build one. It was called the 801 and was the forerunner of IBM's
RS/6000, its current range of Risc workstation systems.
Simultaneously, researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, and
Stanford University were developing Risc machines. This research led to the
development of Risc-based products by Sun Microsystems and MIPS Computer.
Although these Risc processors work slightly differently, they are all based
on the same principle - that a smaller repertoire of functions can deliver
higher performance.
Computers are built from two basic semiconductor components or chips: memory
and processor. Memory chips are used for storing data and program
instructions. Processor chips are used to execute the program instructions.
Traditional processor chips - sometimes referred to as 'complex-instruction
set computers' (Cisc) - provide a wide range of instruction functions to
move data around memory, to read and write to peripheral devices and to
alter the flow of logic in the program. These functions are called the
chip's instruction set and, in Cisc computers, are implemented in a special
code - a microcode. The microcode translates high-level language programs
into code that the processor needs to operate.
IBM's mainframe computers and the Intel chips used in personal computers are
based on Cisc design, with a large instruction set. This means many
high-level program instructions, which would be written in a language such
as Cobol or 'C', can be executed directly or with only a few microcode
instructions.
There is a penalty to be paid, however. The Cisc approach sacrifices chip
performance for functionality.
Risc technology, by contrast, turns this on its head and, by reducing the
number of functions a chip has to perform and eliminating the microcode, it
can increase the speed of operation. The price is an extra layer of
software, needed to translate complex, high-level language instructions into
a sequence of primitive Risc instructions.
This penalty can, however, be turned to an advantage. The intermediate layer
of software between the Risc chip and the program can be optimised according
to the application. A standard commercial data processing application, for
example, does not need complex mathematical functions - so these can be
omitted. Similarly, a computer designed to act only as a database server,
does not require graphics functions so, again, these can be omitted.
Furthermore, the translation process, or compilation, which converts the
high-level program into Risc instructions, can also be optimised.
Specially-written programs - compilers - carry out this translation and can
be specifically-designed to take advantage of the design of the Risc
processor.
The bottom line for manufacturers is that Risc technology can be produced as
a commodity and optimised according to its end use. This reduces production
costs and brings economies of scale.
Hardware builders are increasingly moving their new product ranges to Risc
technology. In some cases they have replaced parts of existing systems. IBM,
for example, has made use of its Risc technology in sub-systems of its
mainframe and minicomputer product ranges.
The main use of Risc, so far, has been in high-performance workstations,
particularly in the technical area. Sun Microsystems, with its SPARC Risc
design, and Hewlett Packard, with its Precision Architecture (PA) Risc, have
attracted supporters from across the industry. Fujitsu, Philips and Texas
Instruments are among those licensed to build SPARC chips. Hitachi,
Mitsubishi and Convex Computer are among those signed up to use Hewlett
Packard's PA-Risc.
This wide support for Risc from other manufacturers has led to the
technology being used in workstations for general business applications.
But although attention has centred on the use of Risc in workstation
computers, it is also making inroads into special-purpose computers. The
960, a new Risc chip developed by Intel, has recently been incorporated in
communications processors from Retix and Hughes LAN Systems.
The flexibility of Risc processors assures them a future in the mainstream
of computing and, although they are unlikely to replace Cisc processors
completely, they will become increasingly important.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Survey on A-Z of Computing (20): Cray One supremacy
challenged - Supercomputers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLANCE OUT of the plane window as your flight comes in to land and watch a
selection of flaps and slats reshaping the wing. The pilot alters the
airflow to maintain balance and full control of his aircraft. Stupendous
mathematical calculations went into designing that wing. Airflow was
assessed at every stage of the flight. That required the science of
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and the only way to accomplish painless
CFD is to use a supercomputer.
Supercomputers sit above the traditional top-end machine, the mainframe.
This division becomes blurred, with IBM offering a vector-processing model
of its biggest box, the 3090. And vector-processing is the key to
supercomputing. A vector processor takes a string of numbers and hurtles
through mathematical options in a quarter of the time a conventional
mainframe would take.
While CFD calculations can now be performed on a number of machines it is
the Cray One that has come to symbolise supercomputing. It is a tall curved
cabinet with comfortable seats projecting from the base. The amiable
exterior conceals a processing power that can play games with the airflow
over, under and through a jet engine.
British Aerospace uses a Cray to experiment with new designs for the Airbus
wing. When BAe isn't running calculations on it, Rover cars borrows the
machine for crash simulation. Familiar from a dozen car commercials, these
tests entail massive crumpling of metal. The supercomputer can predict how
folding metal contracts and where that impact will end. It is a lot cheaper
than wrecking cars every week.
. The Cray has become part of a technological myth. Supercomputers were the
repository of secrets. Intelligence services used them to break codes.
Nuclear physics were thrashed out on their processors. NASA bought them by
the dozen to keep the space programme on track.
Under the Cold War Cocom rules on high technology the export of any Cray
machine was attended by rigorous security checks. Both the British and
French nuclear weapons programmes were wholly dependent on the US releasing
Crays for sale. US intelligence officials were livid when a supercomputer
delivered to the French atomic research programme resurfaced in China.
Adrian Hiley, principal engineer at Rover Group, describes a supercomputer
as 'the fastest machine available to do the job'. It is a definition that
threatens the supremacy of the Cray - the advent of powerful computer
workstations based around advanced microchips has transferred some
supercomputer functions to desktop machines. And supercomputer makers are
suddenly under pressure to deliver value for money. A Cray can cost around
Pounds 1m, but as Hiley puts it 'you get a heck of a lot more for your money
now than you did five years ago'.
The latest workstations dedicated to graphics can generate flight images
good enough for training aircrew. Previous simulators called on the services
of a supercomputer to conjure up a fast-changing environment.
Parallel processors - single computers housing several processing devices
working in unison - have also encroached on supercomputer business. Used to
turbo-charge large databases, the parallel processor can churn through
millions of records per second. Littlewoods dedicates a parallel processor
from Teradata to analyse purchase patterns among direct mail customers.
Any method of bringing processing power to bear on complex problems may lay
claim to the supercomputing mantle. Executive Information Systems (EIS)
filter vast amounts of data through a network to put appropriate facts in a
digestible form on the right desktop terminal. The end result is simple, and
so it should be. But the EIS vendors are muscling in on the intellectual
territory of the supercomputer.
The physical limits of supercomputer's silicon chip have nearly been
reached. With each improvement in speed it becomes more difficult to
maintain a vital low temperature. By the end of the decade the supercomputer
will be overheated from within and overtaken from without by fresh
technologies.
Supercomputers have seen off one challenge. The Inmos Transputer, billed as
Great British Invention and the Computer On A Chip, was envisaged as a poor
man's supercomputer. The idea of parallel processing was harnessed to a
unique manufacturing technique. Practical applications proved hard to come
by and the early promise of the Transputer has yet to be realised. And the
inexorable trend towards smaller machines means that the Cray One is assured
of a place in history. To the human eye it remains the most striking
computer ever built.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Survey on A-Z of Computing (18): Efforts now starting to
bear fruit - Quality Assurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
IN SPECIALIST sectors such as military and aerospace, where lives depend on
the robustness of a computer system, quality assurance techniques have been
in use for many years.
But it is only recently that the banner of quality has been taken up in the
world of commercial computing. In the past couple of years, significant
progress has been made in the definition of quality assurance standards and
there is an increased interest in applying them to commercial systems.
There are good reasons for the lengthy gestation period for quality
assurance standards - particularly when applied to computer software.
Quality is difficult to measure in software and it has taken the past two
decades for the techniques to advance sufficiently to make them worthwhile.
It is also expensive - especially if it has to be grafted on to existing
systems many years after they were first built. As ex-IBMer Robert Pirsig
observed in his book, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, 'quality
isn't something you lay on top of subjects and objects like tinsel on a
Christmas tree. Real quality must be the source of the subjects and objects,
the cone from which the tree must start'.
The computer industry has, therefore, sought to find ways both to define
quality and to ensure that it is built into computer systems from the start.
In the past couple of years, this effort has begun to yield benefits.
Earlier this year, the first results from the Pyramid Project, an
EC-sponsored project which forms part of the Esprit initiative, showed that
the use of quality measurement techniques brought an overall reduction of 35
per cent in the number of faults found in software. The Pyramid Project was
set up in 1990 by a group of European manufacturers and software suppliers
to devise measurement techniques and assess their impact in development
projects. Its members include Data Logic from the UK, Siemens Nixdorf from
Germany and Veridatas from France.
The experience drawn from the assessment shows that software quality is
measurable and attainable, but it must go hand-in-hand with good staff
training and tight management of development.
The pioneering work on quality assessment and assurance has its roots in the
military requirements for high-quality systems.
The earliest practical standard for quality procedures was the
NATO-sponsored Defense Standard 05/21 which emerged about 15 years ago. This
formed the basis of the UK standard for quality assurance formulated by the
British Standards Institute - BS 5750 - in the late 1970s.
At the same time, NATO devised a series of quality standards known as the
AQAP requests - AQAP 13 being the one which related to software quality.
During the past decade, the emphasis has shifted to international quality
standards which would be appropriate to all systems - whether for military
or commercial use.
Commercial organisations, such as British Telecom, British Gas and the
British Shoe Corporation, began to influence the process and the result was
a complex set of three quality standards.
The most important of these in the UK is BS5750. If a software developer is
accredited for this standard, then it follows that it is also effectively
accredited for the other two - although the present bureaucratic process
requires that each be registered separately. This means, for example, that a
company which wants to sell software internationally, must do so under the
appropriate quality standard. The BS 5750 quality standard is divided into
three parts, each covering a different aspect of systems development. It
lays down standards of quality management to create the right environment
for building systems where quality can be tracked and checked - although in
itself it is no guarantee that the end product will be a quality one.
The first part of BS 5750 covers the requirements for design and manufacture
and is the most important part for software developers. The second part
covers installation and the third part distribution.
The standard lays down the methods and procedures which are required to
ensure that software is produced to a standard throughout its entire
life-cycle. Companies which are accredited under the standard are required
to demonstrate that they have appropriate management procedures in place to
achieve the standard.
Software developers are increasingly using quality standard accreditation to
give them a marketing edge - although accreditation does not necessarily
guarantee that the end result is a quality product. It is, however, far
better than no standard at all and quality assurance procedures are likely
to become mandatory for large software suppliers in the future.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Survey on A-Z of Computing (16): The global village gains
momentum - Open Systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS no such thing as a truly open system. Not yet. An open system
should run across and with any other hardware and software. Even given the
necessary technology, it would take several purchasing cycles before the
world found itself using the same standard. In so far as an open system
exists, the MS/DOS software standard can claim to be a world leader. But
MS/DOS rode to fame on the back of the IBM PC. And IBM yields to open
systems only when change becomes inevitable.
Openness used to be in the eye of the vendor. But users discovered that
banding together and demanding the right to switch hardware platforms
produced results. Gradually, the big suppliers were dragged, kicking and
screaming, into agreed standards. For the computer industry shifted towards
compatibility reluctantly and has been looking for ways to recoup lost
profit margins ever since.
The Unix operating system, once derided as non-commercial, is a good example
of big operators rewriting history. Unix emerged from AT&amp;T's Bell
Laboratories, and as such was unlikely to find favour with AT&amp;T's arch
corporate rival, IBM. For years Unix struggled against the stigma of beards
and sandals - a fine operating system for techno-hippies on the West Coast,
but not one you'd want to introduce to the company computer.
Gradually it was rewritten to include user-friendly and practical features.
Smaller suppliers adopted it while pressure groups grew up demanding bridges
to Unix. Large manufacturers were reluctant to promote an operating system
whose prime virtue was that it could run across different hardware
architectures, provided those architectures were tweaked to accommodate it.
Championed by a variety of interest groups, Unix stormed the bastion of IBM.
It made its first appearance under the guise of AIX. IBM sells plenty of
other people's products and ideas, but never loses an opportunity to stick a
'Big Blue' badge on them. Endorsement by IBM might have been the end of the
story. But the Unix world contained too many conflicting forces.
Unix International was backed by AT&amp;T and sworn to bringing vendors into
line with Unix. The Open Systems Foundation (OSF) promoted the IBM/Digital
Equipment line. The users stood back and remained suspicious of any tack
taken by vendors. Enter X/Open - an open standards promotion body claiming
to rise above vendor politicking. These organisations have advanced the
cause of open systems, although every step forward seems to be accompanied
by guerrilla warfare.
'Our mission in life is to expand the market in open systems' declared an
X/Open spokesman. The idea is to get independent specifications verified. A
recent example is the veteran ICL operating system VME. ICL took this
well-established chunk of software and added a layer of code that opened it
up to the X/Open standards. With a large user base and a recognised
pedigree, VME's conversion shows that open systems are a reality and X/Open
is a serious force.
While older systems catch up with common standards, new technologies emerge.
The information technology industry now incorporates open systems into
innovations, but users continue to band together. Old suspicions die hard.
The next generation of business computers will make imaginative use of
graphics and video images.
Advanced Risc Computer Specification (Arcs) machines are being developed by
a consortium of hardware and software concerns. This co-operation is vital
to ensure true compatibility. It also recognises the power of user opinion.
Whatever assurances were given about common interfaces, Arcs technology
would face a rough ride if purchasers feared future compatibility headaches.
Arcs and its accompanying software will pull in other business equipment
such as fax machines. Bill Gates, chairman of software giant Microsoft, says
he is in talks with office equipment manufacturers to create gateways to fax
and photocopier machines. The next generation of office computer will
incorporate a broader concept of open systems, embracing what are currently
stand-alone technologies.
There is a contradiction between open systems and technological progress.
Freeze the development of computer systems, let users and suppliers spend a
decade sorting out connections, and the open systems globe would be a lot
closer. Nobody has suggested such a move, least of all users who keep
discovering new requirements to be featured in next year's product.
The real achievement of the open systems movement is that its ideas have
become accepted in the same way as mainstream political parties now accept
the European Community. Like the EC, open systems is not meant to be a
utopia, just a means to a more practical world.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Survey on A-Z of Computing (17): Colour is starting to catch
up - Printers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID TEBBUTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVER SINCE papyrus was invented, most written and printed communication has
been monochromatic. Huge increases in computer power and storage capacities
have led to the introduction of colour at the display screen, but colour
printing technology has taken a long while to catch up. This is now
changing. Soon, colour printers will be available at desktop prices.
Users look for different characteristics in their machines. Some need to
print sprocket-fed, multipart, continuous stationery. Others want to print
on separate sheets of paper and only need one copy at a time. Others may
have special requirements such printing envelopes, or labels. Some users
don't mind noise, others will insist on near silence.
When personal computers first appeared, printers worked by hitting a carbon
ribbon on to paper with needles (dot-matrix) or with pre-formed characters
(daisy-wheel). The daisy wheel mechanism has almost died out and the impact
dot-matrix technology, in spite of many improvements is now giving way to
the new inkjet and laser technologies - even though the 24-pin dot-matrix
printer can produce print resolutions as good as a laser machine.
All dot-matrix printers are noisy. However, they can work with a variety of
paper options, including continuous, cut sheet and multi-part paper.
The laser and inkjet machines are almost silent in operation. The loudest
noise is that of the fan on the laser printer and the paper feed mechanism
on the inkjet. The laser machine works rather like a photocopier while the
inkjet squirts ink droplets at the paper. Both can print at least 300 dots
per inch in each direction, giving a crisp and professional image.
The problem of inkjets being smudgy are a thing of the past. They can now
match a laser printer for quality, although they run much more slowly. Where
a laser printer prints an entire page at once, the inkjet works by sliding
an ink cartridge back and forth across the page, edging the paper forward
between scans. Should anyone invent an inkjet with a wide, refillable,
cartridge, the days of the laser printer could be numbered - the inkjet does
its job silently with fewer of the environmental problems of the laser
printer.
Some inkjet printers take cartridges with multiple ink chambers, each
holding a different colour ink. This type of colour printing is available at
a low cost. The problem with this approach is that many office documents
still need to be printed in black ink. To achieve black on such machines,
all three colours need to be used - an expensive way of doing such work.
Printers with separate cartridges for each ink colour would be better. An
inkjet machine with four cartridges containing the process colours cyan,
magenta, yellow and black (CMYK), would satisfy the needs of both colour and
monochrome printing. The black cartridge could be replaced separately when
exhausted.
Colour printing can also be done using dye sublimation, thermal wax transfer
or phase-change inkjet technologies. Each of these strives to achieve
photographic quality and is therefore more at home in the studio than in the
office. According to Dataquest, colour laser printers will be available in
1993. Each of these technologies presents the user with a trade-off between
price, quality and speed. In terms of affordable colour, inkjet is certain
to take the lead.
One other important method is the use of a page description language called
PostScript. Instead of sending printing information to the printer character
by character, or dot by dot, PostScript sends a description of the page.
PostScript printers each contain a computer processor, software and memory,
which are used to interpret the PostScript instructions to provide the best
quality result.
The same PostScript page description can be used by printers of varying
resolutions and colours. PostScript makes the printers more expensive, but
it reduces the workload on the computer and produces the best results across
the widest range of printers.
As more printers are connected to computer networks, users are finding
themselves physically remote from the machines. This makes it difficult to
check things such as the paper status, or which fonts are installed on the
machine. It is inevitable that printers will begin to return more detailed
status information to users. Ian Mitchell, associate director of Dataquest's
document management group, said: 'It's time for printers to speak up for
themselves.'
He believes that 'inkjet is probably the new ground for commercial printing
of the future.
'I believe it will replace the 24-pin dot-matrix market within five years,
and will most certainly curtail the downward migration of current page
printer technology. I believe that colour will almost certainly be cheaper
on inkjet than laser.'

FT  23 JUN 92 / Survey on A-Z of Computing (14): Passing the buck avoids
headaches - Maintenance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAINTENANCE IS always a chore. Maintaining a computer system is a job you
would rather give to someone else. Traditionally, maintenance contracts come
with the purchase of hardware or software. When a manufacturer stipulates
maintenance fees, they can be high. If the supplier wants to pressure the
user into moving up to the next generation of machine, whittling down
support is a powerful inducement.
Then there's software. Old programs throw up unforeseen bugs. Only veterans
of that system can hope to sort out bizarre glitches. And experts wouldn't
be experts if they didn't know how to charge for their services.
One blanket solution to the headaches of maintenance is outsourcing, also
know as facilities management (FM) - An outside party takes over all or part
of a company's computer operations. FM has become widespread in the past
five years, with financial institutions in particular turning to third
parties to sort out their sprawling systems.
Some users are reluctant to sign over too much responsibility to an outside
concern. But in spite of initial cynicism it soon became obvious that no FM
company would survive if it left behind a trail of disaffected customers.
The Computer Services Association now includes a clause in its code of
conduct binding FM companies to ensure a smooth handover to replacement
suppliers.
Maintaining human resources is part and parcel of keeping the machinery
ticking over. With an outsourcing deal, the contractor can take over
managing technical staff. That means somebody else is responsible for
retaining scarce specialists.
All of these policies are cheaper than a DIY solution. But in the current
environment that is not good enough. Now corporate information technology
departments are setting up shop on their own. Their commercial experience
and fierce attitude to overheads suggests that the FM pioneers, who owe
their original appeal to economic pressure, may be up against serious
competition.
With several mainframe computer sites and a complex data processing
requirement, Barclays Bank has executed an about turn in computer
maintenance. All servicing on branch automation equipment is carried out via
a third party, Olivetti. But the core mainframe support is now covered by
Barclays Computer Operations (BCO), a year old spin-off business.
BCO sprang out of Barclays' need to maintain 'dark site' computer
operations. This means unattended running - computing with the lights off.
Two IBM mainframes tick away in a locked room, tapes are loaded
automatically. It should, and normally does, run like a dream. But there
will always be occasions when an engineer has to sort out a problem. The
question for Bruce Hotter, managing director at BCO, was how to maintain a
high level of skill when the requirement for that service was infrequent.
The answer was to retain a small team of technicians within BCO and loan
them out across the 13 IBM and IBM-compatible mainframes owned by Barclays.
Only by using BCO as an external source could the bank keep the right people
on call at a realistic price. 'We only have 10 software people in the IBM
mainframe operating system arena to cover the UK. That's pretty efficient.'
says Hotter.
BCO's emphasis on efficiency is ruthless. Hotter reveals that BCO has
recently made an important human catch. 'We're employing an ex-IBMer, on the
engineering side, for three months. We'll bleed him dry on how to cut
maintenance costs. He's already paid for himself 10 times over.'
Third party suppliers are used for some mainframe maintenance. 'Our policy
is to make good money by always going out to competitive bids. This gets the
price down. We're always squeezing. We make the system work for us.' The
system in question is the persistence of hardware manufacturers in chasing
after pricy maintenance deals.
The Hotter school of no-nonsense maintenance calls for constant questioning.
'Do you really need 24-hour cover? It might be cheaper to get a limited
call-out service instead. Going without round the clock service hasn't
caused us a problem and it's significantly cheaper.'
BCO now employs 1,100 staff controlling 13 mainframes, 800 Digital Equipment
and Tandem processors and a network of 50,000 connected terminals. The
organisation has a turnover of Pounds 150m and is bracing itself for full
commercial operation in competition with the maintenance and FM industry.
Hotter reviews BCO's achievement to date modestly. 'We're beginning to get a
bit of street cred.'
Maintenance is about burden shifting. But it is critical to remember that
signing up for maintenance involves making a purchase. No company with a
cost-conscious approach to buying hardware and software should fall for a
maintenance deal without some hard bargaining first. There's no need to lose
your wallet in the coding jungle.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Survey on A-Z of Computing (15): Users look for reliable
connections - Networks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
   Judith Massey
NETWORKS ARE the logical extensions to computers. As soon as users begin to
build up digital information on their own systems, they need to look for a
way to share it with colleagues - as well as a way to gather more
information from other sources.
Today the use of networks is being driven faster than ever before. Now the
low cost of hardware makes the idea of a personal computer on every desk a
reality, organisations need a data communications infrastructure to speed
the flow of information around their company. New applications based on the
distributed client/server model are also fuelling demand, because they rely
heavily on the use of fast, resilient networks that link desktop to server.
Demand for networks is measured by research companies in different ways.
Surveys of the market measure the number of network connection cards being
installed, or how many network servers are being bought. Researchers also
count the number of organisations installing network operating systems. The
operating system is used to manage and direct the flow of data and files
around the network, which runs over a basic cabling infrastructure. PCs are
connected to the network via network connection cards, and network servers
are used to store applications and data.
Whichever way you look at it, the use of networks is growing fast.
International Data Corporation (IDC) reports that of 60m to 70m PCs
worldwide, 25m are already connected to a network. Market Intelligence
Research (MIRC) says that European sales of PC local area network (Lan)
operating systems will double in 1992. In 1991, this market was worth
Dollars 1.1bn, in 1992 it will be worth Dollars 2.2bn, says MIRC.
Turning to large European organisations, recent research from Dataquest
finds that over 50 per cent of PCs are now connected to Lans. These
companies often install Lans to replace other computing hardware platforms.
More often than not, companies install Lans to replace stand-alone PC
systems. Lans are also installed to replace traditional PC to mainframe
links, or proprietary multi-user hardware.
The main reason to install Lans instead of proprietary mid-range hardware is
related to price and performance. The cost and proliferation of PC hardware
and of UNIX-based network servers has fallen fast during the past five
years. The Lan platform can embrace existing PCs, and it can be expanded
easily when new users join the network.
The choice between mid-range and Lan platform is not the only one. Large
organisations also need to decide which network operating system and which
cabling type to use. But many of the choices have now disappeared because
network vendors have the ultimate goal of connecting every desktop computer
to every back office server computer - it is no longer in their interests to
lock users into one particular way of communicating.
The two main vendors of network operating systems in the 1990s are Novell
and Microsoft, with Banyan, IBM, Digital Equipment (Dec), Hewlett-Packard
and others following behind. For the moment Novell is the industry leader,
with a 60-70 per cent share of the world Lan market. Microsoft recently lost
several exclusive deals with key vendors such as 3Com, H-P and IBM, but is
marketing Lan Manager more vigorously today than it did in the 1980s. It is
likely that Lan Manager will also be a key component of Microsoft's imminent
new operating system, Windows NT.
In spite of the popularity of Lans, observers still believe that more
widespread use of Lans for corporate systems is held back by the lack of
real network applications. Only a handful of applications, such as Lotus
Notes and Oracle Server, exploit the speed and flexibility of Lans as
vehicles for client/server applications.
During the 1980s, Lans spread through organisations almost unchecked. This
has created a crisis of complexity for some companies, who find it difficult
to manage network traffic, demand for extra capacity, network security and
software distribution.
These problems arise because PCs and Lans often grow outside the aegis of a
central information systems department. It is not surprising that many
organisations are looking for better management tools from network vendors,
or that server manufacturers, network operating system developers and
network bridge suppliers will all announce better, more resilient and more
secure network components in the early 1990s.
As global markets emerge, there is a growing need for more reliable wide
area networks (Wans). It is likely that user demand will drive the
development of more cost-effective Wan links outside the traditional public
telephone and leased line options. These will include wireless and satellite
links, as well as a smarter use of existing telephone networks.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Survey on A-Z of Computing (13): IBM puts pressure on market
 -Leasing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'BIG TICKET' capital equipment, such as airliners, earth moving machinery
and mainframe computers, is frequently leased rather than bought outright.
The primary reason is cost, but in the case of computers, leasing is also a
defence against corporate and technological change.
One thing is certain when acquiring a computer: at some point - probably
much earlier than anticipated - more capacity will be required. On average,
customers tend to outgrow the capacity of a mainframe within two years. The
dilemma for the customer is that buying sufficient capacity for, say, five
years could be prohibitively expensive with mainframes costing several
million dollares apiece. Selling a second-hand machine at the right price
can also be a problem.
Technology also changes, often bewilderingly quickly, bringing substantial
improvements in cost-benefits. A company failing to keep up with
technological progress can find itself paying far more than its rivals for
its data processing, putting it at at a competitive disadvantage.
A leased computer, however, can be upgraded or, subject to the terms of the
lease, swapped for something more powerful. The leasing company takes
responsibility for procuring and, ultimately, disposing of the machine.
Leasing companies, therefore, have a long, if somewhat chequered, history in
the computer industry.
Total revenues annually worldwide are in the region of Dollars 25bn. The
leading companies include Comdisc, AT&amp;T Capital Corporation and GE in the US
and COS Computer Systems, Promodata and ECS in Europe.
The natural risks of the business have been accentuated in the past few
years by the new and aggressive presence of IBM, the world's largest
computer manufacturer. Leasing depends on a stable market for second-hand
computers with trustworthy residual - or agreed resale - values. In
practice, only IBM and to some extent Digital Equipment computers are used
widely enough to establish reliable residual values.
There are many varieties of leasing contracts, but typically the deal works
like this: the leasing company provides its customer with the mainframe but
first it has to find a 'head lessor' - a bank or finance house - to put up
the money for the machine. The head lessor collects the leasing payments. At
the end of the lease, however, the leasing company makes its money by
relocating the computer to another customer, either as a new lease or as a
second-hand sale. Without something extra to add ginger to the deal, such a
business would be a marginally profitable and deadly dull affair. Leasing
companies show their entrepreneurial flair in their ability to 'manage'
their portfolio of leases; that is, to persuade their customers frequently
to change or add to their systems.
In the past few years, the business has been characterised by intense
competition and slower growth. IBM's emergence in the market has put
pressure on all its competitors, operating as it does, one of the world's
largest leasing companies. The rest of the industry is now dealing chiefly
in second-hand machines: no matter how large an order it places, no company
can hope for a better deal than IBM's own leasing subsidiaries get from the
parent company.
An example of the friction between 'Big Blue' and its leasing competitors is
the vexed issue of 'altered memory', currently the leasing industry's top
concern. The issue speaks volumes about the state of the industry.
A key skill in managing a portfolio of leases is the ability to configure
systems to a customer's requirements.
That may involve refurbishing and refitting second-hand machines;
semiconductor memory may have to be altered.
In the past, IBM checked these rebuilt systems and approved them as
qualifying under IBM's maintenance scheme. Systems so certificated by IBM
would have a recognised second-hand value.
IBM now complains that it is discovering examples of counterfeit memory
boards in rebuilt machines which are being passed off as the genuine
article. It says these boards, even if built from genuine IBM memory chips,
are poorly fabricated and likely to fail.
Systems with counterfeit boards do not qualify for maintenance, IBM says,
neither can the value of the system be guaranteed.
The industry replies that rebuilt boards are an essential part of its
business and that there is no evidence they fail any more regularly than
genuine IBM components. It believes IBM's concern is simply a manoeuvre to
persuade customers to buy new and second-hand machines only from IBM.
The way the issue is resolved may determine whether an independent leasing
industry survives.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Survey on A-Z of Computing (12): Decisions based on
expertise - Knowledge-based Systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE knowledge-based system is an expert system by any other name. Such
systems distill the knowledge of one human expert into a set of rules, to
automate processes of judgement and decision-making which would otherwise
rely on expensive and scarce human skills.
The first commercial fruits of 'artificial intelligence,' AI, expert systems
were predicted at one time to become a boom. The promise was that human
efforts would be aided by computerised stored knowledge: experience would
not be lost to the organisation, even if the expert staff left or retired.
End-users were too cautious - or maybe too intelligent - to believe the
hype. The wave of companies, products, and publications promoting expert
systems has now subsided to leave an invisible tide-mark. As a result of
this flop, end-users have been slow to adopt expert systems in applications
where they might well have been appropriate.
However, in a new, supposedly more trustworthy guise, 'knowledge-based'
systems, they have become established as working tools in several specific
markets.
When academics started experiments with expert systems, the idea was to
simulate human thought processes. This involved some 'understanding' of
language by the systems, which proved to be largely a matter of establishing
and recognising relationships.
Early systems were too ambitious and unfocused, experimenting as much with
logic and language as they did with 'knowledge.' But the UK's academic
research in AI was virtually obliterated 20 years ago, following the
Lighthill Report. Instead of killing the embryonic discipline, this demise
encouraged its proponents to find commercial incentives to develop their
ideas further.
The breakthrough came with enormous leap in the capacity of computers.
Knowledge-based systems demand a substantial amount of processing power.
Where the human brain flashes in instant understanding, the knowledge-based
system has to plod though every possibility, comparing and matching the
problem with its stored 'experience.'
When posed a problem, the knowledge-based system responds with a series of
questions, comparing the response with its repository of 'knowledge,' and
deducing the most likely answer. Some systems are also able to 'learn'
dynamically, adding to their store of knowledge when encountering a new
permutation of facts.
Developers of knowledge-based systems use the term 'shell' to describe the
software framework into which the experts feed their knowledge. The
'knowledge engineer' is a sort of middle man between the expert and the
system, establishing the database and its relationships, in effect
translating the expert's proffered observations into a structure which can
be explored and used by anyone.
This means unravelling the strands of logic which combine into human
'experience.' It is not always easy, even for an expert, to define exactly
how they know something: it can be 'just a feeling.' The really difficult
trick is to map this sort of sensitivity - which is what makes experts truly
expert - and translate it into a structure which relies on logical
relationships.
The system 'learns' these, and in turn is able to teach those who use it,
reducing the mystique of a subject into a set of rules. But like many human
experts, knowledge-based systems are loth to deliver definite opinions and
predictions. They deal in statistical likelihood. One of the first and most
famous working knowledge-based systems was concerned with the diagnosis and
prescription of drugs.
Even so, it did no more than 'suggest' a solution, and was never used in
anger.
Knowledge-based systems work well in situations where there is finite range
of possible answers.
They have triumphed in such environments as banking, where they can be used
to check credit rating. Here the outcome is limited to 'yes, we will lend',
or 'no, we will not.' However, the number of questions to be addressed
before the conclusion is reached make this a good candidate for streamlining
the process with a knowledge-based system.
Other enterprising experts have built systems for commercial use. For
example, in the field of recruitment, head-hunters can now put the inexact
science of psychometrics to work by putting the candidate in front of a
knowledge-based system which cuts down the amount of interviewing time
drastically.
Computer systems, with their 'if-then-or else' logic, are better at dealing
with definites than they are with shades of grey. Software developers often
claim to have an element of 'expertise' built into their products. This
usually means that there are a number of possible pathways for action, and
the software will be pre-programmed to 'recognise' specific circumstances
and make the appropriate choice, usually automatically.
This differs from the true knowledge-based system, where the intervention of
human decision-makers will always be needed to reach the final judgement.
The system is a mere aid, a tool to save time and enable non-experts to
trace their way through a process of deduction. Its output can only be as
good as its programming, and ultimately its source of expertise.
Perhaps the computer industry understands this better than those outside it.
It is noticeable that those organisations using knowledge-based systems are
generally steeped in information technology, and aware of its limitations as
well as its potential.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Survey on A-Z of Computing (11): Rivalry a thorn in side of
progress - Joint Ventures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP MANCHESTER

<TEXT>
THE WORLD recession has meant hard times for the computer industry. But it
has also precipitated rationalisation and consolidation that was long
overdue. Rival companies merged, jobs were cut and an unprecedented round of
co-operation swept through the industry.
Research and development is another area which has seen some surprising
alliances. The best-known joint venture of this type was announced by IBM
and Apple in the summer of 1991 when the two companies agreed to pool
research and development to create a new generation of workstation
computers.
Under the name Taligent, the joint venture company has brought together
staff and expertise from IBM and Apple to develop both the hardware and
software for the new computer.
IBM contributes its long experience of reduced-instruction set computer
(Risc) technology and Apple brings its advanced operating system software,
based on 'object-oriented' principles. The combination of high-performance
hardware and the new wave of object-oriented software, which is easier to
use and less costly to develop and maintain, promises to give IBM and Apple
a formidable product.
The IBM/Apple joint venture is the tip of a huge iceberg. Both companies
have numerous agreements with and investments in other suppliers.
Earlier this year, IBM took a Dollars 100m in French hardware manufacturer
Groupe Bull. Part of the agreement allows Bull to use the same Risc hardware
technology to be used by Taligent.
IBM also has a portfolio of joint venture agreements with software
developers under the umbrella of its Application Development (AD)/Cycle,
IBM's strategy for computer-aided systems engineering (Case) development.
Apple, too, has joint ventures with many software companies and,
increasingly, with hardware companies. In addition to its agreement with
IBM, Apple has a distribution agreement with DEC.
IBM and Apple are not the only ones with joint venture fever. The trend
towards open systems, where different manufacturers computers are expected
to work together, has spawned numerous industry groupings which aim to
promote specific versions of standards.
Although these organisations are not joint ventures, they are examples of
industry co-operation on a scale which would have been impossible a few
years ago. They are jointly financed by their members and the technology
standards they produce are widely adopted.
The Open Software Foundation (OSF), sponsored by IBM, DEC and Hewlett
Packard among others, has produced a specification called the Distributed
Computing Environment (DCE). This lays down rules for the way software works
in distributed computer networks based on the Unix operating system. It
means that a customer who buys Unix systems from a company that conforms to
the OSF/DCE standard, can be assured that the systems from other supporters
of the standard will also work in the same network.
Unix International (UI), a rival open systems group sponsored by AT&amp;T, Sun
Microsystems and others, has produced another specification for distributed
open systems called Atlas. Although Atlas is distinct from Unix , it is
based on Unix and incorporates some of the OSF/DCE specifications which has
led to some confusion.
Not all joint venture groups of this type are successful and it is an
indication of the persistent rivalry in the computer industry that one of
the most publicised of these came to grief recently.
The Advanced Computing Environment (ACE) group, launched in April 1991 with
a deluge of publicity, aimed to create a specification for a new wave of
co-operative computing based on an evolution from current industry
standards. At the hardware level, ACE embraced the Intel microprocessor chip
 -which is at the heart of most personal computers  - and a Risc
microprocessor from US chip builder MIPS Computer.
ACE also specified two operating systems which would be the foundation for
applications software for the computers using the Intel and MIPS chips. One
is a version of Unix from the US software company Santa Cruz Operation
(SCO). The other is a development of the popular Windows software from
Microsoft - Windows New Technology (NT).
The supporters of ACE agreed to base their future product lines on a
combination of these four elements, aiming to evolve a new range of
computers from different manufacturers which could use the same applications
software.
In spite of broad support across the industry, the ACE initiative faltered
earlier this year when the financially-troubled MIPS Computer was taken over
by the US graphics workstation builder Silicon Graphics - a move which put a
question mark over MIPS Computer's role as an independent supplier.
Shortly afterwards Compaq, one of the key sponsors of ACE, withdrew and SCO
announced that it was shelving development of its version of Unix for ACE.
Although the venture is not dead, it is unlikely to have any great influence
in the future and many of ACE's original sponsors have re-directed their
efforts.
Microsoft recently signed an agreement to develop Windows NT for DEC's
computers and Bull, which was using the MIPS Risc chip, has defected to IBM
and will use IBM Risc technology in its new computers.
Joint ventures in the computer industry have become a pre-requisite for
survival in the age of networks. But they are compromises at best and the
inherent rivalry between computer companies - in hardware and software - is
never far from the surface.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Survey on A-Z of Computing (10): 'Big Blue' attacked by
smaller fry - IBM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International Business Machines, 'Big Blue', is the colossus of data
processing, a sprawling giant whose annual sales (Dollars 64.8bn in 1991)
dwarf those of its nearest rivals; it spends more on research and
development than many of them turn over in a year.
Few industries have ever been so dominated by a single company. IBM's
position as leader of the computer world, however, seems at last to be under
attack from a succession of smaller, more agile competitors.
It lost money in 1991, an event that would have been unthinkable a decade
ago. It is going through a profound corporate reorganisation that will see
it lighter by up to 80,000 people by the end of 1992. And it is no longer
finding it easy to dictate the pace and direction of data processing as it
did in the past.
IBM was the role model for computer manufacturers, indeed for much of
corporate America, from 1960 to 1990. Established in 1925 from the bones of
the Computer Tabulator Recording Company, it grew up in the image of its
founder, Thomas J Watson, an opportunistic, fiercely competitive
Presbyterian who started business life hawking sewing machines and small
pipe organs from a horse-drawn wagon.
An apprenticeship with the National Cash Register company taught him the
finer, and sometimes less scrupulous, points of marketing. But he was
essentially a man of the early part of the century; it was his son, Tom
Watson Jr, born in 1914, who understood the potential of the computer and
steered his father's creation to its commanding position in data processing.
The key to its success over the past 30 years has been its domination of the
mainframe market; in its heyday, more than 70 per cent of mainframe
computers worldwide were supplied by IBM. It launched the System /360
mainframes in the 1960s, one of the first and most comprehensive efforts to
establish a family of compatible machines.
A range of machines of different capacities to suit different sizes of
company but all running the same software proved to be just what the market
wanted. The machines were an immediate success. IBM frittered its advantage
away, however, by building special machines for special purposes; by the
1980s, it was making seven incompatible computer families and was forced to
introduce a concept it calls Systems Applications Architecture (SAA) to
persuade customers it was seriously trying to resolve its electronic Tower
of Babel.
Marketing is one of its strengths, however. It understood at an early stage
that data processing managers were both influential in the decisions which
led to the purchase of data processing equipment and vulnerable to pressure
from senior management who had no interest in computing as long as it
provided the information they wanted. Hence the proverb: 'Nobody was ever
fired for buying IBM.'
It has also been a leader in technical innovation, setting standards which
others have had to follow. Examples include the development of low cost
magnetic 'core' memory, the 'Winchester' sealed hard disk drive and reduced
instruction set ('Risc') technology. Risc processors now seem likely to
dominate the mid-range computing market.
Whole industries have grown up supplying either equipment which could be
tacked on to IBM's mainframes or compete replacements, the so called 'plug
compatible' market.
The 1990s ushered in a new era in data processing, an era dominated by
personal computers, corporate 'downsizing' to smaller, less costly systems
and open industry standards (for open, read not controlled by IBM). Profits
margins in this kind of business are tens of percentage points below the
level IBM is used to, and it is having to struggle hard to match its
overheads to its market expectations.
It still has the lion's share of the mainframe market, but that is now a
mature sector, growing at only a few per cent a year. It cannot claim to
lead in portable personal computers, workstations or supercomputers, three
of the most important areas of computing for the future. And while it
dominates mainframe systems software with operating systems such as MVS and
query languages such as SQL, it is engaging in a battle with the software
house Microsoft over the operating system of choice for today's high
performance personal computers. It has never been successful in applications
software.
As an organisation, IBM can seem paradoxical. Its corporate behaviour is
often a model of integrity yet few holds are barred when it is determined to
win an order or an argument. It employs most of the brightest people in the
industry and many of the time servers. It pushes technological research to
the limit but often markets lack lustre products.
The purpose of its current reorganisation is to produce a loose federation
of entrepreneurial units closely in touch with its customers and each with
its own profit and loss responsibilities. Success in the transformation is
by no means certain but competitors agree that only IBM has the
determination and resources to survive into the next century as a full line
computer supplier.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Survey on A-Z of Computing (9): New angles taken on
information - Hypertext
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDITH MASSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HYPERTEXT allows users to search large bodies of text, data and graphics
from a friendly, graphical front-end. It provides built-in links between
related concepts, subjects and areas of knowledge, making it easier for
users to amalgamate the data that is relevant to them at the time.
The technique is widely used in personal computer software to provide 'Help'
information. If, for example a user wants to know about a function in a
program, a detailed explanation can be called up using Hypertext technique.
Hypertext treats knowledge as a mountain of information to be viewed from an
infinite number of angles. This is a far more useful way to access
information than reading through a number of reference books, which present
text and graphics in a static, unchanging format.
But hypertext does not only allow infinite views of one set of information.
It also directs the viewer from one side of the mountain to another, and it
allows browsers to build composite views of different scenes of the same
mountain.
Looking at information in this way goes against the traditional view of
accessing data. Hypertext is closer in many respects to the spoken than to
the printed word. In both cases, there is a body of changing, free-form
knowledge that can be discussed and presented in appropriate formats for the
audience concerned. Parents tell stories differently to their children than
they do to friends and older relations, for example. They use the same basic
knowledge to tell different versions of a story, but use different formats
to do so.
Just as thoughts, experiences and language are changeable and amorphous
entities, so is the information that can be interpreted by hypertext
systems. Hypertext builds further on the accepted concept of storing digital
information on computers. This data is already much more flexible than a
printed equivalent. It can be electronically distributed among many users,
it can be mixed and matched with other digital information, it can be
changed and updated quickly and easily, it can be printed out, or it can
stay on the computer and just be read on-screen.
In another dimension, it makes it much easier to draw relationships between
different sets of data, or graphics, or even single words. An intelligent
hypertext system can also point users from one concept to another, open up
new applications or trigger external events, such as printing or accessing
another data source.
It will lead users back through the stages through which they have already
been, so that they avoid the feeling of being 'lost in space' that so many
on-line text retrieval systems engender.
The practical applications of hypertext have only recently emerged. The best
known generic application is probably the on-line help functions within
software packages, such as Microsoft Windows and Apple's System 7 operating
system. The widespread use of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) means that
there is a wider audience for user friendly, mouse driven hypertext help
systems than in the past.
The aim of software developers working with hypertext is to remove the need
for users to constantly consult bulky reference manuals when they want to
ask a question about a routine or a menu. Hypertext links allow developers
to 'second-guess' which areas of a manual users are likely to want to move
on to after asking their first question.
It is likely that a user of a word processor looking for help on how to use
external files will consequently need to know which files they can import,
for example. A good hypertext system will suggest the next area to look at
by shading a particular menu option, or showing a subject in a pop-up box.
A second generic application for hypertext is electronic publishing. This
can mean providing technical or quality management manuals as hypertext
systems. Users access manuals via their laptop or desktop PC, rather than
consult a number of reference books. Hyperlinks take users by the hand
through different sections of a body of knowledge, prompting them with
signposts to the next relevant area. It is likely that Hypermedia systems,
which add video and sound to reference material, will be particularly useful
for manuals, computer-based training and on-line help facilities.
But the ultimate scope of hypertext is enormous. At one end of the scale,
users can write their own manuals or reference documents, using a product
such as Apple's Hypercard or Lotus FasText. Independent consultants can help
set up networked corporate hypertext systems or organisations can buy
electronic publishing systems such as Interleaf's WorldView or SD-Scicon's
Q- Doc.
The fact that hypertext aids the fast search and correlation of information
means that it is most heavily used in the academic world.
The best known and most ambitious hypertext system is Ted Nelson's Xanadu
project, which aims to give as many people as possible access to every
source of information in the world. For most organisations, hypertext has an
immediate - although smaller scale - effect on corporate information
retrieval.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Survey on A-Z of Computing (7): Chasing the copycat
criminals - Fast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BANKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TROUBLE with software theft is that it doesn't look like theft at all.
The original title holder of an application package suffers no loss and can
continue using the package just as before. The 'thief' simply makes a copy,
leaving the original untouched. Yet according to estimates produced by FAST,
the Federation Against Software Theft, the loss of revenue to software
producers created by such copying totals around Pounds 300m, (Dollars
531.00) and the amount is growing.
FAST has been in existence since the mid-1980s, when it was formed to
counter the blatant copying of applications programs. Its formation was
partly a consequence of the increased copying that followed the penetration
of personal computers into business and corporate markets. Individual PC
hobbyists copying and exchanging programs between themselves was annoying
but companies copying applications on which to run their businesses was
significant.
As the volume of copying and theft has grown, FAST and its chief executive,
Bob Hay, have become more vocal. While the underlying idea that copying an
application does in fact equal theft has been acknowledged by many, it has
fallen to FAST to make the lesson more readily understood by business users.
Over the past two years it has increasingly used the law to protect its
members' interests and expose the 'felons'. The most widely publicised
example was the case it brought against Mirror Group Newspapers following a
raid it conducted on MGN's offices last November. This found over 800 items
of software in use, of which only 97 were legal copies of applications. It
would appear that MGN staff also fell into the trap of assuming that simply
deleting a file from a hard disk would hide the copying.
In the event, FAST investigators used a package called Norton Utilities to
examine the drives and locate evidence of the deleted applications. Taking
this idea further, FAST has now come up with a Software Auditing package.
This can recognise over 650 important business applications, and is intended
to help corporate users build an inventory of applications currently in use.
This can then be compared with the list of those officially purchased. To
ensure the legal veracity of its investigations and claims, the Federation
has built up a support structure of legal advisers which has been called
FLAG - the FAST Legal Advisory Group. This consists of representatives from
some 25 firms of solicitors, all of whom have an active interest in the they
way the law relates to software. They are also joined by the legal
representatives of several big computer companies.
The pressure to curb illegal copying and software theft is a worldwide
phenomenon. The UK is by no means the worst offending country in the world,
and FAST has become closely associated with the Business Software Alliance,
a US-based organisation aiming to combat software theft worldwide. Among the
biggest offenders, according to the BSA, is Germany, where the losses caused
by theft are estimated to have totalled Dollars 1.86bn in 1990 alone.
Other countries with poor reputations on software theft and copyright
protection are said to be Italy and Taiwan, which together cost the software
industry an estimated Dollars 1.5bn. The European Community is also taking
the issue seriously, having approved a Software Directive a year ago.
FAST executives are happy with its contents, for it allows software
licensees to decompile applications to find out what the source code is,
allowing them to write another program that will interoperate with it - a
potentially important move towards achieving practical open systems.
But the directive does not specify what constitutes an interoperable
program, leaving scope for the experienced to use the directive to obtain an
applications source code and, from that, write their own version. While
individual copiers may not think they are depriving the software companies
of much revenue, the revenue not made is also money not available for future
applications development or - more important to users - support for existing
ones.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Survey on A-Z of Computing (8): Mice run a metaphor of the
office - GUIs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL POWELL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GRAPHICAL USER Interface systems
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GUIs - with their pull-down menus, icons and overlapping windows,
represented a big advance in making personal computers easier to use. Files,
folders and dustbins - a metaphor for the office - have proved extremely
popular among computer users, as the tremendous success of the Microsoft
version has shown.
Microsoft says its Windows 3.0 has sold more than 10m copies since its
release in May 1990. The latest version, 3.1 has already attracted over 1m
orders since its release in April 1992. Windows has introduced IBM PC users
to a method of working familiar to Apple users for years.
Microsoft is now reported to be developing a new generation of Windows, NT,
which will be a completely new operating system, replacing MS-DOS and able
to be run on machine platforms other than those based on Intel
microprocessors. The X-Windows GUI system for open systems is having a
similar degree of success in that market.
GUIs have their origins in a series of experiments conducted by Xerox in the
early 1970s to try to find an intuitive way for people and computers to
communicate. The result was the pointing device or 'mouse', now a standard
piece of office clutter, and the concept of the 'electronic desktop', which
uses pictorial images to allow the user to find his way around the
computer's capabilities.
Conventional wisdom has it that a GUI makes a computer more usable by
presenting a common form of communication or interface to its user for all
applications. Once he has learnt to use a GUI, he knows the basic capability
and operation of all GUI-based applications. Operations such as filing and
data deletion or insertion are always handled the same way. The user need
only learn the specifics of the system - and the standard on-line help makes
that much easier.
Before GUIs, a user had to make do with the 'command line prompt' to run
applications. Instead of selecting a spreadsheet from a pretty screen using
a mouse, he would have learn sets of commands. The system offered no
assistance in this process. Once the application started, the user would
need to know what commands to issue for it. This command was different for
almost every application. GUIs, by contrast, use the same technique in all
applications.
Windows' success has established Microsoft as the controlling force in the
PC world, with more clout even than IBM. Microsoft is also an application
product supplier, and Excel and Word for Windows are well on the way to
dominating the market-place.
Suppliers of rival products such as Lotus, Wordstar and Wordperfect, forced
to produce versions of their products which operate under Windows, have been
put on the defensive. The similar appearance and operation of these products
to Microsoft's helps persuade buyers to go for the product from the supplier
which clearly ought best to understand its own interface. The latest
versions of Excel and Word are excellent, considerably better than their
predecessors, and competitive with any rival product.
Graphical Interfaces are not bought without a price. For the developer, this
is the increased complexity of programming under Windows - the manuals for
Microsoft 'C' version 7, which include a Windows Developers Tool kit, weigh
around 50lbs. This means Windows applications are more expensive to develop
than their command line predecessors. Windows applications also soak up
machine power. Operations such as the re-calculation of a Spreadsheet can
take up to 10 times as long on a Windows product than on its character-based
sibling. As machines become ever more powerful, this power is absorbed by
the GUI.
How necessary is a GUI? If its main purpose is to make the machine more
user-friendly, does it really offer benefits to one who is already well
versed in its use? Proponents argue that productivity will still be higher
using a GUI than without, and point to the Apple - which has always had a
GUI to drive it. Opponents question whether that productivity is real or
imagined.
A study in the US last year claimed that users of Apple machines produced
much better-looking documents than PC users, but that the information
content was lower. In other words, they expended more of their creative
energies on layout than on content. If this is true, we may see a general
reduction in the inherent quality of PC-based work, as Windows takes over.
Undoubtedly Windows has had a significant impact by making the PC more
approachable for the untutored user. However, the experienced user has yet
to be convinced. Where an application does not need graphics and exists
entirely on its own, Windows may be an unnecessary overhead.
Nevertheless, as more and more Windows applications appear, it is likely to
become the dominant interface and gradually throttle the older
character-based products.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Survey on A-Z of Computing (6): Start of a world free from
paper - EDI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The idea of electronic data interchange (EDI) is quite simple. It is the
exchange of routine company documents such as orders and invoices in
electronic form between computers run by suppliers and their customers.
The implications of this are considerable. Research company Yankee Group
estimates that without EDI, 70 per cent of all computer output becomes
computer input: information is keyed in to one company's computer, processed
and printed as an order document and posted to another company, where the
information is keyed in again.
The replacement of this possibly week-long process by instant electronic
communication eliminates human error and drastically cuts administrative
costs - but that is only the start.
The potential for reductions in processing time for orders means that
manufacturing companies and retail chains can cut stock-holdings and go for
finely tuned just-in-time manufacturing and shelf filling. Big industrial
users are making savings of several hundred thousand pounds a month.
Europe's biggest EDI service supplier, International Network Services (INS),
says purchasing departments using EDI find the time spent on creating and
pushing through paperwork has been cut from 80 per cent of the total to 20
per cent, because they now only have to deal with exceptions. This means
buyers can now spend 80 per cent of their time on the jobs they are paid to
do: negotiating the best deals with suppliers.
EDI can be an advantage in such negotiations: some big buyers have said they
look for good deals from suppliers which are reducing their costs through
the improved cash flow arising from faster payment of invoices and the
benefits of EDI links to their own suppliers.
EDI pioneers are now moving on still further. Andy Bytheway of the Cranfield
School of Management, who is leading research on the use, costs and benefits
of EDI, points to self-billing and automatic re-stocking of customers as
examples of how EDI is creating new relationships between trading partners.
With EDI providing close links and fast turnround of information, trusted
suppliers can be authorised to deliver goods as their customers' stocks run
low, without needing order messages.
Meanwhile the customers can invoice themselves and arrange payment through
banks, which are also starting to join in the EDI game to complete the
order-invoice-payment cycle.
As Sean Phelan, a senior industry analyst at Yankee Group, puts it,
'bringing in EDI isn't just like getting a fax machine. Companies are
starting to see it's part of the whole idea of business re-engineering'.
The benefits have brought big growth in the use of EDI. INS reports 40 per
cent growth last year in message traffic to 5.5m documents a month. Its
figures put the number of UK organisations using EDI at around 6,400.
Even small companies are moving into EDI, sometimes after less than friendly
persuasion from their big customers. There have certainly been veiled
threats from some large companies that suppliers which did not go to EDI
would have a black mark against their names. Dr Roger Till of BP, chairman
of the EDI Association, says there is 'a different atmosphere' now and that
companies seek to help and convince their traders rather than threaten them.
British Coal, for example, developed a Pounds 200 software package to help
get its smaller suppliers started.
Joining an EDI service can look expensive, especially to a small company.
INS, for example, charges a one-off registration fee of between Pounds 2,000
and around Pounds 100,000, based broadly on the size of the user's computer.
There is also an annual subscription of Pounds 1,000 and a usage charge of
4-6p per 1,000 characters, depending on volume.
However, Bytheway at Cranfield says, 'When you consider the amount of trade
between EDI partners and the reduction in paper handling, the costs are
peanuts, even to smaller companies.'
INS is one of several service suppliers in the UK. Others include British
Telecom, IBM, AT&amp;T Istel and SD-Scicon. Companies tend to use such services
because they can have a single telecommunications link to the service
supplier, which directs the message traffic to the requested recipient. The
alternative is to have individual links to every business contact.
EDI users and service suppliers say the use of different message format
standards by different industries is no longer a problem, largely because of
the emergence of software packages which translate data from users'
application systems into the required formats and make the links to the
requested network services. Prices start at around Pounds 2,500.
Ultimately, services will move towards the emerging Edifact group of
international standards but total use is many years away - the car
manufacturers' EDI group, Odette, for example, will not start pushing its
members towards Edifact until 1994, and INS, which has supported Edifact
alongside the retail industry's Tradacoms formats since 1987, says only 10
per cent of its customers use it.
With such issues largely sorted out and EDI use growing rapidly, research
firm Input goes as far as to conclude that 'companies which ignore or reject
EDI could well be disabled from continuing their activities'.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Survey on A-Z of Computing (5): A less costly way to build
systems - Downsizing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPUTER COMPANIES are increasingly replacing centralised mainframe computer
systems with open, distributed networks of 'smaller' computers.
The main difference between the old mainframe systems and the new
distributed systems is the separation of the front-end workstation functions
from the back-end 'server' functions - often referred to as a client-server
system.
The front-end desktop workstations or personal computers replace the
so-called 'dumb' terminals which are used to provide access to
mainframe-based applications. These are the 'clients' in client/server
systems.
Workstations are easier to use because they have their own processing power
and are equipped with much better presentation features than mainframe
terminals. These features - graphical user interfaces - allow users to carry
out local computing tasks, such as wordprocessing and spreadsheet
processing, in addition to acting as a terminal to a large central server
system.
The server systems replace the back-end functions - database management,
printing, communications and intensive processing.
The term 'downsizing' is misleading. The systems used to replace the old
mainframes and terminals are only smaller in some respects. They are less
expensive, they occupy less physical space and, in theory, they require less
specialist attention.
But the new systems are not smaller in performance terms and many can now
match mainframes in important areas of business data processing such as
transaction processing and database management. The term 'rightsizing',
which is a becoming popular one, is far more appropriate.
Companies said to be downsizing are taking advantage of a shift in the
economies of scale in the computer industry. The original large mainframe
systems offered economies of scale because they offered the greatest amount
of computing power for the price.
But in the past decade, the price/performance of industry-standard
microprocessors - such as those produced by Intel and Motorola - has grown
exponentially. A typical desktop PC in 1992 is more powerful than a typical
mainframe was in 1982.
The standard PC is far less expensive and costs virtually nothing to run.
More important, it can be connected to other computers in a network and
share large, expensive resources such as printers and database storage.
This has made downsizing appealing and an increasing number of large users
are moving applications away from mainframes. Large organisations, such as
BP Oil and Mercury, the UK telecommunications company, have begun to
re-orient their information technology strategy towards networks of
workstations based on the client/server approach.
The trend to downsizing has only become practical because of the growth of
open systems standards. These standards - now followed by most suppliers -
provide a framework with which to connect workstations and server systems so
that they may be used for the advanced applications that were once the
exclusive preserve of proprietary mainframe systems.
The most important mainframe applications have always been
performance-sensitive tasks which involve processing transactions such as
the large networks of automatic teller machines used by banks and building
societies.
Until recently, specially-designed proprietary systems, such as IBM's
mainframe systems, were the only systems capable of powering large-scale
transaction-processing applications. But in the past year, the increased
power and improved software offered by server systems has challenged the
proprietary mainframe's leading role in transaction processing.
The breakthrough has come from companies which have harnessed the power of
several small computers in what is termed a parallel-processing
architecture. These include systems developed by companies such as Sequent
and Pyramid, which use special transaction-processing software from software
developers.
Oracle and Informix - among those at the forefront of this trend - have
produced impressive results for transaction processing which compare with
those produced by mainframe computers costing substantially more.
There are also moves to include standards for transaction-processing systems
within the emerging standards for open systems, based on the Unix operating
system.
Unix Systems Laboratories (USL), the organisation responsible for the
development of Unix, has persuaded a number of leading manufacturers to base
their transaction processing systems on a software standard called Tuxedo.
If USL is successful in establishing Tuxedo as a standard, it is likely that
many transaction-processing applications which use mainframe hardware to
support them will switch to open systems.
The most important aspect of downsizing, however, is the significant cost
reductions in building information systems. Some put the reductions from
downsizing as being as high as 75 per cent of the cost of an equivalent
mainframe system - although the claim is countered by others who warn of
hidden costs such as re-training and systems integration.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Survey on A-Z of Computing (4): Finding the right tools for
the job - Case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CASE has a dual meaning
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Computer-Aided Software Engineering or Computer-Aided Systems Engineering.
The difference is important. The systems variety of Case is much more
ambitious than the software variety.
Software Case is the use of computers and software to help design and build
other software. It is the latest step in the evolution of software, and, in
one form or another, goes back to the beginnings of computing.
Software Case includes high-level programming languages, such as those found
with database management packages (sometimes referred to as
'fourth-generation languages'), and graphics-based flow-charting tools which
can be used to design systems and programs.
Software Case also includes tools to help define data used by the software.
These data definitions are stored in a data dictionary or repository which
can be accessed by every program in the system.
Systems Case goes much further. It uses computer aids to model a business
enterprise and build the information technology systems which are needed to
support it. It includes the components of software Case which are used to
generate applications systems.
Systems Case is usually associated with a set of procedures called a system
design methodology. These procedures ensure that all the important variables
in a system are defined and that the design and construction process is kept
under control.
It is generally accepted that skilled practitioners of a formal
'methodology' are a pre-requisite for successful use of system Case tools.
This does not necessarily hold true for software Case, however, where there
have been useful productivity gains for programmers using software Case
tools in isolation.
The importance of Case - systems or software based - is that it brings
engineering disciplines to the creation of information processing systems.
Rigorous analysis of requirements, solid design principles and formal
management control are as applicable to the creation of a computer system as
they are to building a bridge.
The similarities between large engineering projects and large-scale software
development were first recognised in the 1960s when the term software
engineering was first coined. At the same time, a concept known as the
software 'life cycle' was identified. The software life cycle defines every
phase of development of a software system from its initial conception
through to its live application and subsequent maintenance.
It was recognised that true software engineering would exercise complete
control over the software life cycle.
It was not until the mid-1980s, however, that it became practical to use
computers to assist in software and systems development. Previously,
computers were neither cheap nor powerful enough to do the job. But the
emergence of powerful desktop workstations and personal computers, with
graphics and networking features, have made it possible to equip systems
designers and programmers with effective Case software tools.
The first wave of Case software tools divided the work into two separate
tasks. One set of tools was used to 'capture' the design requirements and
perform the overall design task; and a second set of tools was used to
generate the programs. This separation gave rise to the terms 'upper' Case -
the design tools - and 'lower' Case, which referred to the program
generators.
Examples of upper Case tools include Intersolv's Exelerator, ProKit
Workbench from McDonnell-Douglas Information Systems and Automate from LBMS.
Examples of lower Case tools include Telon from Computer Associates and APS
from Intersolv.
Throughout the 1980s, various attempts were made to synthesise upper and
lower Case tools into a single toolset which could offer a comprehensive
approach to software design. Suppliers of the two different types of tools
built links to each others' products to make what are called 'integrated' or
'I' Case development systems.
Although these links made it easier to bring the design and construction
phases of software development together, it was not completely successful.
As a result, a new wave of integrated Case tools has come to the market in
the past two years. These new toolsets provide a more coherent approach to
Case and the control of the software life cycle.
Many of them conform to an overall framework such as that specified by IBM
in its Application Development (AD)/Cycle. AD/Cycle and other Case
frameworks define how the various tools interact with each other. This means
that customers can mix-and-match the tools they prefer from different
suppliers. Other examples of integrated Case frameworks include Andersen
Consulting's Foundation and DEC's Cohesion.
International standards efforts are being made to provide a universal method
of communication between Case tools and create open Case environments. The
main standards effort - the Case Data Interchange Format (CDIF) - is being
carried out by the Electronic Industries Association of the US, although
European companies are also heavily involved.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Survey on A-Z of Computing (3): Keeping the drama out of a
crisis - Back-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BACK-UP is like insurance, it costs money and is only useful if something
goes wrong. Most users accept the need to take back-ups. These should be
kept off the premises, in the bank or at the home of a member of staff, so
that a physical accident cannot destroy both data on the machine and the
back-up.
A back-up system should enable a user to re-create his data if a failure
occurs. In the case of a complete disaster, such as a fire, everything must
be re-created, perhaps on a new machine. Although disk drives (the most
common data medium) are reliable, they can fail, and, if they do, data can
be lost. In the event of a complete failure, everything may need to be
re-constructed, in a partial failure, only the affected information should
be restored. When data has been lost through a software or user fault (such
as the inadvertent deletion of one or more files), the affected file must be
restored, along with any others which might be affected by the change. A
computer stores a variety of different types of information:
The programs and procedures used to process the data and to operate the
machine.
'Fixed' data (such as tabular information) which is seldom updated.
More transient data (such as transactions) which are frequently updated.
Temporary data.
A simple back-up system might take a complete 'picture' of all this data. If
an accident happens, the user can recover all the data from the back-up, to
re-create conditions at the point that it was made. Any subsequent work
would be lost. Complete back-up of all data can take a long time and during
the process, no other work is possible. So this form of back-up is only
suitable when data does not change often.
A more sophisticated system might take long-term copies of items 1 and 2 and
then back-up 3 and 4. In the event of a total failure, the user would apply
both copies to re-create the whole set of data. In a partial failure, only
the transient data would be needed. It might even be possible to recover
only the files which have been damaged. Thus, if a tabular file has been
corrupted or lost, only that one file need be restored.
More intelligent, partial back-up and recovery systems take less time, and
can therefore be run more frequently. However, they can be dangerous. For
instance, an application system may update more than one file from a single
transaction. Entry of a sales order could entail updating both the order and
the customer files (the latter to hold the value of outstanding orders for
credit control purposes).
If an error wipes the order file, and it alone is restored, then the orders
since the point of failure are re-entered, customers may appear to have
higher order levels than they should. Careful planning is needed to keep
back-up strategy consistent with overall data integrity. In a sophisticated
system, the partial back-up is supplemented with a transaction logging
system which records all transactions since the back-up was taken. In the
event of a failure, files are restored from the back-up and the transactions
re-applied to re-create the system up to the point of failure. Applications
built using database management packages often incorporate this capability.
Magnetic tapes are most often used for back-up on larger systems. They are
quick to read and write and of a high capacity. Their disadvantage is that
the whole tape must be searched to find a particular item. Few PCs (apart
from network file servers) have tape drives and diskettes are the most
common medium for back-up. However, their capacity is low, and the user must
frequently change diskettes. PC users have a poor back-up system provided
with MS-DOS, but better systems are available from certain specialist
software suppliers.
Back-up tapes or diskettes should not just be stacked up in heaps. Users
normally have some sort of cycling system. The most common form is
'grandfather, father, son'. Three tapes are kept, the latest wiping the
oldest. This may not be sophisticated enough for an accounting system, where
the back-up also represents a form of audit trail. There, the user may keep
a cycled back-up during the month, then retain a copy of each month end's
files for the current year, and five years' worth of year end data.
Keeping regular back-up is vitally important because loss of data can be
critical to even the smallest organisation. The back-up media should be
stored in a different physical location from the main data to provide
physical security.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Survey on A-Z of Computing (2): Providing a definition of
standards - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARCHITECTURE HAS a number of meanings in computer jargon. It can mean the
design blueprint for a microprocessor - the so-called 'chip' architecture.
It can also be applied to complete hardware systems to define their methods
of operation - multiple, parallel processing or fault-tolerant
architectures, for example.
But the most common meaning of the word is as a marketing term. Suppliers
use architectures to define design and communications standards for hardware
and software to provide a stable foundation for applications software.
In the early days of computing, manufacturers went their own sweet way when
they designed a computer system. They did not need to take account of what
their competitors were doing because the design of computer systems was
self-contained and under the sole custodianship of the manufacturer.
But in the 1970s, when networks started to appear and computers had to
communicate with each other, the situation changed and suppliers began to
sell their products within a defined architecture.
The trend was accelerated in the 1980s when mass-market personal computers
became available and networking became less expensive.
The architecture defined how different computers could communicate with each
other. A new product which conformed to these specifications could be sold
under the architectural 'umbrella,' with the assurance that it would work.
IBM's System Network Architecture (SNA), originally announced in the
mid-1970s, was perhaps the earliest example of an architecture of this type.
SNA laid down the rules of networking and inter-communication within the IBM
computer environment.
It also enabled IBM to keep control of large areas of its customer's
computing operations. Although SNA has evolved and now includes standards
from other architectures, its emphasis remains very much on IBM's hardware
and software products.
Furthermore, it has given IBM a strong position of leadership in many areas
of technology. IBM's rivals must offer SNA-compatible systems if they want
to connect their equipment to IBM networks.
In spite of the wide adoption of SNA by most of the world's leading computer
users, IBM has not had the field to itself. By the late 1970s, the open
systems movement began to gain momentum and it, too, defined a general
networking architecture.
The International Standards Organisation (ISO) called it the seven-layer
model for open systems interconnection (OSI). It defined how connections are
a made and communications carried out at seven different levels, from the
physical transport system (the cabling) right up to the application level.
Unfortunately, IBM's SNA and ISO's OSI were incompatible - although the two
have slowly converged.
Earlier this year, IBM announced its new Blueprint for Networking, which
redefined SNA to include many open systems specifications. Meanwhile, many
IBM SNA features have become de facto standards with the open systems stamp
on them.
The definition of systems architectures has expanded beyond networking to
cover entire enterprises and their applications. Nowadays this can include
several networks and many different computer systems.
IBM, again, led the way with the announcement in 1987 of Systems
Applications Architecture (SAA). IBM wanted to find a way to knit together
three entirely different computer systems - its System/370 mainframe, its
System/38-AS/400 minicomputers and its PS/2 personal computer.
All three used SNA for their communications infrastructure. But all three
used different operating systems, different command and control interfaces
and different programming languages for their applications software.
SAA embraces the important aspects of all three systems. It builds on SNA's
communications by providing technical definitions for - among other things -
user interfaces (graphical user interfaces - see page 8) and applications
programming interfaces (APIs).
Since 1987, it has been fashionable for large manufacturers and software
suppliers either to define or to subscribe to one or more architectures -
although the differences between them are often hard to spot.
DEC, the minicomputer manufacturer, has defined its Networked Applications
Support (NAS) to include its proprietary VAX systems and some aspects of
open systems.
Groupe Bull, the French hardware manufacturer has defined its Distributed
Computing Model (DCM) - again combining its proprietary systems with open
systems. And ICL, the Japanese-owned UK manufacturer, has defined its Open
Framework - yet another variation on the same theme.
The open systems features included in each of these architectures are
derived from a number of sources. The infrastructural communications
components come from the ISO/OSI model and from standards defined by the
CCITT (X25, X400, X500).
Higher-level components - such as user interfaces and applications
programming interfaces - come from one or more of the informal open systems
groupings. These include:
The IBM-backed Open Software Foundation (OSF) which has defined the
Distributed Computing Environment (DCE)
The AT&amp;T-backed Unix International (UI) which has defined the UI-Atlas
architecture
And the sponsors of the Advanced Computing Environment, (ACE).
All of these open architectures use the Unix operating system as a starting
point and share many common components. UI's Atlas includes some of the
features of OSF's DCE and vice versa.
IBM's SAA and the ISO/OSI standards remain the most important and most
widely-supported architectural definitions - although it seems inevitable
that they will all eventually come together and be refined into a universal
architecture.

FT  23 JUN 92 / Survey on A-Z of Computing (1): A snapshot of today's
technology - Comment / The changes happening in computing now make it an
ideal time to take a snapshot of the technology and the industry which

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE IDEA of change has always been central to computing. Faster and cheaper
computer hardware, innovative approaches to building software and better
ways to make useful applications have flooded from the factories and
laboratories of the computer industry for the last quarter of a century.
But the appearance of constant change in computing has masked an industry
and a technology which has changed very little. Most computing is still
carried out on large mainframe computer systems which were designed in the
1960s and most of the world's business software is written in Cobol, a
programming language which was conceived in the 1950s.
Even the new wave of technology, represented by hardware innovations like
reduced instruction set computers (see R for Risc) and operating systems
software like Unix (see U), has its origins in the late 1960s.
In the last year, however, genuine changes have become apparent and the new
computer industry which has emerged in the 1990s is markedly different from
the one which went before. The rules of the game, too, have been re-written.
IBM, the dominant force in the industry since its birth in the 1950s, has
cut thousands of jobs and, last year, declared the first losses in its
history. Other large manufacturers - such as Groupe Bull, Unisys, DEC,
ICL-Fujitsu - have fared no better.
Many have sought salvation in joint ventures with former rivals - IBM's
links with Bull and Apple being two examples. Software companies have been
hit even harder. The British software industry - once the jewel in the crown
of the UK's high technology industries - has almost disappeared, with once
well-known names like CAP, Hoskyns and SD-Scicon all now in foreign
ownership.
The decline is not restricted to the UK. The consolidation of the software
industry is a worldwide phenomenon - with many well-known names disappearing
in the last couple of years - either through takeovers or mergers. The
beleaguered chief executives of computer companies have blamed their bad
fortunes on the world recession, but, although the recession has certainly
aggravated the problem, the reality is, that a fundamental change was long
overdue.
Growing dissatisfaction with the high cost of information technology and
frustration with the petty differences between rival suppliers' products has
forced users to look closely at their investment in computing - and this has
caused the first real change in the structure of the industry since its
inception.
The proliferation of personal computers, coupled with graphical user
interface (GUI) software, has turned traditional wisdom on its head and put
power in the hands of end users.
Large computer systems are being replaced with networks of workstations
connected by open systems architectures supporting downsized applications.
The changes happening in computing now make it an ideal time to take a
snapshot of the technology and the industry which supplies it. This is the
underlying purpose of the Financial Times A to Z of Computing.
In addition to the obvious task of explaining the obtuse jargon which
characterises computing, this supplement aims to describe an industry in the
process of change.
From hardware innovations like reduced-instruction-set computers (risc) and
new colour printing technologies, through emerging software technology such
as computer-aided software engineering (CASE) and Unix, to structural
changes in the industry itself, the A to Z of Computing sets the agenda for
computing in the 1990s and beyond. It will be a valuable guide to all who
need to know about computer technology in the future.
And, in the 1990s, that means everyone.

FT  23 JUN 92 / International Company News: Hungary launches third stock
market tier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HUNGARY yesterday launched a third tier to its stock market in an attempt to
bolster interest in the Budapest market and draw over-the-counter trading
onto the market floor.
Rules come into effect this week, on the second anniversary of the Budapest
Stock Exchange, setting up the new category, the Free Market, for public
securities which do not meet full listing requirements.
The latest category allows any BSE member, rather than just the issuing
company, to introduce a security onto the new market once it has met a
simplified set of requirements.
Trading is expected to begin next week but brokers do not expect the new
market to build up momentum until the second half of this year.
Shares in up to 40 public companies, including the main commercial banks,
and 260 bonds are candidates for the new market. That compares with 21
listed shares and only one company bond with a full BSE listing.
The rigour of full listing requirements has deterred many companies from the
BSE. The exchange estimates that between 80 and 90 per cent of securities
trading takes place outside the official market.
With own turnover languishing the BSE is keen to inject new interest.
Trading volume for all securities in May was a disappointing Ft2.3bn
(Dollars 30m).
The authorities had long planned a third market but were only able to move
ahead with it after the opening of a new trading floor last month.
Postabank is to raise Ft3bn via a public offer of shares, Reuter reports. It
will offer shares at par between June 26 and October 16.

FT  23 JUN 92 / International Company News: Two French bank heads replaced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HEADS of two of France's nationalised banks, Credit Industriel et
Commercial (CIC) and Societe Marseillaise de Credit (SMC), have been
replaced in the French government's regular three-yearly review of the
senior management of state-controlled companies.
Mr Jean-Pierre Aubert, 49, has replaced Mr Francois Caries, 65, as chairman
of CIC, the federation of regional banks controlled by Groupe des Assurances
Nationales (GAN), the public sector insurance group. Mr Aubert has for the
past three years been chairman of CIC-Paris.
GAN took control of CIC in 1989, the year that Mr Caries became chairman.
The takeover followed a turbulent period for the bank which had been heavily
exposed to a number of bad loans including those to the collapsed Al Saudi
Banque.
The CIC banks have since undergone radical rationalisation to try to control
costs and improve profitability. This programme is expected to continue
under Mr Aubert's chairmanship. CIC recently reported a 12 per cent fall in
profits for last year to FFr714m (Dollars 137.3m).
The new chairman of SMC will be Mr Jean Matouk, 54, taking over from Mr
Jean-Paul Escande, who has headed the bank since 1982. Mr Matouk, a former
adviser on economic and financial affairs to President Francois Mitterand,
is now head of the Caisse Nationale de l'Energie.
SMC, which is under-capitalised, fell into the red in 1991 by moving from a
profit of FFr11m into a loss of FFr17.4m.

FT  23 JUN 92 / State plans to take over Serb economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Serbian government will introduce measures aimed at bringing most
sectors of the economy directly under state control if the United
Nations-imposed sanctions last longer than a month, factory managers said
yesterday.
The measures are part of a package designed to forestall any workers'
unrest, particularly in the textile industry, the most successful export
sector, which accounts for 12 per cent of Serbia's total GDP.
They were drawn up by Mr Radoman Bosovic, Serbia's prime minister, in the
light of the growing concern among the textile industry that the sanctions
imposed on Serbia and Montenegro three weeks ago will have a catastrophic
effect on this sector of the economy.
'The sector employs 200,000 people, or about a quarter of the total labour
force,' explained Mr Gradimir Cvetkovic, secretary of Serbia's textile
association.
'It is also the most successful arm of the Serbian economy. Between 60 and
80 per cent of the industry's total turnover is earmarked for the export
market. The sector accounts for 20 per cent of Serbia's total trade.'
About 60 per cent of the textile industry's turnover is exported to the
European Community, the rest to the US, eastern Europe, and the former
Soviet Union. Last year, textile exports totalled Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds
595m), and imports Dollars 600m.
The sector accounts for 1 per cent of the world textile market, and holds a
3.5 per cent share of the EC's market.
'We are totally dependent on the export market, and totally dependent on
imports, ranging from dyes and chemicals, to material and tanning
processes,' said Mr Dragoslav Kojic, manager of Kluz, one of Serbia's most
successful textile enterprises which exports 100 per cent of its turnover.
He said the sanctions were 'a disaster' for his business.
'I want to send the finished goods to my partners in Germany. But how can I
get around the sanctions? Sooner or later we will lose these markets in
Europe. They will be snapped up by Czechoslovakia, Hungary, or the Ukraine.
It will be very difficult to regain them,' he explained.
Mr Kojic employs 6,000 people, and has an annual turnover of DM100m (Pounds
34.2m) a year. Later this month, he will put his work force on paid leave
for a few weeks.
'After that, I run out of money, energy, and raw materials, which we import
from our partners,' he said. 'I do not know what to tell my workers. The
government kept saying we would cope under the sanctions. This is nonsense.
They haven't a clue.'

THE increasingly confused debate in Germany over the future of the European
Fighter Aircraft was thrown into fresh turbulence yesterday when the
parliamentary leaders of the Christian Democrats (CDU) and Christian Social
Union (CSU) agreed to postpone a decision by one week.
The move was reported to have been made at the request of Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, under pressure from his fellow leaders in Britain, Italy and Spain to
keep a German foothold in the multinational project.
The debate over the EFA, known in Germany as the Jager-90, has split the
ruling coalition, and Mr Kohl is clearly struggling to find a solution which
will satisfy both his own CDU and the Bavaria-based CSU.
Mr Volker Ruhe, the defence minister, is now publicly in favour of pulling
out of the Pounds 21bn (Dollars 39bn) project, while Mr Theo Waigel, the CSU
leader and finance minister, is ironically campaigning to preserve it - not
least to protect the military aerospace industry in Bavaria.
A report in the conservative newspaper Die Welt yesterday said that Mr Kohl
and Mr Wolfgang Schauble, the floor leader of the CDU in the Bundestag, had
decided to withdraw their support for Mr Ruhe in the stormy debate.
Mr Schauble had been convinced by the defence establishment's arguments in
favour of the aircraft, while Mr Kohl was anxious not to offend Britain,
Italy and Spain, the newspaper said.
Public opinion in Germany remains overwhelmingly hostile to the Jager-90,
seen as a symbol of extravagant defence spending in the post-Cold War era.
Defence experts argue that it is the only aircraft capable of meeting the
requirements of the Luftwaffe past the year 2000, and that any less
well-adapted alternative would anyway be quite as expensive in the long run.
A decision on the aircraft needs to be made for the draft 1993 budget, in
order to allocate DM100m (Pounds 34.2m) for tooling up for production.
One compromise proposal is to leave a line in the budget which must be
presented on July 1, without allocating any funds to the project. This would
effectively postpone any decision until next year.

CORNING, the US specialty glass group, will take a second-quarter charge of
Dollars 16m after-tax, or 9 cents a share, Karen Zagor reports from New
York.
The charge covers costs at its Dow Corning venture relating to its
discontinued silicone breast implant business. Dow Corning is a 50-50
venture between Corning and Dow Chemical.
*****
Upjohn, the US drug company, has had its contraceptive drug Depo-Provera,
recommended for approval by an advisory panel of the US Food and Drug
Administration, Reuter reports from Washington.
The panel said its concerns about breast cancer risks were allayed by a
World Health Organisation study showing little increased risk.
*****
Toronto Stock Exchange has postponed by at least six months plans to replace
its trading floor with a fully-automated trading system, Bernard Simon
reports from Toronto.
The exchange now expects to make the change in the fourth quarter of 1993.
It needs more time to test the computerised system and train staff.
*****
Shell Oil, the US unit of Royal Dutch/Shell, the Anglo Dutch oil group, is
selling its Shell Mining coal-mining subsidiary to Zeigler Coal for an
undisclosed sum, Karen Zagor reports.
Shell Mining had 1991 revenues of Dollars 600m, or less than 3 per cent of
Shell Oil's Dollars 3.4bn. Zeigler, which is privately held, quadrupled
sales by acquiring BP's Old Ben Coal unit in 1990.
*****
McDonnell Douglas, the US aircraft maker, has cut a further 1,650 jobs from
plants in Long Beach and Torrance because of slow sales of commercial
airliners, AP-DJ reports from California.
Since July 1990, McDonnell Douglas has cut about 16,000 jobs, including
about 6,000 this year. An additional 2,000 jobs are expected to be cut by
next year.

VOLKSFURSORGE, the German insurance group, expects to book a rise in
earnings in 1992, as a restructuring drive in its marketing organisation
begins to bite, Reuter reports from Hamburg.
Volksfursorge's group premium income rose 8.9 per cent in 1991 to DM4.89bn
(Pounds 1.67bn) against DM4.49bn a year earlier. Group net profit was up
23.5 per cent at DM91.6m (Pounds 31.3m) compared with DM74.2m.
Volksfursorge said it expected this year to maintain dividend and additions
to profit reserves at least at 1991 levels. It will be paying an unchanged
DM12.50 per share.
Additions to profit reserves rose sharply last year from DM8.8m to DM18.3m
in 1990.
At its life insurance unit Volksfursorge Deutsche Lebensversicherung growth
was muted in the first five months of 1992 as a steep rise in new business
in eastern Germany tapered off.
Compared with January-May 1991 results the value of insurance policies was
down 11 per cent at end of May, although premium income was up 6 per cent.
For property insurance arm Volksfursorge Deutsche Sachversicherung the group
is counting on a continuation of the postitive developments.

FT  22 JUN 92 / A top-hat tradition in the balance: Winds of change are
threatening to topple London's discount houses 300 years after they were
founded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some people regard them as the most noble institutions in the City of
London. Others think that they should die.
The City's discount houses are in the thick of a revolution that may
extinguish their activities. For as long as anyone can remember, these money
market dealers have played a crucial role in the Bank of England's sterling
operations, acting as the valves through which liquidity passes from the
Bank to the commercial banks.
But now, nearly three centuries after they were founded, voices in the City
are saying these dealers have outlived their usefulness. 'They are ancient
history, a complete anachronism,' says Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist of
Yamaichi International in London and co-author of a book on the sterling
money market.
Critics charge that London is looking increasingly out of step as the only
European financial centre to use such intermediaries as discount houses in
its money market operations.
'Given the expansion of the money markets globally, they now have a place
only in the history books,' Mr MacKinnon says.
The nine members of the London Discount Market Association, with names like
King and Shaxson or Gerrard and National, still retain the image of
old-fashioned houses which, elsewhere in the City, became an anomaly after
its financial markets were deregulated by the Big Bang of 1986.
A few still cling to their traditions, wearing top hats when they turn up at
Threadneedle Street to borrow money from the Bank in the early afternoon, or
holding a ritual meeting with the Bank's governor once a week.
Their relationship with the central bank is jealously guarded. If the
commercial banks are short of cash, one way they can balance their books is
by borrowing money from a discount house. The commercial banks obtain cash
by selling an eligible bill, essentially a post-dated cheque, to a discount
house which, in turn, sells it to the Bank. The rates at which the Bank
lends to the discount houses influence the level of lending rates throughout
the banking system.
This intermediary role is now under attack from several fronts:
British clearing banks - in the past year, the balance of power in the money
market has shifted towards the clearers, as the Bank of England has allowed
the protection given to the discount market to be eroded.
In the 1970s, the Bank ruled that the commercial banks had to place a
proportion of assets in the form of secured callable deposits with the
discount market. This cash, which averaged around 5 per cent of a bank's
eligible liabilities, was known as 'club money' and gave the discount houses
an assured source of funding at lower rates than those in the market.
In the past year, the 'club money' practice has faded. Commercial banks no
longer have to place a minimum level of funds with the discount houses.
Instead, they have begun keeping larger stocks of bills on their books.
This gives the bigger clearing banks greater leverage over the market. A
common practice among clearers is to push short-term rates in the money
markets downwards when it suits their books, by passing many bills on to the
discount houses at once. They can deploy bills in the quantities they need
to, rather than relying on the liquidity services of the discount houses.
Another challenge comes from the plans for monetary convergence envisaged in
the Maastricht Treaty on European Monetary Union (Emu).
The Bank of England's operations are unlike those in the other 11 EC
countries. In Germany, for example, the Bundesbank deals directly with the
nation's banks rather than through intermediaries. It keeps a tight rein
over day-to-day money market developments by obliging banks to place minimum
reserves in non-interest-bearing accounts at the central bank and, by way of
compensation, operates a limited discount window for the banks at favourable
interest rates.
The Bundesbank operates only once a week in the open market, rather than
every day as the Bank of England does. 'It is a lot simpler on the
continent,' says one money market trader in London. 'If there is monetary
union, Britain will have to resort to the European way.'
Last month, Mr Eddie George, deputy governor of the Bank of England, also
hinted that the Bank was less committed to the discount market principle. He
said some of the subtlety of national money market techniques, 'tailored to
national market circumstances', could be lost in the move to Emu.
The discount houses' profits are being eroded by the British government's
cautious policy on base rates. When base rates move sharply downward, the
discount houses make larger profits because the capital value rises of the
bills they hold.
But in the past year, the Bank has pursued a policy of infrequent rate cuts.
Sterling's membership of the Exchange Rate Mechanism has tended to reduce
volatilities in the cash market, and in the short sterling futures market
where the discount houses are also big players.
The discount houses have tried diversifying. Gerrard and National, for
example, has gone into financial futures broking and gilt-edged
market-making. But another house, Union Discount, was stung when it
attempted to go into leasing. Its chief executive stepped down earlier this
year after the company reported a 1991 loss of Pounds 21.3m.
The discount house dealers are not taking the erosion of their position
lightly. They argue that it is harming London's prestige as a financial
centre.
'We have the most sophisticated short-term paper market in Europe and the
value of our techniques should not be underestimated,' said one discount
house trader last week.
Another broker says the growing domination of the British clearers makes it
harder for foreign banks to invest in the sterling money market. He says a
handful of clearing banks can push short-term interest rates to levels far
from base rates, by deploying large numbers of bills when it suits their
books.
In recent weeks, for example, the overnight rate for sterling in the cash
market has oscillated between 5 per cent and 20 per cent, even though base
rates are at 10 per cent.
'Imagine how the head of treasury in a German bank feels about dealing in
the sterling money market under these conditions,' he says.
It is unlikely that the Bank of England will desert the discount houses in
the immediate future, having had such a close relationship with them over
the centuries.
But the market is unsure how the Bank will react in the long term, both to
the pressures from Britain's clearing banks and the need to conform to
continental-style monetary operations in the run-up to Emu.

FT  22 JUN 92 / Reichmanns moved assets from O&amp;Y
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE REICHMANN family of Canada has moved assets worth several hundred
million dollars from Olympia &amp; York Developments, the holding company under
court protection, into other private family companies during the past 18
months.
The family companies which bought the assets from O&amp;Y lie outside the court
protection which the Reichmanns sought last month for O&amp;Y, its 28
subsidiaries in Canada, and the Canary Wharf project in London's Docklands.
There is no question about the legality of the transfers. The assets are
understood to have been independently valued.
However, the transactions have contributed to growing friction between O&amp;Y
and holders of its CDollars 13.5bn (USDollars 11.2bn) debt.
A lawyer representing one of the lenders said the family 'have managed to
take away some valuable pieces of property from the process.'
The assets transferred from O&amp;Y since January 1991 include:
Olympia Tile, which is one of North America's biggest distributors of
floor-coverings, and was one of the Reichmanns' first businesses after they
arrived in Canada from Tangier in the late 1950s;
The family's 65 per cent stake in Camdev, the property developer previously
controlled by Canadian entrepreneur Robert Campeau;
Several smaller office buildings.
Some key creditors are also complaining that O&amp;Y, renowned for secrecy until
its liquidity crisis broke earlier this year, is still being less than fully
co-operative in making available financial information.
The concerns centre on unencumbered assets, ranging from parcels of
undeveloped land to the Reichmanns' Gulfstream jet, which could be sold to
help service O&amp;Y's debts.
An Ontario court order issued late last week requires O&amp;Y to provide by this
afternoon a more comprehensive list of its assets than has been available so
far.
New procedures have also been put in place to speed up the flow of
information.
The lenders say they were taken aback last week to learn that O&amp;Y was
selling 50 per cent of a 12-storey office development in the centre of
Budapest.
This project was not listed in O&amp;Y's application for bankruptcy protection.
O&amp;Y officials acknowledge privately that the company has delayed providing
some information.
However, they also blame lenders for making unreasonable requests, including
for data which, if publicly known, could complicate the disposal of assets.
They say the Budapest property, which is still under construction, was not
significant enough to be listed separately.
In other developments, a company spokesman declined to confirm or deny
reports that O&amp;Y's US subsidiary had raised USDollars 32m from the sale of a
12 per cent stake in Hyperion Capital Management, a New York portfolio
management firm.
Much of O&amp;Y's energy at present is directed towards keeping the US
operation, comprising more than 20 buildings, out of the bankruptcy courts.
O&amp;Y has disclosed that the three investment banks acting as its financial
advisers will receive CDollars 5.8m in fees over the five months to October.
More than half will be paid to JP Morgan of New York, with the rest split
between James D Wolfensohn - one of whose partners, Mr Steve Miller, is
leading O&amp;Y's debt restructuring effort - and Burns Fry of Toronto.

FT  22 JUN 92 / Statistical agency to give more details on retail sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Central Statistical Office is to bow to pressure from retailers and add
new data to its monthly survey of the sector, which accounts for about one
quarter of the economy.
The monthly report by the government's statistical agency will in future
provide a fuller breakdown of shifts in sales of specific items such as food
and clothing. It may also give better warning of changes in consumer demand
which have a bearing on broad economic fluctuations.
The change follows pressure from some large retailers, who complained that
the CSO had been slow in adding extra information to its survey. It also
reflects the drive by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, and Mr Bill
McLennan, the recently appointed head of the CSO, to improve Britain's
economic statistics.
The new figures will emerge from detailed questions to be sent by the CSO
every month to about 50 large companies in 'mixed retailing' - including
sales of food and non-edible items.
Such stores, including Marks and Spencer, will be asked to break down total
sales according to four categories: food, clothing and footwear, household
goods and miscellaneous items. The extra data will be added to figures of
sales in these four areas provided by other specialised businesses active in
a single category of retailing.
The new information should help the CSO to make its monthly survey more
comprehensive. The agency expects the new data to become available around
the end of the year.
The plan still awaits final agreement from the stores on how the detailed
information will be supplied to the CSO. However, the CSO is confident the
retailers will support the project because of their past comments about the
need to collect this kind of information.
Separately, the CSO is reviewing its publication of cyclical economic
indicators which are intended to give early warning of changes in demand.
The indicators - based on individual sets of data such as housing starts and
share prices - are published every month but have failed to capture the
imagination of economists. Thus they are rarely used in efforts to plot ups
and downs in activity.
The work is part of the effort by the CSO to look at new ways of working out
the path of the economy by studying short-term changes in specific
indicators.

FT  22 JUN 92 / UK aim to speed up wideningof EC likely to be thwarted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S AIM to speed up enlargement of the European Community is likely to
be thwarted by other member states which insist that the Maastricht treaty
and the EC budget increase should be approved first.
Britain would like a symbolic start to negotiations with Austria,
Switzerland, Sweden and Finland - all members of the European Free Trade
Association (Efta) - before the end of its six-month presidency, which
begins on July 1. It believes this would spur ratification of Maastricht.
But a majority of foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg on Saturday to
prepare next weekend's Lisbon summit decided that negotiations should not
begin until the treaty's ratification was complete, and an acceptable
financial package agreed.
Both outcomes are still uncertain, in spite of relief among ministers that
the Irish ignored Denmark's rejection of the treaty and voted Yes to
Maastricht in last Thursday's referendum.
Mr David Andrews, the Irish foreign minister, and his Spanish counterpart at
the meeting, Mr Carlos Westendorp, cut through Saturday's euphoria over the
Irish vote to reassert their conviction that the European Commission's
1993-97 budget proposals were the only acceptable way of encouraging
economic convergence between rich and poor EC members.
The poorer countries were unhappy about a possible compromise which would
spread EC revenue increases over seven rather than five years.
That has sown the seeds for a fierce debate between EC leaders in Lisbon,
although foreign ministers confirmed that the final decision on funding the
Community would not be taken until December's Edinburgh summit. They also
outlined the likely outcome of summit discussions on other issues:
Enlargement: EC leaders will probably ask the Commission to prepare a
mandate for negotiation with the four Efta applicants and will issue a
statement to soften the blow for those countries still on the waiting list -
Turkey, Cyprus, Malta, Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia.
Subsidiarity - that is, the principle that the Community should only concern
itself with issues which cannot be dealt with better at national level. Mr
Jacques Delors, the Commission president, who was shaken by Danish citizens'
implicit criticism three weeks ago of an over-centralised EC, told ministers
there were areas where Community involvement could be scaled down, although
he refused to disclose his ideas to journalists afterwards. The Lisbon
summit is expected to produce a declaration reaffirming the EC's commitment
to the principle.
Ministers also rallied round a paper prepared by the Benelux countries which
restated the smaller EC countries' fears that they might be pushed aside by
changes in the management of an enlarged Community. Member states have
agreed there should be no institutional changes before 1996. The Benelux
countries said large member states would have to accept 'a certain
over-representation' of smaller countries in the Commission, Council of
Ministers and Parliament.
Mr Delors denied after Saturday's meeting that little would be achieved in
Lisbon. 'It will be possible to reach a global orientation, a good
orientation, on the Delors II (budget) package and a broad consensus on the
question of how to proceed with enlargement,' he said.
British and German foreign ministers confirmed on Saturday that London and
Frankfurt were still in the running as possible sites for the European
Central Bank, despite rumours to the contrary. The issue is likely to be
discussed at Lisbon.

FT  22 JUN 92 / Political row may erupt over top people's pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INCREASING the pay of senior civil servants, judges and officers in the
armed forces is set to cause its traditional political embarrassment for the
government next week when the cabinet is expected to consider the latest
report from the Top Salaries Review Body.
The report, said to recommend significant pay rises after a review comparing
the public and private sectors, is likely to be delivered to Downing Street
later this week, though almost certainly too late to be discussed at
Thursday's cabinet meeting.
Although ministers are resigned to a row about the rises for the 2,000 or so
judges, senior civil servants and senior officers covered by the review -
because there is never an optimum time to make such increases  -
sensitivities are particularly acute in the prelude to a tough public
spending round. The government's aim in public sector pay negotiations is an
increase of no more than 4 per cent.
Criticism of large pay increases for the chairmen of privatised utilities
and ministerial urging of pay restraint on the private sector will add to
the government's discomfort. The government's business managers know that
the issue could become a 'lightning conductor' for more general backbench
concerns about the lack of economic growth.
One option to reduce vigorous parliamentary opposition to the pay rises is
to make public the top pay review at the same time as the review body's
separate report on MPs' office costs allowance - an area where MPs tend to
take a more generous view than the government.
The top pay review represents the first wide-ranging study since 1985, which
recommended increases of up to 46 per cent. Even though the government
phased in those rises - as is likely this time - it faced a Commons
rebellion.
The contrast between senior figures in the public and private sectors will
be reinforced with the publication today of a British Institute of
Management survey which found that managers and directors of small companies
gave themselves pay rises of just 4.6 per cent over a 12 month period to
January 1992.
The Labour party has been quick to capitalise on the simmering unrest among
Tory MPs. Mr Tony Blair, the shadow employment secretary, said it was
unacceptable at a time of recession and rising unemployment that 'those at
the top in the public sector are taking pay rises many times the rate of
inflation'.
The sensitivity surrounding the pay rises were signalled earlier this year
when Sir David Nickson, the review body chairman, arranged a delay to avoid
the review being published just before the April 9 election.

FT  22 JUN 92 / A velvet divorce, but a rough road to single life: The Czech
and Slovak republics will face difficult challenges after separation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON and ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The federal parliament which convenes today in Prague will almost certainly
be the last. Only the unlikely prospect of a popular revolt against the
decisions of its recently elected political leaders can now save the
Czechoslovak federal state.
A new interim federal government, to be made up of Czechs and Slovaks in
equal measure, will oversee the separation of the state, which was formed in
1918. Its function will be limited mainly to overseeing an orderly
transition of federal powers to the Czech and Slovak national parliaments by
September 30.
The dissolution of the post-communist state of Czechoslovakia, which was
regarded as perhaps the most promising candidate for full European Community
membership, will have repercussions well beyond its borders. It is further
evidence that the fragmentation of Eastern Europe, most tragically
experienced by Yugoslavia, is continuing.
The decision by the two republics to divorce, taken in the early hours of
Saturday morning, comes only two weeks after general elections which
revealed the strength of Slovak resentment against the government in Prague.
Rejecting arguments that Slovakia's future will be best assured by firm
linkage to the Czech economic locomotive, 60 per cent of the electorate
voted for parties which were either nationalist, or socialist, or both.
That vote provided the mandate with which Mr Vladimir Meciar went into the
talks. The former boxer is the leader of the nationalist Movement for a
Democratic Slovakia which played on the resentments of Slovaks and emerged
as the largest party in the republic. But although Mr Meciar went into the
post-electoral talks on Czechoslovakia's future as spokesman for the
aggrieved party the terms of the proposed divorce bear the strong imprint of
the Czech leader, Mr Vaclav Klaus.
Before the elections, Mr Klaus the former federal finance minister whose
Civic Democratic party (ODS) has become the dominant party in the Czech
republic, openly rejected any 'soft options' such as a looser confederal
structure. At the first round of talks in Brno, between Prague, the Czech
capital, and Bratislava, the Slovak capital, he rejected Mr Meciar's
proposed 'defence and foreign affairs community.' Having received a mandate
in the Czech lands for tight monetary policy, rapid privatisation and a
market economy, Mr Klaus turned a deaf ear to Slovak demands for its own
central bank and requests for federal funds.
Mr Klaus argued that both sides should either agree on a smaller but more
effective federal government dedicated to market-orientated economic reforms
or on a quick divorce. In the event Mr Meciar, had to agree to the latter.
After more than a thousand years of domination by Hungary, followed by a
six-year interlude as a puppet state of the Axis powers during the second
world war and Stalinist industrialisation after the war, Slovakia is
therefore faced with the challenge of independence.
It is a daunting prospect. It raises questions about the republic's
political and economic future and its role in the new Europe. Moreover, not
all of Slovakia's 5m citizens are ethnic Slovaks. There is a restive 600,000
strong Hungarian minority and smaller groups of ethnic Poles and Germans.
One of the principal demands made by Slovak nationalists is for Slovakia to
enter the European Community as a sovereign state in its own right. But that
depends more on Brussels than Bratislava. The likelihood is that the western
Czech lands of Bohemia and Moravia, freed of the need to subsidise the
economically weaker Slovakia, will now move faster on economic and other
reforms. Such policies should allow them to fulfil the preconditions for
membership of the EC while Slovakia, with its inefficient heavy industries,
risks sliding backwards economically.
Politically, too, there are fears over Slovakia's future. Mr Meciar's tight
control over the media and jibes against the Hungarian minority during the
election campaign are warning signs which have been noted by the Christian
Democrat and other opposition parties during recent weeks.
The international implications of the division of Czechoslovakia into two
sovereign, internationally recognised states will affect all international
treaties and agreements concluded by the Czechoslovak state - including the
recently signed association agreement with the EC and membership of the
International Monetary Fund and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
The details of divorce will also require agreement on the division of
responsibility for Czechoslovakia's Dollars 9.1bn net foreign debt, as well
as the domestic debt and agreement on distributing assets.
Some issues are likely to be more fraught than others. At present, for
example, over 80 per cent of Czechoslovakia's 12m tonne annual oil
consumption is imported through the Druzhba pipeline which runs across
Slovak territory from Russia. It terminates in the Slovnaft refinery, just
outside Bratislava.
An independent Slovakia will seek higher transit and refining fees from the
Czech lands. To lessen its dependence both on Soviet sources and Slovakia,
however, the Czech republic has already made plans to build a new 3.4m tonne
capacity pipeline to bring oil from Trieste.
One of Bratislava's main economic complaints against Prague is that recent
economic reform measures - in particular freeing of prices - have hit doubly
hard in Slovakia. Officials in the Slovak industry ministry say that because
the republic is a supplier of components and semi-finished steel to Czech
factories, and because the products from Slovak factories are in many cases
still price-controlled, Czech factories receive artifically cheap Slovak
products which they then sell for valuable hard currency.
The collapse in trade between the former Comecon states which followed the
shift to dollar pricing provides a warning about what could happen if the
political and economic links between the two republics are severed. An
independent Slovakia would be hard pressed to sell its products to the west,
except at extremely low prices made possible by a devalued currency.
Potential markets to the east have no money.
But this is a dangerous part of the world in which to be small and poor. The
border between Hungary and Czechoslovakia was defined after the first world
war by the Treaty of Trianon under which Hungary, as part of the defeated
Austro-Hungarian empire, was much diminished. More than 5m Hungarians now
live outside Hungary's borders. If they are made to feel second class
citizens in an independent Slovakia the Hungarian minority may press
Budapest to demand some form of protectorate or even a renegotiation of the
borders which would bring them back into Hungary.
That could open a Pandora's box of similar claims from Poland and the
Ukraine which would further destabilise a region already apprehensive about
the future.

FT  22 JUN 92 / Arts: Charles Groves - Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NOEL GOODWIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The conductor Charles Groves has died at the age of 77. He once said that he
regarded himself as more of a GP than a consultant, and thought there were
too many conductors aspiring to the latter category at the expense of the
former. His career was very much that of the all-purpose music-maker, with
no less distinction in his work across a broad spectrum of the classical and
modern repertory. In working with every major British orchestra and most of
the opera companies, he was utterly professional and totally dependable, as
ready (as he said) 'to do everything from the St John Passion to Messiaen
and Stockhausen'.
He had notable spells of influential association at Bournemouth, where in
1954 he brought the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra into being after civic
support was withdrawn from the old Municipal Orchestra, and with the Royal
Liverpool Philharmonic, 1963-77 (and afterwards as conductor laureate),
where he was the first British conductor to perform all 10 Mahler symphonies
and to establish a post of associate conductor to encourage younger talent.
This interest in developing talent led to his later presidence of the both
the National Youth Orchestra and the National Association of Youth
Orchestras.
Groves was born in London, and entered music by way of St Paul's Cathedral
School and the Royal College of Music. While still at the RCM he was engaged
as a freelance accompanist to play for Toscanini's choral rehearsals at the
BBC, which he then joined as chorusmaster in 1938. During the war years he
was asked to take charge of the Revue Orchestra, and at 28 was appointed
conductor of the BBC Northern Orchestra in Manchester. Here he was expected
'to do about five concerts a week with no guest conductors' and acquired a
broad basis of repertory as a result.
His BBC work brought him into opera by way of several studio productions. He
became music director (1961-63) for Welsh National Opera, which he had
frequently conducted, and from 1978 he spent two years in charge of English
National Opera. where he conducted the complete Ring cycle as well as
Weber's Euryanthe, Verdi's The Two Foscari and other major repertory. He
withdrew early from his contract on grounds of ill-health, but management
problems were a factor.
Groves acknowledged Toscanini and Beecham as formative influences on his
conducting craft, and followed the latter in his championship of Delius,
making several notable recordings during the 1970s.
He was appointed OBE in 1958 and CBE in 1968, and knighted in 1973.

FT  22 JUN 92 / Arts: Orpheus in the Underworld - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Opera North close their 1991-92 season exactly as they opened it, with a
French operetta revival. Last September the choice fell on Chabrier's
L'Etoile, a gem of zany musical farce which the company buffed up to a
splendid new shine. At the Bradford Alhambra last Friday they unveiled a new
production of perhaps the quintessential work of the entire genre, Orphee
aux enfers.
*****
The good things about the evening start with the decision to perform the
operetta in its original version - the small, scabrous two-acter of 1858 -
rather than (as more commonly happens) in Offenbach's grossly overblown
revision of 1874. There is a terrific new translation by Jeremy Sams, which
follows his no less terrific Etoile text in packing into every number a
bundle of saucily singable rhymes (Eurydice sings of the joys of becoming
one of Bacchus's 'Bacchantes/dancing in my scanties') concealing a
considerable amount of style-conscious elegance beneath their impishness.
There is a neat, intimate, on-the-move production by Martin Duncan, in sets
and costumes (designed by Tim Hatley) that marry Classical architecture and
burlesque. The temple facade of Act 1 has a wonked pediment and ruched
curtains; cut-out sheep, pigs, clouds and other elements of the pastoral are
slid on and off with snappy precision.
Mr Duncan and his cast have worked hard on not falling into traditional
attitudes of oo-la-la uproariousness in Hades, always a tricky business in
English-language performances of Offenbach. Here, the can-can flows out of
the final scene with welcome adroitness.
I laughed a great deal: in common the noisily enthusiastic Bradford
audience, I had a jolly time. And yet, since I had expected from a new Opera
North Orpheus something altogether sharper in its sting, I can't conceal a
feeling of disappointment.
A perennial problem crops up in the revival of popular works of genius whose
satire is, paradoxically, universal and tied to a specific place and time.
Orphee aux enfers is perhaps the most explosively tight, purposeful send-up
of a country's ruling class ever penned, yet appreciation of its comedy is
bound up with an intimate knowledge of subjects (the Second Empire, Greek
mythology) with which most modern audiences have lost direct contact.
*****
Mr Duncan's treatment lacks ferocity. He is right not to have gone for the
pile-driver underlining of 'relevances' that so disfigured the ENO's
Pountney-Gerald Scarfe Orpheus. But the Gods in particular seem to fall a
little too easily into postures and routines inherited from Up Pompeii: a
genuine re-creation of satire has moved out of reach. This has much to do
with the cast - on Friday none of the Gods, Jupiter not excepted, proved
quick enough on the draw, verbal or vocal - but also something to do with
Wyn Davies's affectionate but slack conducting, with tempos too often too
slow for the sustaining of vital momentum.
Still, five of the players give great pleasure: this Offenbach vaut le
voyage for them alone. Paul Wade's daffy yet strangely touching John Styx is
one; Linda Ormiston's Scots-accented Public Opinion, a Morningside lady in
tweeds with a mad glint in her eye and to her umbrella ferrule, is a second;
and Alan Oke's matinee-idol Pluto, ideally witty in delivery, is a third.
Harry Nicoll's slyly sweet-faced Orpheus and Linda Kitchen's adorably
bright, bubbling Eurydice look and sound so good in operetta that both could
spend the rest of their careers thus employed.
Co-production with D'Oyly Carte Opera, sponsored by English Estates; in the
Opera North autumn-season repertory from October 14.

FT  22 JUN 92 / Arts: Less talk, more action on the government front -
Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Royal Fine Art Commission has issued an important little yellow book
with a catchy title, Medicis and the Millennium? Government Patronage and
Architecture. It is modestly written by Judy Hillman - a veteran planning
and architectural writer - and modestly produced. It says a lot of things
that have often been said before but nonetheless need repeating, and
repeating until they are really understood, about the need for Government to
build only to the highest quality of design.
We seem to need special events and anniversaries to concentrate the official
mind, and the current focus on the approaching millennium is as good a
reason as any to think about the quality of Britain's buildings and cities
for the long term future. Rumours abound about what is in the mind of the
new Minister in the cabinet with special responsibilities for the National
Heritage. Last week there was press speculation about a new national opera
house which might be built on London's South Bank to house both the Royal
Opera Company and the English National Opera. This seems, to say the least,
a curious idea at precisely the moment the two companies are launching major
appeals for development funds to improve their existing premises.
Mr Mellor's dream of a great millennium monument to be funded by the
Government will, like everything the Government does, need Treasury
approval. Is it perhaps the hope that the proposed national lottery will
suddenly produce a flood of funds to enable the government to be generous to
architecture and the arts? At present it looks as though the Treasury have
still got a lot of decisions to make about the lottery, its tax status, and
the ultimate destination of the funds.
There are four likely destinations. The Millennium Fund optimistically hopes
to pay for every important public building in the country to be restored and
refurbished. Exactly how this is to happen is not clear. As one of the
destinations for lottery cash the Millennium Fund could soon consume most of
the money. The arts in general are to be beneficiaries, as is sport. The
National Heritage - presumably through the excellent National Heritage
Memorial Fund - is the likely fourth beneficiary.
It can be seen that there is no shortage of clients to spend the nation's
betting profits. And there will be no shortage of advice for ministers from
quangoes like the Royal Fine Art Commission and a whole range of artistic
beggars. But pious wishes are no substitute for planning and action. The
millennium is very close and if ministers in this government want to leave
the nation some more substantial monuments than a Canary Wharf full of
unhappy civil servants and acres of empty offices, then a coherent and
effective plan is needed.
Establishing priorities is essential and there are some obvious ones.
Improvement in the quality of the homes of the people should take first
place over everything else ; this is seldom mentioned by anyone except the
Prince of Wales. I recently asked a young friend what he would like to see
to mark the millennium and his reply was very clear. He thought that the
demolition and replacement of all the unsatisfactory tower blocks of the
1960's should be any government's top priority. The recent publication of
the report by the Urban Villages Group offers serious and careful
alternatives for the enhancement of living and working conditions in our
cities. This could be a key to action.
Once the daily lives of the majority are actively improved by better housing
and improved infrastructure, then the nation can afford to contemplate the
arts and heritage and the building of monuments to ministers. The much
lauded grands projet in Paris have not grown up without considerable careful
redevelopment of whole quartiers of the city and a new town programme.
I am sure that Mr Mellor does not need my advice but on the cultural front
it might be helpful to widen the discussion beyond provision of new
facilities for the performing arts. Both the national opera houses in London
need substantial government help; an end to the tedious round of begging
should be Mr Mellor's immediate priority. Then a national home for dance is
clearly lacking and could easily be provided.
Once he has settled those requirements Mr Mellor must take a look at the
visual arts. The nation needs a major, well designed and air-conditioned
exhibition space to catch the great exhibitions that tour the world and only
get as far as Paris. We need a finely designed Grand Palais in London - so
that shows like Gaugin, Seurat and many others do come across the Channel.
There is a real need for more space for contemporary art: the distressing
fact that only some 20 per cent of the Tate Gallery's collection can be
shown to the public is an indication of how bad things are in that area. At
the Victoria and Albert Museum, only a fraction of its great collections can
be permanently shown in the main museum. There is clearly scope for some
rationalisation of national collections and in fields like architectural
drawings there is still no national policy.
Landscape is an area that is not mentioned in the Royal Fine Art
Commission's little yellow book, but it is a key area that should not be
separated from architecture. It is also an area where the expenditure of a
little money could have a big effect. Gardens and landscape need as much
help as buildings and artifacts from the heritage funds.
I have a feeling that Mr Mellor is the kind of minister who takes decisions
rather than advice. He could give us a welcome break from more committees,
quangoes and endless talk about the millennium. Since he is flatteringly
being compared with the Medicis by the Royal Fine Art Commission, perhaps he
might appreciate the words of Duke Cosimo I de' Medici, when he was trying
to stop all the pointless arguments at his Florentine Academy of Design:
'His Excellency says to carry on with the work and not with words, and not
to pay heed to so much babble and humbug, because that is the way not of
getting things done but merely of spreading scandal.' Can we expect less
talk about the millennium and look to Mr Mellor for more action.?

FT  22 JUN 92 / Arts: Aldeburgh Festival - Music
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In her autobiography the soprano Galina Vishnevskaya recounts how delighted
she was to return to Aldeburgh after years away and find that the town had
not changed a bit. There is something about the open fenland and the force
of the elements on the wind-swept East coast: life moves slowly here and
time encourages contemplation of man's place in the world.
It is difficult to think of a more congenial spot in which to make
acquaintance of a new opera by John Tavener. His music also inhabits a
time-scale of its own and the very slowness and inaction is intended to
bestow upon his work a mood of undisturbed transcendental mysticism, as a
remarkably patient Aldeburgh audience found at the premiere of his second
opera, Mary of Egypt, on Friday.
Its story is the same - unintentionally, one imagines - as Massenet's Thais.
It tells of the prostitute Mary and a holyman, who meet in the desert and
through their discovery of each other find their positions in effect
reversed, for she knows true goodness, while he only starts to find it
through his love for her. As Mother Thekla's text spells out at one point,
'there is more than one way to know God'.
*****
The mood is static, imbued with the sounds and rhythms of religious
ceremony. The cast is small; the atmosphere rarified; the manner of
composition full of self-imposed restrictions, using an ancient Byzantine
hymn as the basis for the whole score. As it happens, these are also the
building-blocks of some other stage works that Aldeburgh knows well:
Benjamin Britten's Church Parables. But how much more Britten made of his
comparable exercise.
All the music in Mary of Egypt is derived from two or three phrases. One of
them, a simple harmonic minor scale, is repeated so often that one comes out
with it going round and round in the brain - a hypnotic effect, as the
composer no doubt intended, but one that does not conceal the basic paucity
of ideas. Repetition is all there is, occupying vast half-hour swathes at a
time. An F pedal runs through virtually the whole of the 100-minute score.
Very little actually happens and Lucy Bailey's production, with designs by
Jeremy Herbert, has merely to bide its time with the right aura of mystic
grace. It was not entirely the producer's fault that the scenes of
temptation were so weak. Tavener provided no more than rhythm-less drumming,
at which the dancers, clad in Hare-Krishna orange, regularly became
possessed by a desire to lift their skirts and show us their knickers.
Patricia Rozario was the ideal Mary, spinning long, melismatic lines of
sultry soprano tone; Stephen Varcoe played Zossima, the holy man, with firm
resolution. On-stage and off-stage choruses were taken severally by the
Britten-Pears Chamber Choir and the Choristers of Ely Cathedral, while
Lionel Friend led the musical performance from the pit. Nothing they did,
however, could stop the air of a 1960s 'happening.'
*****
Tavener is the featured composer at Aldeburgh this year and his music turned
up again the next night at the London Sinfonietta's concert. With Oliver
Knussen as conductor and Christopher van Kampen the cello soloist we heard
The Protecting Veil Tavener's recent and unexpected cult success. Compared
with the opera, this score is positively packed with incident and its
luxuriant string harmonies sounded well in the Maltings's glorious
acoustics.
For a complete contrast the programme also included the first performance,
nearly 70 years after it was written, of Grohg, a ballet by Aaron Copland.
Violent, jazzy, a riot of activity in which strong musical ideas tumble one
over another, this is an orchestral showpiece on the lines of Bartok's
Miraculous Madarin and the much-enlarged Sinfonietta played it with noisy
panache.
In the morning the festival's middle week-end gave a respectful nod to its
founder, Britten. None of his five Canticles is without some weakness, but
heard together they make a natural recital programme, the very diversity of
styles lending strength to the series as a whole. The tenor soloist, who
sings in all five, was Adrian Thompson, not an elegant singer, but honest in
his instincts and able to allay any suspicion of artifice in the music.
Nicholas Clapton and Peter Savidge joined him as counter-tenor and baritone;
Roger Vignoles was the pianist, Michael Thompson the solo horn and Skaila
Kanga the harpist, able colleagues all.

RESULTS DUE
TSB, the sixth largest UK banking group, is forecast to make a return to
profits when it announces its half year results on Thursday.
A year ago, TSB dismayed the markets by unveiling pre-tax losses of Pounds
150m after Hill Samuel, the merchant bank bought by the group in 1988, made
a loss of Pounds 319m after bad debt provisions of Pounds 344m.
This time around the news from Hill Samuel is still expected to be fairly
grim, but reduced provisions and improved profits on the retail side should
mean a pre-tax profit for the group of between Pounds 77m and Pounds 100m.
This is still way below the Pounds 175m pre-tax in the first half of 1989,
but the market is more worried about further bad news than hopeful of a
return to good times at TSB.
Airtours, the holiday company, is likely to report an interim pre-tax loss
of Pounds 7.25m tomorrowup from a loss of Pounds 6.2m in the comparable
period because after expansion of the number of holidays on offer. Its
first-half is always far weaken than its second. On that basis, and
notwithstanding any collapse of demand or excessive discounting, the company
should make an increased full-year profit of Pounds 36.5m compared with
Pounds 27.5m.
Three more regional electricity companies are expected to announce bumper
profits this week. On Wednesday, London Electricity should report pre-tax
profits of around Pounds 145.5m, up 41 per cent on last year's pro forma
result, analysts believe. This is close to the average expected for all 12
companies. Earnings per share may be around 48.7p.
Both Southern Electric and South Wales Electricity results are due on
Thursday. Analysts expect an increase of around 50 per cent from Southern,
giving pre-tax profit of close to Pounds 160m. South Wales Electricity, the
smallest of the 12 companies, is expected to report a comparatively modest
rise of just below 30 per cent, giving pre-tax profits of just under Pounds

FT  22 JUN 92 / Economics: Focus on German money supply and cost of living
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ATTENTION will be focused on Germany this week where May money supply data
and the cost of living index for June will be relased.
German M3 money supply growth is unlikely to have slowed significantly last
month. In April the year-on-year rate of growth dropped to 8.8 per cent from
9.4 per cent in March. This was still significantly above the 1992 target
growth rate of between 3.5 per cent and 5.5 per cent.
Economists are forecasting an annual rate of inflation of 4.3 per cent in
May, from a revised 4.6 per cent in April.
However, they are not yet convinced that the inflationary pressures in the
German economy have been successfully squeezed.
Service sector prices have been particularly stubborn. In the first four
months of the year they accelerated to an annual rate of 5.7 per cent
following rent increases.
The following are some of the other economic highlights of the week, with
the figures in brackets the median of economists' forecasts from MMS
International:
Today: UK, May visible trade balance (Pounds 1.1bn deficit), May current
account (Pounds 0.9bn deficit); Japan, May money supply (up 1.4 per cent on
year), April personal consumption expenditure, April personal income;
Canada, first quarter real gdp (up 0.4 per cent on previous quarter).
Tomorrow: Japan, Bank of Japan governor Mieno gives speech to private
organisation; Luxembourg, all markets closed; Australia, April manufacturing
output price index.
Wednesday: UK, first quarter GDP (down 0.5 per cent on quarter, down 1.4 per
cent on year), May building society net new commitments (Pounds 3.2bn),
April new construction orders; US, May durable shipments, June 11-20 auto
sales (6.5m); France, May trade balance (FFr1.5bn surplus).
Thursday: US, final figures for first quarter GDP (up 2.4 per cent), first
quarter GDP deflator (up 3.1 per cent), first quarter after tax corporate
profits, May existing home sales, May export price index, May import price
index, initial claims for week ended June 13 (400,000), money supply data
for week ended June 15; Australia, April import prices; Switzerland, Swiss
National Bank annual press conference.
Friday: US, May personal income (up 0.4 per cent), May personal consumption
expenditure (up 0.4 per cent), May bank credit, May commercial and
industrial loans; Japan, June Tokyo CPI (up 2.5 per cent on year), excluding
perishables (up 2.5 per cent on year), May national CPI (up 2.1 per cent on
year) excluding perishables (up 2.4 per cent on year), May industrial
production (up 0.5 per cent), May retail sales (up 0.6 per cent on year);
Australia, April motor vehicle registrations (up 4 per cent); Portugal, EC
summit - continues until 27 June.
During the week: Germany, May import prices (up 0.2 per cent on month, down
2.1 per cent on year), May M3 (up 8.5 per cent), June preliminary cost of
living (up 0.3 per cent on month, up 4.3 per cent on year); Italy, May trade
balance (L2.1 trillion deficit), June, CPI - major cities (up 5.8 per cent
on year), April cumulative PSBR (L55 trillion), May bank lending (up 15 per
cent on year), May hourly earnings (up 6.5 per cent on year); Belgium, May
CPI.

FT  22 JUN 92 / Union split with TUC averted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A THREATENED split between the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union
and the Trades Union Congress has been averted after the union's electrical
wing called off a proposed merger with a union representing airline cabin
crew.
The TUC had told the union that the merger would be against its rules
because the airline union, Cabin Crew 89, was a breakaway from a union
affiliated to the TUC.
The issue had clouded already complicated negotiations over the future
affiliation of the AEEU to the TUC.
The AEEU was formed last month through the merger of the AEU engineering
union, which is affiliated to the TUC, and the EETPU electricians' union,
which was expelled in 1988.
The electricians had hoped to press ahead with the merger in spite of
objections from the TUC. Mr Gavin Laird, AEEU general secretary, has now
written to the TUC saying the merger will not go ahead.
However, the negotiations are not yet assured of a successful outcome. Mr
Laird has said that the AEEU will not agree to demands from unions
affiliated to the TUC that the EETPU give up members it signed from other
unions before it merged with the AEU.
Among unions with grievances is Ucatt, the construction workers' union.
The EETPU claims to have recruited more than 10,000 of Ucatt's members
during the last year. However, Ucatt says the actual figure is much less
than that.

FT  22 JUN 92 / Foreign companies 'hiring less'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of people employed in foreign-owned manufacturing companies
slowed to a halt in the 1980s, according to a study of government figures by
by Incomes Data Services, the pay research body, David Goodhart writes.
In spite of claims by the government that deregulation during the 1980s has
led to a large inflow of foreign capital and jobs, the percentage of
employees working for foreign-owned manufacturers was static at 15 per cent
between 1979 and 1989.
The percentage rose from 11 per cent to 15 per cent between 1973 and 1979.
The total working for foreign manufacturers declined from 974,000 in 1979 to
724,000 in 1989, at a time when private manufacturing employment as a whole
was falling from 6.5m to 4.9m.
The organisation says that part of the reason is that the growth in Japanese
groups in the 1980s has been offset by reduced employment in the US
multinationals such as Ford.
The report concludes that the trend in employment by foreign-based
manufacturers is likely to improve.

FT  22 JUN 92 / Industrial demand up in W Midlands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WEST MIDLANDS engineering companies have reported a rise in the number of
orders received over the past three months, with domestic demand growing
more strongly than export demand.
The performance of these companies is often seen as a barometer of British
manufacturing industry.
The west Midlands branch of the Engineering Employers' Federation says in
its latest quarterly survey that 46 per cent of its member companies had an
improved order position in May, compared with 34 per cent in February. The
proportion of companies experiencing a decline in orders dropped from 37 per
cent to to 25 per cent over the same period.
Mr David Botterill, the branch's chief executive, said the results were
'most encouraging' but added: 'It must always be remembered that these
improvements are from a very low base' and that 'there is still a long way
to go before we can say that the recession is over'.

FT  22 JUN 92 / The Faltering Economy: Signposts point to a bumpy road -
Coaxing a revival out of the economy will take patience
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS industry hauls itself along the 'bumpy road' to economic recovery
signposted by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, its leaders insist that they
do not want to be rescued from recession by another short-lived boom.
They can stop worrying: reports from boardrooms and factory floors around
the country suggest that while the worst of the recession may be over, any
upturn will have to be patiently coaxed out of the economy. The process of
recovery promises to be a long haul.
The prize may be the long-sought circle of low inflation, rising
competitiveness and an increasing share of world markets. Failure will mean
a slip in Britain's ability to pay its way in the European single market and
in global markets.
Many industries agree that, after a false dawn last autumn, the early months
of this year saw renewed flickerings of improvement in demand.
Most also suggest, however, that the momentum has stalled, with industry
facing continuing spare capacity and uncertain patterns of demand. Where
higher volume sales are achieved, they are invariably offset by lower
selling prices.
The result is that businessmen are again indulging in what one textile chief
this week dubbed 'group therapy' - musing on corporate ambitions to be
fulfilled when the economy finally permits.
Manufacturers so far managing to report a brighter picture include some of
those in pharmaceuticals and in plastics and paper. Any significant boost to
car sales remains elusive, while commercial vehicle sales are still falling
after nearly three years.
Companies still deep in recession include engineering businesses as well as
those in aerospace, shipbuilding and construction.
All hopes for recovery now rest on a steady improvement in overall business
activity during the rest of this year, with progress consolidated and built
on through next year.
'The road ahead will be uneven and there will be setbacks along the way,'
says Mr Sudhir Junankar, deputy director of economic affairs at the
Confederation of British Industry. 'But by the end of next year we should
see industrial activity levels back to where they were before the recession
began to bite in 1990.'
In spite of what promises to be painfully slow progress, industry is not
beating on the government's door for help. Most calls for assistance centre
on the need for an immediate start in reducing what remain historically high
real interest rates. But Mr Lamont is in no hurry. Some manufacturers still
want fiscal incentives to stimulate investment, but Mr Lamont has no
intention of obliging.
The managing director of an industrial machinery manufacturer based in the
west Midlands says: 'The government is defying economic gravity by keeping
interest rates so high. It makes full economic recovery a pipe dream.'
Mr Simon Powell, finance director of the 600 Group, the machine-tool and
mechanical handling company, says: 'Everyone was a bit too optimistic about
the rate of recovery, but at least we see no prospect of collapsing again.'
His company, like many others, sees no material change in business from a
year ago. It has made big cost savings and in 'one hell of a shake-out' has
cut a workforce of nearly 3,000 to 1,700 in two years. Mr Powell reflects:
'The real tragedy is that so many people have gone off to sell insurance,
and they won't be coming back.'
Although a further round of cuts in staffing in manufacturing looks
unlikely, selective redundancies continue. Industrialists remain pessimistic
about the outlook for jobs, claiming any improvement could be 18 months
away. The manufacturing sector has so far lost about 750,000 jobs compared
with 2m during the early 1980s.
600 Group is pursuing a programme of sharply focused investment. According
to Mr Powell: 'We are not buying a machine if repairs will keep an existing
plant going longer. We are spending in areas which can make us more flexible
in our response to customer demand.'
The picture is confirmed by companies such as Usher-Walker, the printing ink
and roller manufacturer, which says that while ink sales to newspaper and
packaging businesses are up on last year, customers are not yet replacing
printing hardware.
A return to higher levels of investment in fixed assets - down in the
manufacturing sector by nearly 20 per cent since 1990 - can come only with
better profit margins. A compensatory factor, however, is inward investment
by overseas-based companies seeking a foothold in the EC.
A strong feature of this recession has been the decline in long-term order
books. 'We face far less predictable ordering patterns from customers, who
cannot predict their own sales,' says Mr Edward Roberts, chairman and chief
executive of Heath Springs, a Midlands automotive component manufacturer.
Mr Roberts says there is a growing tendency among small and medium-sized
companies to 'buy in' business at uneconomic prices in order to maintain
output - 'a desperate measure and a recipe for disaster'.
Industry also concedes, however, that the recession - as in the early 1980s
 -has served to concentrate corporate minds on seeking new efficiencies.
Productivity has improved more quickly in this recession than in the last,
and is back to the levels of early 1990.
Pay rises in manufacturing are running at half the level recorded a year
ago. Price and cost inflation in the manufacturing sector are at their
lowest levels for 40 years and some forecasts suggest they could be below 3
per cent by 1997.
The prospect offers the opportunity to remain competitive throughout the
remainder of the 1990s - a bonus already reflected in an export performance
that has improved as home markets have deteriorated.
The shedding of skilled labour, a reduction in investment and the threat of
an eventual wage explosion may present serious handicaps as a revival gets
under way. For the moment, though, industry confronts the continuing
difficulties of underperformance rather than overheating.
Mr Harry Evans launched Dolphin Packaging 21 years ago with a redundancy
payment, and achieved a Stock Exchange quote for his Dorset company in 1987.
He says although sales to supermarket suppliers are slowly but steadily
improving, he is not about to put out any flags.
'Business will only really expand again when people who are now trying to
get out of debt are again ready to take it on', he said. 'That could be a
long time coming.'

FT  22 JUN 92 / London Zoo may gain lifeline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CONSORTIUM of companies is to put proposals to the Zoological Society of
London in the next few days to inject Pounds 61m into redeveloping its
36-acre Regent's Park site and creating a conservation centre.
The consortium said: 'Anyone who thinks the zoo can stay the same is
foolhardy. There will have to be changes. This is the only alternative they
have.'
London Zoo, which was founded 166 years ago, announced last week that it
would be forced to close on September 30 as a result of falling attendances.
Mr David Laing, the leisure entrepreneur and a member of the Zoological
Society, has spent more than Pounds 100,000 drawing up the proposals. He is
backed by the John Laing construction company, the Samuel Montagu finance
house, and Cambridge Seven Associates, a design firm.
The consortium, called New Zoo Developments, is also seeking a meeting with
government representatives as 'a matter of urgency'.
London Zoo yesterday welcomed the consortium's outline proposals and said it
would be interested in receiving further details.
The consortium said it would need a binding agreement from the Zoological
Society before it entered into further feasibility studies costing more than
Pounds 500,000.
The proposals, which would be introduced over an eight-year period, envisage
the building of a conservation centre to recreate three varieties of
rainforest environment. An aquarium and film theatre would also be built, as
well as new habitats for many of the zoo's animals.

FT  22 JUN 92 / Falling output predicted for south by bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTHERN England will continue to suffer depressed economic conditions this
year with output falling and unemployment rising sharply, National
Westminster Bank warns.
While Wales, the north of England and Scotland will lead a sluggish economic
upturn, the bank expects the number of jobless in the south-west, the
south-east and East Anglia to increase by 13 per cent, 16 per cent and 17
per cent respectively in the 12 months to March next year.
Output in the three southern regions is expected to fall by between 0.1 per
cent and 0.2 per cent this year, compared with economic growth of 0.4 per
cent in the north of England, and 0.5 per cent in Wales.
Mr David Kern, the bank's chief economist, says in a report that he expects
the UK economy to start growing in the present quarter and to reach a 2 per
cent annual growth rate by the end of the year. He forecasts 0.3 per cent
growth for the economy as a whole this year, with the non-oil economy
stagnating.
He predicts that the economy 'will register a distinct improvement' next
year, with relatively strong growth of between 2.4 per cent and 2.8 per cent
in the south and Midlands and growth of 2.6 per cent in Scotland.
Unemployment, he warns, will rise by about 250,000 to peak at 2.95m by the
end of March next year, lifting the UK rate to 10.5 per cent from 9.6 per
cent last month.
Apart from Northern Ireland and East Anglia, where the bank forecasts
unemployment rates of 14.6 per cent and 8.7 per cent respectively in March
this year, joblessness in the regions is not expected to deviate by more
than 1 percentage point from the average.
NatWest expects Scottish and Welsh unemployment to be clearly below the
national average at 9.5 per cent by next spring while the west Midlands will
have the highest mainland jobless rate of 11.5 per cent. The south-east will
have a jobless rate at the national average of 10.5 per cent.

FT  22 JUN 92 / Ashdown defends anti-Tory 'forum'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PADDY ASHDOWN, the Liberal Democrat leader, was forced on to the
defensive yesterday after colleagues claimed that his hope of changing the
shape of progressive politics would split their party.
His speech to a party meeting last month, in which he called for a new forum
for those wishing to see 'a viable alternative to Conservatism', has been
criticised by some Liberal Democrats as a return to the 1970s Lib-Lab pact.
Mr Ashdown said on BBC television yesterday that he wanted a discussion
about the future of British politics that went wider than just the Liberal
Democrat and Labour parties. He said he wanted it to include Green
politicians and Conservatives worried about their party's monopoly of power.
'There is an opportunity now to reshape the process of progressive politics
in Britain,' Mr Ashdown said. 'If that were to happen it would produce the
consequences that are better for democracy and better for the country.'
Sir Cyril Smith, formerly Liberal Democrat MP for Rochdale, warned, however,
that moves to realignment on the left would divide the party. 'There would
be mass resignations, probably by as many as a third of the members,' he
said. 'I think it would virtually kill the party.'
Mr Ashdown dismissed Sir Cyril's words with a comment that the ex-MP often
launched such 'Exocets' and they usually had 'more sound than effect'. But
the concern was echoed by Ms Liz Lynne, the present Liberal Democrat MP for
Rochdale. 'I was voted for by a number of people who were anti-Labour,' she
said. 'I got a lot of the soft Conservative vote . . . and if I said I was
in favour of any deal with Labour I would be selling them out.'
Mr Ashdown emphasised that talking to other parties and finding common
planks of policy did not necessarily lead to electoral pacts. He said he
shared the distaste for pacts expressed by Mr John Smith, the leading
contender for the Labour leadership.

FT  22 JUN 92 / Low-cost homes policy criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANNING deals with developers offer only limited scope to increase the
supply of affordable housing for rent, according to a report published today
by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the social research organisation.
Ministers have urged councils to negotiate with developers for a 'quota' of
low-cost housing for rent on larger development sites when granting planning
permission. The homes could be let through housing associations to families
on council waiting lists or to homeless people in order to bridge the
expected shortfall in affordable housing for rent.
The Rowntree report, however, says the number of inexpensive homes for rent
provided by such arrangements is unlikely to exceed 2,000 a year during the
next five years.
Three quarters of councils surveyed had considered using planning agreements
to create affordable housing. Only 18 per cent had the powers to insist that
developers provide such housing in private developments.
Most schemes involved transfers of land - normally to housing associations -
free or below market price. Only 18 per cent involved the developer in
building homes and giving them to the association or transferring them at
cost.
The report concludes that planning agreements have some potential but are an
imprecise way of meet-ing targets for affordable housing.
It also suggests that more affordable housing might be built if developers
made cash payments into an affordable housing fund to provide homes on
alternative sites.

FT  22 JUN 92 / Liverpool council debt rescheduled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CONSORTIUM of foreign banks which lent Liverpool City Council Pounds 30m
in 1984 has agreed to reschedule the remaining debt to give the city
breathing space to tackle its troubles. The loan was made to avert a budget
crisis in the then Militant-influenced authority.
Negotiations were held in secret in January and the consortium, led by
Banque Paribas, agreed to the rescheduling in March. Final payment of Pounds
17m was due on April 1. Now Pounds 15m of that principal will be repaid over
the next five years.
Liverpool still has two other big foreign bank loans to clear from its
Militant era - Pounds 30m from Union Bank of Switzerland from 1985 and a
similar sum from Yasuda of Tokyo the following year. Those two were deferred
purchases, where a two or three-year holiday is followed by seven years of
interest charges and repayments, pushing the cost of each to about Pounds
42m.
The series of three Pounds 30m loans saved Liverpool from insolvency after
the council repeatedly set deficit budgets to try to force the second
Thatcher government to give it more money. The tactic was subsequently
outlawed by the government.
The money Liverpool borrowed went into the city's capital account to help
pay for ambitious municipal housebuilding and neighbourhood improvements.
The government was then encouraging the private sector and housing
associations to form partnerships to do the job instead.
Such deals are usually nego
The rescheduling has enabled Liverpool to break a seemingly endless annual
cycle of difficulties over debt repayment and budget crises bequeathed by
its Militant-dominated council, 47 Labour members of which were disqualified
from office for five years for financial mismanagement.
Mr Harry Rimmer, Labour leader of the council, said at the weekend the
council told Paribas it was fully prepared to repay the Pounds 17m but that
rescheduling it would avert cuts, help economic regeneration and improve its
ability to pay in the future.
'We budgeted conservatively and did not assume there would be a Labour
government to bail us out,' he added. 'We were also able to show that
despite our troubles last year, Liverpool has never reneged on a
commitment.'
The government supported Liverpool in the Paribas negotiations, as it did
last year when the council took on the town-hall unions to win a seven-month
strike and push through more than 3,000 redundancies to reduce overstaffing.
The council is now run by a minority group of Labour moderates, who rely on
Liberal Democrat support to keep at bay a rump of leftwingers expelled from
the Labour party. Mr Tony Jennings, leader of the leftwing group, attended
the negotiations over the rescheduling, however, and made a supportive
statement.
During last year's strikes Nalgo, the white-collar union, called out city
treasury staff to try to make the council default on interest charges and
debt repayments. Instead, senior managers did the clerical work and signed
the cheques.

FT  22 JUN 92 / Doubts cast over new trust hospitals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS have been warned that many of the self-governing trust hospitals
due to come into operation next April may not be viable as separate units.
The Commons was told by Mr Brian Mawhinney, health minister, last week that
150 hospitals and other services had applied to become third-wave trusts
from next April - a greater number than in the first and second waves. Still
more hospitals are considering becoming fourth-wave trusts in 1994.
Mr Mawhinney said that demonstrated that more and more National Health
Service staff were behind the government's health reforms.
But the NHS Trust Federation, which represents the boards of trusts, has
expressed concern to the Department of Health that many of the proposed
third and fourth-wave trusts may have neither the managerial skills nor the
strength in the NHS internal market to operate as successfully as the
established self-governing hospitals. Trusts are run by their own managers
and boards outside health authority control.
Mr John Greetham, chairman of the federation and of St James's University
Hospital Trust, Leeds, said the federation believed it would be sensible for
third and fourth-wave trusts to consider merging with existing trusts.
He identified two difficulties. The government requirement that hospitals
should not undercut each other by cross-subsidising activities meant that
even if smaller hospitals were strong in some clinical areas, they would
find it difficult to achieve all-round viability as trusts. The second would
be the fact that 'there is only a limited number of good managers in any
industry or service'.

FT  22 JUN 92 / Council care plans may be delayed: Ministries clash over
funding arrangements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CLASH between government departments about community care has led some
ministers to contemplate postponing the planned transfer to councils of
responsibility for people in nursing and residential homes.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, is keen for the funding to be
'ring-fenced' as special grants to councils, rather than simply being
included in the total grant to local government. The aim is to ensure that
councils use the money for community care and cannot divert it to other
projects.
The Department of the Environment, however, is concerned that if that
approach is followed, the transfer of responsibility, which was intended as
a vote of confidence in local authorities, will be so hedged about with
restrictions that it will be seen as the opposite.
As work on the transfer of responsibility for April next year has advanced,
the difficulties have dismayed some ministers so much that the possibility
of a delay - or even changing the policy - has been raised.
Ironically, preparations by councils for the transfer have contributed to
worries about the policy, as their work has shown up a greater need than
ministers were expecting. That is bound to increase the pressure on the
government to provide more money when the responsibilities switch to the
councils.
The policy of transferring responsibility to councils has had a troubled
history. Councils were due to take over the responsibility in April last
year, but the introduction of the poll tax then delayed the plans, as
ministers were concerned that the cost would affect poll-tax bills too much.
Mr Brian Mawhinney, the health minister, insisted to MPs last week that
steady progress was being made towards implementing the arrangements. 'We
are not talking about disasters waiting to happen,' he said. 'We are
committing all our efforts, with local authorities, to ensuring that the
policy will be a real success.'
Nonetheless, the interdepartmental dispute may have to be resolved in a
cabinet committee. Officials believe that in practice the arrangements are
so far advanced that there is little option but to go ahead as planned. The
final decision on how funding should be available may not, however, be taken
before discussions in the autumn on the public-spending round.

FT  22 JUN 92 / Delors is dubbed harmless by Clarke
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EFFORTS by the government to rehabilitate Mr Jacques Delors with the
Conservative party were renewed yesterday as Mr Kenneth Clarke, home
secretary, mounted a defence of the European Commission president.
'Jacques Delors is harmless compared to some of the rivals being put in
against him,' Mr Clarke said on TV-am. 'I think we ought to wait and see who
becomes president without deciding that this man is responsible for every
piece of nonsense that has come out of Brussels in the last few years.'
Mr Delors is expected to be reappointed president this week with UK
government support.
Mr Clarke said Mr Delors 'will follow through what he says about not wanting
the Commission to be over-centralised, not wanting the Commission to
interfere in things which would be better run by national governments. Then
he will be in line with what we believe we have negotiated in Maastricht.'
As well as the presidency issue, Euro-sceptics will soon seize on the
48-hour working week as a target if the UK is outvoted on the issue at the
social affairs council in Luxembourg on Wednesday. Senior ministers are to
meet before the council to decide the UK's voting stance.
The government's determination to isolate the Euro-sceptics was underlined
yesterday when Sir Norman Fowler, Tory party chairman, emphasised that the
decision to delay further parliamentary discussion of the Maastricht bill
until the autumn should not be seen as reducing the commitment to 'keep
Britain at the heart of Europe'.
The Institute for Public Policy Research, the leftwing think tank, today
outlines recommendations for the UK presidency of the EC, including better
access for eastern European goods in western markets and EC intervention to
compensate for market failings in areas such as labour skills and income
support.

FT  22 JUN 92 / National organisation for enterprise agencies planned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S 300-plus enterprise agencies, which provide support for small
businesses, intend to launch their own national organisation in September
after a decision by Business in the Community (BITC) to end its sponsorship
role.
BITC has been the umbrella organisation for the agencies for the past 10
years, but said this month it wanted to broaden its activities.
Plans for the national organisation are being headed by the Association of
Local Enterprise Agencies, which groups 18 such bodies in the east Midlands
and East Anglia. Representatives of regional groups of agencies from the
north of England, the Midlands and Wales approved the proposal at a meeting
last week.
The proposed September launch cuts across BITC's own plan for a conference
in October to establish a national organisation to be run by the agencies
themselves.
Mr Mike Horner, chairman of the Association of Local Enterprise Agencies,
said: 'This is not a case of the agencies declaring UDI. We are simply
accepting the reality that if the enterprise agencies want representation
they have to do it themselves.'
Mr Horner was confident that the agencies that did not take part in last
week's meeting - mainly those in the south and south-west of England - would
attend the September gathering.
The agencies' national organisation would take on many of the tasks now
carried out by BITC: lobbying on behalf of the agencies with the government,
co-ordinating relations with business sponsors and helping with issues such
as training.
The new organisation is expected to have an office in London, possibly
making use of BITC's offices. BITC, however, would not be involved.
The Association of Local Enterprise Agencies has discussed its plans with
BITC and with Baroness Denton, small business minister at the Department of
Trade and Industry.

FT  22 JUN 92 / More pension delays likely
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOUSANDS of Maxwell pensioners are likely to suffer further delays in
payments of their pensions as a result of the criminal charges brought by
the Serious Fraud Office against Mr Kevin Maxwell, Mr Ian Maxwell and Mr
Larry Trachtenberg last Thursday.
Civil proceedings by liquidators trying to recover disputed pension-fund
assets are likely to be suspended until after the criminal cases have been
settled, which may take years.
None of the accountants acting as administrators or liquidators to companies
in the Maxwell empire was warned by the SFO of its intention to act so soon.
Two have privately expressed concern in spite of comments from the
liquidators to the Maxwell pension funds last week that the arrests would
not affect the conduct of their proceedings.
The civil action includes writs issued by Robson Rhodes, liquidator to
Bishopsgate Investment Management, manager and trustee of the Maxwell
pension funds, for the recovery of up to Pounds 450m from the two Maxwell
brothers and up to seven more writs, also from Robson Rhodes, against
institutions that hold shares whose ownership is in dispute.
Arthur Andersen, administrator to the private Maxwell business empire, has
also launched a number of writs over shares and assets whose ownership is in
dispute.
Mr Neil Cooper, the liquidator at Robson Rhodes, said: 'Nothing at the
moment has stayed proceedings. We still hope to go ahead. I am not
necessarily confident that the hearing will be effective. It would be a
great pity if the effect (of criminal charges) was to delay recovery.'
Robson Rhodes was due to bring its case against Mr Kevin Maxwell in the High
Court late next month. Courts do have the power to permit civil proceedings
to go ahead but often administrators can press for criminal bankruptcy to
claim assets from anyone convicted at the end of a criminal trial.
Meanwhile Mr John Talbot, the Arthur Andersen partner who is administrator
to the private Maxwell companies, is believed to have been served a notice
by the SFO under Section 2 of the 1987 Criminal Justice Act, which requires
him to answer its questions with no right to silence.
That may conflict with powers invoked by both Andersen and Robson Rhodes
under Section 236 of the 1986 Insolvency Act to gather information from the
Maxwell brothers.
Those powers are available to the administrators but not to the SFO. It
still has to be determined whether the SFO will be able to gain access to
the Section 236 interviews under its Section 2 notice.

FT  22 JUN 92 / Maxwell auditors criticise Imro
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COOPERS &amp; Lybrand, accountants of the Maxwell empire, said yesterday it
would take legal advice over criticism in a confidential report on the
regulatory supervision of the Maxwell companies.
The accountancy firm said it was outraged at criticism levelled in the
unpublished report by Imro, the self-regulatory body for the fund management
industry.
Leaks from the report and briefings about its contents have led to hostility
between the auditors and regulators amid indications from the government
that it is reluctant to involve itself in the report's publication.
Mr Frank Field, Labour MP for Birkenhead, has called on the government to
examine ways of publishing the report, which has been submitted to the
Securities and Investments Board.
Mr Field, who was chairman of the all-party Commons social security
committee in the last parliament, is one of the MPs leading the campaign on
behalf of the Maxwell pensioners.
Publication has been delayed because of fears that the report might be
libellous, but Mr Field said that if the report was released as a Commons
paper, anyone who wished to use it in a legal action would have to seek
permission from the House.
The government would prefer publication of the report to be handled by SIB,
which is taking legal advice about plans to publish an edited version by mid
July, before the Commons disperses.
The Financial Times reported on June 10 that Imro had produced the report,
which is understood to be largely self-critical. Imro admits in the report
that it failed to set up proper risk assessment procedures.
Extracts in yesterday's Sunday Times, which said it had been shown a copy,
demonstrate that Imro appears also to be directing some blame for failures
in the regulation of Maxwell companies at Coopers.
Coopers audited for Bishopsgate Investment Management (BIM) and London &amp;
Bishopsgate International (LBI), the Maxwell-owned companies at the centre
of the scandal over the disappearance of Pounds 427m from Maxwell pension
funds.
Coopers said it was outraged by a suggestion that it had delayed release of
its own report to Imro, prepared after Mr Robert Maxwell's death last
November. Imro said Coopers had seemed 'most reluctant' to provide the
report, but Coopers said a draft was sent on December 4, having been
completed on the previous evening.
Imro's report said it had relied on the auditors to take corrective action
after Coopers had identified a series of shortcomings in the accounts of LBI
and BIM during its audit work in 1990. It also claimed that Coopers did not
use an 'established gateway' to IMRO to voice any important concerns.
Coopers said yesterday that the shortcomings had been procedural items and
pointed out that it had a statutory obligation to inform Imro only about LBI
and not BIM. That gap in reporting requirements, Coopers said, was a
legislative failing that needed to be addressed by the government.

FT  22 JUN 92 / MGN Pounds 300m loss expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE long-awaited accounts of Mirror Group Newspapers, to be published
tomorrow, will show losses of more than Pounds 300m after full provisions
have been made.
The newspaper group's gross losses are expected to total about Pounds 400m.
The losses include the money that disappeared in the last months of Robert
Maxwell's life and Pounds 150m in lost pension-fund money.
The trading profits of the group, which includes the Daily Mirror, Sunday
Mirror, The People, Daily Record and Sunday Mail, are expected to be about
Pounds 80m.
No one was prepared to bid for MGN until its true financial position was
known.  Directors expect to announce the completion of a two-year financing
package for MGN - Pounds 180m in lease finance and Pounds 250m in loan
facilities. The relisting of MGN shares, suspended in December, is not
expected for at least a further two weeks.
Completion of medium-term financing clears the way for the sale of the
majority stake under the control of Arthur Andersen, the administrators, and
which is in effect owned by a group of banks. An early sale seems unlikely,
although as many as nine groups have expressed an interest.
Mr John Talbot, the Arthur Andersen administrator, will say only that he has
no plans to sell the majority stake. It might be next year before the
company is sold. Earlier this month the government set up a Department of
Trade and Industry inquiry into events at MGN and in particular last year's
flotation.
Apart from disclosing MGN's present financial position, the document will
also set out in detail how 'irregular transactions' involving the company
came to be made. That account is expected to throw more light on the
resignations last week of Mr Ernest Burrington as chairman of MGN and Mr
Lawrence Guest as finance director.

FT  22 JUN 92 / Balancing profit and principle: A look at the fixed social
objectives of the Co-operative movement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE windswept town of Lerwick in the Shetland Isles there is a fine Co-op
supermarket that sells basic provisions to the locals, occasionally
supplemented by a big demand for fancy chocolates from passing Russian
sailors.
The supermarket charges exactly the same prices as its sister stores on the
Scottish mainland - in spite of the high additional costs of transporting
goods to the island by sea and the lack of any serious competition.
That seemingly perverse commercial approach sums up the trading philosophy
of the Co-operative Wholesale Society, Europe's biggest Co-operative
organisation.
Mr David Skinner, 60, who today takes over as chief executive of the CWS,
explains it by saying that, for the Co-operative movement, social
responsibility comes before revenue. Profit is not all.
The CWS, owned by the 65 retail societies and 200,000 individual members and
boasting sales of Pounds 3bn a year, believes it has a duty to serve such
remote communities rather than to exploit them.
Such principles have changed little since 1844, when a group of 28 working
men, known as the 'Rochdale pioneers', formed the first co-operative society
to supply members with unadulterated food. The assets were held in trust and
the most of the venture's profit - or surplus - was returned to members in
the form of 'divis'.
The Co-operative movement's influence grew enormously in the late 1800s as
it became embedded in working-class culture. By the turn of the century
there were 1,400 societies in Britain with imitators around the globe.
In more recent years, the history of the movement has been one of seemingly
inexorable decline, however. The end of rationing after the Second World
War, the abolition of resale price maintenance in the mid 1960s and the
emergence of strong national retailing chains with easy access to capital
markets combined with the changing economy and class composition of the UK
to hasten the erosion of the movement's appeal.
Its share of the retail market is down to less than half what it was in the
1920s. Nevertheless, with annual sales of more than Pounds 7bn and with
83,000 staff and 8m members, the 65 Co-operative societies still account for
5 per cent of all retail sales.
Sir Dennis Landau, who has just retired after 12 years at the helm of the
CWS, says: 'The Co-operative movement is the third sector in the economy,
quite unlike either the private or the public sectors.'
The pioneers would 'be hellish surprised' by the present shape of the
movement, he says. The CWS alone is now the UK's biggest commercial farmer,
a non-profit wholesaler to the rest of the Co-operative movement, a big food
manufacturer and retailer as well as a substantial operator of funeral,
travel, banking and insurance services, opticians and milk deliveries.
During his tenure Sir Dennis instilled a far greater commercial instinct in
the CWS by re-investing more in the infrastructure of the business,
introducing more efficient central warehousing, upgrading the quality of its
stores portfolio and leading the way in appealing to environmental and
ethical shoppers.
'At the end of the 1960s the writing was clearly on the wall for the
Co-operative movement,' he says. 'It took us a long time to realise that to
do anything in the world we had to be economically successful. We had to
have a bottom line.'
Mr Skinner notes that the Co-operative movement can attempt to build on a
very strong presence in certain parts of the country. In Scotland, north and
south-west England, he says it has more than 15 per cent of the regional
packaged grocery markets.
He believes there is more scope for the Co-operative movement to exploit its
collective strength while maintaining its deep-rooted independent
traditions.
'If we get the trading formula right, we can get the best of both worlds,'
he says. 'We can be a strong regional business which people can identify
with but also have the benefits of being a national operator.'
In spite of the improvements, however, the Co-operative movement's progress
will continue to be hampered by its inability to raise money from the stock
market and the performance of some of the weaker societies, which tend to
damage the Co-op's image and cause difficulty when they are eventually
absorbed into larger societies. No Co-operatives are ever allowed to go
bust.
Mr Richard Hyman, director of Verdict, the retail research group, says: 'The
Co-operative movement is in vastly better shape than for a long, long time
and may be able to arrest the rate of decline in market share. But in the
longer term it must continue to fall.'
Mr Skinner has a tough job trying to balance principle and profit. Many
consumers will hope he succeeds. Not least the shoppers of Lerwick.

FT  22 JUN 92 / Khmer Rouge joins Cambodia talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN international conference on aid to war-ravaged Cambodia began a full
session in Tokyo early today, with Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan
reluctantly taking part alongside leaders of the country's other factions.
He had threatened to boycott the meeting, which aims to raise about Dollars
600m (Pounds 325m) to rebuild Cambodia after more than a decade of civil
war. But he changed his mind yesterday, apparently under pressure from
China, the host country, Japan, and the other Cambodian factions.
The conference is being attended by representatives of over 30 countries, 12
international organisations and the European Commission.
There had earlier been conflicting reports about the Khmer Rouge's
participation.
A boycott of the meeting by Mr Khieu would have left the Khmer Rouge even
more isolated, as its refusal to participate in the disarmament phase of a
UN-brokered peace settlement has already cast doubt on the future of the
country.
The Khmer Rouge has refused to lay down arms until Vietnamese troops have
left the country. Vietnam says its troops have all done so.
Today's conference is a centrepiece of Japan's efforts to play a larger role
in seeking a solution to the Cambodian conflict. Tokyo is expected to pledge
Dollars 150m to the effort and the government is looking at whether it
should send troops from its self-defence forces to Cambodia.
Prince Norodom Sihanouk, president of the SNC, said he would like troops
from Japan to construct roads and bridges in his country under the control
of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia.

FT  22 JUN 92 / Negotiation likely to be Mandela's only choice: The
political aftermath of a week of confrontation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WE WANT arms now, declared the slogan on the placard greeting Mr Nelson
Mandela, president of the African National Congress, as he arrived to
address a township rally yesterday at the end of a week of confrontation and
violence that has stunned South Africa.
At a dusty football ground at Evaton, 25 miles south of Johannesburg, the
ANC leader was left in no doubt about the anger of the 15,000-strong,
predominantly youthful, crowd.
'Mandela', declared another poster, 'give us permission to kill our
enemies'. And as the ANC president asked what the party should do, a forest
of arms went up, with fists clenched and index finger curled, simulating the
trigger action of a gun.
It would have been surprising if Mr Mandela had responded to the anger with
anything other than the announcement that he was suspending bilateral talks
with the government designed to end last May's impasse in constitutional
negotiations.
It was all but inevitable that the stalemate at the Convention for a
Democratic South Africa (Codesa), the multi-party negotiating forum, should
be followed by confrontation in the townships.
More than two years after Mr Mandela's release the ANC and its allies seemed
as far away as ever from their main objective; running the government of
South Africa. In the eyes of many of their impatient and expectant followers
the political changes that have taken place are no more than cosmetic. And
as it became apparent at Codesa that the government was determined to resist
ANC demands for a majority rule constitution and insist on what amounts to a
white veto, it was only a matter of time before the frustrations turned into
violence.
But for all the anger it is hard to see that Mr Mandela has any choice but
eventually to return to the negotiating table: the ANC is outgunned by the
security forces, and trade sanctions are a dead letter.
And ANC talk of the 'Leipzig option' - overwhelming the government by
putting millions of demonstrators on the street - is treated sceptically by
government. Officials acknowledge the capacity of the ANC and trade unions
to conduct a successful one- or two-day stay-away, but doubt that this or
any other 'mass action' can be sustained for much longer.
For President F W de Klerk, however, having the upper hand - for the time
being at least - would be a Pyrrhic victory.
Only peace and stability, his officials concede, can bring about the
economic recovery the country desperately needs.
Nevertheless, the government is open to charges of complacency or
over-confidence, which events of the past week will have shaken. The ANC's
accusation that the government would respond differently if whites were
being slaughtered is undeniable.
The failure to seal off hostels for migrant workers, often located in the
heart of troubled areas, is one key example of apparent indifference.
According to Mr Mandela, Mr de Klerk promised in May last year to phase out
hostels, replacing them with family accommodation, and to fence them off in
the meantime. Nothing has been done. ANC criticism that the government has
failed to ban so-called traditional weapons is also valid.
While no one forecasts an early resumption of talks, it may well be that the
minds of the main protagonists will have been concentrated by a week which
contained all the ingredients of the country's nightmare scenario, in which
industrial action, the bloody rivalry between the ANC and the mainly Zulu
Inkatha Freedom party, and trigger-happy South African police combine to tip
the country towards ungovernability.

ETHIOPIANS voted yesterday in the first democratic election in Africa's
oldest independent nation, but a powerful political faction warned that
alleged irregularities could spark a new civil war, Reuter reports from
Addis Ababa.
About 33m Ethiopians were eligible to vote in the poll for a federal-style
government.
Mr Lencho Letta, vice-president of the Oromo Liberation Front, which has
boycotted the elections, said soon after the polls opened that the OLF might
withdraw from the transitional national assembly. 'Renewed civil war is
inevitable unless the situation improves,' he said.
The OLF announced its boycott last week, alleging its offices had been
closed and its officials arrested by the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary
Democratic Front.
The EPRDF has dominated the interim government in Addis Ababa.

FT  22 JUN 92 / Bahrain breaks Gulf ranks and urges closer ties with Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, MARK NICHOLSON and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BAHRAIN, VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BAHRAIN has become the first frontline Gulf country to urge better relations
with Iraq since the forces of President Saddam Hussein were driven out of
Kuwait last year.
Sheikh Khalifa bin Sulman al Khalifa, prime minister, said in an interview
at the weekend that it was time to open a new chapter in relations among the
Gulf states and put behind 'whatever has happened between us'.
At the height of the Gulf war Bahrain was attacked by Scud missiles and was
host to more than 17,500 US servicemen and over 200 combat aircraft,
including Tornados from the British Royal Air Force. It is the operational
headquarters for the substantial US naval presence in the Gulf.
The prime minister's comments followed greetings he sent to President Saddam
at the start of a recent Moslem holiday and reported contacts between Iraqi
and Bahraini officials in Rio de Janeiro during the Earth Summit.
Sheikh Khalifa said he could not speak for his neighbours on the sensitive
issue of developing ties with Iraq - his initiative is certain to be greeted
with concern, especially in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait - but he pointed out
that Oman, one of six members of the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC), had
maintained links with Baghdad throughout the crisis.
Sheik Khalifa likened a rapprochement with Iraq to US moves to improve links
with Vietnam. 'They lost 50,000 men in Vietnam but they are now trying to
normalise relations. It is only natural,' he said.
'I would like to see normalisation of relations in the Gulf on a wider scale
with all countries - this is the only way we can maintain our international
relations and security.'
The prime minister added: 'Saddam Hussein is only a man. He will die one
day. However, Iraq has to be preserved as a country. There is an idea in the
west that Iraq could be divided into northern, central and southern parts.
We want to prevent its break-up.'
He emphasised the humanitarian nature of his desire for closer links with
Baghdad. 'It was not just a cable I sent to Saddam Hussein. We look at Iraq
as one Iraq. We look at the Iraqi people and we look at suffering people all
over the world. We look at Yugoslavia, and we have sympathy with the people
of Iraq.'
Sheik Khalifa said governments were racing to re-establish links with Iran.
He looked forward to the day when the GCC (Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab
Emirates, Bahrain, Oman and Qatar) might be expanded to include Iran and
Iraq. But before this could happen the GCC would have to patch up
differences, a reference to several divisive border and economic issues.
Iraqi and UN officials began a third session of talks yesterday to seek a
way to end the UN oil embargo against Baghdad, Reuter reports from Vienna.
Under discussion is a plan agreed in September by the Security Council, and
extended in March, which would allow Iraq to sell Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds
860m) of oil over a six-month period.
The sales would be monitored by the UN and would fund purchases of food and
medicines for Iraq, war reparations to Kuwait and UN costs incurred in
enforcing the Gulf war ceasefire.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A LARGE majority of former Israeli generals and senior intelligence officers
believe Israel could safely give up the occupied territories, according to a
survey published yesterday.
The survey, which comes two days before a general election in which the
ruling Likud party is defending its refusal to yield any territory in Middle
East peace talks, largely endorsed the opposition Labour party's stance that
Israel should be prepared to give up much of the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip in return for peace and tough security measures.
Government supporters dismissed the poll, carried out by an independent
organisation, as propaganda by the group of retired officers which
commissioned it. But it appeared to undermine Likud's insistence that, in
addition to ideological claims to the land, the occupied territories are a
vital component in Israel's security.
The poll of former generals showed 68 per cent were prepared to give up the
West Bank and Gaza and 71 per cent 'a substantial part' of the Golan
Heights, given appropriate security arrangements.
In another awkward issue for Likud, the government yesterday reversed an
earlier announcement that members of the Palestinian negotiating team at the
Middle East talks who held a public meeting last week with Mr Yassir Arafat,
chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, in contravention of
Israeli law would be arrested on their return.
A police spokesman said only that they would be investigated, apparently
acknowledging that arrest would spark powerful international pressure to
release them.

FT  22 JUN 92 / Moldova tanks move on breakaway region
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOLDOVAN tanks and armoured vehicles were reported last night to be
mobilising near the disputed town of Bendery, as the conflict in the
breakaway region of Trans-Dnestr threatened to worsen.
The military movement came just a few hours after Moldova urged Russia to
show restraint to avoid war over TransDnestr. There were already heavy
casualties in weekend fighting in the region.
Nationalist Russians and Ukrainians in TransDnestr want to break away from
the largely Romanian-populated Moldova in one of a string of ethnic
conflicts in former republics of the Soviet Union.
The separatists early yesterday seized back control of Bendery from Moldovan
troops and police who had captured it just the day before. But they feared
that a force of about 2,500 heavily armed Moldovan troops on the outskirts
might mount an attack before dawn today.
TransDnestr officials said some 300 separatists had been killed in clashes
in the past two days. The Moldovan Defence Ministry put Moldovan losses in
the previous 24 hours at 30 dead and 200 wounded, with 100 killed and 300
wounded on the other side.
Moldovan President Mircea Snegur was quoted by Itar-Tass news agency as
accusing Moscow of imperialist designs and saying any intervention by
Russia's 14th Army, stationed in TransDnestr, would mark the start of
all-out war.
Interfax news agency said Mr Snegur urged Russian President Boris Yeltsin in
a telegram to show restraint and not to intervene in his country's internal
affairs. This appeal was in response to tough warnings by Mr Yeltsin and his
deputy, General Alexander Rutskoi, that Moscow would intervene to protect
minority Russians in the former Soviet republics.
In a lull in the conflict yesterday tanks vied with strolling families for
space on the streets of Tiraspol, beleaguered capital of TransDnestr, about
10km from Bendery.
A few dozen exhausted volunteer fighters from the Kirov factory in Tiraspol
nibbled at strawberries, dozed in the sun and dodged machine gun fire from a
Moldovan sniper on the ninth floor of an apartment overlooking their
positions.
But the casual attitude of soldiers and civilians alike was no sign that the
conflict was abating.
The weekend fighting has further alienated TransDnestr from Moldova. And
with open Russian military support, the sliver of land on the right bank of
the Dnestr river, with fewer than 1m inhabitants, is now grimly confident it
can beat back the Moldovans.
'It will be a real war,' warned Mr Veleri Litskoi, the secretary of state of
the breakaway region. 'But even with the support of the Romanian army
Moldova cannot defeat us. Together with the 14th Army our forces are 200 per
cent adequate.'
Mr Litskoi believed the 10,000-20,000 well-trained 14th Army troops based in
Trans-Dnestr, many of them locals, together with the region's Republican
Guard, which is commanded by 14th Army officers, could repel any further
attacks even if Romania threw its support behind Moldova, with which it has
close ethnic ties. Romania yesterday condemned alleged Russian interference
in Moldova.

FT  22 JUN 92 / Moscow may use troops to aid Russians: Shift in policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN troops for the first time engaged in combat operations against the
forces of other former Soviet republics at the weekend - in one case,
against troops of a fellow member of the Commonwealth of Independent States.
These conflicts mark a decisive and not easily reversible shift in Russian
policy and may mark Russia's decision openly to defend its kith and kin
outside its own borders.
On his arrival back in Moscow yesterday morning from his trip to the US and
Canada, President Boris Yeltsin said that in the case of wars on Russian
borders 'we cannot remain idle. . . we must react to defend people and to
stop the bloodshed. We have the strength to do that.'
Two conflicts are of immediate concern. The first, to which Mr Yeltsin was
reacting, is in the self-declared TransDnestrian Soviet Socialist Republic.
The territory, part of the Moldovan republic, is bounded by the Dnestr River
to its west and the Moldovan border with Ukraine to its east. Here, most of
the population are Russian or Ukrainian: and here, for nine months, fighting
has been going on between the local forces and the Moldovan National Guard.
According to the latest reports the Moldovan forces took the town of Bendery
 -the second centre in Trans-Dnestr - on Saturday, but were repulsed later.
Estimated casualties run into the hundreds, according to General Alexander
Rutskoi, the Russian vice-president.
On Saturday, as reports came in of what seemed to be a massacre by the
Moldovan forces, the Russian government went into emergency session, from
which it issued a call to all army units to return fire if attacked.
Yesterday the Defence Ministry said the decision had allowed the Russian
14th army, based in Trans-Dnestr in spite of Mr Yeltsin's promise to remove
it, to defend itself.
The second conflict is in South Ossetia, a region in the north of Georgia
beset by conflict since it declared autonomy from Georgia 18 months ago. In
the past month it has called for a union with North Ossetia, which would
mean in effect with Russia (since North Ossetia is a Russian autonomous
republic). The Russian parliament has reacted 'with sympathy' to the claim.
Over the weekend the Georgians made what appears to have been a successful
assault on Tskinvali, the Ossetian capital, which was reported to be almost
destroyed. On Thursday, Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze accused Russian
helicopters of having attacked Georgian tanks - a charge which the Russians
acknowledged, saying they were protecting their installations.
The relations between the Georgians and Russia have worsened suddenly in the
past week. Georgian military forces attacked a Russian tank regiment in the
town of Gori, and fire was returned.
In the absence of Mr Yeltsin, Gen Rutskoi - attracted to nationalist themes
 -went on television on Saturday looking almost like a national leader
declaring war. He said there were hundreds of dead in both Bendery and
Tskinvali, that both Mr Mircea Snegur, the Moldovan president, and Mr
Shevardnadze were guilty of the most 'cynical' deceptions, and that 'Russia
will not permit a settlement of the Dnestr and South Ossetian conflicts from
the position of strength. We are going to put an end to the massive
extermination of the civilian population.'

FT  22 JUN 92 / Croats and Serbs near all-out war: Rivals 'grab for land' to
split Bosnia-Hercegovina between them
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CROATIAN and Serb forces are preparing for an all-out war in
Bosnia-Hercegovina aimed at dividing the independent republic between the
two sides, western military attaches confirmed yesterday.
The diplomats said that, despite attempts by the United Nations to try to
re-open Sarajevo airport, Croatia and Serbia were now engaged in a 'grab for
land throughout Bosnia'.
Croatia wants to control a swathe of territory in the largely
Croat-populated region of western Hercegovina, west Bosnia, as well as the
north of the republic, they said.
Yesterday Mr Mate Boban, leader of Bosnia's Croatian Democratic Union,
announced the establishment of a canton system in those areas held by Croats
in Hercegovina. Mr Boban is the personal appointee of Croatian President
Franjo Tudjman.
Croatian control of the north of Bosnia is designed to prevent Serb units
from forming a corridor between Serbia and the self-proclaimed
Serb-inhabited republic of Krajina, south-western Croatia.
The military attaches added that Croatian forces, which have direct contacts
with Mr Tudjman, had yesterday consolidated their positions in many parts of
western Hercegovina.
'The speed in which they (the Croats) are moving, both across the north of
Bosnia, and west of Bosnia, is both remarkable and very dangerous,' one
diplomat said. He added that the recent military alliance between Bosnian
President Alija Izetbegovic and Croatia legitimised forces from Croatia on
Bosnian territory. The Bosnian presidency declared a state of war against
'the aggressor, Serbia' at the weekend, but did not mention Croat advances
in Hercegovina.
The Croatian offensive from the west is being matched by attempts by Serb
irregulars, and Serbia's proxy army in Bosnia, to consolidate their position
in the eastern part of Bosnia, as well as establishing a 'green line'
dividing Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital.
The UN yesterday announced another ceasefire after it suspended operations
and negotiations to de-militarise the airport, now held by both Serb
irregulars and Bosnia's Territorial Defence forces, under which Sarajevo's
Moslem, Serb, and Croat communities are grouped. Apart from sporadic
shooting, the 48-hour truce appeared to be holding.
The blockade on the airport has prevented the airlift of food to the 300,000
starving people of the city, who have been besieged by Serb irregulars for
the past 79 days.
'The UN is desperately trying to enforce this ceasefire, but I wonder if
either side really wants it now,' a UN official said.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW, BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin of Russia is using the acclaim he received from last
week's deal on nuclear arms cuts with the US to persuade foreign governments
to press the International Monetary Fund to treat Russia as a special case.
This would mean allowing it access to Dollars 24bn (Pounds 12.9bn) in aid
even though its economic reform programme does not observe IMF conditions.
Mr Yeltsin said in Canada on Saturday that he would try to persuade the
leaders of the Group of Seven industrial countries, whom he will meet in
Munich early next month, to 'throw their weight behind persuading the IMF
into opening the Dollars 24bn credit line'.
He said that because of the effects of communism and the consequent
difficulty of the transition to democracy and free markets, 'the standard
IMF project should not be applied to us to the letter'.
His statement sets the stage for a struggle between the IMF, whose officials
are concluding talks with government ministers in Moscow, and the Russian
government - with the G7 leaders invited to take one side or another.
The IMF wants to apply the same criteria to Russia as to other member
countries, thus holding Russia to account for rising budget deficits, for
its decision to hold down energy prices, for the Rbs2 trillion (million
million) debt which state enterprises have accumulated and for the
non-payment of principal and interest on its more than Dollars 60bn foreign
debt.
IMF officials flew in to Budapest yesterday for crucial talks to bring
Hungary's government finances under control, Nicholas Denton writes from
Budapest.
Hungary's missing of its IMF targets sets the scene for the two sides' most
difficult negotiations since democratic elections in 1990.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS long been evident that there is little love lost between President
George Bush and Mr Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire challenging him for the
presidency.
But the depth and age of their feud became clearer this weekend.
Mr Perot has recently refrained from direct abuse of Mr Bush, although he
has joined the chorus ridiculing Vice-President Dan Quayle's inability to
spell 'potato'.
But in a conversation six years ago that appears destined to enter the
folklore of the 1992 presidential campaign, he apparently called the then
Vice President Bush a 'rabbit'.
According to the Washington Post, Mr Perot's hostility was sparked by his
obsession with the fate of American servicemen missing in Vietnam.
Dissatisfied with Mr Bush's lukewarm support for his efforts to locate US
prisoners of war, Mr Perot launched, the Post reports, a series of
unsuccessful investigations designed to implicate Mr Bush in tax and
investment scandals, as well as in the Iran-Contra and October Surprise
affairs.
'This world is full of lions and tigers and rabbits, and you're a rabbit,'
he told Mr Bush, according to the Post.
The episode appears unlikely to do much to change voters' attitudes. Those
who find Mr Bush indecisive will think the 'rabbit' gibe apposite, while
those who worry about Mr Perot's respect for the US constitution will find
fresh evidence in his habit of unleashing investigators on anyone who
crosses him.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A COMPROMISE over European airline deregulation could be thrashed out today
in Luxembourg, where EC transport ministers are meeting to discuss the
European Commission's third package of air liberalisation proposals.
Free marketeers, such as Britain, the Netherlands and Denmark, will press
for airlines to be able to fly within and between any member states and to
charge any fare, subject to controls on predatory or exorbitant pricing.
However they will face resistance from Germany, France and southern member
states, which want to delay full liberalisation.
Mr John MacGregor, the UK transport minister, said on Friday he wanted the
changes to be implemented 'as soon as possible'. He said a breakthrough was
possible.
Under the compromise proposals to be debated today, airlines from one member
state would be allowed to offer domestic services in another country as part
of a longer route from January 1 1993.
The UK is hoping the market will be opened to full cabotage - with airlines
allowed to compete directly on any route within the EC - just 12 months
later. France, Germany, Portugal Spain and Italy want a transition period of
up to six years.
'The principle is that we would like to have a progressive opening, with
safeguards (to prevent damage to the environment, congestion and unfair
competition with rail and road services),' said a French official.
During their two-day meeting, ministers will also consider similar
compromises freeing up freight transport by road and water in the Community.

FT  22 JUN 92 / Central banks act on fraud: Guidelines designed to prevent
repeat of BCCI disaster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW guidelines on minimum standards for bank regulation, designed to reduce
the risk of big banking frauds, are to be issued over the next few weeks by
the main industrial countries.
The rules - to be issued by the Basle-based Committee on Banking Supervision
 -are intended to give regulators additional jurisdiction over activities of
banks outside their national territories. Swapping of information among
regulators on banks operating in more than one country will also be
encouraged by the guidelines.
Regulators and central bankers from the 11 nations in the Group of 10
industrial countries - US, Japan, Germany, France, Canada, Britain, Italy,
Switzerland, Sweden, the Netherlands and Belgium - are represented on the
committee.
It is headed by Mr Gerald Corrigan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York, and has been working on ways to tighten banking regulation
worldwide, particularly in the light of the Bank of Credit and Commerce
International scandal.
Many of the defects in supervising BCCI were due to the the bank's complex
management structure and its spread of operations around the world. This led
to ambiguities in supervising responsibilities among national regulators,
including the Bank of England.
The committee will issue its directive in the form of an update of the
so-called Basle Concordat on banking regulation, which was last strengthened
in 1983. The new rules will in some cases put in concrete form standards
which already apply in some countries.
They are also intended to serve as guidelines for regulatory bodies outside
the G10, especially in the developing world.
The main points are:
Regulatory agencies in specific countries which cover the head office of an
international bank will have the right to inspect records of branches of the
bank in other countries. That should make it easier for the so-called 'home'
regulator to gain the information it needs to find out about, for instance,
suspected fraud.
If the home regulator believes the bank in question is being run improperly
 -even though the improper activities may be showing up mainly in foreign
operations - then it should have the power to take appropriate action. This
could mean closing the bank.
An individual bank should ensure its operations are organised in such a way
that it can be properly supervised by a regulator in one country, at the
site of a designated head office which is where its top management is based.
This is designed to ensure that banks do not deliberately split management
functions among several centres to make supervision more difficult.
Opening of international bank branches should require the go-ahead of
supervisors in both the 'home' and the 'host' country. This should avoid
banks deliberately establishing operations in specific states because they
feel the regulatory agencies are lax.

THE Venezuelan government has opened the door to private investment in the
country's oil industry for the first time since the petroleum sector was
nationalised in 1976.
Five oil companies, including Royal Dutch Shell, won deals to develop five
groups of inactive oilfields. They are to invest Dollars 480m (Pounds 258m)
in the oilfields by 1996 and a total of Dollars 720m over the next decade.
Shell was one of the international concerns whose Venezuelan assets were
nationalised 16 years ago.
Other winning companies were Teikoku Oil Co. of Japan, Benton Oil &amp; Gas of
the US, and two Venezuelan companies, Vincler and Lingoteras. Sixteen
Venezuelan and international groups presented tenders on the operating
contracts. BP made a bid but did not win.
In announcing the winners, Mr Alirio Parra, Venezuela's Minister of energy
and mines, said the companies would sign 20-year contracts under which they
would develop fields, produce crude oil and turn it over to subsidiaries of
Venezuela's national oil company, PDVSA.

SOUTH AFRICA'S peace process was in danger of collapse last night after Mr
Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress (ANC), announced
the suspension of bilateral talks with the government.
Mr Mandela's decision follows the massacre last Wednesday of 42 people in
Boipatong township. A further three people died on Saturday when police
opened fire on a crowd which had gathered to protest at the killings.
The ANC has blamed Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom party for
Wednesday's tragedy, and accused the police of complicity, a charge which is
denied by the government.
'I can no longer explain to our people why we continue to talk to a regime
that is murdering our people and conducting war against us,' Mr Mandela
said.
He also said he would lead a campaign of defiance should the government
reimpose a state of emergency, as suggested by President FW de Klerk after
his abortive visit to Boipatong on Saturday when angry youths chased him out
of the township.
The negotiation process was 'completely in tatters', Mr Mandela told a rally
yesterday of about 15,000 supporters in the township of Evaton, 50km south
of Johannesburg.
He said an emergency meeting of the National Executive Committee of the ANC
would be held tomorrow to 'examine our options' in the light of the events
at Boipatong.
While militant elements within the ANC would favour calling off
negotiations, this can, at best, be a short-term measure. With sanctions
gone and the armed struggle suspended, the ANC lacks the means to force the
government from power. It will probably show its displeasure by intensifying
mass action while making its continued participation in negotiations
contingent on a suitable government response to Boipatong.
Mr Mandela's comments came at the end of a week which saw relations between
the government and ANC sink to their lowest level since the unbanning of the
ANC in February 1990. 'We are back to Sharpeville days and the gulf between
the oppressor and the oppressed has overnight become unbridgeable.'
Earlier Mr Mandela had visited Boipatong where the rapturous reception
afforded him contrasted sharply with the hostility towards Mr de Klerk,
whose visit lasted less than 15 minutes.
The Vaal Triangle townships visited yesterday by Mr Mandela are among the
most volatile and dangerous in the country. The road from Boipatong to
Evaton, which passes through Sebokeng, resembles a war zone. Burnt tyres,
rocks and tree-stumps are strewn across all the main streets to discourage
police patrols and attacks launched from fast-moving cars.
The mood of the crowd in the dusty football ground where Mr Mandela spoke
was very militant. Posters read 'Mandela - give us permission to kill our
enemies'.
Mr Mandela reminded his audience that the infamous Sharpeville massacre in
1960 had occurred in the same vicinity as Boipatong. 'I come back today to
this area where Sharpeville has been repeated with a ferocity that may
completely put an end to negotiations with the regime.'
He said he would request the secretary-general of the United Nations to call
a special session of the Security Council to discuss the 'massacres
committed by Mr de Klerk and his regime'.

FT  22 JUN 92 / Havel urges poll over Czechoslovak split
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR VACLAV Havel, the presi-dent of Czechoslovakia, put his personal prestige
on the line yesterday and called for a referendum on the future of the
country.
The president's appeal followed an agreement on Saturday between the newly
elected Czech and Slovak leaders which call on the parliaments of both
republics to prepare the peaceful break-up of the 74-year-old federation.
'Citizens have the right to express themselves on such a fundamental issue
in a clearly worded question,' the president said in his regular Sunday
radio address to the nation. 'A referendum is the only constitutional manner
in which the common state can be divided into two states.' The agreement
itself is ambiguous. While it does not specifically call for a referendum,
it leaves that option open.
Saturday's accord signed by Mr Vaclav Klaus, the Czech winner of last
month's elections, and Mr Vladimir Meciar, his Slovak counterpart, allows
for the Czech and Slovak parliaments to decide the framework for dividing
the republics by September 30. Their decision must then be ratified by the
federal assembly.
Mr Meciar wanted a referendum in Slovakia toward the end of the year. The
Czech side, anxious to end political paralysis which would deter foreign
investment and hold back economic re-forms, pushed for a speedy solution. Mr
Meciar has also said he will block the re-election of President Havel in the
federal parliament on July 3 because Mr Havel's warning to voters not to
support a candidate with 'dictatorial tendencies' was seen as a thinly
veiled attack on him.
Attempts to reach a compromise which would keep the federal state together
failed after the Czech side rejected the Slovaks' demands for a
confederation of two sovereign and internationally recognised states.
Mr Klaus, leader of the Civic Democratic party (ODS) which won 30 per cent
of the vote in the Czech lands, and Mr Meciar, whose Movement for a
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) won 37 per cent there, ended their negotiations
by signing a political declaration and a limited programme for the new
interim federal government.
The Civic Democratic party said it 'does not consider the confederation of
two sovereign states as one common state . . . and prefers the
constitutional separation of the current state to this confederation'.
The programme of the federal government states that 'its mandate is limited
in time', and that 'it must prepare the conditions for the functioning of
two sovereign and internationally recognised states'.
The new federal government will be reduced from 16 ministries to five,
including finance, defence, and foreign affairs. The governments of each
republic will assume other functions.

The Italian lira remains firmly at the bottom of the European currency
system's grid after a week in which the Bank of Italy was forced several
times to intervene in the open market on its behalf. Its differential
against the strongest currency, the Portuguese escudo, is wide enough for
central bankers to be concerned about the possibility that it will test its
limits in the EMS this week. Sterling is second from bottom despite recent
comments from the UK chancellor that the pound could enter the system's
narrow bands when the time is right. If today's figure for the UK's current
account and trade balance in May is disappointing, the pound may weaken.
The chart shows the member currencies of the exchange rate mechanism
measured against the weakest currency in the EMS's narrow 2.25 per cent
fluctuation band. In practice, currencies in the EMS narrow band cannot rise
more than 2.25 per cent from the weakest currency in that part of the
system. Sterling and the Spanish peseta operate with 6 per cent fluctuation
bands.

FT  22 JUN 92 / Wellcome may scale back share offer to under Pounds 3bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WELLCOME, the UK drugs company, will today be advised to keep the size of
its planned international share offer at the lower end of expectations. As a
result, the offer may seek to raise between Pounds 2bn and Pounds 3bn,
rather than a possible Pounds 4bn.
While Wellcome rejects any comparison between itself and the GPA Group, the
Irish aircraft leasing company forced last week to abandon an Dollars 800m
(Pounds 432m) international share offer because of poor demand, the UK
group's advisers are determined to avoid being over-confident by offering
too many shares.
Wellcome Trust, the charitable body which owns 73.6 per cent of Wellcome,
has said it planned to reduce its holding by selling between 25 per cent and
48.6 per cent of the company's shares.
Robert Fleming, the UK merchant bank which is global co-ordinator for the
Wellcome sale, will today recommend the company to be cautious.
Mr Laurence Banks, deputy chairman of Robert Fleming, said yesterday: 'We
are moving towards the lower end of what the trust has said it is planning
to sell. One thing we are not going to do is to announce the sale of 48.6
per cent.'
Under the terms of issue, it could be increased by about 10 per cent should
demand warrant it. Mr Banks added: 'It is better to build up the size of the
issue than to be over-confident.'
At today's meeting of lead managers, brokers to the sale, which have gauged
interest worldwide, will report encouraging signs from institutional
shareholders.
But one broker explained: 'GPA's advisers also expressed interest at this
stage which obviously makes one nervous. I firmly believe the expression of
intent to buy from institutional shareholders is serious but it would be
wrong to be over-confident and issue too many shares.'
As a secondary offering, Wellcome is being priced against an existing share
quote. GPA's pricing was more difficult.
Advisers to the sale would also feel more comfortable with a smaller issue
because they are determined to maximise the price received by the charity.
The shares go on sale by tender offer on July 6. The only special deals will
be certain priority arrangements for existing shareholders and early
applicants.

FT  22 JUN 92 / About 4,500 Lloyd's Names face average Pounds 100,000 losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT 4,500 Lloyd's Names face average losses of more than Pounds 100,000
each for 1989, it emerged yesterday following the first official
confirmation that the insurance market lost Pounds 2bn in that year.
Unaudited figures confirm that losses are heavily concentrated among a
minority of Names - the individuals whose assets provide Lloyd's with its
capital base. Audited final figures are expected at Lloyd's annual general
meeting on Wednesday.
Meanwhile, Mr David Coleridge, chairman of Lloyd's, reacted strongly to a
move by disgruntled Names to force an extraordinary general meeting and a
no-confidence vote in the governing council.
He said the actions risked 'damaging Lloyd's worldwide business'. The
council's policies were directed to protecting policyholders, and were in
the interests of all members.
It also emerged yesterday that Lloyd's authorities could be seeking as much
as Pounds 50m from brokers and agents to boost funds providing 'hardship'
relief for Names facing ruin.
The Pounds 2bn loss for the market as a whole compares with a deficit of
Pounds 510m in 1988, the first time Lloyd's had been in the red for 20
years. It reflects the impact of disasters such as hurricane Hugo, which
devastated the Caribbean in September 1989.
The latest loss comprises a Pounds 1.4bn loss on the 1989 year, the transfer
of Pounds 400m to reserves to cover claims emerging from business
underwritten in previous years and Pounds 200m for Names' personal expenses.
More than 4,300 of the 31,329 Names made losses equal to 30 per cent or more
of their premium income limits (the amount of premium Names are allowed to
receive according to Lloyd's rules). With this limit amounting to an average
of Pounds 350,000 in 1989, the indications are that these members - about 14
per cent of the market's membership - have lost more than Pounds 100,000
each.
The losses of syndicates managed by two agencies - Gooda Walker and Feltrim
 -totalled Pounds 602m, while five syndicates - numbers 255, 290, 298, 540
and 847 - registered losses of Pounds 560m.
The impact of the losses is certain to increase the number of Names seeking
hardship relief, under which debts are restructured and Names are allowed to
retain a house and modest income. More than 1,000 applications have been
received since the committee was set up two years ago.
Although Lloyd's decided last week to reject the introduction of a bail-out
plan - in which the market as a whole would have assumed the losses of the
hardest hit - Mr Alan Lord, chief executive, confirmed on Thursday that
talks were under way with brokers and agencies to increase the amount
available to help improve the hardship terms.
Lloyd's officials met the Lloyd's Insurance Brokers Committee on Friday,
when the idea of Lloyd's brokers contributing Pounds 25m over a three-year
period to such a fund was mooted. Agencies - which manage the affairs of
Names and syndicates - could be asked for a similar amount.

FT  22 JUN 92 / London Bullion Market (6): Bars face rigorous tests - London
Good Delivery List
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF a large gold bar is good for delivery on to the London market, then it is
acceptable anywhere where gold is traded.
This did not happen by design. No-one is sure when the words good delivery
came into being. Mr Les Edgar, chairman of the London Bullion Market
Association's physical subcommittee, says the phrase surfaced in the 1920s,
but the oldest surviving list of good delivery refiners available to him
dates from 1934.
'We don't quite know what went on in the early days as the informal customs
of the market developed into formality,' he says. There is no way of knowing
how bars were tested, but they were known to be deliverable and were the
currency of the day.
That first list comprises mainly British refineries throughout the world,
including South Africa. The London market shut for the Second World War and
did not open again until 1954, when the good delivery list, although
dominated by British and Commonwealth refineries, was much bigger. Since
then it has expanded to include Asian and Latin American refineries as
different countries discovered the advantages of good delivery status. The
list is still growing - three refiners have been added this year.
A rigorous process has to be undergone in order to attain good delivery
recognition. But refiners remain keen to get on the list, which is printed
every year and sent to all LBMA members and other interested parties such as
central banks.
Mr Edgar believes this is because if a refiner cannot add value to his gold,
but has to cast the raw material, 'it's good to know it's of a standard
someone will always buy with no hassle'.
Any applicant must have been in existence for not less than five years, and
refining for not less than three years. It has to have been producing more
than 10 tonnes of gold a year in the form of bars weighing 400 troy ounces.
The net worth of the applicant must exceed Pounds 10m, and the central bank
of the country in which the applicant is based must have accepted its bars.
Only when all these conditions have been met can the applicant write to the
LBMA, including among other documents the central bank letter of
recognition, audited financial statements and 10 colour photographs showing
bars produced by the company.
An applicant can be rejected at this paper work stage of the process, and
never make it to the second, technical stage. 'We might see from photographs
that his bars look like rubbish, or we may have problems with his finances,
says Mr Edgar.
Once the paperwork requirements have been satisfied, the applicant must
provide a sample of gold bars which comply with the LBMA specifications.
They must weigh between 350 troy and 430 troy ounces, and be 99.5 per cent
pure gold.
The specifications reflect the necessity of keeping to an unchanging
standard so that all the bars already deep in vaults around the world are
not invalidated.
The very fact that the weight is measured in troy ounces, a unit used at the
annual fair at Troyes in France in the Middle Ages, is testimony to gold's
value as a steady currency in a changing world. (A troy ounce is slightly
heavier than the UK ounce at 14.58 to the lb, equivalent to 32.15 per
kilogramme).
In reality modern bars are consistently close to 400 troy ounces, and modern
refining techniques mean that most gold is of 99.99 per cent purity, 'and
frequently a premium can be obtained for such high grade material,' says Mr
Edgar.
Each bar has a serial number and the stamp of the refiner. It is traditional
not to put the weight on the bar because if there were an error on the
original weighing the bar would have to be amended.
The gold not only has to pass the technical specifications, it also has to
look good. 'Bars should be of good appearance, free from surface cavities or
other irregularities, layering and excessive shrinkage, and must be easy to
handle and convenient to stack,' the LBMA demands.
This is very much a subjective test. The vault man in charge of the bars
will get another three or four vault men to attend from the eight vaults in
London and carry out a joint inspection. It is possible for bars to be
rejected at this stage and a request for bars to be resubmitted.
'If we are happy at the eye stage the bars are sent to two referees,' says
Mr Edgar. They carry out a series of assays and melting procedures and
produce a report.
The applicant is then sent 24 gold samples he has to assay. 'His assaying
ability is thoroughly tested,' says Mr Edgar. 'Where problems arise it is on
the assay testing side - the test is necessarily a tight one.'
Past this last hurdle, the subcommittee will recommend the applicant to the
LBMA as a producer of acceptable bars. Only then will the LBMA confirm that
the bars are good delivery in London.

FT  22 JUN 92 / London Bullion Market (7): At the tip of an iceberg - The
Fixings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT 10.30 am and 3.00 pm every working day N. M. Rothschild &amp; Sons hosts one
of the City of London's most select parties - the London gold fixing. It is
select but far from exclusive. The five members of the fixing committee
constitute the tip of an iceberg that incorporates virtually the whole of
the world gold market.
The five - representatives of Rothschild (traditionally chairman of the
fixing committee), Samuel Montagu, Mocatta and Goldsmid, Sharps Pixley and
Mase Westpac - are in constant contact with their dealing rooms, which are
in turn in touch with traders around the globe.
The fix begins with the chairman naming a price that he has chosen on the
basis of pre-fix trading activity. That is relayed through the dealers to
their customers, who respond with pledges to buy or sell at that price
certain quantities of good delivery bars of about 12.5 kg (worth about
Dollars 135,000 each).
These pledges are netted by the individual fix members who then announce if
they are sellers, in which case they specify the amount, or buyers, in which
case they do not state the size of their bids.
If there are no sellers the price is raised; if no buyers, it is lowered.
When both buyers and sellers are declared, the chairman asks for 'figures
please' and the volume of bids is announced.
If the bids outweigh the offers the price is raised, if the sellers are in
the majority it is lowered. The process continues until the price is found
that achieves equilibrium between bids and offers.
This is indicated by the miniature Union Jacks that are placed in front of
each committee member being laid on their sides, following which the
chairman cries 'fixed'.
However, there is no rush. Market conditions can change by the minute and
buyers and sellers can change their minds. Any committee member can halt the
proceedings by calling 'flag up' and raising his little Union Jack while he
consults with his trading room.
The whole process can sometimes be completed in minutes, but it has been
known to take two hours when the market is in a particularly excitable mood.
The fixing ritual, though venerable, is far from ancient. It dates from
Britain's abandonment of the gold standard during the First World War. Until
then the Bank of England stood ready to buy any amount of gold at Pounds
3.17.9d a troy ounce and to sell at Pounds 3.17.10 1/2 d. During the war the
bank bought all South Africa's gold output at Pounds 4.4.11d, but when
sterling was devalued against the US dollar in 1919 it was persuaded to
allow all South African gold, about half the world's output, to be sold by
N. M. Rothschild 'at the best price obtainable, giving the London market and
the bullion brokers a chance to bid'.
The first fixing took place, by telephone, on September 12 of that year and
the price was Pounds 4.18.9d, reflecting the higher grade being offered and
a premium on account of sterling's depreciation against the dollar.
For nearly 50 years - except during the attempt to reimpose a gold standard
for sterling in the period 1925-31 and from the start of the Second World
War till 1954 - the fixing thrived, principally as the outlet for South
African gold, with the Reserve Bank of South Africa using the Bank of
England as its selling agent.
The Bank of England operated on the re-opened market, as did other central
banks, to hold the price at Dollars 35 an ounce for reasons of monetary
policy. This was in accordance with President Roosevelt's 1934 decision,
confirmed by the Bretton Woods Agreement in 1944. As upward price pressure
built up the London Gold Pool was formed in 1961, with the Bank of England
acting on behalf of Britain, the US, Belgium, France, Italy the Netherlands,
Switzerland and West Germany to maintain that price.
However, pressure continued to build up, with Soviet gold sales drying up,
sterling under pressure and the US suffering from balance of payments
difficulties as well as the Vietnam War. Despairing attempts to hold the
line after sterling's 1967 devaluation were finally abandoned on March 15,
1968 when Mr Roy Jenkins, the Labour chancellor of the exchequer, announced
that the gold market had been closed 'at the request of the US'.
When the London gold market opened its doors again two weeks later it was on
a world that was scarcely recognisable, and the role of the fixing had
changed for ever.
South Africa had switched much of its business to a new pool of Swiss banks
operating through the Zurich market and a two-tier market had been
established. Central banks traded among themselves at the official Dollars
35 price and other business - for speculators, hoarders, jewellery and other
industrial users - was conducted in a free market.
'That year really was the watershed in London's history,' said Timothy Green
in his book The New World of Gold. 'The story really does divide before and
after 1968. As one dealer put it, 'We used to be a distribution centre for
South African and other people's gold; now it is a market place, a trading
forum'.'
Throwing complacency to the wind, the London market introduced the second
fixing at 3 pm and started to fix the price in dollars; both moves being
designed to attract US market operators.
Since then the London fixing has become as important an institution in the
new, investor-based market as it was when central banks ruled the roost. The
price levels it sets apply to a relatively small amount of the business done
in a round-the-clock market. But they are valuable snapshots (sometimes
time-exposures) of the state of the market and investors know that the
fixing price results from the matching of a substantial volume of business.
For this reason producer sales are often tied to the fixing price and many
central banks use a fixing average in revaluing their gold holdings.
The actual amount of business done at the fixings remains a secret, though
some traders feel that, in the interest of market transparency, daily volume
figures should be published.
Prominent among these is Mr Robert Guy, who recently stepped down as
chairman of the London Bullion Market Association. But others argue that
such information would be meaningless as fixing volume represents only the
sum of the unmatched business of myriad individual traders and would give
little idea of the true extent of the business covered by the fixing price.
For the time being, therefore, it seems likely that the market will retain
some of its mystery and that the stock response to a query on the level of
turnover will continue to be 'oh, several tons'.

FT  22 JUN 92 / London Bullion Market (5): A poor return on their metal -
The Central Banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE jury has been out on gold's monetary role since Lord Keynes described it
nearly 50 years ago as 'a barbarous relic'.
Until 1968 the verdict seemed to be going against the indestructible yellow
metal as the successful defence of an official valuation of Dollars 35 a
troy ounce condemned it to a wasting role as a reserve asset. But then the
freeing of the price and the accelerating rise in the 1970s threw new light
on the case. By 1980 Mr Irwin Shisko, a leading New York bullion analyst was
telling a conference of the American Mining Conference: 'Gold is now the
world's single most important reserve asset'.
That was gold's glory year, when the London price ranged between Dollars 474
and a record Dollars 850 an ounce. At the year's average of Dollars 614 an
ounce the 35,000 tonnes in official hands were worth nearly Pounds 700bn,
close to 70 per cent of the western world's reserves. The price is now not
much more than half that level and the central banks' attitude seems to have
been adjusted accordingly.
The central banks and other official financial institutions remained buyers
of gold until the late 1980s, according to the American Precious Metals
Advisors consultancy group, which estimated at the beginning of last year
that their net purchases in the four years from 1985 amounted to more than
650 tonnes. But it put their net sales at 155 tonnes in 1989 and 62 tonnes
in 1990. Moreover, it suggested that the 1990 figure should properly be put
at about 120 tonnes because Japanese reserves had temporarily been inflated
by the purchase of 60 tonnes for commemorative coins to be minted in 1991.
Some of this gold was bought from central banks in Canada, Belgium and
possibly France, APMA said.
By the middle of last year the value of central banks' gold reserves was
down to Dollars 368bn, said Mr Ricky Hall, assistant general manager of the
Bank of International Settlements. That represented a fall of 47 per cent
from the 1980 level.
The banks were getting a poor return on this metal, he said. Even at a
modest compound interest rate of 6 per cent gold bought 10 years earlier at
Dollars 459.25 an ounce should have been worth Dollars 823 an ounce, instead
of the Dollars 361.20 ruling at the time.
He suggested that central bankers who were worried that they could not put
their gold holdings to work for fear of causing shame or a political loss of
face, should consider setting up a form of mutual fund which would hold some
of their gold reserves in good delivery form only in physical locations of
its own choice.
'The fund would need to have access to the currencies it needed by borrowing
or doing swaps in its own name,' he said. 'By going through the fund any
embarrassment which a central bank might feel about mobilising its gold
directly in the market place could be overcome.'
According to Mr Andy Smith, analyst with the Union Bank of Switzerland, many
central banks have found ways of mobilising their gold holdings without
embarrassment. 'Up to 800 tonnes of official gold may be in circulation in
the interbank gold market on any given day, equivalent to half the western
world's mine supply . . . unsurprisingly this 'easy gold' policy has kept
the cost of borrowing gold very low,' he said.
Mr Smith foresaw the central banks becoming an increasingly bearish
influence on the gold market. 'It is reasonable to expect the banks to
become net sellers of about 700 tonnes a year from the mid-1990s.'
Gold's monetary role was 'now history for private investors and central
banks. Selling gold would be just part of a day's work for a central bank,
not an admission that the financial world as investors know it was about to
end'.
Mr Smith calculated that if the eight countries that between them accounted
for more than 85 per cent of central bank gold were to sell all their gold
and reinvest the proceeds in interest-bearing paper, the combined annual
return, in perpetuity, would be Dollars 21bn.
'On a per capita basis,' he added, 'the annual dividend would be impressive
enough to catch the eye of the most well-to-do tax payer.' Mr Smith made
that calculation about six month's ago. At the time of writing nearly
Dollars 1bn has been knocked off the potential combined yield.
Although such an extreme course was not to be expected Mr Smith said that
central bankers were certainly under pressure to include gold sales in their
gold mobilisation policies. For example, as part of a recent revised
treatment of US net international indebtedness the US Commerce Department
had revalued US gold reserves at market prices rather than the still
official Dollars 42 an ounce. 'Clearly, an unrealised asset value of over
Dollars 80bn has not completely escaped US official attention.'
Mr Smith noted that a single European central bank would control 40 per cent
of the world's official gold reserves, while 'a single European currency
reduces the principal need for reserves of any kind - intervention in
currency markets'.
So the rescue of the Maastricht agreement could be bad news for holders of
gold. This is especially so if, as Mr Smith suggested was possible, EC
member states, seeing that a Eurobank could economise on all reserves made
'pre-emptive strikes, liquidating gold and currency reserves to the benefit
of tax-payers before the ink is dry on Eurobank statutes'.

FT  22 JUN 92 / London Bullion Market (4): Production heading towards a
plateau - Supply and Demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE total supply of gold to the world market fell last year for the first
time since 1983, to 2,815 tonnes from 2,913 tonnes in 1990, according to the
annual survey of the market by Gold Fields Mineral Services.
While Western gold mine production continued to rise in spite of prices at
the lowest real level since the 1970s, the rate of growth in mine production
slowed to just 2 per cent, the lowest increase in the past 10 years.
Nevertheless, total mine production set a new record of 1,782 tonnes.
Gold Fields believes mine production is heading towards a plateau if not a
peak. It believes the slowdown reflects 'the increasing difficulty of
attracting finance for marginal properties and the depletion,
rationalisation or closure of some older mines, offsetting increases from
new capacity.'
However, Gold Fields points to the tenacity and adaptability of the mining
industry in the face of low prices. It adds that this reflects the
non-feasibility of putting many underground mines on to a care and
maintenance basis.
Mr Andy Smith, analyst with Union Bank of Switzerland, points out that many
observers had expected production to fall sharply. 'We were promised a cliff
 -but now we have a plateau as far as the eye can see.'
It was a mistake to assume that the mining and financial services industries
would not respond to low prices. Mines adjusted their costs and the
derivatives market helped them to realise higher prices.
Mr Smith also points out the gold mining industry has benefited from cheap
finance provided by gold loans and forward sales.
These have enabled it to double production over the past 10 years. The
industry now works on gold borrowed from the central banks at very low
interest rates, a policy which has kept more mines in business than would
otherwise have been the case.
Gold Fields suggests, however, that the impact of forward sales and gold
loans was much reduced last year 'owing to the combination of low spot
prices, a less attractive forward price due to lower interest rates, and an
absence of price spikes.' Forward sales fell from 254 tonnes in 1990 to 51
tonnes last year, while 11 tonnes of gold loans were repaid, leaving a net
impact of 40 tonnes on the supply side of the equation.
Net sales from the Communist bloc, in which Gold Fields still includes the
former Soviet Union but not eastern Europe, fell to 226 tonnes last year
from 425 tonnes in 1990. This is the net result of imports to China
exceeding Chinese sales to the West in 1990. Sales from the former Soviet
Union fell only marginally, and are now put at more than 1,000 tonnes over
the last three years, 'although as much as 20 per cent of this metal may
have been used in swaps'.
Central banks reverted to being net sellers last year, with net sales of 105
tonnes compared with net purchases of 66 tonnes in 1990. Gold Fields says
this reflects a variety of policies, from outright distress sales to a
deliberate decision to reduce the gold content of official reserves.
The biggest shift in the market, according to Gold Fields, was the implied
disinvestment of 241 tonnes from the private sector, which purchased 173
tonnes in 1990. This is attributed to disposals of bullion and coins by
European and US holders and sales of stocks from Europe on behalf of
Japanese and Middle Eastern investors.
Gold demand is dominated by jewellery fabrication, which rose by 4 per cent
to 2,111 tonnes - a record - in spite of the recession. 'The reasons for
this robust growth include the stockbuilding by jewellery distributors and
retail outlets in many European and Gulf countries and a rapid rise in
demand from China,' says Gold Fields.
Gold used in electronics fell by only 1 tonne to 147 tonnes in spite of a
sharp downturn in computer sales and the first signs of weakening military
equipment orders. Dental use rose quite strongly.
Sales of all the main bullion coins fell sharply with the exception of the
Australian Nugget. The issue of a special coin to celebrate the enthronement
of the new Emperor in Japan soaked up 60 tonnes and distorted the figures.
Without this, coin fabrication would have fallen below 100 tonnes for the
first time since 1974, Gold Fields says.
Total hoarding of gold in Latin America, the Middle East and Asia fell. The
report wonders whether 'the behaviour of bar hoarders in Asia is now
becoming more similar to that of Western investors, with a falling price
promoting disillusioned sales rather than bargain hunting purchases.'
The gold price, which averaged Dollars 362.26 last year, has continued to
fall this year. Gold Fields blames the poor performance on, among other
things, a decline in global economic output for only the second time since
the Second World War, the rapid resolution of the Gulf war and the easing of
political tension with the demise of the Soviet Union.
The outlook is more positive because output should fall as more than a third
of gold production is unprofitable while consumer spending and inflation are
near cyclical lows. But if economic recovery is weak, says Gold Fields,
additional gold sales could be prompted, keeping the lid on prices for some
time.
Mr Smith of UBS believes gold is becoming a North-South market.
He points to the fact that most jewellery sales and almost all investment
are in countries that abhor paperwork and revel in the non-transparency of
gold markets.
'Gold's attractiveness in the developing countries is that it is stateless,
anonymous, and invisible,' says Mr Smith. He believes the big question for
the market in the 1990s is whether countries such as China will absorb more
gold than is being dishoarded in the west.

FT  22 JUN 92 / London Bullion Market (2): Need for more turnover
transparency - Robert Guy and Dick Gazmararian
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is a need for greater transparency in the gold market, suggests Mr
Robert Guy, a director of N. M. Rothschild, the bullion house which hosts
London's daily gold fixing session. 'I find it very difficult when people
ask me the turnover of the market not to be able to tell them.'
Mr Guy was the first chairman of the London Bullion Market Association when
it was set up in 1987 to represent the interests of participants in the
wholesale bullion market. He has only just stepped down after four strenuous
years.
Freed from the necessity for diplomatic neutrality, Mr Guy is able to nail
his colours firmly to the mast. He suggests that the association went one
step in the right direction towards more transparency in July, 1990, when it
started to publish details of gold lending rates.
'I believe this attracted more business to the market, not only from mining
companies, but also from central banks,' he says.
Now he has stimulated a debate about turnover transparency. He is very much
in favour of the London gold market providing turnover details, not on a
daily basis but regular historic statistics. Many other markets do this - Mr
Guy points to the London stock exchange as an example of a market where
turnover statistics apparently help to lift trade.
'Investors today demand more transparency than they used to. I believe gold
market activity would be enhanced if we had greater transparency.'
Mr Guy suggests that the management of those companies participating in the
market would benefit from publication of turnover statistics. They would
have some benchmark figures against which to measure their own statistics.
Not every member of the association agrees with him. Mr Guy thinks that most
of the LBMA's market making members are in favour but 'as we believe in
consensus, unless everyone agrees, it won't happen'.
Mr Guy startled some in the bullion business recently by suggesting a merger
between the gold and platinum markets.
He points out that many members of the LBMA are also part of the platinum
market and the two markets face similar issues.
Then it would be worthwhile for the combined markets to employ a chief
executive to take on some of the work which at present, as far as the LBMA
is concerned, is shared between members of the management committee with the
backing of an executive secretary and her assistant.
Mr Guy says: 'The level of regulation has increased and is increasing. I am
sure, for example, that there will be new regulations on financial
derivatives and I am also sure this will involve the bullion market.'
Perhaps the biggest disappointment during his four years, says Mr Guy, was
that the association failed to persuade UK government that gold trading
should not attract VAT. He points out that, although in theory gold has been
de-monetised, it is still accepted along with currency as a reserve asset by
governments in creating and managing their reserves. 'There is no VAT on
currency when an individual buys, why should he be penalised on gold?'
He suggests that the UK government should conduct an audit to see how much
it really gains from taxing gold, including a calculation of the revenue
collected from VAT, an estimate of revenue lost because of VAT fraud 'which
obviously still continues', and how much business is lost to the London
market as a result of the imposition of VAT on gold.
Mr Guy is particularly pleased with an agreement reached last year between
the association and UK Customs and Excise so that trading between LBMA
members could continue to be free of VAT. As Mr Guy explains, as long as
gold remains under the effective control of an LBMA member, no VAT should be
paid when it is traded. It makes no difference if the gold is allocated to a
particular customer or not.
Mr Guy's successor as LBMA chairman is Mr Dick Gazmararian. He has no doubt
about what is the most important issue facing the association today: it is
the question of how the London market will be treated as the European
Community harmonises its VAT system.
Mr Gazmararian, 46, took over as the association's second chairman in May.
He is managing director of Mase Westpac, which has the distinction of being
the world's only bullion bank. He started his career with Merrill Lynch
before spending eight years as managing director of the Hong Kong operations
of Mocatta &amp; Goldsmid, the oldest London bullion house.
He joined his present organisation in 1986 when Westpac Banking Corporation,
Australia's biggest bank, bought Johnson Matthey Bankers from the Bank of
England. The bank had rescued JMB two years earlier after it got into some
difficulties with its loan book.
He says that, while the association does not expect the EC to remove VAT on
gold, neither does it fear that the tax might in future have to be paid on
every transaction. However, it is having to work very hard to ensure that
the European Commission's bureaucrats understand enough about the way the
London bullion market works to recognise that the present arrangements
agreed with the UK Customs and Excise should be allowed to continue.
Any substantial change is likely to have an adverse impact on LBMA members'
cash flow and make the London market just a little less competitive - given
that Zurich will not be covered by any EC regulations (at least, not until
Switzerland joins the Community.)
Time is running short because the Commission hopes to have the issue out of
the way by the end of this year.
Mr Gazmararian says that the LBMA's efforts to promote itself will continue.
'Promotion is a necessary cost in the times in which we live. More and more
is put out by other organisations and regulated exchanges. We have to keep
in step with other markets.'
But there is a limit to what can be achieved. 'Our job is to let people know
how they can buy in London - it's an educational matter as much as
anything.'
Mr Gazmararian says Mr Guy's contribution to the LBMA was unique. He
spearheaded efforts to put it together when at first there was some mutual
suspicion. On one side some long-established members of the market were
concerned that some of the new participants, being foreign-owned, might be
Trojan horses for organisations primarily interested in their own gold
centres. On the other hand, there was some concern that the association
might be run by the five members of the fix and their interests would be
held paramount.
But the association was pulled together, even though during those first four
years the gold price was falling and it is obviously easier to arouse
enthusiasm in a bull market.
Mr Gazmararian points out that as he begins his term the association has 12
market making members and 50 other members - 62 in all, about the same as
when it started four years ago. And 75 per cent of the membership turned out
for the association's annual meeting - a sure sign that enthusiasm runs
high.
He suggests that today any company wishing to be an international bullion
dealer must have a market making presence in London.

FT  22 JUN 92 / London Bullion Market (3): Market hooked on hedging -
Derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOLD market is hooked on derivatives, and shows no signs of breaking
away from its addiction.
Gold miners are spoilt for choice for hedging instruments which allow them
to lock in a guaranteed profit and achieve prices on their sales well above
the market average. Among the hedging methods listed at last year's
Financial Times gold conference were FDFs (fixed date forwards); SDFs (spot
date forwards); CSOs (committed sale options); CPOs (committed purchase
options); COs (compound options): Double Os (overnight options); KO options
(knock-out options); CCSs (committed close-out sales); and SIPs (simulated
inventory positions).
This a la carte menu is changing all the time as the market changes. 'If we
were to go into a bull market - a real bull run - there would be a suite of
derivatives emerging appropriate to that bull run,' says one gold market
analyst.
However, the market is very far from a bull run,with general agreement in
the industry that the plethora of hedging activity has been a factor in
trapping the gold price in its relatively narrow trading range for the past
two or three years in spite of events such as the Gulf war and the break-up
of the Soviet Union.
Every time there has been a spike in the price, a substantial part of the
mining industry has sold gold forward by the tonne, putting a cap on the
price. This has led to a situation today where some mines are achieving
prices of Dollars 420 a troy ounce when the spot price is about Dollars 340.
It would be hard to persuade any company not to maximise profit and
minimalise risk. But the Catch 22 appears to be that the more the market
hedges, the more pressure is placed on the price, and the more the mining
companies can tell shareholders they were right to hedge.
'It becomes a vicious circle,' says an analyst, pointing out that six months
ago mines were hedging when the price was at Dollars 360 a troy ounce - a
level they would be only too happy to grab now.
Hedging affects the gold market by helping marginal mines to stay in
business. A substantial amount of world production has been protected as far
out as 1996, and it is no accident that the biggest increase in hedging
activity in the past year has been in the high cost South African mining
sector.
While the forward, gold loan and options markets have long been in
existence, it was not until the mid-1980s that derivatives really took off,
starting with the rise of the Australian gold industry. It made sense at a
time of high interest rates to borrow bullion which was available in the
local market rather than to borrow dollars to exploit the shallow, low cost,
low grade deposits that the Australians wanted to bring on stream.
The gold market took the lead from the money markets whose products were
easily transferred because of the quasi-monetary characteristics of gold.
The fact that gold is a contango market (the forward price is always at a
premium to the spot) has been one of the factors attracting mining
companies. There is so much gold available above ground that the market is
unlikely to lapse into backwardation (where the forward price is at a
discount to the spot price) for any long period.
Most of the users of the derivatives tend to be on the supply side; on the
demand side there has been a growing disenchantment by investors, while
jewellery fabricators are simply not big enough to have the necessary credit
lines. The lack of a counter balancing demand side to the equation adds to
the capping effect on the market.
At the current level of sophistication, a mining company can tell a bullion
dealer the kind of hedging strategy it has in mind and ask for a tailor-made
product, according to Ms Jessica Jacks, economist with RTZ, the world's
biggest mining company. Declining interest rates, lowering contangos and a
declining spot price will just generate another suite of more-appropriate
hedging strategies. And in quiet market conditions there is plenty of time
to devise fresh derivatives to tempt producers.
Now producers have started to sell into a price decline, reflecting a view
of prices which can best be described as realistic, but also a desire to
continue using hedging policies. 'My feeling is that it's really a feature
of the market that's going to hang around,' says one analyst.
The changing strategy of the mining companies is reflected in a sharp fall
in forward sales - from 249 tonnes in 1990 to 51 tonnes last year, according
to Gold Fields Mineral Services, which gives four reasons. Sales increased
substantially in 1990 (year of the Gulf war); the market has been range
bound, with low volatility; interest rates have fallen; and there has been a
gradual change in attitude by some producers to forward sales.
Gold loan repayments exceeded the demand for new loans last year, leaving a
net repayment to the market of 11 tonnes. The trend has continued - on April
29 this year Newmont Mining, North America's biggest gold producer, bought
11.7 tonnes of gold in order to pay off a gold loan early. Ms Jacks
estimates that as much as 100 tonnes could be repaid this year.
There is a full spectrum of philosophies in the mining industry - on the one
hand Homestake which refuses to hedge, and on the other American Barrick or
some of the Australian companies which almost 'monetarise' their gold before
they've brought it out of the ground.
As one analyst says: 'I don't know if it's right or wrong. All I know is
it's there and if you ignore it you are not really analysing the full gold
market.'

FT  22 JUN 92 / London Bullion Market (1): Havens of inertia - Most gold
production is at record levels but producers and bullion dealers are feeling
the pinch. At today's prices half the world's gold mining capacity is
unprofitable and investors remain disenchanted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING

<TEXT>
IN some respects the world of gold has never been more dynamic.
Production in countries outside the former Soviet Union is at record levels.
More gold is being bought by jewellery makers, gold's main customers. In
each of the past four years jewellery fabricators have consumed more gold
than was produced by all the gold mines outside the former communist
countries.
They also helped to absorb a great deal from other sources such as imports
from Russia, disposals by central banks and scrap material.
Jewellers' appetite for gold was whetted because it has been looking such a
bargain. Gold has recently been at its lowest point for six years when
measured in dollars. Valued in Swiss francs, the metal has been at its
lowest since 1978. In yen, it has been at a 20-year low. From the peak of
Dollars 800 a troy ounce in 1980, reached after Soviet forces invaded
Afghanistan and the US froze Iran's assets, gold has fallen steadily and
dropped below Dollars 340 this year.
Some consumers welcome this trend but producers and bullion dealers are
feeling the pinch. On the production front, about half the world's gold
mining capacity is unprofitable at today's prices. Most of the uneconomic
mines are in South Africa, where large workforces dig to depths of up to 2
1/2 miles (4km) to extract the metal from narrow seams.
The steady fall in the gold price has left investors disenchanted. In
particular, many North American and European investors have quit the gold
market in the past few years, relying instead on a vast array of new
financial instruments to protect their wealth.
This trend is having a deleterious impact on bullion markets. One analyst
aptly describes them as havens of inertia. Yet even in depressed
circumstances they play a vital role in the world of gold.
In Europe, North America and parts of Asia gold trading is a highly
sophisticated business. Gold is traded round the clock by the most powerful
financial institutions in the world.
It is often said that gold bullion trading follows the sun, begining the day
in Sydney and then on to Hong Kong and Singapore. It moves west as the
markets open in Switzerland and London and then crosses the Atlantic to the
New York market and the futures exchanges in the US.
Many tonnes are bought and sold daily as big market makers continually quote
two-way prices (buying and selling prices) to other traders and to clients,
adjusting them throughout the day and night.
In Europe the standard trading quantity is 4,000 troy ounces. The unit of
trading in international markets is the so-called London Good Delivery Bar.
Each bar must contain between 350 and 430 troy ounces of gold and have a
minimum purity of 995 parts per 1,000. Bars must be in good condition and
bear a serial number and assay stamp from one of 49 acceptable gold melters
and assayers worldwide.
London has an important role in world bullion markets, not least because of
the fix. Every working day at 10.30 am and 3 pm London time, representatives
of five bullion houses meet at the offices of N. M. Rothschild to fix the
price of gold. Also at the fix are Mocatta &amp; Goldsmid, Sharps Pixley, Samuel
Montagu and Mase-Westpac. Most of them have been trading gold for centuries
and Mocatta can trace its history back to 1671.
At the fix each representative has a telephone line open to trading rooms
where dealers are in touch with customers. Potential price movements are
unlimited during the fixing and the process has been known to take as much
as two hours when the market is particularly volatile.
There are two big attractions to being in at the fix. First, it is a truly
open market where buyers and sellers are brought almost directly into
contact with one another by means of modern technology.
Second, the fix remains the one place to transact very large volume trades
because the wide network of traders involved is in touch with so many
customers in so many places simultaneously. The result is a single market
clearing price. There is no bid-offer spread but a negotiable commission
applies.
The fix is held in such regard that it has effectively become the benchmark
for the gold market. Many mines, for example, sell their production at the
average of the London morning and afternoon fixes over a period of perhaps a
month.
There are several other firms apart from the five fixers making a two-way
market in gold in London. Other organisations will quote to customers on a
commission basis and lay off the risk with the professional market makers.
The international market in London, Sydney, Hong Kong and Zurich is known as
the loco London market because gold is quoted for delivery in London.
Participants usually have a metal account with a London dealer to be
credited or debited as gold is bought or sold. Most transactions do offer
physical delivery and every transaction is made on the basis of being
deliverable. The gold in London vaults effectively underwrites the credits
clients have with banks.
London has another advantage over other bullion markets: the presence of the
Bank of England. The bank has a unique status in the gold industry. It is
not just another gold repository recognised by the International Monetary
Fund. It has a long history as an even-handed agent in the gold market for
many other central banks. The bank acts as the regulator of the London
Bullion Market Association which was set up in 1987 and covers all aspects
of gold dealing in London.
Outside London, most spot trading is done through Zurich. This dates back to
1968 when the London market closed temporarily at the request of the US
Treasury and gave Switzerland's big three banks - Union Bank of Switzerland,
Credit Suisse and Swiss Bank Corporation - access to South African
production for the first time. Previously South African gold had been
marketed exclusively through London.
As well as selling spot gold, bullion traders arrange swaps (where the
seller promises to buy the gold back at an agreed price at an agreed future
date), and make prices for forward delivery. In recent years options trading
has become an integral part of the market.
Some observers argue that this increasing sophistication of the bullion
markets has contributed substantially to today's quiet conditions and to
present low prices.
Forward prices and options enable producers and industrial consumers to
hedge their future commitments while providing valuable access for
investors. However, some analysts suggest this type of trading has resulted
in some of the price volatility disappearing from the bullion market.
Dealers love volatility because it generates more income and helps to
attract more investors.
Forward selling and options trading has become very common among western
gold producers because these devices enable miners to lock in guaranteed
profits. In exchange they sacrifice a potentially higher return. However,
there is no denying the market impact. When the gold price rises the rush of
producers to sell more gold forward places a cap on any further increase.
Ironically, the lower the gold price sinks, the more pressure is put on
miners to sell forward and stop it going up again.
So the clever schemes made available by bullion dealers have distorted the
impact low prices usually have on supply and demand. Much more gold mining
capacity would have gone out of production by now - perhaps putting the
price back on an upward trend - if not for the aggressive forward selling
programmes followed by many Australian and North American mining companies.
These have been protecting them from low spot prices.
Even South African gold output is only slightly down since the recent peak
in 1988 - by 20 tonnes to 601 tonnes last year - but only partly because of
the protection give by forward sales. Much more important is the South
African industry's ability to take many other steps - such as to stop mining
uneconomic seams and to concentrate on those where gold is more abundant and
more easily accessible - rather than closing mines.
This cannot continue for ever and analysts agree that some substantial South
African mine closures are in the offing. They also point out that it is
becoming much less attractive for gold miners to sell forward, so this
barrier to price rises might prove less effective in future.
The unknown quantity in the gold market is the future behaviour of the
central banks. Between them they have more than 35,600 tonnes of the metal
in their vaults, equivalent to about 17 years' production. In the past few
years the central banks have been net sellers and have the potential to cap
price rises in the second half of the 1990s as effectively as forward
selling by producers has done in the past few years.
Perhaps the biggest bet on a gold price increase has been placed by Newmont
Mining of the US, the biggest producer outside South Africa. On April 29
this year - the day the gold price was fixed in London at Dollars 333 an
ounces, its lowest point for six years - Newmont bought 11.7 tonnes of gold
(375,000 ounces) at a cost of nearly Dollars 126m to pay back early a large
gold loan.
Mr Jim Hill, Newmont's vice-president, corporate relations, says: 'We felt
that, whereas the gold price might go down a few more dollars, the trend
from now on would be up.'
Bullion dealers fervently hope Newmont is right.

FT  22 JUN 92 / Bigger may not be better: Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The top subject at this week's European Community summit in Lisbon, it
appears, is to be the admission of new members. On the face of it, this is a
very curious moment for the Community leaders to discuss the subject, right
in the middle of the Maastricht crisis. For this is a crisis over the nature
of the Community, and new members cannot possibly join unless the nature of
the organisation is in some sense settled.
And yet there is also a sense in which the enlargement issue is a mirror
image of the Maastricht problem. The treaty represents a substantial leap
forward towards a more integrated Europe; but the admission of a large
number of new member states must mean a Community which will be less
integrated than it is today.
The Commission has drafted a report on the problems of enlargement, which it
has submitted to the summit, and in which it says; 'widening must not take
place at the expense of deepening'; yet this is a logical and political
contradiction of opposites. For if the effective operation of the Community,
in terms of the functioning of its institutions, is to remain as integrated
with 20 members in future as it is with 12 today, then it is clear that
national political inputs to such a Community must be much more integrated
than at present. Which is politically impossible, QED.
It would be a 'tragic error', says the Commission in its weaken the
Community's decision-making capacity. Let us be clear: the weakening of
decision-making would not be an avoidable error, nor a possible danger: it
would be a racing certainty, on at least three levels.
The first level is simple arithmetic. If there are 20 governments
represented in the Council of Ministers, they cannot conceivably reach
decisions as easily as 12 governments; goodness knows, it is already
difficult enough for the 12. You only have to consider the time required for
each minister to say his piece just once, and add the geometrical increase
in the number of interpreters and translators. It is obvious that Community
decision-making must grind slower and slower.
The standard solution of European integrationists is an increase in majority
voting. That was the main achievement of the 1986 Single European Act, which
finally blew away the Gaullist myth of a national veto, and which will lead
by the end of this year to the Single European Market. And now the existing
member states have agreed to a further increase in majority voting as a
central element in the Maastricht Treaty.
But to argue that there must be much more majority voting in a Community of
20 than in a Community of 12 is a leap too far. It may be logical, it may be
sensible, and it may even be idealistic; but it is simply not realistic. Not
one of the 12 member states is demanding an immediate strengthening of
majority voting in order to admit new members. Considering the passions
stirred up in a number of member states by the prospective loss of
sovereignty already implied by Maastricht, it seems unlikely that they could
accept a further loss of sovereignty through another notch on the majority
voting ratchet.
The question is particularly acute for the large member states: France,
Germany, Italy, Britain and Spain. In the existing Community, the small
countries enjoy a very large premium in the Council of Ministers, with a
voting weight which is totally out of proportion to their population or
their GNP. This is a historical legacy from the days when the three original
large members (France, Germany and Italy) could afford this generous
concession, since there were only three small countries (Belgium, the
Netherlands, Luxembourg).
In today's Community of 12 the large members are outnumbered seven to five.
But all of the four plausible membership candidates are small (Austria,
Sweden, Finland, Switzerland), and they would tilt the balance still further
against the large countries 11 to 5.
In practice, such a Community would be dominated by small countries; it is
difficult to imagine the large countries accepting political subordination.
The British demand early enlargement, precisely because it would stop the
Community dead in its tracks; but even they might object to such a position
of weakness. Yet the small countries now inside the Community will not be
eager to accept a reduction in their voting weights for the sake of
admitting new members.
There may be grounds on which enlargement is nevertheless desirable, or at
least tolerable, despite its disadvantages. Economic and monetary union will
still be determined by Germany and by other large members with strong
economies, like France; the rich Efta countries should cause no problem.
The one thing which will certainly disappear with enlargement is any hope of
a common foreign and security policy. The Commission report says that new
members must give 'firm and precise commitments' on this subject, but this
is just empty piety. The Swiss will say: 'Yes, yes', and mean nothing; can
anyone seriously imagine a foreign policy which is commonly conceived in
Lisbon, Vienna and Helsinki? The very idea is laughable.

FT  22 JUN 92 / Monday Interview: A mission to give satisfaction - Henning
Schulte-Noelle, chief executive of Allianz, the German insurer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A deep scar runs down the left side of Mr Henning Schulte-Noelle's face,
from below the earlobe to the corner of his mouth.
It does not result from an accident. More romantically, it is the result of
a duel fought during his university days. It proves, in the parlance of this
ritual, that Mr Schulte-Noelle is satisfaktionsfahig - capable of giving
satisfaction.
Now, decades after his mettle was tested in this brutal manner, he is being
put to the test again and the same question is being asked. Is he capable of
giving satisfaction? Not, of course, at the point of a sword, but as the
recently appointed chief executive of Allianz, the Munich-based insurance
company which is one of Europe's most powerful financial institutions.
The question is especially poignant, as Allianz has reached a tricky point
in its history. In spite of its undoubted financial might - its assets are
estimated at DM400bn (Pounds 137bn) and its premium income last year was
DM48bn - it faces several potentially serious problems.
First, Allianz is under attack from the Bundeskartellamt, the German federal
cartel office, which is concerned about the group's domination of the
domestic life assurance market and its relations with Dresdner Bank,
Germany's second-largest bank, in which Allianz has a 22 per cent stake.
Second, the German insurance market faces a wave of deregulation which will
increase competition and threaten Allianz's main source of profits. A series
of European Community directives, aimed at freeing the insurance markets in
member states, must be implemented by the summer of 1994. In Germany, the
impact will be felt most severely in the profitable market for personal
insurance, in particular household and motor insurance.
Third, there are doubts about the wisdom of Allianz's move into eastern
Germany. It has bought Deutsche Versicherungs, the former state insurance
monopoly, which is unlikely to yield profits until 1996. Before then,
accumulated losses are expected to amount to about DM1.5bn, on top of the
purchase price of DM711m.
Fourth, and perhaps most important, doubts remain about the company's broad
strategy, which was developed by Mr Wolfgang Schieren, Mr Schulte-Noelle's
predecessor.
During 20 years at the helm, Mr Schieren transformed what had been a
regional player into the world's largest general insurance group. But
critics say he spent too much money - about DM10bn in the 1980s - buying
poor-quality businesses. They cite in particular the case of Fireman's Fund,
the US insurer which was bought for Dollars 3.3bn in 1990 and made a paltry
profit of Dollars 28m - before gains on disposals - on turnover of Dollars
2.6bn last year.
Sitting in a small, modestly furnished office deep in the headquarters of
the Allianz empire - a hushed, marble-floored office complex - Mr
Schulte-Noelle seems unperturbed by the challenges.
His calm manner belies long experience at the top of the German insurance
industry. He has been with Allianz since 1975 and, in the decade prior to
his succession last year, became one of Mr Schieren's closest aides. During
that period he was part of the executive team which consolidated the
company's position within Germany while pursuing aggressive expansion on the
Continent and overseas.
The internationalisation of the group has led to a shift in the company's
source of revenues. 'At the beginning of the 1970s, when the strategy was
conceived, overseas business amounted to 2 per cent of total turnover,' he
explains. 'Now it is 48 per cent.'
In pursuing this strategy, Allianz has placed little emphasis on short-term
financial gains. 'It is important that we earn money and pay dividends, but
this is not our only priority. We are now at the size where we have more
strategic options worldwide than we had 20 years ago.'
Some acquisitions have nevertheless yielded quick rewards. Mr Schulte-Noelle
cites the Italian insurer, Riunione Adriatica di Sicurta (RAS), bought for
DM1.1bn in 1984 and Cornhill, the UK insurer, bought for DM900m in 1986. But
other areas require greater patience. 'There are some parts of the world
where one can't reasonably make money in a few years. We are quite prepared
to wait five, eight or even 10 years if the market is an interesting one for
us in the long term.'
The US is one of these markets, and Mr Schulte-Noelle is sure that Allianz
was right to buy Fireman's Fund, in spite of its meagre return last year.
'We are still convinced that the Fireman's Fund will proUS that we have been
seeking. Once there is an upturn in the weak US market we expect a rapid
improvement in profitability', he says.
He is equally adamant that the purchase of Deutsche Versicherungs is
justifiable over the long term. 'If we had decided not to go into the new
Bundeslander, arguing that in five years we would still not have made a
return on our investment, I'm sure that our investors would have criticised
us for ignoring the potential of these new markets.
'If you imagine that the east of England had been split off - representing
25 per cent of your market - and suddenly there came along an opportunity to
get back in there, British companies wouldn't have to think very long about
it, especially if the alternative was to build up from scratch.'
While supporting the strategy of rapid international expansion, Mr
Schulte-Noelle believes that phase in the company's development is over.
The one exception is Asia: Mr Schulte-Noelle says he will make determined
efforts to build up a presence in what he calls the 'growth markets of the
future', in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia, Vietnam and even China.
In Europe and the US, by contrast, the emphasis will be on consolidation.
There will be acquisitions, but these will be designed to address specific
weaknesses. In the UK, for example, he says Allianz will seek to expand its
share of the life assurance market.
At home in Germany, he accepts there is likely to be a short-term reduction
in profitability in 1994 and beyond. He blames the process of deregulation
which will increase competition and reduce margins in the German market. But
he is not unduly worried; he says the company has taken steps to minimise
the impact of deregulation through heavy investment in training and
information technology in anticipation of the changed conditions and with
the aim of making the company more flexible in introducing new products'.
Throughout the interview, Mr Schulte-Noelle remains impassive. His cool
demeanour is at odds with his reputation within the company as 'one of the
boys' who, when head of sales, used to sit at the piano after conferences
and accompany salesmen as they sang into the early hours.
He breaks into a wry smile only when a direct allusion is made to Allianz's
power within Germany. This power is at the root of the recent challenge from
the cartel office, which claims that Allianz's dominance of the life
insurance market is anti-competitive and which has ordered the insurance
group to cut its stake in Dresdner and reduce the two companies'
co-operation in the life assurance sector. Allianz vigorously denies the
allegations and Mr Schulte-Noelle is not alone in Germany in seeing the move
as a generalised attack on Allianz and its position in corporate Germany.
'It probably stems from fears about us networking all over Germany,' he
says. 'But it's nonsense to think there is anything sinister about our
investment strategy.
'Look at the facts. Allianz has to invest a lot of money - we receive about
DM100m to invest every day. The German stock market is not a very large one.
If you have this amount of money to invest and there are a limited number of
companies, pretty soon you build up holdings in the companies you like.'
He says that Dresdner's management - indeed the management of any company in
which Allianz has a stake - is free to take steps which may go against
Allianz's interests. But as the head of Germany's most powerful investor, Mr
Schulte-Noelle is unlikely to meet opposition from many German businessmen.

FT  22 JUN 92 / Candour at last on health care: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oregon is awaiting federal approval for a health care experiment that seems
likely to influence the provision of medical services throughout the US and
perhaps the rest of the world.
Everybody in medicine knows that the steady advance of technology is making
possible ever more complex and expensive treatments, especially for those
approaching the end of their natural lives. Everybody knows that it is
irrational to finance all the treatments that will be medically possible: at
some point, other needs such as investment in education must take priority.
But nobody wants to talk openly about the setting of priorities, still less
mention that evil word 'rationing'.
Nobody, that is, except a set of unusually courageous policymakers in
Oregon. The state found that the soaring cost of ineffective organ
transplants was blowing holes in its budget for Medicaid, the joint
state/federal medical scheme for the poor. With thousands of poor children
lacking access to routine care, it decided it had to find a more rational
way of allocating a limited health care budget. The result is an innovative
plan that divides all health services into 17 categories of care and a total
of 709 condition/treatment pairs, ranked in order of importance.
The top category includes acute fatal conditions where treatment prevents
death and leads to full recovery. An example would be an operation for acute
appendicitis. Maternity and newborn care is ranked the second most important
category of treatment. The 17th and least important category includes
treatments reckoned to result in minimal improvements in the quality of
life: for example aggressive treatment for the terminal stages of cancer or
Aids.
The legislature was presented with the list last year and with a series of
costings prepared by an independent actuary. It then faced a very simple
task: finding how far a limited Medicaid budget would stretch. The cut-off
point reached was condition/treatment pair 587; nothing ranked less
important is to be made available by the Oregon public sector. Conditions no
longer treated will range from trivial ailments, such as viral sore throats,
to surgery for some kinds of lower back pain and infertility services.
The scheme has been widely attacked as crude, unworkable and unjust. Critics
are enraged by the planned exclusion of some treatments currently available
under Medicaid.
The explicit rationing, however, is only part of a broader strategy to
provide universal health care. The plan offers health care to everybody
living below the federal poverty line (Dollars 964 per month for a family of
three). Medicaid currently excludes many below the poverty line, all
childless adults and many categories of care such as standard dental work.
In a linked reform, companies will either have to provide insurance for
employees or pay into a state scheme; Oregon is also creating a state
insurance pool for high-risk individuals (people who have had serious
illnesses are often unable to get private insurance).
Officials in Oregon point out that health care is rationed everywhere. In
the US private sector it is rationed by price and by the onerous
restrictions written into insurance policies. In Britain's National Health
Service, rationing is even more opaque: public officials and doctors make
key resource allocation decisions behind closed doors. The breakthrough in
Oregon is the attempt to make the rationing open and fully accountable.
The priorities were determined by an 11-member commission consisting of four
consumers, a social worker, a nurse and five doctors. They reflect the
social values expressed by Oregonians in numerous public meetings and
surveys and expert assessments of the clinical effectiveness of different
procedures. Treatments at the bottom of the list are those either not widely
valued or judged futile.
Several members of the commission told me they would happily join the Oregon
plan themselves. They stressed that it was not just for the poor but a
benchmark for all private sector plans, many of which currently offer
inferior benefits. Public hearings and analysis of clinical effectiveness
had resulted in priorities that differ radically from those embodied in the
US's market-driven health industry.
For example, the Oregon plan puts heavy emphasis on preventive and primary
care. It stresses pain control and 'comfort care': unlike Medicaid, the plan
thus pays for hospice care for the terminally ill but not for high-tech
interventions to prolong life by a few days. Perhaps the most exciting
innovation is a plan fully to integrate the treatment of physical and mental
disorders. In future mental health will cease to be a poor cousin because
funding, as on the physical side, will reflect clinical results rather than
prejudice or custom.
The moves afoot in Oregon are revolutionary. The state is saying that
consumers, rather than physicians or bureaucrats, must take the lead in
determining health care priorities. It is saying that a bundle of basic
health care services can be rigorously defined and must be universally
available. Above all, it is saying that decisions about the use of finite
resources must be made openly. This is no easy task, but can anybody suggest
a better way for approaching health care reform?

FT  22 JUN 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: Focus on Yen trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Now that fears over the future of European union have temporarily subsided,
foreign exchange dealers will focus attention on the Japanese yen, writes
James Blitz.
Ireland's overwhelming vote in favour of the Maastricht Treaty will reduce
the volatilities seen in European exchange rates in the last fortnight. This
will give traders a chance to analyse the other big economic event last
week: the sharp fall in the Japanese stock market to a 68-month low.
The yen is being pulled in opposite directions by two factors. One is the
fall in activity in the Japanese economy. This has raised fears that the
Bank of Japan could ease policy, cutting interest rates and prompting a
sell-off of the currency. On the other hand, there is next month's meeting
of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations in Munich. There are again
strong hints that the G7 will launch a concerted policy to keep the yen
strong and reduce Japan's overwhelming trade surplus with the US.
The upcoming week will see the release of new data on Japan's economy.
Today's money supply numbers are expected to register a record low in growth
terms. Later in the week, there will be Consumer Price Index and labour
market data, which, despite being lagging indicators, should confirm that
inflation pressures remain subdued.
The dollar's weak trend, confirmed last week by a surprisingly wide US trade
deficit for April, will continue through the week. Durable goods orders for
May are out on Wednesday and personal consumption figures (for the same
month) on Friday. But neither figure is likely to budge the view that the US
economic recovery is, at best, sluggish.

FT  22 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Maxwell questions for the
City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ARREST of the Maxwell brothers will in one sense take the pressure off
the authorities, who needed to be seen to be doing something; but in
another, it ought to give them an even more awkward time.
Now that we are to have a prolonged holiday from the absorbing questions of
who knew what and who signed what, we should be facing the larger issues -
not just of pension arrangements, but of arrangements in the City. Those who
come out of the affair with any credit are thin on the ground.
The questions are too numerous even to list in a short column, so I will
concentrate mainly on three: custodianship, including share registration;
the abuse of collateral; and self-regulation.
It ought to be simply impossible for any borrower to pledge as collateral
securities which he does not own, for ownership should be a simple matter of
fact. Ambiguity arises only because of slow back-office operations, and the
lack of any clear, legally defined custodial function.
In New York these matters are better defined. Custodial and back-office
operations are run, very economically, by a handful of specialists with
clear legal obligations and no possible conflicts of interest. Similar
arrangements should certainly be legislated here for assets held on trust;
and if the banks and brokers are seriously interested in cost-cutting, the
practice would quickly become general. Indeed, it is only because of the
easy-money laxity of the 1980s that these functions are not already
contracted out.
Of course, the Maxwell problems would never have arisen had not
stock-lending been a normal feature of pension fund life, and had not the
banks been willing to extend credits on collateral which they would
routinely have withheld. This could be a matter for legal reform; my
post-bag suggests that I am not quite so lonely as I supposed in arguing for
a law ending the banks' prior claim on pledged assets.
The main reasons for this are moral and economic: it seems both wrong and
economically damaging that the main losses in a bankruptcy should fall not
on those who created the risk by excessive lending, but on suppliers and
others who were in no way involved.
There is also a fundamental question of monetary control. Existing
arrangements make it much too easy to monetise existing assets while
retaining ownership. This helps to explain why credit booms run so far out
of control, and why interest rates have had to be so much higher since
deregulation. The Maxwell story of apparent abuse of this system is only a
footnote: the system is wrong.
Finally, the Maxwell affair must cast still further doubt on the whole
London system of self-regulation, already under question from earlier
scandals and because of the present imbroglio at Lloyd's. The apologetic
self-examination from Imro deserves some sympathetic attention.
The regulators were clearly too ready to give the benefit of any doubt; but
would anyone have acted differently in their position? The whole system is
redolent of cups of tea and Governor's eyebrows - effective when the City
was a club and a blackball fatal, but increasingly inadequate to a
deregulated system.
This is not just a question of attitude, but of manpower and rewards.
Effective policing cannot be left simply to the serious fraud squad. An
unregulated market surely needs policing by a basically adversarial body,
properly financed and staffed, on the lines of the Securities and Exchange
Commission in Washington.
None of this will prevent scandals; still less will any official safety-net
system, such as US deposit and pensions insurance. The US savings and loan
scandal has already given a new and deeper meaning to moral hazard, and
there is good reason to fear that American company pensions will be
defaulting on a scale which will pose yet another fiscal problem for
Washington.
But a better policed City would be more widely trusted, and banks forced to
be prudent might not be forced into overcharging like the unregulated public
utilities they are. Scandals are only the smell of a decay with much wider
effects.

FT  22 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Polish airline secures
financing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE biggest aircraft financing deal yet for an eastern European carrier has
been secured by Bankers Trust, writes Daniel Green.
The bank will act as adviser to Lot-Polish Airlines in arranging a Dollars
264m, 12-year financing deal guaranteed by the Export Import Bank of the US
(Eximbank).
The figure covers 85 per cent of the cost of nine Boeing 737s to be
delivered over the next two years. The balance of the financing will be
raised separately by Lot.
The structuring of the deal allows the Polish carrier to pay interest at a
floating rate with an option to fix at a later date.
Mr David Flitterman, of the Bankers Trust's eastern European group, said
that working with Lot was straight forward because it had been among the
first east European airlines to purchase US-built civil aircraft and
therefore was known to western financial institutions.
'Lot bought two Boeing 767s two years ago,' he said.
The Eximbank-guaranteed funding will be used to finance the purchase of five
Boeing 737-500 and four 737-400 aircraft.
Deliveries are scheduled to begin in November.

FT  22 JUN 92 / US Syndicated Loans: Banks regain enthusiasm for highly
leveraged deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGHLY leveraged transactions (HLTs) in the US syndicated loan market are
creeping back into fashion in the wake of a strong high-yield bond market, a
recovering economy and historically low interest rates.
Although the rate at which banks are taking on HLT deals today is nowhere
near that seen at the height of the market's boom in the late 1980s, the
volume is running at a pace that should easily exceed 1991's total.
After limiting their participation in HLTs because of loan default problems
at the beginning of the 1990s, and then watching their HLT portfolios shrink
as the surviving borrowers paid off their debt, US banks are re-entering the
HLT market with renewed enthusiasm.
Typical of the deals currently in syndication is the Dollars 400m financing
for the supermarket group Grand Union. The deal is being put together by
Bankers Trust and consists of three tranches - priced at spreads of between
300 and 350 basis points (bp) over the London interbank offered rate
(Libor), and paying participation fees of up to 325bp.
Bankers Trust has been in the vanguard of much of the new HLT business. It
has also joined Chemical Bank and Barclays Bank in constructing a Dollars
680m deal for Coltec - priced at 275bp over Libor and paying fees of around
300bp - and is also working on a Dollars 750m HLT for soft drinks group Dr
Pepper, and a Dollars 470m deal for California supermarket chain Ralph's.
Both of the deals are being put together alongside initial public offerings
(IPOs) of stock.
In contrast with the mid to late 1980s, today's HLTs are not being used for
mergers or acquisitions, but for deleveraging - paying off loans that carry
high interest rates with funds raised through borrowings at lower rates.
After years of carrying junk, companies want to retire their high-yielding
debt, simplify their capital structures and generally clean up their balance
sheets.
As Mr Dick Trask, head of syndication at Citibank in New York, said of the
market today: 'You don't have the feeding frenzy, acquisition-driven stuff
you saw in the 1980s.' Today it is strictly about refinancing, deleveraging
and general corporate restructuring.
The watershed deal for the HLT market may have been the huge Dollars 1.25bn
syndicated loan in December involving textile company Burlington Industries.
The loan, alongside the proceeds from a simultaneous stock offering, was
used to retire or refinance all of the company's outstanding junk bond debt.
The Burlington deal, led by Bankers Trust and Chemical Bank, was typical of
many to follow. It involved a company overloaded with costly debt that
managed to turn its business around sufficiently to persuade bank lenders
and equity investors to provide fresh funds for a complete overhaul of its
balance sheet.
It was also typical in that the HLT was put together alongside an IPO. As
one banker explained: 'Banks are looking at deals where the original HLT has
seasoned for a couple of years, and where the company is now getting back to
the banks and saying: 'We'll bring in new equity to improve the
capitalisation and pay you a lot of fees'.' For many banks, it is a
difficult offer to turn down.
Not only are the fees on new HLTs enticing - some deals are paying 200bp to
300bp - but so is the pricing, which on recent transactions has been nearer
the top end of 250bp to 300bp above Libor, with even a few deals boasting
margins as high as 350bp above Libor.
At the same time, the risk profile of borrowers has improved, and the
companies are coming to the market, many of them after HLTs a few years ago,
with a reputation for much sounder management than in the late 1980s.
As Mr Charles Kiley, managing director in Bankers Trust Securities'
syndicated loans department, says: 'There has been an improvement in the
confidence level of the bank market, which is a function of the economy and
of these particular companies being pretty good success stories in their own
right.'
The recent decision by the US regulatory authorities to drop the HLT
designation on leveraged syndicated loans has also helped the market. The
authorities were worried that the HLT label, which scared away many
potential lenders, was preventing companies from raising funds. Its removal
could free up a fresh supply for capital-hungry companies.
The improvement in the economic outlook has also been a boon. 'Banks and
other investors are feeling more confident (about the economy) today than a
year ago, and they are open for business,' explained Bankers Trust's Mr
Kiley.
As for the outlook, a lot will depend on developments in the IPO market,
without which many recent HLTs would not have been possible. Recent signs
that investor demand for IPOs is waning suggests the growth of HLTs may
slow. Optimists, however, are hoping that as the economy recovers, and
interest rates stay low, new life will be breathed into acquisition-related
HLT business.

FT  22 JUN 92 / US Money and Credit: Economic data prove disappointing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS NOT exactly another double dip (or, to be exact, a triple dip), but
Wall Street is having to revise its forecasts in the wake of the most recent
economic data.
After the solid 2.4 per cent growth achieved in the first quarter (that
figure is due for revision this week but little change in the number is
expected), economists are now predicting the economy will have probably
grown not much more than 1.5 per cent during the second quarter.
The reason for this depressing downward revision is last week's raft of
economic statistics which suggested that the economy is not growing as fast
as originally hoped.
The clearest indication of the need to revise second-quarter GDP numbers
came from the April trade data. The figures released by the Commerce
Department on Thursday showed that the merchandise trade deficit widened in
April from Dollars 5.6bn in March to almost Dollars 7bn, the largest trade
shortfall since November 1990.
The reason for the widened deficit was a 1.9 per cent drop in the value of
exported goods (down to Dollars 36.4bn) and a 1.6 per cent increase in
imported goods (up to Dollars 43.3bn). The drop in exports was particularly
worrying, as it confirmed that the economic travails of foreign countries
could prove a drag on US economic growth over the next six to 12 months.
Until April, the US was at least able to rely on steadily growing export
sales to aid the domestic recovery. If that particular prop is now removed,
the recovery in the US may prove to be even more anaemic than feared. What
is more, the rise in imports during April was not necessarily evidence of
increased domestic demand, but more a reflection of higher oil prices.
Hence the downward revision in forecasts for second-quarter GDP, and
economists are now predicting flat export and modest import growth over the
rest of the second half, neither of which is much use to the US economy.
Most of the rest of last week's news was also on the bearish side. While May
housing starts rose a handsome 11 per cent, all it did was reverse two
months of declines. Clear proof of a sustained increase in housing activity
has yet to be discerned.
The latest snapshot of retail sales was also unfavourable, with the Johnson
Redbook service reporting that department and chain store sales dropped 4.5
per cent on a seasonally adjusted annual rate between May and the first half
of June. Labour market conditions also show little sign of improvement, with
weekly jobless claims falling a meagre 2,000 in the latest week.
So will all the economic gloom presage another interest rate cut by the
Federal Reserve? Probably not, judging by the Fed's 'Beige Book' report on
economic conditions, released last week. The tone of the book was cautiously
optimistic and suggested that the economy continued to improve across the
country, albeit at a slow pace.
The Beige Book depressed the Treasury markets because its message seemed to
be: steady as she goes. Some economists, however, are hopeful that the Fed
will ease policy one more time.
They believe that if retail sales, labour market conditions and the housing
market all remain weak - or at least not strong enough to fuel a strong
recovery - then the Fed will lower interest rates again.
Although predicting the Fed's actions is a dangerous game, bond market
optimists think both the Fed funds rate and the discount rate will be cut by
half a percentage point within the next month, quite possibly in early July.

FT  22 JUN 92 / UK Gilts: Funding fears depress long bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORRIES about funding overshadowed good news on inflation, leading to a
slight rise in yields at the long end of the gilt curve.
Talk in the market centred on the Bank of England's auction on Wednesday of
Pounds 2.75bn of 9 per cent bonds maturing in 2012. Assuming the auction
succeeds, the Bank will have disposed of nearly half the gilts it will need
to sell to meet this financial year's projected public sector borrowing
requirement (PSBR) of more than Pounds 30bn.
Even though in the first three months of the year the Bank has made good
progress in gilt sales, fears are growing that the pace of funding may have
to be maintained because of the deterioration in public finances.
Consequently the likely large glut in supply would almost certainly reduce
prices, pushing up yields.
Anticipating such a move, prices fell at the long end of the yield curve. At
the short end there was a firmer floor for prices, a result of speculation
about a reduction over the summer in UK base rates, now at 10 per cent.
The 9 per cent bond due in 2008 saw its price slip by a quarter of a point
over the week, closing on Friday at 99 19/32 . Its yield was pushed up 3
basis points to 9.04 per cent. As for the shorter dated 8.75 per cent stock
maturing in 1997, the price was little changed at 98 17/32 , for a yield of
9.11 per cent.
Fears about growing deficits were bolstered by the announcement of a Pounds
3.1bn PSBR in May. Even though this was a smaller figure than the market had
expected, the underlying trend is that the Treasury's projection of a Pounds
28bn deficit for the year to next March will be comfortably exceeded.
Assuming the deficit turns out to be closer to Pounds 32bn, that will leave
about Pounds 36bn of gilts to be sold for the year as a whole, accounting
for redemptions. Since the beginning of April, the Bank is believed to have
sold nearly Pounds 13bn of gilts.
Last week also saw a reminder of the weak inflationary forces in the UK
economy, a result of only small increases in demand over the past few
months. Growth in average earnings, as measured at an underlying level by
the Employment Department, fell to its lowest level for 25 years in April -
7 per cent on a year-on-year basis - and is expected to fall further in the
next few months.
The slowdown in the rate of earnings growth was spread across all sectors of
the UK economy. Average earnings growth for manufacturing employees fell
from 7.75 per cent in March to 7.25 per cent in April.
Indications that any recovery from the recession will be fragile were
supported by news of a large decline in consumer confidence and a report
from the Confederation of British Industry that manufacturers were expecting
output to grow only slowly.
Such indicators underline how the pressures pushing up prices throughout the
economy will stay muted, which is good news for the gilt market. However, a
slow or non-existent recovery will increase the PSBR, and produce a still
higher figure in 1993-94.
For the time being, the gilt market is less impressed by the inflation
outlook - which it reckons it has known about for some time - and is
concentrating on the funding aspects which some economists think could lead
to a dire time for gilt investors in months to come.

FT  22 JUN 92 / European Bonds: Irish treaty referendum sparks rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE'S government bond markets shed their gloom and rallied as Ireland
voted in favour of the Maastricht Treaty on Friday, thereby reviving hopes
of European economic and monetary union (EMU).
Having spent much of the last week nervously waiting for the Irish
referendum to take place, the bond markets rose quickly on the news that
Ireland's voters had said yes to Maastricht by a tidy majority. The chief
beneficiaries were the higher-yielding markets: Italy, Spain, France, the UK
and the Ecu bond market.
All of these - but particularly the Italian, Spanish and Ecu bond markets -
were hit severely when the Danes overturned the convergence apple-cart by
voting against the treaty on June 2, and they have suffered further falls
subsequently due to uncertainty about the prospects for EMU.
However, Ireland's referendum result revived confidence that the EC would
succeed in pushing ahead with EMU, and not surprisingly it was the
high-yielding markets which showed the strongest gains after the vote.
However, it seems likely that the sense of optimism will be brief. Indeed,
not all of the high-yielding markets managed to hold on to their gains on
Friday. Spain, France and the UK fell as investors and dealers took profits,
and the immediate future is unlikely to hold much hope of a strong rally.
'The whole episode of the last two weeks (since the Danish referendum) has
made investors more circumspect about convergence,' said Mr George Magnus,
international economist at SG Warburg. 'Even if the politicians say we are
back on the road to monetary union, people are more suspicious and will tend
to look at the domestic fundamentals in future.'
The Maastricht Treaty has to be ratified by all 12 member countries. France
is due to hold a referendum in the autumn. As the date approaches the
markets could well suffer bouts of nervousness, particularly as investors
concentrate more closely on the economic problems of the high-yielding
markets, especially Italy and Spain.
Italy has had a particularly rocky ride since Denmark voted against
Maastricht. The combination of political and economic problems and
devaluation fears sent investors scurrying for safer D-Mark assets after the
Danish referendum.
Last week, the Italian bond market see-sawed wildly. News of a solution to
the country's political problems and rumours that withholding tax on bonds
would be removed helped to lift the market, but devaluation fears wiped out
the gains.
Italy has been without a government for about two months. Last week,
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro named Mr Giuliano Amato, a Socialist, as the
new prime minister. While the Italian bond market took heart from the
appointment of a prime minister, economists were quick to point out that Mr
Amato's chances of success would depend on the formation of the new
government.
The other positive factor - news that the withholding tax on Italian bonds
will be lifted - also proved only a temporary boost for the market with many
traders remaining sceptical. 'There has been a tendency to circulate rumours
regarding the lifting of the withholding tax when the currency and/or the
bond market are in deep trouble. This is one of those situations,' said Mr
Karim Basta, an economist with Merrill Lynch.
Indeed, the Italian bond market spent much of last week being buffeted by
devaluation rumours. The Bank of Italy was forced to raise its emergency
funds rate from 12.5 per cent to 13 per cent shortly after the Danish
referendum in order to protect the lira.
However, the currency remains susceptible to devaluation rumours and the
news that one of the large US securities house expects to see a 5 per cent
devaluation in the lira caused further alarm in the markets on Wednesday and
Thursday. This prompted the central bank to intervene in the foreign
exchange markets to support the currency and to deny the possibility of a
currency devaluation.

FT  22 JUN 92 / International Company News: Brother slims down bloated
product range - The Japanese equipment maker has embarked on a critical
restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the foyer of the Brother Industries building, a smiling photograph of Mr
Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the International Olympic Committee,
congratulates the Japanese company on sitting at the top table of Olympic
corporate sponsors along with Coca-Cola, 3M, Philips and a few others.
Having already paid for its high profile, Brother should be able to bask in
Olympic year publicity. Instead, the year of Barcelona has become an
important test of strength for the maker of information equipment, sewing
machines and other household electric appliances.
With profits under pressure, Brother has just announced a restructuring plan
that could become commonplace among Japanese manufacturers, many of which
are burdened by too broad a product range and struggling in overcrowded
consumer and business equipment markets.
Another problem not unique to Brother is the side-effect of having achieved
the admirable aim of producing high-quality goods at reasonable cost - the
company has consistently reported poor operating profits and has been
dependent on non-operating items, such as profits on stock sales, to boost
its earnings.
The weakness of Japanese stock prices has not only increased the cost of
capital for manufacturers such as Brother, which lifted its long-term
institutional borrowing from zero to Y3bn (Dollars 23.8m) last year, but it
has also denied the traditional easy profits on marketable securities.
For Brother, these circumstances were behind a mediocre operating profit of
Y486m last year, down from Y2.35bn. The company would have reported a loss
were it not for a change in pension plan accounting that produced an
operating gain of Y669m.
Sales for the year were down from Y166bn to Y165.2bn. Net profit rose
slightly from Y3.2bn to Y3.6bn, thanks mainly to a Y1.1bn increase in gains
on property and equipment sales, and an extra Y699m in gains on stocks sold.
In response, Brother plans to cut its product range by about 30 per cent to
700 items, transfer 10 per cent of its 5,300 Japanese workers to new
ventures, increase the percentage of parts produced in-house, and make
research and development operations more market sensitive.
Mr Tamotsu Shimizu, the company's managing director, said a slowing economy
had forced the restructuring. Office automation equipment and industrial
machinery markets, already overflowing with competitors, were made all the
more difficult by capital spending cuts. Meanwhile, sales of its old
mainline product, home sewing machines, rose by 16 per cent.
He reckons that reducing the product line by 30 per cent will reduce sales
by only 10 per cent, as the items to be discarded are clearly not Brother's
best sellers.
At the same time, the company is hoping that a focus on successful products
will eventually lead to an increase in sales and, most importantly, stronger
profits.
'If it's not contributing to profits, we will no longer make it. Sometimes
you continue to produce a loss-making item because it is something that your
customers want and you have to keep their loyalty,' Mr Shimizu said. Items
to be pruned, he says, will include white goods and older-style sewing
machines.
Asked whether the company had tolerated losses in order to secure market
share, tilted his head back, closed his eyes and said: 'Yes, that's true.'
He explained, for example, that US discount stores wanted high-volume,
low-cost deals that sometimes force a company to take losses.
Mr Shimizu pointed to a curious contradiction that Brother was trying to
resolve. Its international sales division is wholly owned and tends to
produce good-quality market research material for product developers, while
market trends are less well-tracked at home, where sales are handled by an
affiliate of the company.
'Within Japan, we have been product-driven and we have got to become more
market oriented,' Mr Shimizu said. Again, Brother is one of many Japanese
manufacturers reaching this conclusion, as the boom years of the late 1980s
 -when GNP expanded at 6 per cent and 7 per cent and the stock market soared
 -gave over-confident producers the impression that virtually anything would
sell.
During this period, companies rapidly introduced slight variations on
existing products and also attempted to squeeze into new markets. The steel
companies elbowed their way into electronics, the camera makers attempted to
re-establish themselves as office equipment companies, and the consumer
electronics makers launched hundreds of new items each year.
Times have changed. Japanese car makers are at least talking about slowing
the flow of their new releases, while Hitachi, the consumer and commercial
electronics company, wants to lengthen the life-cycle of its products to
reduce expenditure on research and development.
But, in spite of weak earnings and murmurings about reform, most companies
are yet to bite the bullet, and there are doubts as to whether Brother's
changes go far enough.
For example, the planned shift in parts sourcing only aims to increase
in-house components from 12 per cent to 13 per cent of all parts. The
company also wants to maintain Japanese production at 80 per cent of the
total, though it hints that south-east Asian and Chinese factories will
probably take a larger share if profits continue to falter.
Mr Shimizu is confident that the success of new ventures will allow the
company to soak up excess labour, making redundancies unnecessary. One of
those new ventures is a karaoke (singing machine) systems company, Joysound,
of which he is a director.
Brother plans to provide karaoke hardware and software in Japan, and would
eventually like to go international. However, the company could find the
karaoke room as crowded as the white goods market and, in two years the
company may be reckoning as to whether the start-up funds could have been
better spent shoring up its postion in information equipment, which accounts
for about 40 per cent of sales.
The company is genuinely reassessing the cost of being an Olympic star, and
contemplating whether to be a corporate front-runner again at the 1996 games
in Atlanta.
'They want a lot more money for Atlanta,' explained Mr Shimizu, aware that
Brother's presence in the main stadium is less important than its survival
in the market.

THE fortunes of Mr Bernard Tapie, the controversial businessman who was
recently forced to resign from the French cabinet because of his involvement
in a fraud case, took another knock yesterday when Testut, a company
controlled by the Tapie group, disclosed consolidated losses of FFr68.01m
(Dollars 12.8m) for 1991.
Testut, a weighing machine business, is one of the companies recently put up
for sale by Bernard Tapie Finances (BTF), Mr Tapie's holding company, which
owns 88.75 per cent of its equity. BTF has been forced to make disposals in
order to reduce the debts incurred by its controversial acquisition two
years ago of the Adidas sporting goods business.
When BTF recently announced its 1991 results - which showed it had slipped
into a net loss of FFr294.9m after net profits of FFr47.97m in 1990 - the
holding company said it had made provisions for its losses on both Testut
and Teraillon, another weighing machine maker.
Testut last year saw its sales rise sharply to FFr446.73m from FFr291.4m in
1990, according to its accounts published yesterday.
Mr Tapie has been charged with fraud concerning his role in the disposal of
an electronics distribution company to Toshiba, the Japanese technology
group.

FFr241m profit

<TEXT>
GARANTIE Mutuelle des Fonctionnaires (GMF), the French insurance group,
produced a net profit of FFr241m (Dollars 45.6m) last year. This was after
making a FFr29m provision for a tax levied by the French government on the
insurers for the care of victims of HIV, the virus which causes the AIDS
disease.
GMF is comprised of a group of mutuelles - state-controlled companies that
provide financial services, including insurance and banking, for public
sector employees. The GMF group also has a controlling stake in FNAC, the
largest record retailer in France. FNAC is now locked in a battle with
Virgin, the British retailing group, in the French music market.
Mr Jean-Louis Petriat, the flamboyant businessman who chairs both GMF and
FNAC, told the annual meeting at Strasbourg this weekend that GMF had
increased its turnover in 1991 by 3.2 per cent to FFr6.4bn and that the
number of policy holders had risen by the same percentage to 2.92m.

   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Chicago Mercantile Exchange plans to build a second trading floor
directly above its current floor.
The Dollars 26.6m (Pounds 14.3m), one-year project will double the CME's
trading capacity and result in the world's largest exchange trading
facility.
The CME anticipated the expansion when it built its office tower in 1983.
The building has 30,000 sq ft empty space where the new trading floor will
be placed.
Mr Jack Sandner, CME chairman, said the exchange needed to grow to alleviate
crowding. Trading volume over the last decade had grown 222 per cent. 'Our
most successful products - interest rates and currencies - are overcrowded
to the point where new business opportunities may be missed if we do not
make this move.'
The exchange's plans to expand its index products, with new contracts on the
Russell 2000 small capitalisation index, the FT-SE 100 and the Goldman Sachs
commodity index have made the need for a larger space more urgent.
The CME will move its interest rate and currency group products to the new
floor next year. The floor will have 16 new trading pits and 770 member-firm
booths.
The Chicago Board of Trade, also overcrowded, is looking to build a new
trading floor as well. However, the CBOT is housed in a 1929 landmark
building without any expansion capability.
The exchange is consequently looking at other sites, but any of these is
expected to cost the exchange over Dollars 100m to construct.

<TEXT>
SMITHKLINE Beecham, the Anglo-American healthcare and consumer group, has
signed a co-promotion deal with Sigma-Tau, the Italian private healthcare
company, to sell a drug in the US for degenerative disorders  - including
Alzheimer's disease.
Sigma-Tau already has a worldwide co-marketing agreement with Roche of
Switzerland for the drug, known as Alcar.
The three companies will promote the drug together. Alcar, which was
launched in Italy in 1986, is presently in phase III trials in the US.
Results from the US trials, involving 400 patients at 27 clinical trial
sites, are expected during the first quarter of next year. Previous trials
in Italy showed the drug could retard dementia in Alzheimer's disease,
improving attention span, long-term memory and verbal ability.
Meanwhile, SmithKline is developing two drugs, oxiracetam and denbufylline
,for the treatment of Alzheimer's.
The company said the agreement would not affect their development. It added
that the experience the group gained from marketing Alcar would help it
later when selling its own compounds.
The US Food and Drug Administration is investigating reports that some
individuals who smoked while using nicotine patches had heart attacks. It
said a hospital in Massachusetts had reported that five heart attack
patients had used nicotine patches while smoking.

FT  22 JUN 92 / UK Company News: New structures that keep the stags at bay -
The changes taking place in the way companies float their shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE FLOOD of companies coming to the stock market
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
at a number unrivalled, barring privatisations, since before the 1987 stock
market crash - would in days gone by have had the stags preparing for a
bonanza.
But this time round private investors hoping to make a quick profit by
applying for shares and selling them soon afterwards may find that the
issues have been structured to prevent the once-familiar scenes of mayhem
when dealings in newly-floated companies' shares began.
Partly through the privatisation programme, corporate financiers have
developed ways to avoid the worst excesses of the old style issues, hoping
to secure a higher price for companies going public and reduce the risk of
spectacular flops. The new structures also cut commissions involved in
issues.
In the old days a flotation would usually mean a public offer for sale,
perhaps with the price set by tender, but often with a fixed price pitched
to ensure the issue's success. The offer would be fully sub-underwritten,
costing 2 per cent of the value of the shares being sold in commissions.
Investors would fill in their application forms - making multiple
applications in the days before those were outlawed - then wait to see if
the issue was oversubscribed.
If an oversubscription was large it would result in a ballot for shares or
the scaling down of allotments to perhaps 100 shares per investor. On the
first day of dealings the shares would open at a large premium to the issue
price, and stags would sell their small parcels of shares to institutions
attempting to gather together a holding large enough to justify its place in
a fund. Often large percentages of the newly-quoted company's share capital
would change hands in the first few days of its stock market career.
The Laura Ashley flotation in 1985 was by no means the worst example. Its
offer for sale at 135p was 34 times oversubscribed, a ballot cut allotments
to 300 shares for smaller applicants, and first day dealings saw the price
at a 59p premium. But the shares' performance since has been dismal.
While this was great fun for the stags, the company could feel it had sold
its shares too cheaply, and paid a lot to do so. Since the last rash of new
issues new ways of handling flotations have been introduced.
Nowadays, according to one merchant banker, 'book-building is the buzz word
in the new issue market'. Book-building - gathering indications of the
number of shares institutions will buy in a placing at what price - is the
basis of large international offers, such as those of Wellcome shares. But
they have a place in smaller UK only issues. Corporate financiers say that
book-building has always happened on an informal basis. That helps to assess
at what price the shares will be fully taken up, so that pricing is a more
exact art.
Many of the current spate of issues have an institutional placing separate
from the public offer for sale. This means the institutions can get the
stock they want without having to scrabble in the aftermarket for it. It
also reduces the risk of the issue flopping as a proportion of the offer is
firmly placed before the public sale.
'A public offer for sale is a very blunt instrument,' one new issue expert
says. 'There must be enough give in the price for the two week carry between
pricing and applications closing'.
Says one merchant banker: 'If you take the view that a proportion of the
stock - say 65 or 75 per cent - is going to end up in the hands of the
institutions, then the most effective and cheapest way of getting it there
is through a placing. We are cutting out the stags, the middle men.'
Another says: 'If you put the shares where the buyers are it makes the
pricing more accurate.' That means a higher price as a narrower margin for
error is needed. 'It is very, very hard to assess public demand', he says,
explaining why in the past some issues have appeared underpriced.
Kenwood Appliances, which is being valued at Pounds 104.5m in its float, is
typical in placing half the 23.2m shares being sold and offering the rest to
the public. The Telegraph and Anglian Windows issues take the same half and
half route.
The commissions on the public offer are the usual 2 per cent, with 1 1/4 per
cent going to the sub-underwriters, and  3/4 per cent to the brokers who
line up the sub-underwriters. But the placing involves commissions of only
3/4 per cent, of which  1/4 per cent goes to the brokers and  1/2 per cent
to Schroders, the sponsoring bank. The bank takes on the full risk of
holding the shares being placed in the few hours between pricing and the
receipt of firm orders from the institutional buyers.
At Kenwood's 285p issue price, the commissions on the public offer will
total Pounds 662,000 and on the placing Pounds 248,000. By placing half the
shares over Pounds 400,000 in commissions is saved.
The Stock Exchange insists that a proportion of the shares - usually 25 per
cent - in a flotation are publicly offered, unless the issue is raising
under Pounds 15m. Smaller issues can thus avoid the costs involved in
advertising a public offer, as well as the higher commissions. Country
Casuals, the retail group, is only doing a placing in its flotation.
However, another development in new issue tactics - the so-called financial
intermediaries placing - helps smaller companies raise up to Pounds 30m
without a public offer, and is also being used by larger ones to extend the
placing element. One merchant banker planning a flotation for the autumn is
aiming to keep the issue just under Pounds 30m to avoid the need for a
costly public offer.
Under this arrangement shares are placed with stockbrokers which specialise
in dealing for private clients or small pension funds, charities or trusts.
They then sell them to their clients at the issue price. These brokers can
assure their clients that they will get shares, so they do not have to take
the chance of applying in the public offer. However, investors who go
through brokers will have to pay commission on the purchase whereas
applicants in new issues pay no commissions.
MFI Furniture Group's issue, expected to value the company at over Pounds
750m, will involve a public offer of 25 per cent, an institutional placing
of 65 per cent or more, and a financial intermediaries placing of up to 10
per cent.
The stags may not be pleased by these changes, but companies coming to the
stock market must be pleased to see their shares heading into long-term
holders hands at a higher price and lower cost.

DENMARK'S Nationalbank, the central bank, yesterday promised to provide cash
support to Unibank, the country's second largest commercial bank, should
support be necessary.
The central bank said that rumours concerning Unibank were 'unfounded'.
The action by Nationalbank follows a spate of rumours on Friday that Unibank
was in serious difficulties, which caused an unknown number of depositors to
withdraw their funds from the bank.
The bank itself issued a statement to its staff on Friday afternoon
denouncing the rumours as completely untrue.
The Finance Supervisory Board, the bank sector's watchdog, also issued a
statement late on Friday saying that 'the rumours which have come to our
knowledge have absolutely no basis in reality.'
Unibank made a DKr1.8bn (Pounds 160m) loss in 1991 and it is expected to
report a substantial loss again in the first half of the current year, both
because bad loss provisions will remain high and because falling bond and
share prices since Denmark rejected the Maastricht Treaty in the June 2
referendum will cause substantial unrealised losses on bond and share
portfolios.
The bank's capital adequacy ratio at the end of 1991 was 10.7 per cent
compared with the Danish minimum legal 10 per cent and Mr Steen Rasborg,
chief executive, said that the ratio remains between 10 per cent and 11 per
cent.

FT  22 JUN 92 / Economics Notebook: Adjusting an undeserved reputation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Economic adjustment measures in developing countries, especially under
IMF-inspired programmes, are often blamed for increasing poverty, widening
inequality and holding back development.
A study by the Development Centre of the Paris-based Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) suggests this reputation may be
undeserved. Claims that adjustment is a cruel punishment visited on the poor
by unfeeling international organisations and greedy bankers miss the point,
the authors say.*
Basing their arguments on case studies in seven countries, which included
using economic models to test alternative strategies, the authors conclude
that adjustment does not necessarily dampen growth or increase poverty.
Obviously much depends on the severity of the economic crisis. But different
measures have differing social impacts. This is true both for stabilisation
policies that cut domestic demand to curb inflation and rein in trade and
budget deficits, and for longer-term structural adjustments to improve
supply by making the economy more responsive to market signals.
Political opposition to adjustment that delays government action worsens the
social costs, the study argues. The costs of adjusting are lower than the
costs of not adjusting, and adjusting before the crisis is better than
waiting until the crunch comes and the country can no longer meet its debts
or finance its outgoings.
The study is interesting partly because it claims to break analytical ground
in disentangling and simulating the effects of different adjustment
policies, and partly because it is the work of two academics with no
particular axe to grind. Thus, while the authors see adjustment as
essential, they do not necessarily endorse IMF prescriptions.
Of the seven countries looked at in detail, Chile, the Ivory Coast, Ecuador
and Morocco instituted programmes under IMF supervision. Malaysia and
Indonesia did so on their own initiative before running into trouble (and so
had more choice of policy measures). Ghana is cited as a prime example of an
economy ruined by refusal to adjust when crisis hit in the 1970s.
In Malaysia and Indonesia, where the problems and so the stabilisation
measures were less severe, living standards rose during adjustment. Poverty
also declined in Ghana during adjustment, which got underway in the 1980s.
In the other countries, adjustment was accompanied by stable or higher farm
incomes and employment but urban poverty increased. In Chile, where the
urban poor predominate, and in Ecuador where peasants rely heavily on
non-farm sources of income, poverty rose overall.
The study attributes these differences to the timing of measures and to the
policy mix chosen. Some governments, including Ghana's, ran programmes
designed to protect the poor. Ecuador made no provision and Chile helped
only the poorest.
Adjusting before the crisis meant less drastic cuts in demand, including
cuts in public spending. Early adjustment also ensured a continuing flow of
foreign capital, bolstering private investment necessary for future growth
and cushioning public spending on social services and essential
infrastructure.
The economic models used by the study also indicate for the first time how
countries might have fared without adjustment. The answer is badly. The
authors say critics tend to focus on the costs of adjustment (often
confusing them with the costs of the crisis) and ignore the costs of
non-adjustment.
In Ghana's case, non-adjustment meant drying up of funds from abroad and a
reduction in imports to the low levels of export earnings. This produced
falling incomes, output, trade and a 'disastrous increase' in poverty.
Simulations for other economies confirm that this path leads to socially
costly 'self-centred underdevelopment'.
Looking at stabilisation policies, the authors suggest that devaluation
seems to be a more efficient and equitable way of reducing a trade deficit
than cutting public spending or running tight money policies. It slows
economic activity less and, because it usually favours the poorer rural
sector, it reduces inequality and poverty.
The authors conclude that to minimise social costs the best stabilisation
programmes combine devaluation, a restrictive monetary policy to keep the
lid on inflation (which hurts the poor) and a moderate reduction in public
service wages (if they are higher than elsewhere). The worst involve raising
the prices of basic goods and laying off public sector workers - recipes for
social unrest, but often included in IMF-approved programmes.
Cuts in capital spending, if necessary, should not apply to rural investment
which helps reduce inequality and poverty, the study says. Similarly, cuts
in social spending and subsidies should avoid measures that impose
disproportionate social costs to the sums saved. For instance, making the
poor pay for medicines effectively deprives them of medical care, even when
treatment is free.
The study in general praises structural adjustments which it says tend to
have positive social effects. For instance, price liberalisation usually
favours the rural over the urban sector. Moreover, increased economic
flexibility reduces the costs of stabilisation.
However, the authors, again disputing conventional IMF and World Bank
wisdom, warn countries not to take drastic measures like privatisation to
reorganise state enterprises during an austerity programme. If attempted,
there should be compensation programmes for the unemployed, as in Ghana, and
effective longer-term measures to retrain redundant workers and help them
find alternative employment.

Bourguignon and Christian Morrisson (OECD Publications, 2 rue Andre-Pascal,

FT  22 JUN 92 / Kalon seeks to reassure Manders over jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KALON GROUP, the West Yorkshire-based paint manufacturer, yesterday said its
hostile Pounds 104.4m all-paper bid for Manders (Holdings), the
Wolverhampton paints group, would only result in a net loss of 300 jobs and
not the 500 originally feared.
Kalon's formal offer document, which Manders' shareholders receive today,
says recruitment after a merger would partly offset closure of the Windeck
factory at Bingley and further rationalisation.
The workforce would be cut by about 12 per cent overall instead of 20 per
cent. It would still result in cost savings of more than Pounds 4m.
Manders yesterday accused Kalon of backing down under pressure.
The listing particulars also show that over the past three years Mr Mike
Hennessy, Kalon managing director, received a Pounds 745,300 bonus linked to
earnings per share growth. His average annual salary including other bonuses
over the same period was Pounds 128,000.
In 1988 Kalon's pre-tax profits were Pounds 3.72m; in 1991 they were Pounds
9.2m, a growth rate of 36 per cent a year.
Mr John Farmer, finance director of Manders, yesterday dismissed Kalon's
profits growth and said its eight-for-three offer was 'fragile'.
He said: 'Kalon is only offering its shares which have been inflated by its
windfall figures of last year when its prices went up and raw material costs
went down.'

FT  22 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Coal sale
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In privatising British Coal, the government must reach a delicate balance.
It naturally wants to maximise proceeds for taxpayers. But if it tries to
enhance the worth of BC by pricing its output too aggressively, it will
impair the value of its remaining 40 per cent investment in the two
electricity generating companies, which it intends to sell in the medium
term.
Hence the importance of the negotiations over the generators' future coal
contracts. There may be up to 25m tonnes sustainable UK annual coal
production which can easily compete with imported coal. A BC sold on that
basis might not be hugely profitable, but its earnings stream would be of
high quality and worth a premium in the market. Had the generators to accept
higher-priced coal contracts, more UK coal would be economic, but BC's
earnings quality would fall.
Equally, after a point, higher contract prices would reduce the generators'
profits. New competitors would not face the same constraint and would
probably use gas anyway. PowerGen and National Power might try to pass on
costs to the distribution companies, but it is hard to see the regulator
accepting that.
The government's first need is to strike the level above world coal prices
that the generators can bear without adverse effect on their earnings. That
is probably no more than 10 per cent, which would allow British Coal annual
output of nearer 30m tonnes. The end to uncertainty once a deal is signed
should increase the value of the generators. The remaining task then becomes
that of extracting value for the taxpayer.
The logical route would be to seize the opportunity, albeit belatedly, to
break the generators up into smaller, competing units. There would be no
significant loss of value. The new companies would have relatively stable
earnings thanks to their coal contracts. The government could sell its
stakes once the market had stabilised. The process would take longer than a
straight secondary sale, but taxpayers would benefit from a more competitive
industry.

FT  22 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Index-linked gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A curious feature of UK government funding since the election has been the
unusually high profile of index-linked gilts. At some Pounds 1.2bn, new
index-linked stock accounts for more than 10 per cent of gilts sold so far
in 1992-93, bringing the total size of the market to almost Pounds 14bn. The
Bank of England has clearly uncovered demand for this paper. Less obvious is
why such demand should exist. The prospect of declining inflation should
make conventional gilts more attractive, despite the worries on economic
convergence unleashed by Denmark's Maastricht referendum.
Admittedly, index-linked gilts have a much greater appeal to high-rate UK
taxpayers than conventional gilts. But this advantage has always existed. A
more important factor appears to be the unusually narrow yield differential
between index-linked and equities. The chart shows that, even after the fall
in equity prices last week, the differential is still below its long-term
trend. Indeed, since the election it has plumbed depths rarely seen since
just before the 1987 crash.
There is no need to dwell on that ominous parallel, but the behaviour of the
differential further undermines the fundamental basis for the post-election
rally in equities.
Since index-linked stock offers both inflation adjustment and a guaranteed
real return, it is the next best thing to a risk-free equity investment. The
risk involved in equities - of the chosen company going bankrupt, for
example, or simply the ravages of the cycle - means they should normally
command a yield premium over index-linked. Arguably that premium should now
be more than the 0.5 to 0.6 of a percentage point to which it has tended in
recent years. The poor economic outlook has clouded the prospects for real
earnings growth, while the abnormally low average level of dividend cover
makes equity yields less secure than they at first sight appear.
One might thus have expected heavy buying to hit the index-linked market as
equity investors became more risk averse. That this did not happen owes
something to traditional worries about trading liquidity, as well as the
dampening effect of the Bank's habit of issuing new paper to meet demand. It
may have plenty of opportunity to do so if doubts over the future of
European currency union create resistance in the conventional gilts market
to the government's large funding requirement. The extra volume could be to
the market's benefit. As its size increases, liquidity will improve.
Eventually the index-linked market could offer a viable opportunity for
investors who want equity style growth with minimal risk.

<TEXT>
Even after last week's gyrations, the US equity market appears deceptively
sanguine. The Dow is sitting neatly between its recent peak and its level at
the start of the year. But overall it has risen by a mere 4 per cent.
Broader indices, notably the S&amp;P 500, have been flatter. Last week's
cancellation of the GPA flotation suggests that investors are becoming more
sensitive to risk after a flood of new issues. The forthcoming election is
adding to the uncertain outlook.
Since late last year the equity market has been underpinned by retail
investors switching out of money market funds in response to exceptionally
low short-term interest rates. That process cannot go on for ever, though
the Federal Reserve would be reluctant to raise rates ahead of the election,
and the economy has also been slow to respond to monetary ease.
If anything, recent indicators have tended to weaken the view that recovery
is gathering speed. The Fed could conceivably cut short-term rates again,
which would help Mr Bush's re-election chances. But any cut will be small.
Once a sustained recovery is evident, short-term rates will inevitably rise
again, tempting retail investors back into cash.
Those who remain bullish on equities on the grounds that corporate earnings
are expected to rise strongly cannot have it both ways. On the one hand the
argument assumes slow growth and low inflation will continue to justify easy
money. On the other, the economy will have to grow rather more robustly if
the market multiple of 14 for next year is correct. In that case, presumably
short-term interest rates will be rising again. That does not give much
incentive for further buying of US equities.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Sir, I take issue with Jurek Martin ('Is the US system still working', June
17) on one point. He says that politicisation of the judiciary has meant the
'rejection of fine legal minds (Robert Bork)' from seats on the Supreme
Court. But let us not forget Bork's role in Watergate. It is one Martin
could have easily mentioned, particularly as he acknowledges the actions
during Watergate of some 'principled civil servants', such as Elliot
Richardson, Nixon's attorney general, who chose to resign rather than fire
(at Nixon's behest) the special prosecutor who was about to expose the
president's role in the conspiracy. The man who finally did axe Archibald
Cox was, of course, Bork.
Fine legal mind notwithstanding, for that reason I am glad Mr Bork never
ascended to the Supreme Court.

<TEXT>
Sir, The commitment of Britain's gallant few to seeking exports at Ecobrasil
('British business left in the cold', June 10) was matched and encouraged by
the Department of Trade and Industry with financial support and by our
consulate general in Sao Paulo with its first class commercial intelligence
and administrative assistance. We found David Maclean, minister of the
environment, who visited us, to be excellent value.
The political uncertainty surrounding the Earth Summit in Rio deterred many
exporters, not just British, from exhibiting at Ecobrasil. Participation by
companies in all of the national pavilions was well down on first estimates.
The determination of 'our few' has been well rewarded. While we did not see
many delegates from the Earth Summit (far less FT correspondents]), those of
us new to the Brasilian market, and those already established, were
delighted with the results of their participation in Ecobrasil.

FT  22 JUN 92 / Letter: Accuracy of retail sales statistics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr R M NORTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Roger Saoul claims ('Appeal should be for better statistics', June
18) that the official retail sales statistics are, and have been for some
time, misleading. This is not so and he will be glad to hear of the progress
we are making.
Until the end of last year, the official monthly retail sales index was
based on a voluntary inquiry addressed to about 3,500 retailers covering
about 60 per cent of retail sales. This provided a generally sound indicator
but did have some weaknesses. In particular, a small number of large
retailers chose not to take part and it was difficult to achieve a
statistically sound sample if we had to rely on the co-operation of
volunteers.
From January 1992, the inquiry was made compulsory and the panel extended to
comprise a carefully selected sample of 5,000 retailers of all types and
sizes covering around 70 per cent of total retail sales. All large retailers
are required to contribute and the sample is more truly representative.
Results from the new inquiry were introduced when the April estimate was
published last month.
There will be further improvements to the system of retail sales statistics.
We are about to launch a quarterly inquiry to large retailers to collect
information on sales by different product categories. We shall also be
pursuing the possibility of a better breakdown by types of business to
improve the usefulness of the detail currently published monthly.

<TEXT>
Sir, I can assure you that the heading of your report 'Euro-MPs press over
Maastricht' (June 18) gave an entirely false impression of our discussions
with the prime minister on this subject. Since our view of what should be
done following the result of the Danish referendum coincided with that
expressed by Mr Major and the foreign secretary, there was nothing to exert
pressure about.
Clearly a negotiation would be necessary between the Twelve to reach
agreement on the terms of any 'solemn declaration' to be attached to the
treaty, but it would not involve any actual re-negotiation of the Maastricht
Treaty itself. The government has already made a proposal to this effect.
Several other possibilities were briefly discussed.
Moreover, we were all agreed that it was sensible for the eleven Member
States other than Denmark to proceed with ratification of the treaty as soon
as practically possible.
If the meeting highlighted anything, it was certainly not 'the spread of
views across the party', but the unanimous support of the Conservative
Euro-MPs for the government's policy on the Maastricht Treaty, and in
particular for finding ways of helping Denmark to ratify it.

FT  22 JUN 92 / Letter (3): Demise of NEDC leaves UK without means for
valuable industrial dialogue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER MCGREGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The idea that the NEDC was a corporatist institution is just ridiculous
to anyone who worked there. Of the three parties around the Council Table
neither the CBI nor the Trades Union Congress could deliver anything by way
of bankable agreements on behalf of their member organisations, and the
government probably could not deliver such an agreement itself (which in my
time it didn't really want to do except perhaps on one occasion).
The council was not a stupid body in concept, however: a regular discussion
by the social partners (to use the Continental term) of the economic
situation without over-ambitious ideas about trying to agree about what
ought to be done would be useful, provided that all issues were open to
discussion and that the basis was a previously published independent
analysis, like that of the Council of Economic Advisers in Germany. NEDO was
set up to provide this analysis. However it was sabotaged by the Treasury,
which eventually insisted that discussions must be based on its papers and
no-one else's. For a long time the TUC would not discuss pay, and when it
did agree the Treasury sabotaged that, perhaps inadvertently, although I
doubt it. The CBI spent a lot of its time trying to avoid accidentally
agreeing with the TUC about anything. If that is corporatism it has a
peculiarly ineffective form, but that is true of many British institutions.
The sector committees also sometimes had delusions of grandeur. it often did
useful work, but the basic concept was wrong. It should be possible for
industry trade associations to talk directly to government, and these trade
associations should also talk regularly to the relevant trades unions on the
basis of exchange of information about what is going on and not only of
negotiation.
The need for intelligent communication continues to exist at industry and
company level, and British institutional arrangements are conspicuous by
their absence. Someone needs to see that independent mechanisms develop for
these purposes. Perhaps we should now have a Council of Economic Advisers to
provide an independent review of the economic situation which can be
discussed without the formality of the NEDC?

<TEXT>
Sir, I have worked on various projects for NEDO, including 10 years on the
Cotton and Allied Textiles Economic Development Committee, eight of them as
chairman, and in the last four as chairman of the manufacturer-retailer
panels.
Those of us who have worked on the sector groups did so because their work
was not being done elsewhere. But the government has thrown the baby out
with the bathwater in dismantling the think-tank activities of the sector
groups.
The work of the sector groups and their various working parties has been
actively supported by countless busy industrialists, yet this work was not
taken into account in the pronouncements of last week. The sector group's
job has been to develop strategic thinking and put key pan-sector issues
under the microscope, thereby influencing management, employees and the
stance of government, domestically and internationally. Yes, this involves
exchange of views and communicating findings to individual firms, an
activity that can be described as a 'talking shop', a phrase used
disparagingly by eminent politicians and the Confederation of British
Industry when the NEDO closure was announced. Yet are not all committees
'talking shops' and has anyone, particularly government, found a better way
to involve knowledgeable and experienced people in constructive debate?
I had hoped that the need to create a more productive industry-government
interface would now be acknowledged as it has become clear that the issues
of the 1990s and beyond are global by nature and that the nation's
competitiveness is a micro-economic problem, requiring detailed
understanding, sector by sector, and which cannot be solved by grand ideas
alone, by tinkering with taxation, or without government in partnership with
industry.

Sir, I am glad that Samuel Brittan (Economic Viewpoint: June 18) did not
cheer the demise of the National Economic Development Council. It needed
reforming, of course, but not abolition. The council, and its many working
parties, have brought together national representatives of industry, trade
unions and consumer interests to exchange views and also on occasion to
agree action. Other European countries all seem to find dialogue of some
kind valuable, and it could have been made more effective here. In one form
or another consultation and dialogue surely must take place, and it is up to
government to decide how it should be organised,
The research activities of NEDO, on the other hand, can readily be taken
over by the private sector. Indeed the public interest may be better served
by sponsoring independent research. This is the sort of pattern followed in
Germany and in most countries of continental Europe. As Samuel Brittan says,
what is needed is not just routine economic forecasting but 'research into
the obstacles to growth' and how they can be overcome. The National
Institute of Economic and Social Research has been following such an agenda
since well before NEDO was founded. We have benefited from co-operation with
NEDO over the years. Now we must try to fill some of the gap that will be
left when it goes.

'Since you'll have to wear breeches at banquets,' the duchess told a
candidate for a footman's job, 'please roll up your trousers and let me look
at your calves.'
When he had done so, she added with a nod: 'And as you'll be wearing a kilt
when we're in Scotland, roll them up further and show me your knees.' He
obliged, and she nodded again. 'Fine - all that remains is for me to see
your testimonials,' she said.
'Now if only I'd had a better education,' the would-be footman thought
later, 'I would have got that job.'

Greece's determination to lay claim to the name Macedonia and keep it out of

Having launched an international campaign to publicise the tourist

repaint its assets to make the point.

<TEXT>
If Conservative party rumours are to be believed John Major is toying with
the idea of making Sarah Hogg, boss of his policy unit, governor of the Bank
of England after Robin Leigh-Pemberton. But if a woman can make it into the
Old Lady why can't a foreigner?
It would certainly widen the catchment area and provide a welcome breath of
fresh air. After all if the Central Statistical Office can recruit
Australian Bill McLennan, why can't the authorities show the same sort of
adventurousness in choosing the next governor?
One candidate who springs to mind is Donald Brash, New Zealand's central
bank governor. He has reduced inflation to under 1 per cent well ahead of
the end-1993 deadline set by his official paymasters. He has also succeeded
in halving his bank's staff in the past few years - an achievement that
should impress ministers.
Another advantage - apart from Brash's good record as a public speaker  - is
that he will be free for the job. His term of office ends in August next
year, precisely two months after the Threadneedle Street job becomes vacant.

In 1957 a young entrepreneur called Captain I R Maxwell asked the New York
end of accountants Price Waterhouse if it would be willing to audit the
books of his newly formed Pergamon Institute, headed by Sir Robert Robinson
OM - one of Britain's leading scientists.
Before it would accept the assignment, PW New York asked PW London for its
opinion of Sir Robert Robinson and Captain Maxwell. Not much was known about
Sir Robert, but his Order of Merit impressed PW London. Sir Robert was
'clearly a scientist of great repute' and the OM 'is rarely given and then
only to individuals who have given great service to the country', gushed the
anonymous London partner.
But the Captain was another matter. 'I must admit that I never took a great
liking to him and he always appeared to be somewhat of a mystery. Altogether
my advice would be to go slow about accepting any work of a recurring nature
from him.'

FT  22 JUN 92 / Observer: Red carpet for the poor
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The only sort of tourists most cities seem to go out of their way to welcome
are rich ones. But Paris, to its honour, is bucking the trend.
The city hall, ministry of tourism and holiday operators are gearing up to
welcome at least a million impoverished east Europeans over the next few
weeks. Having been taken aback 12 months ago when the lifting of visa
restrictions suddenly brought a huge influx, especially of Czechs and Poles,
they're determined not to be caught again.
Being too poor to afford hotels and restaurants, many of last year's eastern
visitors ended up sleeping and grabbing the odd meal in vans and buses. On
some August days, more than 1,200 such vehicles from various sources were
parked in central Paris, often hampering access to the most popular sites.
Other visitors, still poorer, just pitched a tent wherever they could. As a
result, Mayor Jacques Chirac complained to the head of the Paris police
about hundreds of illegal campers regularly staying by the Eiffel tower.
To help those arriving this time, the city tourism office is ready to hand
out lists of cheap hotels, restaurants and camp-sites specially printed in
Hungarian and Russian as well as Polish, Czech and Slovak. It has also
produced 10,000 Paris guides in the last three of those languages for
distribution to tour operators in the east.
True, the expected 1992 influx is unlikely to have much to spend either.
Nor, even without them, would France go short of its vital tourist trade. In
all, visitors last year almost matched the country's 56.5m population -
there were 52m of them, nearly a sixth of them going to Paris.
But the city is looking ahead. If east Europeans see a red carpet awaiting
them as they are now, it believes, they'll return when they're richer in
future years.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Foul] Observer is being less than fair and less than clever ('Ah so',
June 12) when he ascribes the curious English to a Tokyo car-hire company.
Old Japan hands will recognise the piece as an extract from a wonderful
spoof published in 1879 and re-printed in 1953. It was called 'Revised and
Enlarged Edition of Exercises in the Yokohama Dialect' and purports to have
been compiled at the request of the Bishop of Homoco. What makes it funny
(at least to those of us who speak Japanese) is not the peculiar English
(which is itself a send-up) but the wonderful way in which the Japanese is
transcribed and then translated. It demonstrates the authors' good
understanding of the language and their ability to send themselves up.
Observer is being unfair to this slim publication and unjust to Tokyo car
hire firms, whose service in general is far more efficient than any I have
found in London. And to suggest that Japanese corporate communications are
still at that level is to demonstrate either ignorance or a vicious streak.

FT  22 JUN 92 / Letter: Pension law: America's is imperfect, but it strikes
the right balance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms ALICIA M KERSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The late Robert Maxwell apparently did not siphon off assets of his
companies' pension plans in the US. It is tempting to conclude that ERISA,
America's comprehensive pension law, was the deterrent. My British
counterparts should be aware that Maxwell's actions, if prudent, could have
been permitted in the US. ERISA relies on the private sector for the
delivery of pensions, and accommodates, at least in part, the role of
pension assets in the corporate financial structure.
Britain's debate questions who should own pension assets. Here the answer is
clear: Maxwell could have terminated the plans and taken back any assets in
excess of benefits earned to date. During the late 1980s, pension plan
terminations became common here, despite arguments that excess funds
belonged to the pensioners. Now terminations have slowed, due to poorer
investment performance and curbs on plan funding.
Reformers in the UK are considering removing plan assets from the employer's
control and prohibiting self investment. Under ERISA, Maxwell could have
appointed himself trustee, retained investment control and directed
investment at plan assets in Maxwell companies. If those investments were
prudent (perhaps a large 'if' in the case of Maxwell) no law would have been
breached.
(Although ERISA does not explicitly require it, our regulators insist that
any self-investment be validated by an independent party.)
Pension losses in the US are limited by an insurance system managed by a
quasi federal agency, the PBGC. Without a federal guarantee of the
programme, this should provide little comfort to pensioners. The system has
been marked by deficits and by regular increases in fund premiums (paid by
plans). Until recently, premiums were not based on plan financial health.
Limited experience rated premiums are now imposed, but the relationship of
premiums to risk remains imperfect.
Enhanced reporting and disclosure is frequently advocated. I am sceptical.
ERISA does require extensive reporting and disclosure. But under ERISA, no
one would have learned of Maxwell's defalcations of pension money until it
was too late. An investment may not be reported for as many as 19 1/2 months
after it is made. The government only recently began enforcing penalties for
failure to file (someone discovered revenue could be raised from it).
ERISA will not prevent a determined person from raiding pension assets; no
private system will.
There is a danger of over-reacting to the Maxwell affair. ERISA is far from
perfect but it has achieved a balance between protecting pensioners and
preserving the private system.

FT  22 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Regulating the water industry
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR IAN BYATT, the UK water regulator, has acquired a reputation as the most
interventionist of the utility regulators. This is entirely appropriate in
an industry which lacks even the measure of competition existing in other
utilities, where gas, for example, competes with electricity, BT with
Mercury. The water companies can point to considerable benefits from
privatisation: record levels of investment; fast-improving water quality;
and better service. But with little potential to increase competition, only
assiduous regulation can defend consumers against monopoly abuses.
There has been no shortage of reasons for the regulator to intervene. Price
rises averaging 5 per cent a year over the rate of inflation produced profit
increases last year in double-digit percentages. Most companies have
increased prices less than the permitted maximum this year, but only with
bad grace after Mr Byatt warned that excessive profits would bring nemesis.
While shareholders have enjoyed rising dividends, many drought-stricken
parts of the country are enduring hosepipe bans and other restrictions on
the use of water.
Water company chairmen and chief executives - probably underpaid when
nationalised - have tripled their salaries since privatisation with scant
regard to public relations. The level of disconnections to collect unpaid
bills has climbed steeply, with the most ruthless company 300 times more
likely to cut off a non-paying customer than the least. Ambitious plans to
use monopoly profits from water supply for acquiring businesses such as
waste management have had to be squashed.
Tinkering rejected
This suggests considerable scope for tightening the regulatory regime when
the present arrangements are reviewed in 1995. Mr Byatt has rightly rejected
immediate tinkering on the grounds that the Pounds 28bn investment programme
would be undermined by a return to the short-termism prevalent when the
industry was nationalised. But he has issued a stream of position papers on
the options for 1995, inviting debate in the industry and among water users
The most important of his proposals is to set the companies' price cap
formulae in the light of their rate of return on capital. He has suggested
that current rates of return are too high for low-risk utilities. While
there is room for debate over the targets, Mr Byatt is undoubtedly right to
form a view about appropriate rates of return in the absence of competitive
pressure.
Environmental objectives
Mr Byatt has also questioned the cost of environmental improvements imposed
on the companies by the EC and watchdogs, such as the National Rivers
Authority. Meeting EC targets for levels of nitrate and pesticide residue,
for example, is already costing Pounds 1.8bn - to achieve standards of water
purity the value of which is a matter of controversy. The NRA's chairman,
Lord Crickhowell, wants to accelerate the already ambitious programme for
reducing river pollution. And last week, he urged companies to reduce the
rate of extraction from 40 depleted rivers. Such environmental objectives
have merit, but decisions must be taken only after thorough cost-benefit
analysis.
Finally, Mr Byatt has urged that domestic water users should pay for the
amount of water they use, rather than the present flat-rate charge, based on
house values. The case for metering is strongest in the south and east of
England where ground water reserves are so depleted that shortages would
long outlive an end to the drought. Grandiose schemes to bring water from
the wetter north are under consideration, though a national grid would be
ruinously expensive. More promising returns are available on investment in
modernising mains, which lose almost a quarter of the water they carry
through leakage. However, metering, almost universal among other European
countries, offers the only hope of choking off the inexorable rise in demand
for water in areas of shortage. It will have to be introduced.
Mr Byatt has shown commendable initiative in raising these issues and in
cajoling the industry into meeting its social obligations. The water
companies may squirm and protest, but consumers are in no mood for
compromise.

FT  22 JUN 92 / Leading Article: President John Major
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST WEEK'S Irish referendum result gives a reprieve, but not yet definitive
salvation, to the project for European union embodied in the Maastricht
treaty. It does not even restore the status quo ante June 2. The unexpected
Danish No vote on that date, however narrow, continues to affect the climate
and agenda of the entire EC in a way that the expected Irish Yes vote of
last Thursday, however overwhelming, cannot do.
At the end of this week the EC's political leaders will gather in Lisbon for
the first post-Maastricht meeting of the European Council. Before June 2 it
had been understood that the main business of this meeting would be to
consider the modalities of negotiations with would-be new members. Britain,
which takes over the presidency next week, would still like to press ahead
with that discussion and to fix the opening of the actual negotiations early
in the new year. British governments have consistently supported the
enlargement of the EC, which fits with their vision of it as an open
free-trade area, and have made themselves strenuous advocates of its
extension, at a later but not too distant date, to former communist
countries in central and even eastern Europe. The thought that new members
might have difficulty in accommodating themselves to a tightly integrated
political and monetary union is, in British eyes, a pro rather than a con.
Shared misgivings
British logic therefore sees the Danish revolt against Maastricht as no
obstacle to the enlargement process. On the contrary, it makes sense to deal
with both problems at once, since Danish misgivings about an
over-centralised Union are likely to be shared by fellow Scandinavians. But
precisely for that reason other governments, which regard making a success
of political and monetary union as the priority, insist that negotiations
with new members cannot start until the Maastricht treaty is safely
ratified, so that applicants know what it is they are applying to join.
That view seems likely to command a majority, and Mr John Major may
therefore not be able to devote his presidency to the enlargement issue, as
he had advertised his intention of doing. If in the end Maastricht does
unravel - either because the French use their referendum to dispose of
President Francois Mitterrand in the way they once disposed of Charles de
Gaulle, or because the German Lander make themselves the spokesmen of
increasingly widespread public anxiety about the demise of the D-Mark, or
even (just conceivably) because the opposition joins forces with Tory rebels
to force a referendum in the UK - then indeed it will make sense to involve
the candidate countries in discussion of what, if anything, is to take its
place.
Intense suspicions
Mr Major might then find ways to turn the unravelling to his advantage. But
he cannot be the one to unpick a knot which he himself tied. Domestically,
he cannot afford to denounce an agreement he once described as 'game, set
and match to Britain"; and in the Community he cannot afford to nourish the
intense suspicions harboured by so many of his partners about the sincerity
of Britain's commitment to European union in any form.
Much of the next six months will inevitably be devoted to efforts to
preserve Maastricht, by devising formulae to placate the Danes and other
Eurosceptics, while at the same time inventing legal artifices to enable
eleven member states to implement the treaty without Denmark if that proves
unavoidable. Much time will also have to be devoted to the Community budget.
Yet the EC must not fall into the trap of imagining that the world will
stand still while it wrestles with its internal problems. If it does so it
will fail lamentably in dealing with the countries to its east, where the
economic and political disintegration is proceeding at an alarming pace; and
it will fail, above all, in reaching a solution to the impasse in GATT, a
crisis more immediate and as urgent as anything involved in Maastricht.
As an experienced global power, Britain should be well placed to take the
lead in dealing with this external agenda, provided it can disarm its
partners' suspicion that it is using external problems to block or derail
the longer-term process of integration.

FT  22 JUN 92 / Loss of direction at the crossroads: Israel's politicians
are preoccupied with past disputes ahead of tomorrow's general election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The campaign for tomorrow's general election in Israel has been dominated by
old wars, old men and old insults. Strangely lacking has been a serious
debate about the immense changes the Middle East has undergone since the
last election in 1988.
The Soviet Union, for decades the main sponsor of Israel's Arab enemies, has
withered and died. The US, Israel's guardian ally, is pre-eminent in the
region. Saddam Hussein's Iraq, only two years ago a powerful and ominous
shadow to Israel's east, has been vanquished in a war in which Israel was a
de facto ally with its greatest foe, Syria, and other Arab powers.
For the first time, Arab nations have come to the negotiating table for
peace talks constructed by the US on terms largely favourable to Israel. The
Palestine Liberation Organisation has been kept at arms length and has
accepted that any discussion of Palestinian independence be postponed for at
least three years after an interim stage of limited self-rule is agreed,
something it used to reject outright.
But rather than address these remarkable developments, the ruling Likud
party, led by 76-year-old Mr Yitzhak Shamir, has preferred to spend the
campaign maligning the opposition Labour party as a pro-Arab nest of
Bolsheviks. For its part, Labour has wallowed in the military record of its
70-year-old leader, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, chief of staff during the triumphant
Six Day War 25 years ago this month.
There have been many slogans, but precious little real discussion about the
great strategic and economic challenges facing Israel as a consequence of
the events of the past few years.
The disappearance of Soviet influence, coupled with Washington's growing
strategic interest in the Gulf, has undermined the link to the US. This was
sharply illustrated in the acrimonious breakdown early this year of Israel's
appeal for Dollars 10bn in US loan guarantees to aid the absorption of mass
immigration from the former Soviet Union, itself a consequence of Moscow's
collapse.
The prospect of diminishing access to US aid has highlighted the failure by
Israel to achieve a flourishing, independent economy to take advantage of
the demographic 'critical mass' Russian immigration offers Israel. The lack
of significant growth has led thousands of Russian Jews to suspend plans to
emigrate, a damning judgment for Israel on the relative economic outlook in
the two lands.
Above all, the peace talks launched last October in Madrid, though slow to
gain momentum, will before long require Israel to make the tough choices
about its future it has avoided since 1967. It will have to decide what to
do about the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights - to say
nothing of East Jerusalem - all captured from Jordan and Syria and most of
which the international community, including the US, expects Israel to yield
in exchange for peace.
Labour has pledged to drop Likud's commitment to hold all the territory in
perpetuity. It promises to push ahead with the peace process. But it has
avoided giving any detail about its intentions. Mr Rabin has made his
election pitch more an attempt to steal the clothes of the Likud than to
blaze a path to the future.
'If you look at the television campaigns, the slogans in the newspapers and
so on, it seems as if they are debating the past and not the present,' says
Mr Arye Na'or, a former cabinet secretary to Menachem Begin, the late Likud
premier. 'The leaders believe the nation is not ready to draw the
consequences of the changes in the world and they do not pave the way.'
Mr Na'or decries this lack of leadership. But he shares the belief that the
Israeli people are largely unmoved by the great events of the past few
years, distrusting the motive of the Arabs in coming to the peace talks.
'They continue to see the walls of the siege and they don't see the windows
of opportunity in the walls.'
But is this really so? Many Israelis clearly do perceive that the country is
at an important crossroads. Mr Na'or himself is among those who feel a great
opportunity is being presented to Israel which the government should not
fail to grasp. Opinion polls have shown consistently strong support for the
Madrid process, even among Likud supporters whose leaders remain steadfastly
opposed to the 'land for peace' formula upon which it is based.
Some younger Israelis think the problem lies not just in the unbending
ideology of Mr Shamir and the Likud, but in the continued domination of the
old generation of politicians whose thinking remains anchored in the
traumatic past of the Nazi holocaust, the battle to establish Israel in 1948
and the wars which followed.
'I am afraid that where we used to be the rational ones, and the Arabs
irrational, we have now become irrational and the Arabs rational in
assessing the situation in the Middle East,' said a prominent young Tel Aviv
businessman in private conversation recently.
It is among businessmen, especially those involved in exporting, that the
importance of taking advantage of the Madrid peace talks is often most
clearly advocated. Aside from the political benefits, they can see the
rewards from the opening of markets - closed until now - in Israel's natural
Middle Eastern hinterland and the elusive inward investment that could be
unlocked by political stability.
The economic future of Israel has probably never been more intertwined with
the political. As the US loan guarantee issue showed, the country's
longstanding reliance on foreign aid, overwhelmingly from Washington, is set
to be tied more closely to the government's policies towards the peace
process.
This has occurred just as Israel has to find the resources to cope with the
flood of immigration which has already increased the population by about
400,000 to 5m in the space of two years. So far the record is not
encouraging.
Despite a construction-induced boom last year, real industrial growth has
failed to take off, leaving overall unemployment at a record 11.5 per cent
of the workforce and more than one third of immigrants without a job.
Immi-gration has slumped, putting in jeopardy the Zionist dream of
attracting more than 1m Russian Jews to strengthen the country
demographically and drive the economy forward.
Much of the blame is put down to a lack of radical reform of the domestic
economy in which the government is still an all-powerful player. 'Nowhere in
the developed world is government still so involved in the control and
allocation of resources as in Israel,' says Mr Stephen Plaut, a business
economist at Haifa University. 'The direction of change is very slowly in
the right direction, but it is very, very slow. I think we still need a
quantum leap.'
He says without long-term growth, not only will the goal of attracting
immigration fail, but the burden of supporting Israel's large defence
commitment - almost 20 per cent of GNP - will become more difficult to
sustain. 'In Israel, if the economy is inefficient it is a strategic
problem. A lack of growth is destabilising because it tempts the other side
into seeing us as weak.'
Both the Likud and Labour are committed publicly to accelerating market
reforms. But neither has articulated any detailed economic programme during
the election campaign.
There remains the suspicion that their vested political interests in the old
system will continue to erode their commitment to reform. Labour is still
bound to the Histadrut trade union federation, the power of which depends
largely on the economic status quo, while the Likud has long exploited
government patronage to channel favours to its bedrock constituencies.
Even if the main parties finally do enact domestic reform, it may not be
enough. 'The economy of Israel is going to be handicapped until we have a
real peace process,' says Mr Aharon Dovrat, former chief of Clal Industries
and now head of his own investment house. 'We should move much more
aggressively than we have up to now.'
What are the prospects, then, for a break in the logjam on Tuesday, given
that in Israel no party ever wins an outright majority?
Labour is hoping that public support for the peace process, coupled with
frustration over Likud's ambiguous attitude towards the negotiations and its
dismal economic record, will translate into the most significant pro-Labour
swing since Likud came to power in 1977. In theory, that could lead to a
Labour-led coalition excluding the Likud which would shed its pre-election
reticence and move forward boldly to unlock the peace process.
But that remains an unlikely scenario, unless the opinion polls are
underestimating support for Labour and its small party allies. Indeed, polls
suggest Mr Shamir might be able to reconstruct his coalition of Likud,
extreme right-wing and religious parties. In that case it is hard to see how
the peace talks could advance, given the extreme right's objection even to
Palestinian autonomy.
The decisive question in the intense coalition bargaining that will start on
Wednesday will be what Mr Rabin and Mr Shamir both want. Mr Shamir is
unshakeable in his opposition to giving up territory. He is, according to
colleagues, very concerned that even conceding autonomy could lead
ultimately to that end. But he has to take into account not only the strong
support for the peace process within Likud, but also the immense, perhaps
unbearable, international pressure Israel would come under if it withdrew
from the talks.
At the same time, Mr Rabin is concerned not to expose himself to all-out
opposition from the right if he goes ahead with negotiations. He would
prefer to take the Likud with him into an interim settlement on the occupied
territories, leaving aside underlying ideological differences on the issue
of 'land for peace' until final settlement talks begin several years down
the road.
Thus many Israelis believe the next government will be a Labour-Likud
coalition of the type which was in office from 1984 until 1990. However, the
'National Unity' governments proved more a formula for paralysis than
progress, both domestically and externally. There is no guarantee it would
be any different again, despite the existence this time of a mechanism for
peace talks.

FT  22 JUN 92 / Case for Russian 'dollars'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In an article on January 20, I suggested that the use of western hard
currencies - usually known generically as 'dollars' - in the former Soviet
Union was a useful lubricating agent in restarting the market economy before
governments were able to launch a successful reform of local currencies.
Dollars, I remarked, would draw tropical fruits from the Siberian tundra.
Instead of frantic attempts to clamp down on their use for such purposes,
secondary western currencies, I concluded, should be encouraged; and the
west should even help to provide some more.
The suggestion was treated with deafening silence by the travelling army of
advisers now swarming over the former communist world. I sensed I had broken
a taboo of some sort. The silence has been broken by three economists, one
from the University of London School of Slavonic and East European Studies
and two from Kingston Polytechnic who have explained why the taboo should be
disregarded.*
The orthodox theory is straightforward. If a substitute for the local
currency - say the rouble - becomes more easily available, the desire to
hold it declines. Or to put it the other way round: the velocity of
circulation of the rouble increases. As the increase in the money supply in
such countries depends almost entirely on the government's deficit, the rate
of inflation in roubles will - other things being equal - increase, thus
making the inflation problem worse.
The fallacy of the orthodox theory is that other things are very much not
equal. The first thing that is not equal is the level of output. Although
monetarists inveigh against high inflation, they tend in their mathematics
to overlook its effect on real output.
The paper's authors remind us of some of the adverse effects of high and
variable inflation. There is enormous information loss as economic agents
become confused about how far any particular price rise represents a
relative change and how far just general inflation. Thus the price mechanism
loses its ability to co-ordinate economic decisions and the level of output
falls. The use of secondary western currencies can enable a price mechanism
of sorts to function.
But that is not all. In the absence of western secondary currencies,
commodities such as vodka or cigarettes come to be used as money; their
price relative to other goods is further distorted; and the commodities
themselves are taken out of normal circulation. If land is held as a store
of value, building may be held down as an impediment to its easy
transferability.
The authors discuss a possible compromise well known from Latin American
experience, that is to use a foreign currency as a unit of account, but to
make payments in the domestic currency at the current rate of exchange.
However, it is more convenient for all concerned to be able to use the same
currency both for making a contract and for settling it, thereby saving on
transaction costs.
Another compromise is the indexation of contracts. Although better than
nothing this too has disadvantages. For the more that prices are
automatically marked up in line with a general price index the less scope
there is for relative price changes, which again inhibits the functioning of
the price mechanism. Indeed, indexation may be more expensive in terms of
real resources. In Poland before the currency reform, hard currency
transfers, which were the source of the economy's 'dollarisation', accounted
for considerably less than 3 per cent of GNP. In Brazil, by contrast,
widespread indexation and high inflation resulted in the expansion of the
banking sector from 5 to 13 per cent of GNP in the 1980s.
There are many more subtle effects. In high inflation countries over half
the real money supply may be in hard currencies. But if dollar transactions
are illegal, they will not be taxed. Making them legal reduces the budget
deficit even in terms of the local currency.
Tolerating dollar transactions need not prevent an eventual currency reform.
It can even help credibility. For if local citizens are not forced to hold
roubles as a store of value they will be less inclined to suspect that the
government will deliberately resort to inflation as a way of taxing these
holdings.
Of course, dollarisation is not a panacea. It does not get round the big
political and institutional difficulties involved in privatisation and price
reform. Nor does it create resources out of thin air. But as it is in line
with local habits and inclinations there is a presumption in favour of it at
least as a transitional device. Indeed there may be a case for western
governments providing hard currencies not just as a stabilisation fund or
for governments to use in buying imports, but directly in loans to local
business to put into the circulation. A little unorthodoxy can go a long
way.

Today sees the start of one of those periods on television when, if you
don't like sport, you might do best to take a fortnight's holiday abroad.
There will be plenty on television wherever you go, but it seems easier to
avoid holiday. You are not going to have much difficulty in finding Today At
Wimbledon or the European Football Championship so these notes are about the
other choices.
The last in C4's Female Parts series (9.00) is written by The Guardian's

Norah, Rose, Wynne and Dorothy has anything like as many laughs as her
television column, we are all in for a treat.
The four named women are described as 'real life Golden Girls', four
Lancashire widows who swim, study French, and keep a weather eye open for
male dancing partners.
World In Action (9.30 ITV) investigates the snatching of monkeys from the
wilds of Mauritius for sale to research scientists, and Panorama (9.40 BBC1)

Ford's reputation as a recruiting ground for Britain's corporate treasurers
has been strengthened by GRAND METROPOLITAN's decision to poach Nick Rose,
treasurer, Ford of Britain, to be its new group treasurer.
The 34-year-old Rose, who joined Ford after leaving Oxford, replaces Mike
McCann who died some months ago. Although McCann joined GrandMet after a
short stint as Trafalgar House's group treasurer, he had also spent the bulk
of his career on Ford's financial side, including a stint as treasurer of
Ford's UK arm.
Rose, who will be responsible for managing GrandMet's liquidity, debt and
exchange rate exposure, reports to David Defty one of GrandMet's two deputy
finance directors. Rose says that the big difference between his old job and
his new one is that GrandMet has a lot of debt and his respon-sibilities
will cover the world, whereas at Ford, he was restricted to the UK. With
annual turnover of Pounds 8.7bn and pre-tax profits of Pounds 963m, GrandMet
is Britain's tenth biggest company.

Walsh was recruited from outside the group in 1987.
Beresford, 50, joined Smiths Industries in 1963 and by 1978 had become
managing director of its automotive group. In 1983 he moved to Lucas as
director and general manager Lucas Electronics and Systems, a joint venture
between Lucas and Smiths Industries. Two years later he joined Plessey as

FT  22 JUN 92 / People: Building up Amec construction
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Dean, joint managing director of BICC's Balfour Beatty construction
arm, has taken over as chairman of Amec's mechanical and electrical
activities in a move to strengthen the management of a part of the Amec
group which has been hard hit by the recession.
Dean, 51, replaces Mike Kersey, 50, who becomes deputy chairman. Kersey, a
veteran Mathew Hall man, joined Amec after it acquired Mathew Hall in late
1988.
Amec's mechanical and electrical businesses account for an estimated 25 per
cent of the group's profits and turnover and Dean's appointment suggests
that Amec is anxious to take a tighter grip on what is one of its toughest
businesses. Malcolm Hawe, architect of Amec's ill-timed expansion into
housebuilding, has also been replaced recently.
Kersey surprised some analysts, they noted that Amec and Balfour Beatty
share similar cultures and often work as partners on the same construction
projects. Dean has spent 18 years with Balfour Beatty including stints as
managing director of Balfour Beatty Engineering &amp; Services and chairman of
Balfour Beatty America.
Balfour Beatty itself has been undergoing a management shake-up following
the surprise departure of chief executive David Cawthra last September.
However, Dean resigned in January, and says that his decision to quit had
nothing to do with BICC's decision to look outside the group for Cawthra's
replacement. He describes his departure as 'very amicable'.
However, as part of the re-organisation, the old Balfour Beatty top
management organisation has been disbanded. Haro Bedelian has become deputy
to Peter Mason, the new chief executive hired from Norwest Holst last month,
and Ian Carroll has been put in charge of all the group's channel tunnel
power activities and made chairman of Balfour Kilpatrick. BICC says that
Dean is not being replaced.

FT  22 JUN 92 / Management: Checking up on the supervisors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bad supervision has long been a problem for UK companies. Yet improving the
performance of supervisors can cause unwanted side-effects.
One company taking part in a pilot scheme was appalled when its supervisors
began to criticise their own managers. It panicked and threw out the
government-backed researchers conducting the trials.
This was an extreme response from just one of 200 companies which took part
in mainly successful trials of the UK's first standards designed to assess
and improve the quality of supervisors.
The standards were published last week by the Management Charter Initiative,
the UK industry and government-backed body which is struggling to improve
the performance of managers. The MCI found that middle managers tended to
make the life of supervisors a misery, sabotaging them while at the same
time branding them as the Achilles' heel of UK business. The companies found
that flawed management structures and practices were often a more important
cause of poor supervision than the supervisors themselves.
Indeed, few organisations have a clear idea of what supervisors do, let
alone what they should do. This confusion is a central obstacle to effective
supervision. The problem has been made worse by radical reforms of
management structures and inadequate training.
The MCI believes its standards offer a mechanism for defining, assessing and
improving the competence of supervisors.
The UK's 1.2m supervisors are a disparate group - ranging from leaders in a
Belfast missile factory to British Rail station managers - so that not all
standards apply to all supervisors. Employers should look at the company's
objectives, identify the contribution of supervisors and then pick the
standards which apply.
The standards are made up of seven units of competence. Each describes what
is expected of a competent supervisor in particular aspects of the job. The
actual outcomes can then be measured against what is desired and differences
addressed where necessary.

FT  22 JUN 92 / Management: Better to stay in control than try to branch out
 -The pitfalls facing defence contractors seeking new markets in the civil
sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Dowty, a middle-sized defence engineering company, decided in the
mid-1980s to diversify into the civil sector, it made a classic mistake.
From its hard won position of providing command and control systems for
Royal Navy ships, it plunged into a competition for a Pounds 700m civil
aviation air traffic control system. But by 1991, it had finally lost out to
formidable rivals like IBM or Thomson-CSF, the French state-owned company.
The moral of the story, according to the National Economic Development
Council which documented the case*, is that 'it is very difficult to topple
established major players whose past performance has not been subject to
significant problems'.
This is only one of the many potential obstacles in the way of defence
contractors seeking new markets. A recent survey of defence companies by The
Technology Partnership, a consultancy, found that executives see many blocks
to diversification, including:
A lack of marketing skills in the civil sector.
Management accustomed to dealing with one customer - the Ministry of Defence
 -and unable to adapt to a more entrepreneurial environment.
Financial pressures: banks have become less prepared to lend on risky
projects and top management and shareholders compound the problem by
demanding rapid returns on investment.
Some companies can overcome these obstacles. Racal Avionics was formed in
1982 from Decca, which Racal had bought in 1980. At the time, it made
aircraft radio equipment and sold 90 per cent of output for defence
purposes.
Leo Gallagher, marketing director, says that when Racal decided to try to
find civil customers, it had two main planks to its strategy: to identify
products with the potential to be world leaders and, therefore, to compete
on technology rather than price. It found that some of its satellite
communications equipment could be fitted to civil aircraft with little
modification.
The company underwent a profound cultural change, says Gallagher. 'We had to
become absorbent to new ideas. There was a big impact on marketing and
product support.' For example, sales staff had to recognise that while
defence customers had their own maintenance crews, civil buyers did not.
But without expertise in such levels of customer service, or in marketing
outside the defence sector, Racal also needed partners. It established a
joint venture with Honeywell, the US electronics company and formed a
consortium with British Telecom and British Airways to develop
aircraft-based satellite communications.
More than 60 complete satellite communications systems have now been
delivered at a typical cost of Dollars 500,000 (Pounds 270,000) each.
On the basis of this and nine more cases, NEDC has produced a set of
guidelines for companies keen to diversify
Build on strengths. Change the product or the market but not both.
Prepare for cultural change. Relationships with customers and perceptions of
how long it takes to get a product to market are different in the civil
sector. Expertise may have to be recruited at the highest level. A dedicated
project team is one answer.
Be prepared to acquire people and skills through recruitment, acquisition or
joint ventures.
Prepare to spend. Diversification must be driven by the board; ideas from
the workforce should be sought but rigorously pruned.
If these rules look familiar, so they should. NEDC staff and defence
executives see them as applicable to any company thinking of
diversification, not just those in the defence sector.

FT  22 JUN 92 / Management: Fired with a new enthusiasm - Many arms
manufacturers have been seeking to diversify. But BAe's missile makers have
been concentrating on what they know best
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Diversification has become the siren song of arms manufacturers facing
reductions in defence spending. But at Britain's principal missile factory,
managers have closed their ears to it. They take pride in having chosen just
the opposite course.
Instead of making use of existing skills to branch out of a depressed
defence market into civilian products, British Aerospace managers are
sticking to what they know. They have reduced the range of activities at the
plant at Lostock near Bolton and are training employees in new skills to
improve performance in the core activity of guided weapons.
After a period when the future of the business was in serious doubt, the
Lostock plant is a changed place. The machinery in what used to be one of
the largest machine shops in Europe has been thinned out. The plant has been
converted wholesale to Japanese methods of assembly and inventory control,
even in specialised low-volume production lines. Round tables have been
installed for morning and afternoon performance review meetings. People who
worked as machinists can now be seen braiding tresses of electrical wires.
Concentrating on core activities was a risky gamble, since the outlook in
those activities was far from secure. Until very recently, there were
questions over all the division's big new projects.
Throughout 1990, BAe's plan was to merge the division with the guidance
systems activities of France's Thomson-CSF. But its own business prospects
appeared to get steadily bleaker and the merger plan fell through early last
year.
The British government was threatening to pull out of a multinational
project for a new long-range anti-tank weapon involving BAe as the UK
partner. The division was also being challenged over its biggest single
project: a GEC-Matra consortium was competing to supply the RAF with a new
air-to-air missile. If it won, the inevitable next step seemed to be a
takeover of BAe's missile operations by GEC.
This year its fortunes have turned, with a batch of orders worth more than
Pounds 700m. In the interim, BAe's workforce in the Dynamics division has
been cut from 16,500 to below 6,000 and the number of big sites from seven
to three. Almost all the manufacturing has been concentrated at Lostock.
The buildings date from the 1930s, a former de Havilland factory with a long
record of diversified aerospace business. In 1988, guided weapons made up
only about half the workload. 'What we'd got here was a real mish-mash of
everything,' says Tom Nicholson, operations manager of BAe's Dynamics
division.
Don Dewin, the current general manager for the site, found 'an unsuccessful
business unit that was a law unto itself'. Everything was done on-site, from
printed circuit-boards to machining nuts and bolts. 'Their standards of
success were all about technical performance,' says Nicholson. 'The concept
of competitive advantage wasn't understood.'
Employees were presented in stark terms with the problems of the business:
high costs, high work-in-progress, late deliveries, customer
dissatisfaction. 'Existing work is insufficient and the site is grossly
overloaded,' said an internal management pamphlet.
The management gave itself until the end of 1992. Although more production
has been moved to Lostock, the workforce has been almost halved to about
1,400. Demarcation lines have vanished. 'It used to be one man, one skill,
one task, one machine,' says Nicholson. 'Now one man can look after three or
four machines.'
Works convener Frank Hilton admits the lessons were hard to swallow. 'Nobody
likes change,' he says. But the need was accepted and the transformation has
taken place without industrial disputes.
The traditional hierarchy, involving between eight and 11 layers, has gone.
Between Dewin and the shopfloor there are now just three layers - head of
manufacturing, group leader and team leader. The company is moving towards a
flexible, multi-skilled workforce in which each operator is trained to
inspect the quality of his own work.
Last year, the plant began its conversion to the Kawasaki Production System,
applied by consultants Price Waterhouse under a licensing agreement with the
Japanese group. The aim is to create a logical work flow, based on
integrated teams, and to compress inventories and lead times. When
production of the RAF's new Alarm anti-radar missile began in 1989, the
manufacturing cycle was 80 weeks. It is now 30.
Kawasaki itself has extended the system - designed to ensure that components
arrive only when they are needed - from motor-cycle production to other
sectors including aerospace. In the UK, says Andy Taylor of Price
Waterhouse, 'very few companies have taken it wholeheartedly on board.' The
big challenge at Lostock, says Taylor, has been to apply the same principles
used in flowline production to 'one-offs', complex products made in small
numbers, such as the ground equipment for the new-generation Rapier 2,000
air defence system.
Confident that it now has its own manufacturing process under control, BAe
Dynamics has started programmes for working with its suppliers on similar
lines.
Nicholson recognises that the Lostock plant is still 'a long way from best
Japanese practices'. But he reckons it is one or two years ahead of BAe's
cash-rich military aircraft division, which has not yet had to face an
abyss. Says Nicholson: 'There couldn't have been a better climate to do it
in'.

BARROW &amp; Hepburn, which has manufactured ministerial dispatch boxes and
leather goods since 1780, is to move into retailing by opening a shop in
London's West End. 'It has taken us 212 years to make up our minds,' said Mr
Brian Miller, managing director.
The shop in Bury Street will sell a range of luggage, attache cases, belts
and wallets. Replicas of the famous red dispatch boxes will also be on sale,
but they will not have the royal cipher or the security lock.
The London-based company makes more than 150 boxes a year for ministers,
although output 'depends on how heavy the ministers have been with them', Mr
Miller says.
'The creation of the Ministry of National Heritage was fun. That resulted in
an order for 12 new boxes,' he added.
The company also makes boxes for judiciary and the royal family. The Queen
has purple boxes, the Queen Mother deep blue, and the Prince of Wales green.
Another company product is the sheepskin purses used by the Queen to
distribute largesse on Maunday Thursday. The design has been unchanged since
1210.
The purses are a steadily growing business because the Queen gives away as
many purses as she has years. This year the company made 264: two each for
the 66 men and 66 women who received the Queen's money.

FT  22 JUN 92 / Destabilising effects of exchange rate stabilisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO per cent inflation, says Mr Norman Lamont, is the right destination for
the UK economy. But the chancellor has also reaffirmed the government's
determination to take sterling into the ERM's narrow bands at a central rate
of DM2.95 'in due course'. Given this commitment, Mr Lamont's talk of an
independent target for inflation is largely otiose. Inflation and economic
performance will have to be what exchange rate stabilisation permits.
The priority accorded to the exchange rate is no longer new. By 1985 Mr
Nigel Lawson - inventor-in-chief of Conservative monetary doctrines - had
already abandoned his attachment to domestic broad monetarism and embraced
exchange rate targetry. He proposed joining the ERM at a rate of about
DM3.75 in the autumn of that year. Denied by Mrs Thatcher, he allowed
sterling to fall, with the price of oil, to a low of DM2.75 in early 1987.
Throughout the subsequent five and a half years, stabilisation of the
exchange rate has been the chief immediate target of monetary policy, at
first informally and then, after October 1990, through ERM membership. The
policy has been reasonably successful in its own terms: sterling fluctuated
between DM2.70 and DM3.30 prior to ERM entry, since when it has remained
close to its central rate.
Has the exchange-rate-oriented monetary policy also succeeded in either
stabilising the domestic economy or lowering inflationary expectations?
Unfortunately the answer to both parts of the question is 'no'.
The behaviour of nominal gross domestic product is the obvious test for
macroeconomic policies, since their direct effect is always on nominal, not
real, variables. But nominal domestic demand (GDP, plus imports, minus
exports) is a still better test, since macroeconomic policy influences
output via demand.
The most stable period for British macroeconomic performance under the
Conservatives was between the second half of 1982 and the first half of
1987. During that period the year-on-year increase in nominal domestic
demand varied between a low of about 7 1/2 per cent and a high of about 10
1/2 per cent. Between 1987 and 1992, by contrast, the year-on-year growth of
nominal domestic demand has varied between a peak of about 14 per cent and a
low of less than 2 per cent.
The years in which exchange rate stabilisation has been the predominant
target for monetary policy have, therefore, seen far more macroeconomic
instability than those that followed the fierce, but largely necessary,
disinflation of 1979-82.
How successful has exchange rate stabilisation been in lowering inflation?
The best measure of inflation for this purpose is not short-term
performance, influenced as it is by transient events, but rather
expectations, as measured in long-term rates of interest.
Much weight is currently being placed on the reduction in the gap between
yields on British gilts and those on German Bunds, to about 1 percentage
point. But this reflects higher German yields more than lower British ones.
For the UK, changes in inflationary expectations can best be measured by
changes in the gap between the yields on index-linked bonds and those on
conventional gilts. At around 4 1/2 per cent, this gap is only a little
smaller now than in 1987.
Naturally, economists can explain away the poor performance of exchange rate
targetry. They can blame it on the failure to enter the ERM earlier; they
can point to the costs that would have had to be borne, in any case, to
lower the still excessive inflation rates of the mid-1980s; and they can
stress the glorious future of low inflation and stable growth that lies
before the UK economy.
Yet it remains undeniable that the macroeconomic instability of the past
five years has been considerable, while inflation is still not decisively
lower than in the mid-1980s. The view that fixing sterling to the D-Mark at
DM2.95 guarantees steady economic growth and price stability remains a hope,
not a fact.

FT  22 JUN 92 / Moscow sends troops to defend Russians: Significant change
in policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN troops for the first time engaged in combat operations against the
forces of other former Soviet republics at the weekend - in one case,
against troops of a fellow member of the Commonwealth of Independent States.
These conflicts mark a decisive and not easily reversible shift in Russian
policy and may mark Russia's decision openly to defend its kith and kin
outside its own borders.
On his arrival back in Moscow yesterday morning from his trip to the US and
Canada, President Boris Yeltsin said that in the case of wars on Russian
borders 'we cannot remain idle. . . we must react to defend people and to
stop the bloodshed. We have the strength to do that.'
Two conflicts are of immediate concern. The first, to which Mr Yeltsin was
reacting, is in the self-declared Trans-Dnestrian Soviet Socialist Republic.
The territory, part of the Moldovan Republic, is bounded by the Dnestr River
to its west and the Moldovan border with Ukraine to its east. Here, most of
the population are Russian or Ukrainian: and here, for nine months, fighting
has been going on between the local forces and the Moldovan National Guard.
According to the latest reports the Moldovan forces took the town of Bendery
 -the second centre in Trans-Dnestria - on Saturday, but were repulsed later
in the day. Estimated casualties run into the hundreds, according to General
Alexander Rutskoi, the Russian Vice President.
On Saturday, as reports came in of what seemed to be a massacre by the
Moldovan forces, the Russian government went into emergency session, from
which it issued a call to all army units to return fire if attacked.
Yesterday, the defence ministry said the decision had allowed the Russian
14th army, based in Trans-Dnestria in spite of Mr Yeltsin's promise to
remove it, to defend itself. According to spokesmen in Tiraspol, the
Trans-Dnestrian capital, the 14th army and the area's National Guard are
fighting side by side.
The second conflict is in South Ossetia, a region in the north of Georgia
beset by conflict since it declared autonomy from Georgia 18 months ago. In
the past month, it has called for a union with North Ossetia, which would
mean in effect with Russia (since North Ossetia is a Russian autonomous
republic). The Russian parliament has reacted 'with sympathy' to the claim.
Over the weekend, the Georgians made what appears to have been a successful
assault on Tskinvali, the Ossetian capital, which was reported to be almost
destroyed. On Thursday, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the Georgian leader, accused
Russian helicopters of having attacked Georgian tanks - a charge which the
Russians have acknowledged, saying that they were protecting their
installations.
The relations between the Georgians and Russia have worsened suddenly in the
past week. Georgian military forces attacked a Russian tank regiment in the
town of Gori, and fire was returned. Mr Shevardnadze, the former Soviet
foreign minister, whose assumption of leadership seemed to presage a
moderation of conflict, has been forced to sound more and more anti-Russian.
In the absence of Mr Yeltsin, Gen Rutskoi - who is attracted to nationalist
themes - went on television on Saturday night looking almost like a national
leader declaring war. He said that there were hundreds of dead in both
Bendery and Tskinvali, that both Mr Mircea Snegur, the Moldovan president
and Mr Shevardnadze were guilty of the most 'cynical' deceptions, and that
'Russia will not permit a settlement of the Dnestr and South Ossetian
conflicts from the position of strength. We are going to put an end to the
massive extermination of the civilian population.'
What this means should be clear this week. Mr Yeltsin, who may wish to be
more cautious than Gen Rutskoi, must nevertheless be seen to be protecting
Russian interests, the more so after having given away so much of Russia's
nuclear arsenal.

FT  22 JUN 92 / Yeltsin pushing for special IMF treatment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin of Russia is using the acclaim he received from last
week's deal on nuclear arms cuts with the US to persuade foreign governments
to press the International Monetary Fund to treat Russia as a special case.
This would mean allowing it access to Dollars 24bn (Pounds 12.9bn) in aid
even though its economic reform programme does not observe IMF conditions.
Mr Yeltsin told reporters in Ottawa, Canada, on Saturday that he would try
to persuade the leaders of the Group of Seven industrial countries, whom he
will meet in Munich early next month, to 'throw their weight behind
persuading the IMF into opening the Dollars 24bn credit line'.
He said that because of the effects of communism and the consequent
difficulty of the transition to democracy and free markets, 'the standard
IMF project should not be applied to us to the letter'.
Mr Yeltsin's statement sets the stage for an unprecedented struggle between
the IMF, whose officials are concluding talks with government ministers in
Moscow, and the Russian government - with the G7 leaders invited to take one
side or another. The talks between the Fund and Russia are said to be going
badly, and an agreement before the G7 meeting with Mr Yeltsin in Munich on
July 8 is unlikely.
The IMF wants to apply the same criteria to Russia as it does to other
member countries. It is thus holding Russia to account for rising budget
deficits, for its decision to hold down energy prices, for the Rbs2 trillion
(million million) debt which state enterprises have accumulated and for the
non-payment of principal and interest on its more than Dollars 60bn foreign
debt.
Though Mr Yeltsin proclaimed his commitment to market reform on his trip to
the US and Canada last week, the government sends a different message in
Moscow, acknowledging it is moderating its policies in response to public
and industrial pressure.
An article in the Nezavisimaya Gazeta last Thursday, written by a senior
government adviser under a pseudonym, makes clear that the cabinet
'reformers' have made a strategic alliance with the 'industrialists', who
now have three representatives in the cabinet. The government accepts that
this will blunt the radicalism of its programme and require more subsidies
and a slower pace, but has been forced to conclude it because it needs
support from those who control production and believes they too are
interested in market reform, albeit in a more measured way.
At the same time, worsening economic indices are narrowing the government's
options. Figures published last week show a drop in exports of around 5 per
cent in the first four months of 1992, compared with the same period last
year. Grain purchases of 13.8m tonnes show a 75 per cent increase. on last
year, according to official figures.

FT  22 JUN 92 / Hungary faces tough Fund talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Monetary Fund officials flew in to Budapest yesterday for
crucial talks to bring Hungary's government finances under control.
Earlier, the Hungarian finance ministry confirmed that recession and
disappointing tax revenues would make the 1992 budget deficit overshoot
targets agreed with the IMF by a factor of nearly three.
Hungary's missing of its IMF targets sets the scene for the two sides' most
difficult negotiations since democratic elections in 1990. It also puts at
risk Hungary's reputation as eastern Europe's most sure-footed reformer.
The overrun has forced the government to put together an emergency package
of spending cuts, tightened tax collection and measures to raise revenue
from the banks. The latter are expected to include a reduction in the
interest rates paid for compulsory commercial bank deposits with the central
bank and legislation to slow banks' provisioning for bad loans. Both changes
are likely to destabilise the large state-owned commercial banks financially
just as they are coping with a wave of bankruptcies among clients and
preparing for privatisation.
Details of the package are expected soon. Even so, the finance ministry said
the 1992 deficit could not be held below Ft160bn-Ft180bn (Pounds
1.1bn-Pounds 1.23bn), far above the Ft70bn (Pounds 480m) target agreed with
the IMF.
The budget deficit is also placing the Hungarian government in an ever
tighter bind domestically.

FT  22 JUN 92 / Subtle Doctor moves into Italy's political front line:
Giuliano Amato, trying to form a government in Rome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICIANS rarely make the transition from backstage brains to frontline
responsibility. But this is the challenge now facing Professor Giuliano
Amato since he agreed last Thursday to form an Italian government.
With his glasses perched precariously on the end of his nose and his aloof
air, the 54-year-old constitutional law expert has always looked more at
home delivering academic lectures than giving speeches at Socialist party
meetings. He talks quietly and listens silently.
After being given the unusual part-time job of Albania's chief debt
negotiator last year, he shied away from publicity when most of his
colleagues would have made a meal of this exotic task. The only enemies he
has created are those envious of his formidable intellect, who feel he is
too clever by half.
Ever since Mr Bettino Craxi, the Socialist leader, drafted him to run the
prime minister's office in 1983, Prof Amato has been dubbed 'Dr Sottile'
(literally the 'Subtle Doctor', but it also refers to his 'slight' figure).
Although he subsequently held the key finance portfolio as treasury minister
from 1987 to 1989 and is the deputy leader of the Socialist party, he is
best known as the behind-the-scenes organiser, planner and thinker for Mr
Craxi, who owed much of his success as prime minister to Mr Amato's tireless
work and meticulous grasp of detail.
His experience at the Palazzo Chigi, the prime minister's office, cemented a
strong mutual respect between the two and Mr Amato has remained
extraordinarily loyal. He even accepted the unpleasant task of acting as
special commissioner to investigate corruption in the Milan branch of the
Socialist party knowing this included the affairs of Mr Craxi's son and
brother-in-law. But no one questioned either his impartiality or his respect
for Mr Craxi. And when Mr Craxi last week recognised the cards were stacked
against his own candidature, it was he who suggested Mr Amato should stand
in his place.
These links with Mr Craxi are important now for two reasons. Prof Amato
needs to show that he is not a stalking horse for Mr Craxi's thwarted
ambitions to acquire credibility. Second, he needs to insulate himself from
the possibility that Mr Craxi and the Socialist party might be further
implicated in the Milan corruption scandal, with its affect on other
judicial investigations into Italian political corruption.
On the latter point, Mr Amato should be reasonably well protected. In a
world of corrupt politics, his reputation is one of patent honesty.
Demonstrating his independence from Mr Craxi will be more complex.
Traditionally, party bosses have sought to control the prime minister and
dictate his cabinet. However, the financial plight of Italy, with rapidly
deteriorating public finances and the lira under severe pressure, combined
with the unprecedented weakness of the parties after the elections, has
changed the rules of the game. The situation requires an emergency austerity
programme, followed by electoral reform.
All the parties recognise this and accept the idea of a more 'technocratic'
cabinet. In essence, decisions are being forced upon Italy and Mr Amato has
to execute them.
To all intents and purposes, he will be forming a government of national
salvation with initially limited objectives. The fragmented nature of the
new parliament is unprecedented and obliges him to operate on the basis of
broad cross-party support. Otherwise the government will not last.
As it is, on the most optimistic scenarios, Prof Amato's task may be no more
than to carry out essential measures ahead of an early general election in,
say, 14 months.
In this situation, his curious hybrid experience as academic and politician
could prove the right mix. He began his career as a university lecturer
after a postgraduate degree at Columbia University in New York, but he was
soon acting as a legislative adviser to the Ministry of Planning. In the
late 1970s he ran the research department of CGIL, the main trades union
federation, dominated by the communists - a reflection of the strong
socialist roots he inherited from his civil servant father.
He stepped back into the administration, helping to reorganise the running
of the cabinet office before steering a commission examining state
share-holdings. He also acted as special adviser to the European Community
on regional policy before standing as a Socialist deputy in 1983 for Turin.
He was once quoted as saying: 'As treasury minister I am realising that
everyone treats the budget like a Christmas tree from which they all feel
entitled to take something.' Now, he has the unpopular task of forcibly
removing the hands from the Christmas tree - or, perhaps more appropriate,
the till.

FRENCH President Francois Mitterrand has brought forward the parliamentary
congress to complete the constitutional reforms required to ratify the
Maastricht treaty by six days to tomorrow. Agreement at the congress would
provide a boost for pro-Maastricht sentiment on the eve of the European
summit.
The congress, a joint sitting of both parliamentary houses, the National
Assembly and the Senate, needs to deliver a three-fifths majority in favour
of the necessary constitutional changes. France is to hold a referendum on
the treaty in the autumn.
President Mitterrand, who maintains that France must champion the Maastricht
cause within Europe, decided to bring the congress forward from June 29
after the National Assembly on Friday delivered a decisive vote in favour of
the proposed reform.
However, the French president's initiative may be marred by the militant
farmers, who are threatening to encircle Paris and blockade Versailles, the
venue for the congress, tomorrow as part of their protests at EC farm policy

FT  22 JUN 92 / W Europe new car sales down 4.9%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW car sales in west Europe fell by 4.9 per cent in May, the sharpest
monthly fall this year, chiefly because of an accelerating decline in new
car demand in Germany.
According to industry estimates new car sales in west Europe in May fell to
1.19m from 1.25m in the same month a year ago.
Sales last month were lower than a year ago in 10 of 17 markets across west
Europe, with declines most significantly in Germany and France.
New car sales in Germany are estimated to have fallen by 16.1 per cent last
month to 359,000. Demand remained strong in Italy, however, with a rise in
new car sales of 6.4 per cent, while sales increased by 6.2 per cent in
Spain and 1.4 per cent in the UK.
Hopes for the start of a significant recovery in demand in the UK had been
kindled by the 9.1 per cent jump in new car registrations in April, the
first monthly year-on-year increase in 30 months.
Sales were only marginally higher in May, however, and car makers are
becoming concerned that their forecasts for higher UK sales for the full
year will soon have to be reduced, if the predicted recovery remains
elusive.
In the first five months of the year total west European new car sales were
marginally lower than a year ago with a decline of 0.1 per cent to 6.221m.
Sales were lower in eight and higher in nine markets across west Europe.
The Volkswagen group of Germany, which includes Audi, SEAT and Skoda, has
established an unprecedented lead over its main rivals and captured 17.5 per
cent of west European new car sales in the first five months, with a 4.9 per
cent jump in volume.
The competitive gap has widened thanks to the decline of the Fiat group of
Italy.
Ford of the US, which was briefly European market leader in the mid-1980s,
has fallen back to fifth place and suffered a 5.5 per cent fall in sales
(excluding Jaguar) in the first five months.

FT  22 JUN 92 / US to abolish levy on defence equipment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bush administration has decided to abolish a levy on foreign sales of
defence equipment or civilian goods using technology developed by the
defence industry.
The levy, known as recoupment fees, is designed to recover some of the costs
incurred by the US government for the development and production of defence
equipment.
Originally charged only on government-to-government sales of important
defence equipment, it has been extended progressively to commercial goods
having as little as 10 per cent in common with an original defence product.
Abolishing recoupment fees is expected to help US defence manufacturers
compete in overseas arms markets, and is also intended to benefit defence
and technology industries by reducing the amount of paperwork it has to do
to enable the Pentagon to calculate the recoupment fees.
The total cost of the fees is uncertain, but the AIA calculated in 1990 that
the paperwork needed to comply with recoupment rules alone would cost
Dollars 42m (Pounds 22.7m) a year.
However the abolition of recoupment fees could also revive an argument with
the European Community over the Airbus passenger aircraft company.
While the EC agreed to limit direct subsidies to Airbus, an end to
recoupment would call into question the US's commitment to limit indirect
subsidies to aircraft makers through defence contracts.

FT  22 JUN 92 / The European Market: National barriers chipped away -
Semiconductor makers ahead of a trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE end-1992 date for completion of Europe's 'single market' is still more
than six months away. But for Europe's semi-conductor manufacturers, it has
virtually arrived already.
Motorola, the US communications and electronics group, is paving the way
towards a single European pricing system for the network of distributors
through which it sells semiconductors. It also intends to bring in common
payment terms as a way of unifying sales conditions across Europe.
'The challenge is to deal with distributors in one currency, to allow them
to respond to customers in different countries, and to make that channel to
customers more efficient,' says Mr Barry Waite, general manager of
Motorola's European semiconductor group.
'If Europe intends to have a competitive semiconductor industry, it has to
be competitive not only in design, manufacturing and technology, but also in
the way it takes things to the market,' Mr Waite adds.
Semiconductor manufacturers mostly sell their products directly to large
industrial users in such areas as telecommunications, consumer electronics
and the automotive sector. Sales through distribution intermediaries however
account for roughly 20 per cent of the Ecu10bn (Pounds 7bn) a year turnover
of the European semiconductor market.
Motorola has been bringing in single pricing step by step. It has been
gradually aligning prices for such products as integrated circuits and
memory chips over the last two years.
Apart from single pricing, Motorola plans to introduce invoicing in the
currency of the distributor's choice, including Ecus.
It is also proposing to provide Europe-wide technical and commercial
support. For example, a distributor which buys products in the UK could
still count on local technical support from Motorola if the goods were then
shipped to Germany.
These changes will bring the European distribution market more in line with
the US and Japan, where a single currency and market enable suppliers to
operate off a single price list and maintain central stocks.
Other semiconductor manufacturers agree that the trend towards a single
market is here to stay. 'It's a developing road map,' says Mr Ken Sanders,
managing director of Texas Instruments in the UK.
Texas Instruments has been working since 1988 on adapting its semiconductor
organisation to a pan-European structure. It has a common order book that
lets it move products quickly from country to country.
The shifting strategies of the semiconductor groups partly mirror the
changing face of the market for distribution. The distribution sector has
seen a flurry of activity as companies have established pan-European
capabilities. Cross-border mergers and acquisitions have created larger
distributors with activities in several European countries. For instance,
the Benelux countries have recently witnessed concentration in this sector.
This trend has been a growing necessity for distributors who had seen their
margins shaved by falling semiconductor prices. Additionally, distributors
have been squeezed by moves among suppliers to improve their servicing of
the big semiconductor users, according to Mr Jim Eastlake at Dataquest, the
high technology consultancy.
One drawback is that the economies of scale which should stem from
centralised warehousing and inventories have been slow to materialise.
If these economies are, in fact, to be realised by moves by such companies
as Motorola, this will probably intensify the trend for concentration in the
distribution sector.
The losers, then, would be the smaller distributors who stick to their local
national systems. Mr Sanders of Texas Instruments, however, believes it is
important to balance the European dimension in distribution with a strong
local element.
'Integrated European distributors will have an advantage over
non-consolidated distributors - but not over strong national champions,' he
says.

FT  22 JUN 92 / France (20): Austerity a la mode - Luxury goods trade faces
a period of discomfort
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN the heads of France's luxury goods groups gather next week in the
opulent Louis XVI rooms of the Hotel de Crillon in Paris for their annual
Creanova lunch, their mood will be somewhat subdued.
France is still the bastion of the international luxury goods industry.
Hermes scarves, Dom Perignon champagne, Chanel suits, Louis Vuitton luggage
and Guerlain scents are instantly recognisable all over the world. In the
1980s the French luxury goods houses expanded rapidly in a buoyant economic
environment. Now, they face a much more competitive climate.
For the past two years the luxury goods groups have been beset by a
significant slowdown - and changes in consumer taste - in major western
markets, notably the US and Germany. Now they face the threat of a similar
slowdown in Japan, by far their most buoyant market during the 1980s.
At the same time the industry is still adjusting to the structural changes
wrought by the influx of investment into luxury goods in the mid 1980s. The
expansion of major players - from France's LVMH, to the UK's Dunhill and
Seibu of Japan - has turned a fragmented industry of small family firms into
a more mature sector dominated by a handful of powerful holding companies.
This consolidation has aggravated the recessionary pressures on smaller
players.
So far it is difficult to assess the full impact of the industry's problems.
The situation is complicated by the Gulf War early last year, which caused
chaos in the duty free market.
The war was cited as the chief scapegoat for last year's lacklustre results.
But to some extent it camouflaged the industry's underlying problems, which
are now surfacing.
Mr Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH, struck a cautious note at a recent
shareholders' meeting when reporting on first quarter trading conditions, as
did Mr Pierre Berge, chairman of the Yves Saint Laurent fashion house.
The chief problem for the luxury goods groups is the economic slowdown in
the US which has depressed sales for at least two years. This situation has
been aggravated by the financial crisis of the US department stores, the
main outlets for designer fashion and expensive cosmetics.
The same scenario has been replicated in smaller markets, notably the UK.
But more recently the larger European markets of Germany, Italy and France
itself have slowed.
Although this downturn is chiefly due to economic pressures, it also
reflects the shift in tastes against the ostentatious values of the 1980s.
Some sectors of the industry have benefited from this, notably the older
houses such as Hermes with artisanal roots, whose products evoke the quality
and authenticity that consumers are looking for. In spite of the recession,
Hermes is selling more of its 2,000 calf leather Kelly bags - which date
back to 1935 and take 20 hours to make by hand  - than ever.
Other areas of the industry are suffering, particularly the nouveau
designers who sprang up in the 1980s and older houses without the same
heritage as Hermes. Balmain, for instance, changed hands last summer for the
third time in three years. Earlier this month Karl Lagerfeld was sold by
Revillon, a privately owned French company, to the UK's Dunhill. The whole
industry is waiting to see how Orcofi, the holding company founded by the
Vuitton family and the L'Oreal cosmetics empire, fares with Lanvin after its
relaunch this autumn.
The industry is now threatened by the prospect of a serious slowdown in
Japan, which accounts for FFr884m, or a third, of all French designer
fashion exports. Until recently Japan was one of the few markets that could
be counted on to compensate for the downturn elsewhere. Mr Arnault said
that, perfumes apart, LVMH's sales had either fallen or stagnated in Japan
during the first quarter of this year.
This situation could become more serious if Japan's economy deteriorates
further, or if the Japanese follow the same pattern as in the past by
responding to economic difficulty by increasing savings and reducing
discretionary expenditure.
Japan's instability poses another problem in that, in recent years, the
Japanese have emerged as an important source of investment for French luxury
goods houses. Martine Sitbon, one of the leading young Paris fashion
designers, was recently bought out by the Seibu group which already had an
interest in Jean-Louis Scherrer. Chantal Thomass and Jean-Paul Gaultier also
have business links with Japan. But the flow of funds from Japan could be
more limited in the future.
Meanwhile, the luxury goods industry is trying to come to terms with its own
internal changes. The expansion of French holding companies, such as LVMH
and L'Oreal, as well as of foreign players like Dunhill and Seibu, has
raised the stakes in the industry. These companies have undoubtedly made it
more complex, and much more expensive, to function in the luxury goods
sphere by initiating a new era of mainstream management techniques and
extravagant marketing.
It is these companies that have increased the cost of staging a fashion
show. LVMH and YSL may be able to afford to pay up to Dollars 25,000 for
super-models like Linda Evangelista or Christy Turlington to appear in their
catwalk shows, but the specialist fashion houses cannot. Similarly it now
costs around Dollars 50m to publicise the launch of a new perfume worldwide
which is well beyond the means of the smaller players.
This increase in costs is already taking a toll on smaller companies and
some of the most prestigious names in French luxury goods - from the
grandest of Bourdeaux chateaux to famous fashion houses - are now up for
sale. The consolidation of one of France's largest and once most lucrative
industries, aided and abetted by the recession, seems set to go on and on.

FT  22 JUN 92 / France (21): A flavour of sour grapes - The economic impact
of falling wine prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was a big bang late one night at Coursan railway station a few weeks
ago. An explosive device blew up part of the points system. The railway
between Narbonne and Beziers was out of action until the damage was
repaired.
The stranded passengers at Coursan station had become the latest casualties
of the problems of France's wine industry. The explosive had been placed by
a band of militant winegrowers protesting against the fall in prices, the
latest blow for an industry which has, for the past year, been in deep
financial difficulty. The wine trade is now struggling against a vicious
cycle of rising stocks and dwindling demand which could catalyse significant
changes in the size and structure of one of France's largest industries.
Only a few years ago the picture looked very, very different. The 1980s were
a decade of almost unalloyed success for France's wine makers. They not only
benefited from the expansion of important export markets, notably the US and
Japan, but also from three years of wonderful wines in 1988, 1989 and 1990.
The vintages of those years were high in quality, but also in quantity. This
left the market awash with fine wine when the global economic slowdown began
to bite at the end of the 1980s and demand declined.
The negociants, who buy wine from the growers and sell it on to the retail
sector, found it difficult to persuade their customers to accept the high
prices they were charging for the prime vintages of 1988 and 1989. They
found it even more difficult to sell the lowlier wines from 1987.
By the time the 1990 vintage came on the market the wine trade was in
trouble. When the wine growers uncorked their 1991 vintages earlier this
year, the situation was much worse. The negociants were still burdened by
stocks of unsold wine and they faced the additional problem of scores of
unwanted cases returning from the US, popping up in French supermarkets
sometimes still bearing their US customs labels.
The only consolation for the wine industry was that 1991 was a small
harvest, owing to the spring frosts and the long hot summer. Industry cynics
are pinning their hopes on another paltry harvest this year, which would
have the advantage of alleviating the stock problem.
However, it could create serious cashflow difficulties for some companies
which will need the proceeds of 1992 sales to fund their businesses in the
coming year.
The beneficiaries are, of course, the wine drinkers, who have been able to
buy really good wines at bargain prices for the first time in years. Some
negociants are so desperate to reduce their stocks that they have been
off-loading top wines - such as Chateau Cheval Blanc, Chateau d'Yquem and
Chateau Margaux - on to supermarkets.
Meanwhile, the industry's problems are mounting. Even the prestigious
Bordeaux region has been hit. A couple of small merchants have closed. Some
of the grandest chateaux are up for sale.
The sales and closures seem set to accelerate this year particularly if, as
the wine trade suspects, poor sales of the 1991 wines aggravate the cashflow
problems of the wine growers and their negociants.
At the same time the French industry faces increased competition from
foreign wines - from over the border in Spain and further afield in
Australasia, eastern Europe and the newly respectable South Africa. These
wines tend to be better attuned to the modern palate - being lighter and
fruitier - than the heavy, old French wines. France also has the problem
that the majority of its wines are reds, while latter-day wine drinkers tend
to prefer whites.
These competitive pressures, coupled with the general trend against
alcoholic drinks, even in France itself, where sales of high quality wines
fell last year for the first time in more than a decade, will intensify the
long-term pressure on the French wine industry. Perhaps the only positive
aspect of its present plight is that it should accelerate the process of
rationalisation required by the industry if it is to prosper in the future.
In brutal terms the industry is too big and too diffuse, being fragmented
between too many tiny companies. The way ahead is to plough up the
unprofitable acres churning out poor-quality plonk - chiefly heavily
subsidised small holders and co-operatives in the south - and for the rest
of the industry to consolidate into a smaller number of larger, more
powerful companies.
This process is already under way. A European Commission initiative to
reduce France's wine growing area by 500,000 hectares over the next five
years should mop up many of the unprofitable grape growers. Meanwhile, the
technological advances in wine production, which have already wrought
impressive improvements in quality and productivity, should strengthen the
survivors.
Similarly, the industry is already consolidating. The 1980s saw a stream of
acquisitions and amalgamations in which powerful global drinks groups, such
as Suntory of Japan and Allied-Lyons of the UK, invested in French wine.
This has already helped the industry in the present recession, given that
the new investors tend to take a longer-term view than their predecessors.
These changes are likely to spread to the industry's structure.
Traditionally it has been divided between a series of specialised businesses
 -the wine growers, or viticulteurs, and the negociants. But these
distinctions are being eroded. Some negociants are becoming involved with
wine production and some viticulteurs in sales. Chateaux Lafite, Latour and
Mouton-Rothschild in Bordeaux all already operate their own negociants to
sell some of their wines.
The consensus in the industry is that these changes will continue in the
future, so that the French are better prepared for the rigours of life in
the international wine market of the 1990s.

FT  22 JUN 92 / France (18): Momentum slackens - Nuclear energy takes
account of the Greens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SECURITY OF supply has been the core of successive French governments'
energy policy for the past 20 years and is likely to go on being so.
Short of its own oil, gas and coal, France was crippled by the first 1973
oil shock. One of the first actions of Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, on
becoming president a year later, was to launch the most ambitious nuclear
energy programme in western Europe, continued with little change over the
past 11 years by his successor, President Francois Mitterrand.
By the turn of this decade, up to 80 per cent of France's electricity was
nuclear-generated, making France the most nuclear-dependent country in the
world and the second biggest producer of nuclear electricity after the US.
Since then, the proportion has dipped slightly, to 72 per cent last year, as
some of the earliest power stations neared the end of their lives. Nuclear
energy represents 37 per cent of overall energy consumption, still the
highest of any western industrialised nation.
Over the long term, Electricite de France (EdF), the monopoly power supply,
wants to keep nuclear energy at around 75 per cent of electricity
production, partly to keep a balance with other power sources such as oil
and hydroelectricity but also because EdF's government owner needs to take
account, more than ever before, of the rising influence of France's two
ecology movements, the Verts and Generation Ecologie (GE).
The ecologists do not deny that France needs secure energy supplies, but
they do force the government to be extremely cautious over how the nuclear
programme is to develop.
The ecologists' problem, however, is that they are deeply split and they are
both unsure whether they want to make an alliance with a mainstream party,
let alone which one. Nowhere are the divisions between GE and the Verts
deeper than on energy policy.
GE, led by Mr Brice Lalonde, a former environment minister in the Socialist
government, wants a moratorium on new nuclear plant - not too far out of
line with government policy - and permanent closure of a controversial 1200
MW fast breeder reactor at Creys-Malville near Lyon.
Mr Antoine Waechter, head of the Verts, wants all nuclear plants closed
within 15 years, an idea dismissed by the government as outrageously
impractical. Mr Waechter repeatedly refuses GE overtures for a merger, on
the grounds that this would be selling out to the moderate establishment.
The government's attitude to the ecologists is being tested as it agonises
over the future of Superphenix, the fast breeder at Creys-Malville. The
reactor, the world's most powerful of its type, was closed in July 1990
after repeated safety problems and the government has said it will decide,
in the light of independent technical advice, on its future by July 3.
In spite of France's determined reliance on its own nuclear energy, it
remains even more dependent on oil than Britain or Germany, which have
bigger coal and gas resources.
This is why the government continues to keep a firm hold of the two state
owned oil companies, Elf Aquitaine and Total, in spite of its recent
privatisation programme.
At both companies, the emphasis is on increasing reserves. Total is
concentrating its sights on the Middle East for Total, where it is the
largest western oil producer, while Elf has ambitions in Kazakhstan and
Russia, where it recently become the first western oil company to sign
production sharing deals.

FT  22 JUN 92 / France (17): In the doldrums - A look at banks and insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANDRE LEVY-LANG leaned back in his leather chair. 'This is a difficult time
for all of us,' he said. 'The market is getting more and more competitive.
Last year was tough and this year is not going to be easy.'
A few weeks ago Mr Levy-Lang, chairman of Paribas, one of France's most
prestigious investment banks, showed just how difficult last year had been
when he announced that Paribas had made its first loss.
The only source of solace for Paribas' chairman is that the other big French
banks fared little better. Credit Lyonnais saw its profits fall after a
sharp rise in client-risk provisions. Banque Indosuez suffered a slide in
profits. Banque Nationale de Paris and Societe Generale both returned to
profits growth, but neither managed to return to 1989 levels.
The big French insurers were in a similar position. Axa, the largest private
sector insurer, saw its profits fall as did Union des Assurances de Paris
(UAP), the state-controlled company which is the biggest single player in
French insurance. Assurances Generales de France (AGF) and Groupe des
Assurances Nationales (GAN), the other state-controlled insurers, both
reported static profits.
The reasons for this litany of lacklustre results vary from company to
company, but the broad picture is much the same. France's big banks and
insurers have been hit by the effects of the economic slowdown on their
fledgling international operations and on their property holdings in France.
They are also still struggling to come to terms with life on lower margins
in their increasingly competitive domestic market.
Dispiriting though this scenario may seem, the performance of the French
financial groups seems positively sparkling compared with that of their
recession-struck competitors in the UK and, until recently, in the US.
With the exception of Credit Lyonnais, which is now paying the price for its
aggressive loans and expansion policy in the late 1980s, the French banking
industry is seen by analysts as strong and stable. In spite of the rapid
rise in provisions last year, charges as a proportion of total loans are
still far lower for the French banks, including Credit Lyonnais, than for
the British and American banks.
Similarly, the French banks have made impressive progress at responding to
growing competition by cutting costs and restructuring retail networks.
The French insurers are also seen as solid, well-managed companies. They
have been hit by the problems of the Paris property market and by ferocious
competition on pricing - and profitability - in the non-life sector. But the
life market is relatively healthy and seems set for further growth once the
government's private pension plans come to fruition.
Moreover, France's insurance groups have been remarkably successful at
warding off foreign competition. This may be more difficult in the future,
particularly if the French market follows the pattern set in the UK, by
moving away from the old system whereby insurers sell through networks of
exclusive agents, to direct sales, which may make it easier for new players.
Both the banking and insurance industries face the prospect of fierce
competition. The banks, for instance, are as concerned about the expansion
plans of the French post office as by the threat of foreign competition.
However, the past performance of banks and insurers at containing costs and
re-orienting their operations suggests they are in reasonable shape to face
their new competitors.
These developments come at a time of broader changes in the role of France's
financial institutions, specifically of their relationship with the state.
Traditionally, the big banks and insurers have played a pivotal part in the
French government's involvement in industry, directly as state-controlled
institutions in their own right, and indirectly through the influence they
exert as important investors in other companies.
Times are changing. The days when the public sector banks, BNP and Credit
Lyonnais, were at the beck and call of the French government are over. The
marked difference between the measured policies adopted by BNP and Credit
Lyonnais' aggressive expansion is testimony to the degree of autonomy they
enjoy. From time to time both banks still take on large portions of other
state-controlled companies. But BNP is believed to have argued for - and won
 -more favourable terms from the government for its acquisition of a tranche
of Air France shares last summer.
This new, more distant relationship is influenced as much by the commercial
constraints of operating in the modern banking industry - where BNP and
Credit Lyonnais have to comply with international capital standards, whether
or not it suits their largest shareholder - as by changes in government
thinking.
The relationship may become even more distant in the future, particularly if
BNP and Credit Lyonnais follow Societe Generale by going into the private
sector or if, like the insurance companies, they become part of the
government's partial privatisation programme.
President Mitterrand's announcement last summer that the government would
sell off minority stakes in state-controlled companies in a series of
partial privatisations, heralded a new phase of French industrial policy.
The insurers - UAP, AGF and GAN - were named among the first candidates for
partial privatisation. It is still not clear what form the share sales will
take and whether the insurers themselves will be able to raise capital for
their own use, but the government has already tabled legislation to allow it
to reduce its holding to 51 per cent.

FT  22 JUN 92 / France (19): Urban danger signals - Trouble brews in the
high-rise jungles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNIFER MONAHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN riots broke out in Los Angeles this spring, President Mitterrand
immediately laid the blame on America's lack of social legislation; such a
thing could not happen in France, he implied in a French radio interview.
Some people felt his remarks were tempting fate.
Five years ago, the word 'ghetto' was used in France to describe an
Anglo-Saxon problem; now it is everyday currency in the discussion of
France's own problem, in deprived dormitory suburbs which combine poverty,
crime and intense concentrations of ethnic minorities.
The past two years have seen sporadic violent outbursts in big estates in
the Lyon and Ile de France regions. Many more incidents have occurred than
are generally reported, from Amiens in the north to Avignon in the south.
Gangs of youngsters, who steal from cars and supermarkets, have been growing
younger, with an increasing number aged under 13, when they cannot in law be
charged. Crime figures for 1991 show an overall increase of 7 per cent, with
the highest jump in the ill-favoured suburbs. Seine-Saint-Denis, for
instance, suffered a rise of over 18 per cent. In the March regional
elections, it was high-crime communes, where a sense of insecurity is most
acute, that gave the National Front most votes.
These developments are not new. But economic and social exclusion has become
more acute with renewed high unemployment - nationally now 10 per cent, far
higher in the poorer suburbs.
Political attention was first focused on the social consequences of mass
urbanisation in the early 1980s, when violent incidents erupted in the
outskirts of Lyon. Since then, governments have made repeated attempts to
get to grips with the urban problem, notably through the Developpement
Social des Quartiers (DSQ), with its emphasis on multi-agency co-operation,
backed by public funds.
At first, it appeared that these social policies might be winning - until
the riots which broke out in 1990, again in a suburb of Lyon. Events since
1990 have generated an accelerating sense of urgency, and pushed urban
issues nearer the top of the government agenda.
One result of so much attention has been a proliferation of policy
initiative, each offering state assistance to encourage local communities or
urban agglomerations to solve their own problems; a Minister of Urban
Development was appointed to give these policies coherence, as well as to
demonstrate political commitment.
The first Urban Minister, Michel Delebarre, mayor of Dunkirk, secured a 33
per cent increase in Treasury funds devoted to urban renewal. But he
suffered a serious setback in March, when he lost his power-base as
president of the Pas-de-Calais region and he was moved sideways to another
ministry. Even more damaging politically was the forced resignation in May
of his successor, Mr Bernard Tapie, the Marseille industrialist and football
chairman, because of imminent charges for embezzlement.
Only days before, Mr Tapie had announced a sweeping new programme, to
demolish and replace some of the most desolate concrete architecture,
mobilise large private enterprises in the development of the troubled
suburbs, and persuade local residents to help supervise and support the
young. Not all commentators were convinced that such measures would meet the
long-term needs of the most disadvantaged - for education, training, jobs,
affordable housing and adequate public transport.
The new Minister for Towns is Mr Francois Loncle, a former journalist and
close political associate of the prime minister, Pierre Beregovoy.
Mr Tapie's programme was the centre-piece in a wide government offensive,
timed to precede the long summer school vacation. But other measures will go
ahead, including programmes to provide sports and other activities for young
people who cannot go away on holiday, as well as workshops and local
building projects.
This wider government initiative is centred on urban security. More police
are being allocated to the priority estates, many of which have a population
the size of a middling town, but no local police-station.
Critics point out that law and order are being given higher priority, in
view of the national assembly elections next spring. Opinion surveys suggest
people in the worst-off estates are fed up with the constant threat of
crime.
Thirty years ago, France had to build cheap housing fast. The result was a
proliferation of vast concrete estates which are now widely recognised as
intolerable to live in. In the past decade, demolition and renovation of
these estates has cost FFr60bn. This year's over-all budget devoted to urban
renewal and security is more than FFr6.2bn. These are France's ghettos, and
today France is picking up the tab.

FT  22 JUN 92 / France (13): The business elite is alive and well - School
ties and other links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GIANNI Agnelli, chairman of Fiat, patriarch of the Agnelli dynasty, may
be one of the most powerful men in Italy, but this year he learnt exactly
how much - or how little - power he had in France.
In the late 1980s the Agnellis had peacefully and profitably expanded their
interests on the other side of the Alps, by using their social contacts to
smooth their path in to France. Everything went well until last autumn when
the Italians felt confident to do a French deal on their own.
Mistake. The Agnellis' attempt to take over Exor, the company that controls
Perrier, the famous French mineral water, by doing a private deal with their
old friends, the Mentzelopoulos family, dragged them into a fierce fight
with their old French allies - Mr Antoine Riboud, chairman of the BSN food
group, and Mr Michel David-Weill, senior partner of Lazard Freres bank -
which ended in an embarrassing defeat for the Italians.
Mr Agnelli's error was to underestimate the power of the French financial
establishment - the labyrinthine network of influential bankers,
bureaucrats, industrialists and financiers who occupy the most powerful
positions in France's largest financial and industrial groups.
One of the sharpest lessons of the Perrier affaire, to the Agnellis and to
everyone else, was the extent to which the establishment still dominates
corporate France. Why is it that a small group of people - mostly from the
same narrow background of elite Paris lycees, the Grandes Ecoles and the
finance ministry - still wield so much power?
One reason is the tradition of family ownership in large French firms. Some
of the most powerful figures in French business - Mr Francois Michelin, Mr
Serge Dassault and Mr Martin Bouygues as well as Mr David-Weill - inherited
their positions and often controlling holdings in their companies.
These family interests are, in turn, reinforced by the complex web of
holdings and cross-holdings that characterises France's corporate sector,
together with the intricate system of voting and non-voting shares. As a
result many of France's largest companies are virtually bid-proof, thanks to
their blocking stakes. This offers considerable stability to those at the
top.
Another reason is the power of the state. So many large financial and
industrial groups are state-controlled that the links between French
business and politics are far closer than in most other capitalist
countries.
This closeness is accentuated because the government of the day chooses the
presidents of all state companies. Many chairmen of the big banks, insurers
and industrial groups - such as Mr Jean Peyrelevade of Union des Assurance
de Paris, Mr Gerard Worms of Suez and Mr Jean-Yves Haberer of Credit
Lyonnais - worked in ministerial offices earlier in their careers.
As a result, as Mr Agnelli discovered to his cost, the members of the French
establishment are not only well-entrenched, but well known to each other and
extremely efficient at closing their ranks to repel outsiders.

even in the back-biting world of French finance - with a bad word to say
about Michel David-Weill.
In many ways he is the epitome of the cosmopolitan corporate financier -
charming, courteous, cucumber-cool and armed with a barrage of amusing
anecdotes. It is these social skills, as much as his business brains, that
have turned Mr David-Weill, senior partner in Lazard Freres bank, into a
pivotal figure in French corporate life.
When another corporate skirmish, between two of his closest contacts - Mr
Gianni Agnelli of Fiat in Italy and Mr Antoine Riboud of France's BSN -
broke out this summer, it was Mr David-Weill who smoothed out a settlement
between the feuding factions.
Under Mr David-Weill, who as one of Concorde's best customers divides his
time between Paris, London and New York, Lazard has made its mark as one of
the world's most powerful merchant banks. It has been involved in most of
the major bids of the 1980s and early 1990s, but it has done so discreetly.
Lazard Freres is, after all, a bank that does not even have a name plate
outside its Paris head quarters on Boulevard Haussmann. A. R.

FT  22 JUN 92 / France (16): A pension for every citizen - The hottest
political issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF you mention the words pension reform to a French financier, the response
is almost certain to be one of unalloyed glee. Say the same words to Tresor
officials and they are likely to reply with a sigh.
The apparently arcane subject of pensions is one of the hottest topics in
French politics. The extreme left apart, everyone seems to agree that the
existing system must be reformed. The problem is that noone seems to know
how to reform it.
The present pension system is a product of post-war France. Almost all
pensions are provided by the state, with the exception of the tiny number of
senior executives who belong to fonds salariaux company pension schemes.
The system is administered by the Caisse de Retraite, a government body that
acts as a cash manager by paying for pensions with money received from those
in employment. This system worked well in the 1950s and 1960s, when France
had a young workforce and proportionally fewer pensioners.
But in the 1980s, as the population aged and the number of young employees
diminished, the system has come under pressure. This problem will worsen in
the future as these demographic trends accelerate until the 'crunch year' of
2020 when there will be more people of pensionable age than there will be
working to pay for their pensions.
Private pensions look like the solution. Earlier this year Mr Pierre
Beregovoy, then finance minister and now prime minister, confirmed that the
government was committed to expanding private pensions to relieve the
strains on the state system. He has since sanctioned a series of small
reforms notably the announcement in March of plans for a new tax-efficient
personal equity plan.
Mr Beregovoy is believed to favour more ambitious changes including the
eventual introduction of corporate pension funds. So far he has been
thwarted by the opposition of the trade unions - which maintain that
pensions should be the state's responsibility - and by the sheer complexity
of reform. One of the trickiest problems for the Tresor is persuading the
electorate that they should shell out extra money for their own private
pensions at the same time as they continue to pay for today's pensioners.
Mr Beregovoy has not yet found a solution. The consensus is that he will
wait until after next year's National Assembly elections when he - or his
successor - will feel more confident about tackling the trade unions and
about tabling potentially unpopular legislation.
The French financial community can hardly wait. After all, the new breed of
private pension funds will not only provide a lucrative new market for
France's banking, broking and insurance industries but also a sorely needed
source of investment for the stock market. Mr Jean Peyrelevade, chairman of
Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP) and one of France's most powerful
financiers, summed it up with: 'Pension reform is quite simply the single
most important issue on our agenda'.

FT  22 JUN 92 / France (15): Exports revival - Manufacturers sense a
breakthrough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THANKS TO A long period of wage restraint, cost reductions, low inflation
and general economic stability, French companies are suddenly finding
themselves internationally competitive.
Manufacturing industry has led a steady rise in French exports to its
European neighbours since the turn of the year, the main reason behind a
sharp improvement in the country's trade position. France recorded a trade
surplus in each month of the first quarter for the first time in 20 years,
with a record positive balance of FFr7.79bn in May.
'French companies have made a strong increase in exports not thanks to the
growth of the world economy . . . but because they are more competitive than
their competitors. And that is very new. We are producing better and cheaper
than elsewhere,' said a delighted Mr Michel Sapin, finance minister.
This sudden improvement comes after what has been a hard year for the
corporate sector. While the economic downturn hit France later and less hard
than some other countries, including Britain and the US, it did depress
company profits in many sectors in 1990 and 1991. Last year, only four out
of the top 10 companies recorded or are expected to report a profits rise:
Renault, Alcatel Alsthom, Total and Rhone Poulenc. Of the rest, two lost
money and four made reduced profits.
According to a study by Credit National, the state-owned bank, the top 50
groups cut their investments by 6.7 per cent last year. This is despite
repeated urging from the government to gear up for a recovery, a plea which
businesses say they would love to answer if only the government would reduce
interest rates.
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, would like to give them what they
want, but his failure last autumn to sustain a rate cut independently of the
Bundesbank for more than a month underlines just how much French monetary
policy still follows Germany's.
Like their international competitors, French businesses have in any case
been been more interested in cutting costs than investing in new capacity
during the downturn. Last year, France's top 50 companies made a 2.8 per
cent average reduction in their workforces, the biggest cut for many years,
with the heaviest losses coming from Usinor Sacilor in steel, the Air France
airline, Renault and Peugeot in cars, Michelin in tyres, and Bull and
Thomson in electronics.
Credit National thinks investments by the top 50 will continue to fall this
year, by around 3.8 per cent, but that cash flow will recover sharply, from
a 1.8 per cent decline in 1991, to an 8 per cent rise in the current year.
Credit National incidentally backs up Mr Sapin's optimism on the
international competitiveness of French business with another survey,
showing that the largest French companies' net profit margins have been
higher than their German counterparts, their biggest competitors and trading
partners, for the past five years. Staff costs could be part of the answer,
21 per cent of turnover in France as against 28 per cent in Germany.
However, French companies are still undercapitalised by comparison with
German ones in that they continue to pay heavy debt charges while their
German equivalents are rolling in cash, on which they receive a steady
income. On average, the top French companies' debt gearing stands at 70 per
cent of shareholders' funds, while German gearing is only 25 per cent, says
the Credit National study, carried out with its German partner,
Industriekreditbank. One factor in the high gearing of some of the largest
French companies is the heavy borrowing they took on to finance a series of
overseas acquisitions in recent years, in a belated internationalisation
strategy, which now leaves France's largest companies with on average nearly
60 per cent of their sales abroad.
Some of these takeovers, however, took place right at the peak of the
previous upturn, just before the recession hit. Michelin's acquisition of
Uniroyal Goodrich, the US tyre maker, and Saint Gobain's acquisition of
Norton, the US abrasives group, are examples.
It is no surprise that the pace of overseas acquisitions by the biggest
companies has fallen off sharply since those big purchases in 1990, so that
the value of foreign takeovers by the top 50 fell by 24 per cent to FFr80bn
last year, putting an end to four straight years of growth. The big bidders
were too busy digesting their acquisitions to think about expanding again
for the moment.
All the same, there were some spectacular deals last year. These include the
FFr12.8bn purchase by Schneider, the electrical equipment group, of Square
D, its US competitor, one of the few successful hostile French bids in the
US.
Last year also saw the Pounds 300m acquisition of US oil group Amoco's UK
petrol station and refining interest by Elf Aquitaine; the FFr3.8bn
acquisition of the transmission equipment division of Rockwell International
by Alcatel Alsthom, the telecommunications and engineering group; and hotel
operator Accor's FFr2.2bn bid for Wagons Lits, the Franco-Belgian travel
group.
Equally, France has been on the receiving end of some big acquisitions in
the past 12 months, helped by the relaxation of most controls on foreign
investment and a testament to the liberal mood of the Socialist regime.
Revealingly, nobody in the the government lifted a finger to find a French
solution to the FFr15.46bn takeover battle between two foreign companies for
Perrier, the mineral water group, once seen as a sacrosanct part of
corporate France. In the end, Nestle, the Swiss food multinational, fought
Italy's Agnelli family through the courts to win with a FFr15.46bn offer.
Such an open and highly publicised bid battle would have been unlikely only
a few years ago.
Daimler Benz, the German cars and aerospace group, was last year given a
free hand to take a large minority stake in Sogeti, the holding company
which controls Cap Gemini Sogeti, Europe's largest computer services group
and one of France's best known post war industrial successes, with an option
to take full control. Similarly, the Japanese car group Nissan was given
clearance to take control of its French distributor, after having met
official resistance up for the past decade.
In general, all this points to a good climate for the corporate sector. The
arrival of the economically liberal Mr Beregovoy as prime minister in April
has probably helped, though Mrs Edith Cresson, his interventionist
predecessor, was not nearly as bad for business has her critics make out.
It was, after all, Mrs Cresson who launched fresh incentives for small
businesses and agreed to reduce corporation tax again to a flat 34 per cent
last year. The cut continued a trend started by the Gaullists in 1986 and
leaves France with one of the lowest corporation tax rates in Europe.

FT  22 JUN 92 / France (12): A fading reputation - Motorway Planning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOTORWAYS are one of the few areas where France's reputation for highly
organised long term infrastructure planning is coming unstuck.
France is currently agonising over the future of its motorway system on two
fronts. First, the success of the two environmental parties in last March's
regional election has suddenly placed a question mark over several new
motorway projects.
Second, Mr Jean-Louis Bianco, the transport minister, has called for a
review of the system of financing motorways, in the wake of a critical
report by the Cour des Comptes, the state financial watchdog. The report
maintains that at least a third of the national network is not properly
maintained and that too much investment goes to big inter-city routes at the
expense of regional roads.
One of the Verts' achievements in the regional elections was to gain the
presidency of a regional council for the first time, when Mrs
Marie-Christine Blandin, a school teacher, took control of the former
Socialist fiefdom, Nord-Pas-de-Calais. One of her first steps, to the fury
of her predecessor, has been to freeze two motorway schemes, raising fears
over what the greens might do to motorway plans in other regions where they
are influential, such as Alsace, Haute-Normandie, Ile-de-France and
Rhone-Alpes.
Separately, the Cour des Comptes report raised the spectre of a 'two-speed'
France, with the fast lane provided by semi-private toll charging motorway
operators, and the slow lane being the roads financed directly by
cash-strapped central and local government.
The central state budget's share of road investment has slipped from nearly
100 per cent in the early 1950s to a mere 27.5 per cent now, with the rest
coming separately from the toll road operators, with 43.7 per cent, and
local authorities, with 28.8 per cent. Funding for national routes is too
often left to local authorities, which as a result cut back spending on
regional roads, says the report.
It finds the system of private operators inefficient, in that 10 per cent of
tolls goes on the costs of collection. Moreover, the toll motorway system is
up to 30 per cent more expensive than a simple two-lane trunk road, given
that the law obliges the government to provide a toll-free road in parallel
to every toll-charging motorway.
The private operators borrow under a state guarantee and gather tolls, under
renewable government concessions, to repay construction costs. Until the
early 1980s they were independent, when the state stepped in after after a
decrease in road traffic caused most of them serious financial problems.
Only one, Cofiroute, has remained independent.
The government usually extends an operators' concession when it agrees to
build a new motorway, so that it can pay for the work. This means operators
are happy to go on expanding the existing system so long as they can go on
collecting tolls from existing motorways, in contrast with the government's
original plan that tolls on a given route should only last until the
investment, plus profit on that motorway, had been collected. In an earlier
report, the Cour des Comptes condemned the system for being managed and
developed without any logic.

FT  22 JUN 92 / France (10): Challengers in the fast lane - Car giants aim
to narrow the gap with Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH car industry is emerging from recession stronger and more
competitive than before.
It still has some way to go before it can match Japanese levels of
productivity, the ultimate target in the minds of the managements of both
Peugeot and state-owned Renault. Yet the strides they have made are
enormous.
A decade ago, Peugeot and state-owned Renault were on the brink of
bankruptcy. Now they are in relatively good health, in spite of having
suffered a two-year decline in their main European markets.
Last year, for example, Peugeot maintains it produced the highest net
margins of any car maker in the world, even after having suffered a 40 per
cent decline in net earnings. Mr Jacques Calvet, the group's chairman,
reckons the market will pick up this year. Renault, once one of the public
sector's heaviest loss makers, reported well over doubled net profits last
year, and is proceeding so successfully with its alliance with Volvo that
both partners talk of a possible merger.
Like their international competitors, French car makers have had to make
heavy workforce reductions, down by 25 per cent over the past five years at
Renault and down by 5 per cent over the same period at Peugeot, which was
less overmanned than its public sector rival. Much more is to come,
according to a recent study by the planning commission, which estimates that
the French car industry must trim its workforce by another 2.5 per cent
annually until the end of the decade to become fully competitive.
Peugeot and Renault have also overhauled factory organisation, introduced
just-in-time-stock control, Japanese-style production teams, reorganised
their design departments, and - more at Renault than Peugeot - modernised
their product ranges.
Peugeot reckons to have improved the number of cars made per man by 50 per
cent over the past five years, while Renault says it has improved its
productivity by 6 per cent to 7 per cent per year over the same period. Both
aim at least to repeat that improvement by the end of the decade.
This leaves French car industry's productivity just 10 per cent behind that
of Japanese car producers in Britain, itself 10 per cent behind the Japanese
in Japan, according to a study by consultants McKinsey for the European
Commission.
French car production has also become more efficient. The average Renault
plant is now fully operational 70 per cent of the time, while Peugeot
Renault even manages 75 per cent; a big improvement over recent years, but
still behind the 85 per cent in Japan.
Of course, getting this far has not been easy, and there are still handicaps
to be overcome.
For example, Renault and Peugeot both invested heavily in automated
production lines in the mid-1980s. Yet they have since had to retreat
slightly, re-introducing more labour and simpler machines to the shopfloor,
because the robots proved complicated to maintain and sometimes unreliable.
Tighter stock control has saved financial charges for both of them. Yet the
extent to which just-in-time stock control depends on Japanese style labour
stability was sharply underlined by a strike at Renault's main engine and
gearbox plant, which took just 10 days to bring the group's entire French
and Belgian car production to a halt.
The other big shortcoming they have yet to tackle is an ageing and
relatively untrained workforce. The average age of workers at one of
Renault's main plants at Flins, near Paris, is 45 as against 28 at Nissan
UK, according to the planning commission study. In 1989, nearly half of
French the car industry's workforce had no professional diploma. Renault is
accordingly pushing for European Community and government aid for
retraining.
There has, however, been measurable progress in several areas.
Quality control. Peugeot has abandoned the old style of quality control,
whereby faults are identified and corrected in an enormous car park at the
end of the production line. Now the lines are divided into sections, each
managed by an autonomous team, which is responsible for correcting its own
faults as the unfinished car passes through.
As a result, Peugeot has over the past five years closed all its refinishing
shops. Renault is moving over to the same system and aims to close all its
refinishing departments within four years.
Components. Renault and Peugeot are getting less integrated and becoming
primarily designers and assemblers. This is another way of cutting costs to
the bone, but also reflects the fact that neither wants to become involved
in the increasing electronic and specialised componentry found in modern
cars, such as anti-lock brakes or catalytic converters. This leaves their
hands free to concentrate on key mechanical components such as automatic
gearboxes, where the pair are considering joint production.
Accordingly, the proportion of bought-in components has risen steeply in
recent years to just over 60 per cent of operating total costs at Peugeot
and 67 per cent at Renault. They have both been selling some of their
component businesses or seeking export partners, as in Renault's disposal of
a stake in its steering systems subsidiary to a power steering offshoot of
Toyota. Renault has now told its component buyers to put in house and
external suppliers on exactly the same footing when deciding where to buy.
If they have become more dependent on outside component producers, France's
car makers have also been applying more pressure to keep suppliers up to the
mark. Peugeot and Renault have for the past five years been running joint
audits on component suppliers' quality, grading them according to ability to
do their own quality control and at the same time reducing the number of
suppliers with which they do business directly.
They are thinking of extending this system to cover suppliers' productivity
and costs too. Meanwhile, Renault says it has achieved substantial costs
savings by pooling much of its component buying activities with Volvo.
Design management. Another part of the race to catch up with Japan is the
time and investment taken to design and launch new cars. Here, Peugeot
estimates that the Japanese still have a substantial advance, capable of
launching a new model for around FFr3-4bn in three years, as against the
French average of FFr6bn to FFr8bn in four to five years. These comparisons
are, of course, rough since there is no standard measure for the starting
point of a new design.
Nevertheless, Renault and Peugeot reckon they are catching up. Both
companies have in the past three years started setting up project teams, so
that all departments involved in a new car launch work together
simultaneously. Formerly, new cars were designed by a production line-type
organisation, with the blueprint passing from the design department through
engineering and production management. The time taken to design and launch
Renault's soon to be unveiled small car, code-named the X06, was in line
with Japanese experience, says Mr Philippe Gras, deputy chief executive. On
average, Renault aims to produce a new model in just under four years, down
from the previous norm of nearly five years.
Peugeot last year placed the design teams of its two sister companies under
a single management to help them work faster and expects to produce the
first concrete results from 1994.
The French car industry's progress invites the question of whether Peugeot's
continued calls for protection against Japanese competition - not,
incidentally, echoed by Renault - should be taken seriously. Last summer's
EC-Japan car import agreement allows the Community to set controls on
Japanese car sales until the end of the decade - so what can there be to
fear?
Peugeot's answer is clear. Japanese cars should not be allowed free access
to the EC until Tokyo allows the Europeans the same market share in Japan as
the Japanese have in Europe. As Mr Calvet argued in a recent article in the
FT, the deal was an example of how Europe has 'unilaterally disarmed without
anything in exchange'. The next few years will show whether Mr Calvet and
his colleagues can create the weapons to fight back.

FT  22 JUN 92 / France (11): Jacques Calvet of Peugeot
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JACQUES Calvet, the combative chairman of Peugeot, created quite an
impact three weeks ago when he announced that he planned to run for French
president in 1995.
The timing was impeccable. Mr Calvet, a right-wing opponent of European
federalism, announced his ambitions just a few days before the Danish vote
against European federalism.
Mr Calvet's stock in trade is to argue for a strong Europe able to defend
its member states' interests, to attack the European Commission, and to warn
of unfair Japanese trade practices.
An outstanding member of the business elite, Mr Calvet, 61, started his
career as senior adviser to former president Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing,
when the latter was finance minister from 1970 to 1974. He moved on to
Banque Nationale de Paris, the leading state-owned bank, becoming chairman
before being kicked out by the Socialists in 1981.
Mr Calvet joined Peugeot a year later, at the invitation of its family
shareholders, and instituted a tough programme of cost cutting. As a result,
Peugeot last year published the best net margins in the world car industry.

FT  22 JUN 92 / France (7): Revising the borders - Industrial policy in the
melting pot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVER the past decade, President Francois Mitterrand has drawn back many of
the frontiers of state industry to allow free market forces a controlled
entry into this previously protected domain.
The secret of understanding French industry policy is to know where those
boundaries lie at a given moment - and it is not easy.
'There are no absolute rules to determine what is a strategic industry . . .
It is true that what is strategic or not, or what requires intervention or
not, does evolve,' said Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, industry minister, in a
recent interview.
Cars, papermaking and machine tools were, for example, among the sectors
thought strategically vital in the mid 1980s. Now the Paris government feels
those businesses should compete without its help and focuses its industrial
interest instead on electronics, semiconductors, biotechnology and the
environment. The state's business, says Mr Strauss-Kahn, is to lend a
helping hand in projects in such strategic sectors, too long-term for
private business to handle alone.
Defence equipment and vital supplies, such as oil, are also treated as
strategic and therefore subject to state control, though here the government
is loosening its grip slightly. By contrast, it is increasing control over
air transport, through Air France's takeover in 1990 of UTA, a private
airline.
To the opposition, all this looks like a complete muddle. Mr Jacques Chirac,
leader of the Gaullist party, recently complained of 'the confusion of
government policy on privatisation, which wavers constantly between
recognising the freedom of companies and maintaining the control of the
state'.
Yet there is clear evidence that the government is allowing the public
sector more freedom. It is, for example, increasingly leaving the big
decisions in state industry to professional managers and allowing them to
strike alliances with private foreign partners.
True, there was a quick swerve towards interventionism during the 11-month
government of Mrs Edith Cresson, the former prime minister, who resigned in
April. This made a lot of noise, but little practical impact. Her successor,
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, has taken a more hands-off approach, balanced by Mr
Strauss-Kahn's vigilant attention to the need to keep up to the mark in
strategic sectors.
Examples of these new freedoms are the ground-breaking alliance between
Renault, once a sacred symbol of French state industry, and Volvo, the
Swedish car maker; the stakes taken in Bull, the state-owned computer group,
by NEC of Japan and IBM of the US; and the share swap being negotiated
between Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) and Dresdner Bank of Germany.
The government is also showing that it does not want to disrupt proven
professional management in the public sector in the way in which it is now
settling down to review the 45 top jobs in state industry, whose three-year
mandates come to an end in the next few months. Mr Beregovoy plans to make
as few changes as possible.
Until last spring, the tone of French industry policy was set by Mr
Mitterrand's 1988 election pledge that there should be neither
privatisations nor nationalisations, known as the 'ni ni' policy. The aim
was to induce stability after the merry-go-round of nationalisations of the
first Socialist government and the privatisations under the 1986-1988
Gaullist regime.
In the event, the state-sector's demand for fresh capital proved so strong
that the 'ni ni' rule became unworkable. This was recognised officially when
the Renault-Volvo alliance was given the go-ahead in early 1990, allowing
Volvo to take a 20 per cent stake in Renault and to contribute to a capital
increase.
In May last year, the government finally buried 'ni ni' by issuing a decree
allowing private companies to take minority stakes in French
state-controlled businesses, so long as they contributed fresh capital and
entered into a an industrial, commercial or financial co-operation accord.
That freedom was later extended to the state insurers, which had been left
out of the decree because they were governed by their own separate law.
Last September, Mr Mitterrand gave his personal seal to the end of his old
policy, by telling the nation that he now supported partial privatisations
so long as the cash from share sales was used to fund industrial investments
or jobs.
Mr Beregovoy's arrival gave fresh impetus to all this, as well as marking a
practical step back from interventionism. One of his first actions was to
tone down an ambitious plan to restructure the electronics industry, hatched
by Mrs Cresson's government, in which the Thomson Consumer Electronics (TCE)
audio and video equipment group was to merge with the industrial arm of the
CEA atomic energy authority. It now looks as if CEA-Industrie will simply
take a minority stake in TCE.
The Gaullists, however, complain that Mr Beregovoy's move to a more liberal
industry policy is very slight. The real reason for his privatisations is to
raise cash for the government rather than to give state industry more
freedom, they complain.
The government fully accepts that most of the partial privatisations so far,
except for Renault, have been to raise money to fund the campaign against
unemployment, its top priority in domestic politics, rather than to raise
investment funds for the companies. Ironically, the Socialists also gave job
protection as one of the reasons for their nationalisation programme in the
early 1980s.
Officials say the state hopes to raise FFr15bn to FFr20bn this year. It
looks as if they will meet that target easily. To date, the government has
pulled in FFr2bn from last November's flotation of Credit Local de France, a
local authority bank, and FFr2bn from the sale of a small stake in Elf
Aquitaine in March. Up to FFr3bn is to come from the sale of a stake in
Caisse Nationale de Prevoyance, a life insurer, and another FFr8bn to
FFr10bn is expected to come from the sale of a large stake in Total, the oil
group.
The Total case is especially interesting, since the government is planning
to reduce the public sector's stake from 34 per cent to 15 per cent, and the
state's direct voting rights to a mere 5 per cent. This is a much greater
relaxation of control than most people had believed possible in a sensitive
sector such as oil, though the government is to keep the crucial rights to
nominate the chairman and to vet Total's international agreements.
It is wrong to suggest that state-owned companies have been completely
deprived of fresh investment, even if they do continue to be
undercapitalised by comparison with privately-owned foreign competitors. The
state has bailed out the neediest cases, such as Bull, Thomson and Air
France, from its own budget.
Its ability to do more has been limited by the European Commission's
rigorous application of EC rules against state aid, as well as by the
government's own budget deficit. So ways have been found to fund state
companies without having to dip directly into the public purse, by using
state owned banks.
Credit Lyonnais, for example, pumped FFr2.5bn of fresh share capital into
Usinor Sacilor last year after having bought a stake in Rhone-Poulenc, the
state-owned chemicals group, in the previous year, and is discussing a
possible FFr1bn investment in Aerospatiale, the state-owned aircraft and
missiles group. Credit Lyonnais' larger competitor, BNP, paid FFr2bn for Air
France convertible bonds.
Credit Lyonnais was happy to oblige and says it would have made these
investments in any case on straight commercial grounds. BNP, by contrast,
fought successfully to get better terms out of Air France. The state banks
are not necessarily a pushover - a sign that independent management in the
state sector will not always be easy for the government to digest.

FT  22 JUN 92 / France (8): Marriages have been arranged - Aerospace
swallows its national pride
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH aerospace industry, the third-largest in the western world, has
been stepping up the search for foreign partners in response to shrinking
national defence budgets and the continued downturn in the civil aircraft
market.
Aerospatiale, the state-owned aircraft and missiles group, led the first
real rationalisation of the hard-pressed western helicopter industry,
through a merger of its helicopter business with that of Deutsche Aerospace
(Dasa) to form Eurocopter. The new group, formed in January and controlled
by Aerospatiale, is the world's second largest supplier after Sikorsky of
the US.
Mr Jean-Francois Bigay, Eurocopter's French chairman, believes this is the
first step towards a reduction in the number of leading western helicopter
makers from eight to three or four by the end of the decade.
A similar strategy is behind the plans by Aerospatiale - with Dasa and
Alenia of Italy - to acquire joint control of Fokker, the Dutch aircraft
producer. The trio teamed up last year to form a regional aircraft
consortium called Regioliner, controlled by Dasa. If successful,
Regioliner's bid for Fokker could help rationalise capacity in Europe's
troubled regional and commuter aircraft sectors.
Airbus, the four-nation European airliner group, has been considering making
smaller aircraft itself, but has not objected to Regioliner's ambitions
because it is concentrating on plans for a long-haul airliner for 600 to
1,000 passengers. However, the bid for Fokker must first obtain approval
from the Dutch government and the European Commission's anti-cartel
authorities. The Commission is no great supporter of mergers in the regional
aircraft industry, having last year caused an outrage by vetoing an attempt
by Aerospatiale and Alenia to buy de Havilland of Canada.
Elsewhere in the French aerospace industry, Dassault, the family-controlled
producer of fighter aircraft and executive jets, is discussing collaboration
on a future generation of fighter aircraft with British Aerospace - a
reflection of both governments' belief that Europe cannot afford more than
one project of this type.
If it comes to fruition, this new fighter would enter production in at least
30 years' time, and is separate from the four-nation European Fighter
Aircraft (EFA) and France's Rafale fighter projects. The German government's
rethink over the EFA underlines the pressures on European defence budgets.
France is sticking with the Rafale, on which Dassault's future largely
depends, but has had to delay first deliveries by two years, to 1998.
Snecma, the main engine supplier to Dassault and Airbus, is also looking for
a foreign partner. It is discussing possible collaboration on future
military jet engines with Rolls-Royce of the UK. Currently, Snecma is the
only European company to develop a fighter jet engine - the M88 for the
Rafale - on its own.
By contrast, Snecma decided long ago not to go it alone in civil engines;
for the past 23 years, it has had a successful partnership with General
Electric of the US. Their joint subsidiary, CFM International, had a 27 per
cent share of the world market at the end of last year, making its CFM-56
family of engines the most popular on the market.
All this alliance-seeking activity follows another hard year for France's
aerospace companies. If anything, the pressure to restructure is more
intense than ever.
The industry's new orders fell by 30 per cent overall last year and sales
are expected to shrink by 25 per cent in real terms by 1995, according to
Gifas, the industry umbrella organisation. Aerospatiale's orders fell by 50
per cent last year, while Snecma's fell by 30 per cent. Dassault - which has
not won a military export order for four years - saw its orders decline by
25 per cent.
Dassault, Snecma and Sextant Avionique, the aerospace electronics group,
were all forced to make job cuts. Mr Henri Martre, chairman of both
Aerospatiale and Gifas, has warned that more job losses among the industry's
118,300 employees are inevitable. The industry's workforce fell by 2 per
cent last year, in line with the fall in sales, but this is not nearly
enough given that productivity was improving, argues Mr Martre.
To fund their development, both Aerospatiale and Snecma need fresh capital.
Aerospatiale has been negotiating to raise around FFr1bn (Dollars 185m) by
selling a minority stake to Credit National, the state-owned bank, while
Snecma has indicated that it needs around FFr750m.
Dassault's main problem is the lack of export orders for its fighters.
Military sales still account for three-quarters of the group's total
turnover, much higher than the average for the French aerospace industry. It
has high hopes for selling 100 Mirage 2000-5 multi-role combat aircraft to
Taiwan, but the deal is diplomatically sensitive.
At time of writing, the French government was mulling over whether to
authorise the deal. A sale would be a coup for Dassault, but would anger
China. France has important commercial interests in China and relations with
Beijing are already strained because of French tolerance of Chinese
dissident activity in Paris. The final decision, says Mr Pierre Joxe, French
defence minister, must 'take into account all the short, medium and
long-term interests of France.'

FT  22 JUN 92 / France (9): France Telecom enters the real world - The
unchaining of a State monopoly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONLY a few years ago, France Telecom was a cosily protected monopoly
telecommunications operator which never had to worry about international
competition.
Today, 18 months after being turned from a government department into a
semi-autonomous state-owned establishment, France Telecom is on the
offensive, breaking with its old image as one of the few leading
telecommunications operators with only limited international interests.
France Telecom is now in the forefront of a trend by the west's
telecommunication monopolies to seek international partnerships, to compete
against each other in foreign markets and to provide services outside their
home bases. The world's fifth largest telecommunications operator has in the
past year made more foreign alliances than ever before since its creation in
the early 19th century to run a telegraph service for Louis Philippe.
It struck a landmark accord in March with Deutsche Telekom to form a joint
venture, Eunetcom, to provide worldwide telecommunications services for
international companies. It is a serious competitor to Syncordia, a similar
group being set up by British Telecom. Mr Marcel Roulet, France Telecom's
chairman, described it as an important contribution to defeating British
Telecom's ambitions to be 'the only European operator that counts on the
world scene at the end of the decade'. The Franco-German group will be open
to other partners, including British Telecom, though the original partners
would always be central, he said.
France Telecom has not been afraid, meanwhile, to challenge British Telecom
on the UK operator's home turf. The French group created a stir early last
year when it launched Transpac Network Services in the UK to operate private
telecommunications networks - like Eunetcom - for large companies. It was
the first time that a national telecommunications operator from one European
country had decided to compete in the fixed networks of another.
In a smaller UK deal, France Telecom teamed up with the Swedish national
telecommunications operator to take a 25 per cent stake in Ram Mobile Data,
a British company which offers data transmission by mobile telephone. France
Telecom says this is an exploratory investment, to give it a ringside seat
at the early development of what may be an important market, similar to the
10 per cent stake it took in Phonepoint, the UK operator of pocket
telephones.
Across the Atlantic, France Telecom has formed a joint venture with US West,
one of the seven regional Bell telephone companies, to sell mass market
electronic information services. This will be similar to France Telecom's
Minitel videotext system, the world's largest, whereby subscribers use a
small computer box, plugged into a telephone line, to read information, send
messages and shop.
Further afield, it has over the past year taken stakes in Telmex, the
privatised Mexican telecommunications operator, and participated in a
takeover of Argentina's northern networks, to gain an entree into what will
be fast-developing markets, ripe for modernisation. A similar strategy was
behind its first two deals in eastern Europe, to open a mobile phone network
in Poland, with Ameritech, one the US regional operators, and to help set up
a paging system in Czechoslovakia.
If France Telecom has been busy abroad, it has also continued to be active
at home, where it is continuing to enlarge its networks, to develop new
services and to work on the few areas where it lags behind international
competition, such as mobile phones and cable television.
Turnover rose by 7 per cent to FFr115bn last year, on which France Telecom
made a pre-tax profit of FFr16bn. However, that dropped to a mere FFr1.6bn
net after the FFr14.5bn annual levy which the state charges France Telecom.
The levy has for long been a bone of contention between the operator and the
government and will disappear at the end of next year, when the group will
start to pay normal corporate tax. This would have added an estimated FFr6bn
to net profits last year.
As in previous years, last year's sales expansion was led by a strong growth
in business traffic. Facsimile machine use rose by 50 per cent, while
computer data transmission was up by 12 per cent. The number of lines rose
last year from 28m to just over 29.1m, of which 80 per cent are now
connected to digital exchanges, giving France one of the highest levels of
digitalisation.
This modernisation of what was 20 years ago one of Europe's worst
telecommunications services has permitted a steady improvement in quality.
On average, a private subscriber can now expect a fault once every 11 years,
while the likelihood of finding a call box out of order is seven in 1,000.
Digitalisation has also permitted a fast expansion over the past year in the
number of subscribers to Numeris, the integrated services digital network
which allows voice, data and pictures to be piped down the same line.
Numeris had 150,000 subscribers nationwide by the end of last year, six
times more than in 1990.
Minitel, meanwhile, has continued its relentless growth, with a 7 per cent
rise in the number of terminals to 6m. French citizens spent a combined
total of more than 105m hours last year tapping away at their Minitel
keyboards, making use of more than 15,000 services. By far the most popular
of these is the electronic telephone directory, with the others ranging from
databases, to weather and traffic reports and home banking.
The project, launched 11 years ago, in part owes its fast growth to France
Telecom's controversial policy of giving away the most basic of its
terminals. This has been criticised by the Cour des Comptes, the
government's financial watchdog, as a waste of money. A recent audit by
Coopers and Lybrand for France Telecom disagrees, pointing out that Minitel
will have made a FFr4.3bn profit in the 16 years to 2000, if the extra
traffic it generates is included.
Minitel has had to face one small blot on its reputation over the past year,
the continued popularity of erotic message services. Some of these have
become so pornographic that the government has imposed a 50 per cent
turnover tax to penalise the worst offenders and France Telecom even closed
one service.
One of the operator's weak areas continues to be portable telephones, the
use of which is still proportionately one quarter of that in Britain. Here
France Telecom is staking everything on the future generation of Groupe
System Mobile (GSM) digital mobile phones, to enter service in Paris and
Lyon from July 1 and a complementary network of mass-market pocket phones,
nattily named Bi-Bop, now on trial in Strasbourg. The two existing analogue
mobile networks, France Telecom's Radiocom 2000 and SFR, its private sector
competitor, have 375,000 subscribers between them, only 25,000 short of
total capacity.
Cable television is the other weak area, where subscriptions are running way
below break-even, in spite of a huge investment by France Telecom. By the
end of March, there were a mere 857,000 cable subscribers out of the nearly
4m households equipped with cable points.
Part of the problem, competition between cabled and conventional television
stations, is out of France Telecom's control. Nevertheless, it is helping
revive the cable system by increasing its share in the financially squeezed
cable operators, part of a government plan unveiled in May.

From a glance at the latest sets of figures from the existing players on the
French securities markets, one could be forgiven for wondering why. All but
a handful of the established Paris brokers lost money last year. Even the
few profitable firms came under intense financial pressure. The latest
figures from the Association Francaise des Societes de la Bourse show that
the 55 French stockbrokers made combined losses of FFr600m in 1991.
The reasons for the losses are obvious. The French stock market is
over-crowded, with too many firms chasing too little business in an illiquid
market. This problem is compounded by the continuing existence of a number
of small, heavily loss-making brokers, which are propped up by their owners,
often the big French banks, thereby destabilising the rest of the industry.
Finally, as if to add insult to injury, despite the radical reforms of the
1980s, Paris has never succeeded in stemming the loss of business to its
chief competitor, London.
Why then, have apparently rational companies such as Morgan, Kleinwort and
Nomura decided to invest in the lacklustre Paris market? The answer is that
they, like the established players, are confident that the future will be
far brighter when the second wave of France's financial reforms has taken
effect.
The first wave of reforms in the mid to late 1980s revolutionised the French
markets as Paris followed London's lead by deregulating its financial
sector. The labyrinth of closed markets, restrictive practises and other
anomalies that had for decades dominated French finance was swept away.
At the end of it all, France could claim to lead the world in terms of
technology and to have opened up its markets for the 1990s. But Paris still
had its problems. The market was illiquid, mainly because of the severe
shortage of both investment and equity in France, a country where the state
still controls the pension system and huge chunks of industry.
Moreover, some of the old anomalies, such as the Bourse tax on share
transactions and anachronistic takeover laws, had survived. The attempts of
Paris to establish itself as an international trading centre were also
impeded by the strict rules on disclosure, which made it easier for dealers
to execute 'block' trades in large volumes of shares in London.
Fortunately for the French financial community the socialist government has
recognised these problems. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister who, as
finance minister, pursued so rigorous an economic policy that he won over
even the most conservative of financiers, is seen as the chief proponent of
reform. Indeed, one of the ironies of French politics, at least to
Anglo-Saxon eyes, is that the main opponent to financial deregulation has
been not left-wing politicians but the Patronat, the lobbying body for big
business.
The second wave of financial reform is now underway. The first candidate for
change was takeover law, which recently came under scrutiny during the
controversial bids for the Au Printemps stores group and Perrier mineral
water. The government has already abolished one anachronism in this area -
the right to make partial bids for two thirds of a company.
Meanwhile the stock market authorities are considering proposals to make
block trading easier in Paris. There are also growing lobbies both to
abolish Bourse tax - a move that Mr Beregovoy is believed to support - and
to modernise the regulatory structure of the Paris markets,possibly by
merging the two watchdogs, the Commission des Operations de Bourse and the
Conseil des Bourses de Valeurs.
Further, the government is tackling the longer term issue of liquidity. The
proposed reform of the French pension system, which will almost certainly
involve encouraging the use of private pensions as a complement to the
existing state system, should provide a sorely needed source of new
investment by creating the sort of private sector funds that are already
such important components of the US and UK markets.
Looking into the future it is possible to paint an optimistic scenario
whereby the private pension funds also instill more discipline into the
French markets by challenging the power of the big banks and insurers, which
now dominate the investment scene, and by insisting on higher standards of
reporting from companies.
At the same time the government's policy of partial privatisation - the sale
of minority stakes in state-controlled companies - should help to address
the equity problem. Partial privatisation started earlier this year with the
sale of a stake in the Elf Aquitaine energy group. It will continue with the
forthcoming Total oil group issue and future sales of stakes in the big
insurers.
The pension and privatisation programmes seem set to continue whichever
party wins next year's National Assembly elections. The socialists, who have
so far been impeded in their pension plans by trade union opposition, are
expected to wait until then to accelerate their reforms. If the
conservatives come to power in France, both programmes should be stepped up
even further.
It would be foolish to exaggerate the likely impact of all the various
financial reforms. The new takeover laws are little more than a mopping-up
exercise and noone expects the new block trading system to achieve anything
more than simply stopping the loss of any more business to London.
Similarly, it will take years, possibly decades, for the full effects of
pension reform to emerge, given the complex logistics of the exercise.
Moreover, the tradition of state ownership is so strong in France that, even
if the right returns to power, it is difficult to envisage the state not
continuing to control a large tranche of industry.
But the important thing is that changes are indeed underway. It is this
which has encouraged the likes of Morgan, Kleinwort and Nomura to expand in
Paris and which has helped the established houses to lick their wounds and
swallow last year's losses.

FT  22 JUN 92 / France (6): Support falters for main parties - Politicians'
fortunes are being buffeted by wild swings in public opinion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON

<TEXT>
IN 18 short months, the mood of the French government has swung wildly from
triumph to despair and half way back again. As battle raged in the Gulf War,
President Mitterrand and his then prime minister, Mr Michel Rocard, were
both at the peak of their popularity. But by last autumn the President and
his new prime minister, Mrs Edith Cresson, were both sinking to record
depths in the popularity polls.
At that moment the regime seemed in a state of terminal depression and even
disintegration. The Socialist Party was apparently doomed to suffer a
crushing defeat at the next general elections; the party was almost openly
at war with the President; it even seemed uncertain whether he could survive
to the end of his term.
Today the mood has swung round again. Mrs Cresson has been replaced by Mr
Pierre Beregovoy, and the change of cast is working wonders for the image of
the government and the popularity of the President; the polls are once more
giving a little buoyancy, the President is back in battling form, and no-one
now suggests that he might be forced into early retirement.
These contrasts of mood are so volatile that one might be tempted to
discount them as manifestations of a Latin addiction to melodrama. Yet the
dispassionate facts are equally volatile. In the first round of the 1988
general elections, the Socialist Party scored nearly 35 per cent of the
popular vote. This was not quite enough to lead to an absolute majority in
the National Assembly, but it was enough to make the PS the largest single
party in France by a wide margin.
Less than four years on, in the regional elections of March this year, the
Socialist vote had dropped by almost half to a shrivelled 18.3 per cent.
However, this stunning collapse in the Socialist vote in March did not do
the traditional conservative parties any good. In the first round of the
general election in 1988, the Gaullists and the centre-right UDF umbrella
grouping together scored just over 38 per cent; in March this year their
combined vote fell to 33 per cent.
In other words, the three main-line parties of government did so badly that
they could only score just over 51 per cent of the vote between them. Their
collective set-back was reflected in a mushrooming of voter support for a
wide gamut of protest parties: the big break-through was made by the two
ecological parties which scored 13.9 per cent between them; but the extreme
right-wing National Front also moved ahead with 13.9 per cent.
Polling evidence suggests several reasons why the mainstream political
parties lost support in the March elections. To many Frenchmen the political
class appears remote, elitist and indifferent to the concerns of ordinary
people. In addition there is a strong whiff of corruption hanging over the
political parties, especially but not only the Socialist Party, as a result
of repeated revelations of illicit party financing.
But perhaps the strongest common reason for popular alienation is that the
Socialist Party and the conservative opposition parties all present a
wearying spectacle of constant jockeying for position between rival
contenders for leadership. The right wing has long been disfigured by the
feuding between former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing of the UDF and
former prime minister Jacques Chirac of the Gaullists, both of whom are
determined to stand for the Presidency in 1995. But the image of the
Socialist Party was also seriously damaged at its Congress in Rennes in
1990, by the open power battle which broke out between warring factions.
This Socialist power battle, which was waged between three main factions,
was this year fought to a realignment which effectively transfers control of
the Party to Mr Laurent Fabius, leader of a breakaway faction mustering
around 30 per cent of the party activists. In the past Mr Fabius had made
several previous attempts to take over the party leadership, but each time
he was blocked by a tacit alliance between the factions of Mr Lionel Jospin,
representing the traditional party leadership, and Mr Michel Rocard, the
former prime minister.
In January this year, however, Mr Rocard switched sides and Mr Fabius won
the nomination as first secretary of the Socialist Party. As his side of the
bargain, Mr Fabius tacitly endorsed Mr Rocard as the Socialist Party's
'virtual' candidate in the next Presidential elections. Such an endorsement
is a gesture, not a commitment; but it should lead to a formal adoption of
Mr Rocard's candidacy by the Party, which would then be almost irreversible.
The full extent of Mr Fabius' victory only gradually became obvious. When
President Mitterrand dismissed Mrs Cresson as prime minister in April, he
replaced her by Mr Beregovoy, a leading member of the Fabius faction, while
Mr Jospin was excluded from the government altogether. By the time of the
next general elections in March next year, therefore, the Socialist Party
should look a good deal more disciplined, if not united, than it has in the
past couple of years.
The conservative parties have in the past been seriously weakened by their
divisions, and Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing and Mr Jacques Chirac have both
paid lip service to the necessity of uniting their forces. In principle they
are now committed to the idea of holding a primary selection process, to
decide which of them should be the conservative candidate in the next
Presidential election. But their solemn assurances have never sounded fully
reliable and will be severely tested by their profound policy disagreements
over the Maastricht Treaty in the debate looming ahead.
In the wake of the March regional elections, Le Monde ran an ironic cartoon
which showed a ceremonial major-domo addressing the crowd on the steps of
the presidential palace: 'Attention] Stand aside]', he was saying. 'The
President will now bounce back]'
At the time, the fortunes of the government and the Socialist Party had sunk
so low that it seemed inconceivable that the President could ever 'bounce
back'. Today, the balance of forces between government and opposition is
again more evenly matched. The odds remain that the Socialists will be
defeated in the general elections of March 1993, possibly by a wide margin;
but it is also conceivable that the political struggle over Maastricht will
so divide the conservative parties as to weaken their electoral chances. The
one thing we know for certain is that President Mitterrand is never beaten
until the battle is over, and the battle is not over yet.

FT  22 JUN 92 / France (3): The pains of recovery - The economy is fighting
its way out of a tight corner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER A YEAR of precipitous slowdown in the rate of growth, the French
economy is starting to show signs of recovery. The government is now
forecasting an increase of 2 per cent this year. But just as the slowdown
was much more severe than anyone had predicted, so the recovery promises to
be painfully modest.
The government repeatedly declares its urgent desire for a faster rate of
growth to arrest and, if possible, reverse the the creeping rise in
unemployment, which has now passed the 10 per cent mark. But the existing
constraints of its long-standing anti-inflation policy, reinforced by the
future imperatives of the European programme for Economic and Monetary
Union, have deprived it of virtually all margin of manoeuvre for influencing
the speed of the recovery.
The downside of the slow recovery is the prospect that unemployment may go
on rising for the rest of this year. But there are two important
compensating factors: French inflation remains more firmly under control
than in most of the country's main trading partners; and as a result of the
accompanying improvement in French competitiveness, the trade balance has
started to show a fairly spectacular improvement.
In the end, the recession proved fatal for the premiership of Mrs Edith
Cresson. No sooner was she appointed, in May 1991, than her popularity and
that of her government began an uninterrupted decline which eventually
reached catastrophic depths. After the humiliating popular rebuff of the
regional elections of March this year, President Mitterrand was forced to
replace her by Mr Pierre Beregovoy, whose popular standing has improved with
every passing week.
No doubt Mrs Cresson suffered heavily from personal errors of style and
judgment. But hindsight also suggests that the main reason for her fall from
power was the unexpectedly steep recession, which happened to coincide with
the period of her premiership. In December 1990 the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development was forecasting a 2.3 per cent growth
rate for 1991; by the middle of 1991 this prediction had been scaled back to
1.4 per cent; the final out-turn seems to have been no more than 1.2 per
cent.
Neither in absolute nor in relative terms was this a particularly deep
recession. It was certainly less severe than the one in the UK. But it was
much more difficult than the French people had been led to expect. Mr
Beregovoy is benefiting partly because of his contrast with the personality
of Mrs Cresson, but also because his appointment has coincided with the
first signs of economic recovery.
One of the first consequences of the slowdown has been a sharp increase in
the size of the budget deficit. Up to and including 1990, the Socialist
government had followed the pattern set by its conservative predecessor, of
steadily cutting back this deficit by around FFr10bn each year. But the
passive effect of lower tax revenues last year swelled the deficit from the
planned level of FFr81bn to FFr132bn, and the government is planning this
year for a further small absolute increase to FFr135bn (though the rise will
be less than the rate of inflation).
The government's acquiescence in an easing of budgetary policy has come in
for criticism from the conservative opposition on the grounds that the
deficit has swelled from 1.4 per cent of GDP in 1990 to 1.9 per cent in
1991. Yet the new higher borrowing requirement is still rather modest
compared with the deficits of many other industrialised countries, such as
the UK with 4.5 per cent of GDP or the European Community average of 4.3 per
cent. Moreover, it remains inside the 2 per cent ceiling set for the
completion of EMU and should start to decline again this year.
In any case, France is continuing to set new benchmarks with the success of
its fight against inflation. Last year the rate was reduced to 3.1 per cent,
and for the first time since the early 1970s slipped below Germany's. The
gap has continued to widen as a result of the impact of German unification,
and is now more than a full percentage point. This year, despite the
emerging recovery, the government is forecasting a further decline in
inflation to 2.8 per cent, a rate which it expects to maintain in 1993 as
well.
The fight against inflation, coupled with the success of the strong franc
strategy in the context of the European Monetary System, has also started to
pay impressive dividends in the foreign trade balance. In each of the first
four months of this year France has recorded a surplus. The monthly record
in April of FFr7.8bn brings the cumulative total surplus this year to
FFr12.8bn, compared with a deficit of FFr16.5bn in the same period last
year.
There is no doubt exporters have enjoyed a transient advantage from the
effects of German unification. But the government claims a solid improvement
in competitivity which has convincingly overcome the traditional weakness of
French industry in international markets.
The black spot in the French economy, and the central anxiety for the
government, remains unemployment, which in April grew by 1.4 per cent or
over 39,000 to a new peak of 2,897,700. The economic recovery is evidently
too slow to create enough new jobs for the increasing numbers of young
people on the labour market, while at the same time lay-offs are still
adding to the unemployment queues.
One worrying feature is that unemployment is growing faster than average
among men of prime working age, between 25 and 49. Another is that nearly a
third of the total (917,000) have been out of work for over a year. The new
prime minister has promised that every one of these long-term unemployed
will be offered a job, training or community service by the autumn. And the
government has embarked on a partial privatisation programme to help fund
this programme.
As the economic recovery gathers momentum, France should be well placed to
take advantage of it with its low inflation, stable currency and competitive
industry. It is an achievement which has been often praised by independent
economists, starting with the OECD. It will be an enviable start for whoever
wins the general elections in March 1993.

FT  22 JUN 92 / France (2): Platform for historic ambitions - France aspires
to a key role in the refashioning of Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVER SINCE World War Two the French have been at odds with the Americans.
Throughout the Cold War they were at odds with them over the confrontation
with the Soviet Union. Today the Cold War is over, but the French are again
at odds with the Americans, this time over the architecture of Western
Europe. The antagonists are the same but the difference is that now the
French have picked an argument where the odds are stacked in their favour.
Picking a foreign policy argument has long been a national addiction of the
French. They have a romantic view that history gives them a right and a
vocation to exercise their influence on the rest of the world. France, they
say, is a nuclear power. France is a permanent member of the United Nations
Security Council. France, in short, is an important country.
For most of the post-war era, this extravagant effort of national
self-assertion was at variance with practical reality, in terms both of
France's own strength and of the readiness of the rest of the world to be
impressed. Nevertheless, France was able to take advantage of the lethal
menace of the Soviet Union, on the one side, and the solidity of all the
other members of the Atlantic Alliance, on the other, to claim for herself a
unique status of moral independence, as a gratuitous defiance of the
domination of the two super-powers. It was a conspicuous gesture of protest
at the leadership of the Americans, but the French could not change the the
essential characteristics of the international constellation, and their
example did not make converts.
On the contrary, France's claim to stand aside from the rest of the alliance
merely caused constant friction. At moments of supreme emergency, from the
Cuba crisis of 1962 to the Euro-missile crisis of 1983, France lined up
loyally with the Americans. As soon as the tensions subsided, France once
more reclaimed the right to a role of national individuality, but could not
make any dent on the reality of American leadership.
What has dented American leadership is the earthquake of events in Eastern
Europe which has followed the collapse of the Soviet system. But this
earthquake, and the trauma of the Gulf War, have also deeply shaken many of
the most basic assumptions of the previous foreign policy, not just of
France but of all Western countries.
In addition, the French have had the special problem of coming to terms with
the fact that their previous ambitions were themselves often based on
self-deception.
The first of these self-deceptions was the deeply-rooted idea that France
has a special role and can wield a special influence in the Arab world. In
Lebanon, the French persuaded themselves that they had a civilising mission
to guarantee the dominance of the Christian community; with Iraq the French
believed they had forged a strategic alliance with a friendly state which
would play a key role in the stability of the Gulf. The slow realisation
that Lebanon is a Syrian, and not a French fiefdom, and the violent
revelation that France had no influence whatever on Iraqi expansionism, have
both been painful awakenings.
The second self-deception was the idea that France would always have special
political strengths with which to dominate the Germans. France's former
enemy was economically more powerful, but it was divided and politically
enfeebled, whereas France was a nuclear power, a notional victor from World
War Two, and the proud possessor of a permanent seat on the UN Security
Council.
This illusion of political superiority was rudely shattered by the fall of
the Berlin Wall, the end of the Cold War, and the unification of the two
Germanies. All at once, Germany regained its full sovereignty and France
lost its claim to the special status of a former conquering power. All at
once, it became more difficult to define the advantages conferred on France
by the possession of nuclear weapons.
The third illusion is that France is a strong military power in conventional
terms. The constant modernisation of France's nuclear triad was only
achieved at the expense of its conventional forces. These had appeared
entirely adequate for minor adventures in former colonies in Africa; they
were revealed to be humiliatingly inadequate for the war in the Gulf. Yet,
if the end of the Cold War down-graded the value of a strategic nuclear
arsenal, it was likely to place a larger premium on effective conventional
forces.
French responses to the whirlwind of recent history have often seemed
petulant, displaced or anachronistic. After the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait,
President Mitterrand continued to proliferate diplomatic initiatives, even
though there appeared no reason to expect a diplomatic solution. After the
fall of the Berlin Wall, President Mitterrand appeared to hope that German
unification could be delayed, and manifestly did not welcome its
implications when he could not prevent it.
So long as there was any chance that President Mikhail Gorbachev could
retain his ascendancy over the Soviet Union, President Mitterrand was less
than welcoming to President Boris Yeltsin. Yet, when the conspirators
mounted their abortive coup against Mr Gorbachev, President Mitterrand
appeared altogether too ready to accept it as a fait accompli.
In view of these fairly spectacular foreign policy fluffs, some people
claimed that President Mitterrand had lost his once-famed power of political
judgment. Such a sweeping verdict is almost certainly misplaced, but his
reflexes may well have been betrayed by his age.
In the case of German unification, the key fact was generational: few
Frenchmen of the age of Francois Mitterrand would instinctively welcome the
full restoration of German sovereignty, even though for conscientious
political reasons he had spent all of his presidency forging close political
links with Germany. In the case of the abortive Moscow coup, President
Mitterrand's essential judgment does not seem significantly different from
that of other Western leaders. The key distinction was in the temperature of
his commentary: in public he chose to comment on the coup in cold terms,
whereas others adopted a vocabulary of heated condemnation. His was the
choice of an old man.
In contrast with the instability of events and the uncertainty of French
responses, the single most constant theme in Francois Mitterrand's foreign
policy has been the commitment to the development of European integration,
and it has proved a constant stabiliser. France has always been in the
forefront of the debate over the future of Community development, but in the
1960s and 1970s the French attitude to Europe was often at best ambiguous.
Under the presidency of President Mitterrand, however, almost all the old
ambivalence has been cast aside, and in tandem with Germany, France has
become the power-house of a new drive for European integration.
Their joint drive gathered extra momentum in response to the fall of the
Berlin Wall and the unification of Germany. In 1989, the Community was
already launched in the direction of Economic and Monetary Union. In 1990,
France (and Germany) demanded a further strengthening of the integration
process, with a parallel negotiation on Political Union; by the end of 1991
these two negotiations culminated in the Maastricht Treaty of European
Union.
If the political ambitions of this treaty are fulfilled, it will endow the
Community with far-reaching ambitions for a common foreign and security
policy, leading one day perhaps to a common defence policy. The Community
would thus itself become a world player on the international stage, in
competition with the other major powers. But the pursuit of these long-term
ambitions for Europe is a direct challenge to the established hierarchy of
power in the world, and it is setting France on a collision course with its
more traditionally-minded allies, starting with the US.
So far the conflict between the two sides has been uncertain and ambiguous.
All the Western allies, including the French, have continued to protest that
Nato's role, and the American military presence in Europe, remain as
essential as ever. Yet, by definition, the disintegration of the Soviet
enemy places an unavoidable question mark over the future purpose of the
Western alliance.
That question mark is only underlined when the Americans seek to invent new
peace-keeping roles for Nato which are not provided for in the Atlantic
Treaty, in a transparent effort to prop up its uncertain credibility. But
these declarations of allegiance to Nato have not dissuaded the French (and
the Germans) from pressing ahead with plans to endow Europe with the power
of political, and perhaps one day military, action.
In the wake of the Gulf War the countries of Western Europe proposed to
strengthen their military cooperation in the long-dormant Western European
Union; the US State Department immediately issued an intemperate protest at
what it saw as a direct challenge to the role of Nato. Yet the new Nato
strategy agreed at the Rome summit in November 1991 included approving
references to the role of specifically European forces. This year, France
and Germany announced the setting up of a joint corps as the kernel of a
future European army. American officials again protested that the new unit
would weaken Nato, and could only be employed with Nato's permission.
The paradox of these American protests is that the French drive for a more
integrated Europe must eventually lead them to abandon their traditional
claim to a separate and independent defence policy. As it is, the French
have endorsed the merit of integrated military forces, both in principle at
the Nato summit, and in practice in the project for a Franco-German corps.
The long-term objective of a European defence policy clearly implies a
French readiness to subordinate their national defence to the common
European interest.
What the French have not endorsed, of course, is the general principle that
Europe's defence should be subordinated to the judgment and the interests of
America. This issue is likely to sustain the friction between France and
America, at least until the US accepts the idea that Europe's interests are
separate and may well be different.

FT  22 JUN 92 / France (4): Jean Peyrelevade
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is a story that when Mr Jean Peyrelevade swapped his lucrative post as
head of Banque Stern in Paris for the chairmanship of Union des Assurances
de Paris he swallowed a salary cut of 80 per cent.
It was almost certainly worthwhile. UAP is the biggest of the big French
insurers and one of the most powerful shareholders in French industry. As
chairman, Mr Peyrelevade, the son of a Marseilles schoolteacher, holds one
of the most powerful posts in French finance.
He owes his position both to his brains and to his political contacts.
Mr Pierre Mauroy, an old friend, made him assistant director of his private
office as soon as he became prime minister. Mr Peyrelevade is the archetype
of that peculiarly French phenomenon - the cerebral socialist financier.
After the premier's office came the chair of Compagnie de Suez, one of
France's most powerful industrial and financial groups, followed by a
lucrative stint in the private sector, as chairman of Banque Stern, while
the socialists were out of power between 1986 and 1988.
When the socialists returned, so did Mr Peyrelevade to rule the roost over
French finance from UAP's opulent offices overlooking Place Vendome. AR

judgment on the long reign of Francois Mitterrand

THE French debate on the Treaty of Maastricht, which comes to a climax in
the next few months, will be cathartic for France, and it should give new
endorsement to the development of the European Community. But whatever its
outcome, it is poetic justice that this French debate on Europe is taking
place under the presidency of Francois Mitterrand.
The debate will be cathartic because the French have long been ambivalent
about Europe. From the beginning, French statesmen have always been in the
forefront of the building of the Community; but other French statesmen have
been among its fiercest opponents.
Ambivalence is inherent in the clash between the nationalist and centralist
legacy of French institutions and traditions, compared with the pluralist
liberalism of the Community model; and it is manifest in the archetypal
passions which set Socialists against Communists, Gaullists against
Liberals. France has been part of the European Community for over 40 years;
but this deep-seated ambivalence has still not been resolved.
It has not been resolved, partly because it has never before been fully
expressed. Public opinion polls have regularly shown consistently strong
support for European integration; yet the paradox is that the French people
have never before debated the implications of their European future as they
are doing today.
By the conventions of the Fifth Republic, the French public and the French
parliament are expected to leave diplomacy and foreign policy to the
President of the Republic; since Europe is treated as part of foreign
policy, the electorate is not normally expected to say a word.
In 1965, General de Gaulle carried his war against the Community to new
heights, by walking out of the Brussels Council of Ministers; he was forced
to think again after a setback in the Presidential election of December
1965; but he never offered a hint that he might need to seek parliamentary
support for his belligerent policy to the Community.
Today's debate on the Maastricht Treaty, in parliament and in the media, is
by common consent the most intense debate on Europe that the French have
ever conducted. Indeed, it might be truer to say that it is the only intense
debate on Europe they conducted in the past 35 years. One would have to go
back to the Rome Treaty in 1957, or even to the abortive project for a
European Defence Community in 1954, for an event of comparable intensity. By
contrast, the Single European Act of 1986, which laid the foundations for
the Maastricht Treaty, and which was antagonistic to everything the Gaullist
Party stood for, was ratified by the then Gaullist government without a
murmur and almost without discussion.
When the question is put, the French are likely to give a clear Yes to
Maastricht. This is what the opinion polls have been saying, and this is
what the leaders of most of the mainstream political parties will be
campaigning for. The Communists, the extreme right-wing National Front, and
the Greens will call for a No vote; but they do not command a majority in
the country. By contrast, the Socialists, the Centrists and the centre-right
UDF group will all call for a Yes; only the Gaullist party is still deeply
split on Europe, but at the end of the day its leadership will probably call
for a Yes.
It is poetic justice that this referendum is taking place towards the end of
the Presidency of Francois Mitterrand, because his deep commitment to
European integration has been the most consistent theme in his long
political career.
Doubts have sometimes been expressed whether Mr Mitterrand is really a
socialist, and if so in what sense; but his credentials as a committed
pro-European are virtually never questioned, even by his adversaries; and
when in the past, he has had to choose between 'socialism' and Europe, as in
the spring of 1983, he has always chosen Europe.
But this time, it is the French people who are being asked if they will
choose Europe. If they do, they will confirm Francois Mitterrand's claim to
a place in modern European history as one of the driving forces giving new
impetus to the process of integration. France's Maastricht referendum will
obviously be an inherently important turning-point for the future of
European integration; it will also be a suitably elevated test of
Mitterrand's reputation and political legacy.
Because the political and international stakes are so high Maastricht is
already starting to raise the level of political debate in France, as well
as the calibre of President Mitterrand's public engagement. All politicians
are conscious that the outcome of the referendum will be critically
important for France and for Europe; they also know that the issues raised
in this debate could have a decisive impact on the parliamentary election in
March next year, as well as on the next Presidential election two years
later.
Most of the past year saw the government gripped in the doldrums of despair
and disintegration. Once the Gulf War was out of the way, nothing went right
for the regime. The President seemed to have lost his touch (but not his
obstinacy) when he appointed Mrs Edith Cresson to the prime ministership;
more and more members of the Socialist Party were tarnished by charges of
financial corruption; the President and his Party were increasingly at
loggerheads. The Party seemed to be sliding helplessly towards an
annihilating defeat in the next general election; a treacherous chorus of
voices began saying that the Party could only survive intact if the
President resigned early.
Even the President seemed at one stage to be aware that the domestic
situation could become so unfavourable that he might have to consider early
retirement. But that mood has now passed. The Maastricht referendum will
enable President Mitterrand to face the electorate on an issue of high
policy with a powerful and ambitious case to argue. If he secures a large
Yes majority, the verdict may well boost his personal popularity, still at a
desperately low ebb, as well as the election chances of his party.
Conservative advocates of a Yes vote are determined to prevent the
referendum from being turned into a personal plebiscite for President
Mitterrand; they claim their decision to vote with President Mitterrand on
Maastricht still leaves them entirely free to vote against him on other
issues. But they know they cannot be sure of separating out the question
from the questioner; they are compelled to campaign actively for Maastricht,
just in case the electorate should vote personally against President
Mitterrand.
A year ago, when the government's rating was sinking to an all-time low,
President Mitterrand promised a reform of the constitution, including a
shortening of the seven-year term of the presidency. This constitutional
project now seems to have faded from view. But it would be a pity if the
growing excitement of the Maastricht controversy were to shut out the more
modest case for a re-examination of the working of the constitution.
In the depths of its political doldrums last year, some commentators
suggested that France was afflicted by a deep sickness of the spirit. Of
course, France was not sick; on the contrary, any casual observation would
show that France is as well governed as its neighbours, and its economy
better managed. On the other hand, it does seem that the French are
increasingly sick of their political class.
One factor is revulsion at repeated revelations of illicit party finance
arrangements, mostly in the Socialist Party, and some of which have also
involved personal corruption.
A more general explanation, however, of which specific corruption is only
one manifestation, lies in the constitution of the Fifth Republic, which
gives too much power to the ruling party and far too much to the president,
who is wholly unaccountable.
This is a system where the tentacles of patronage and influence reach into
every crevice of society, where the party of government is always tempted to
abuse its power, and which in the end gives off a reek of pervasive
corruption. Critics accuse the Mitterrand presidency of giving way to the
self-important pretensions of a monarchical fin de regne, and some even
insinuate that President Mitterrand has been continuously extending a
politically decadent grasp while losing his intellectual grip.
These added innuendoes are over the top and therefore miss the point.
President Mitterrand is by now an elderly man. But those who under-estimated
his strategic skills in the past often had cause to regret it, and the
Maastricht process is likely to show that his faculties are as sharp as they
have ever been.
The central issue in this closing phase of President Mitterrand's presidency
is not whether his successor will have noticeably shrewder judgment but
whether the system gives him an unbalanced share of power.

FT  22 JUN 92 / Boycott threat over Cambodia talks
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A 32-nation ministerial conference on rebuilding Cambodia is due to open in
Tokyo today amid conflicting reports about whether Mr Khieu Samphan, leader
of the communist Khmer Rouge, will boycott the meetings.
Hopes that the Khmer Rouge had dropped its opposition to the meeting, where
pledges of nearly Dollars 600m for the reconstruction of Cambodia are being
sought, were raised on Saturday when Mr Khieu unexpectedly arrived in Tokyo.
However, Mr Khieu told reporters after a meeting of the country's Supreme
National Council (SNC), which groups all four main Cambodian factions, that
he would not attend. Subsequently, Kyodo News Service quoted a senior
Foreign Ministry official as saying that he would.
A boycott of the meeting by Mr Khieu would leave the Khmer Rouge even more
isolated, as its refusal to participate in the disarmament phase of a
UN-brokered peace settlement has already cast doubt on the future of the
country.
The Khmer Rouge has refused to lay down arms until Vietnamese troops have
left the country. Vietnam says its troops have all done so.
Today's conference is a centrepiece of Japan's efforts to play a larger role
in seeking a solution to the Cambodian conflict. Tokyo is expected to pledge
Dollars 150m to the effort and the government is looking at whether it
should send troops from its self-defence forces to Cambodia.
Prince Norodom Sihanouk, president of the SNC, said he would like troops
from Japan to construct roads and bridges in his country under the control
of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia.

<TEXT>
THE Reserve Bank of India has directed ANZ Grindlays, the Australian-owned
bank, to make provision of Rs4.05bn (Dollars 144m) for losses incurred in
the country's Rs30.8bn securities market scandal, writes RC Murthy in
Bombay.
The central bank rejected Grindlays' contention that it had done nothing
wrong in crediting five cheques made out to the bank to the personal account
of disgraced broker Harshad Mehta.
In a statement to the reserve bank after meeting its deputy governor, Mr Bob
Edgar, Grindlays manager in India, defended as 'normal practice' the
crediting of cheques to Mr Mehta's account.
The reserve bank stepped up pressure on Grindlays after the State Bank of
India paid Rs7.07bn last Tuesday to the National Housing Bank for losses in
similar transactions.

FT  22 JUN 92 / Japan risks losing lead in industrial competitiveness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN has maintained its world lead in industrial competitiveness for the
seventh consecutive year but, for the first time, there are doubts about the
future, according to the annual World Competitiveness Report published today
by the International Institute for Management Development (IMD) and the
World Economic Forum.
Germany takes second place in the competitiveness rankings from the US,
which has slipped to fifth. Some way behind Germany comes its previous
rival, Switzerland, in third place, followed rather surprisingly by Denmark,
which has boosted its position to fourth from eighth in 1991.
The rankings of 22 industrialised and 14 developing countries are based on
more than 330 criteria grouped into eight competitiveness factors. Hard
statistical data are supplemented by the results of an international survey
of executives who evaluate their country's ability to compete on world
markets. This year, some 3,300 questionnaires were returned, out of 18,000
mailed.
The report suggests a weakening of Japanese competitiveness from previous
years. Japan continues to lead on factors such as the strength of the
domestic economy, management, research and development and education. But
its scores on integration into the world economy, government policies,
finance (following turmoil in Japanese financial markets) and the attitude
of young people to life and work have slipped.
Germany too could face future problems of competitiveness. The report says
German companies may increasingly invest abroad as the advantages of low
wages in eastern Germany are eroded, so reducing the country's strength in
foreign trade.
At the same time, the report notes that world recession has favoured
countries such as Japan and Germany which excel in producing high-quality
goods with a superior price-quality ratio.
World Competitiveness Report 1992 (695pp, SFr700), available from Ms Hoa

FT  22 JUN 92 / Taiwan agrees to restrain sales of machine tools in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TAIWAN, under considerable US pressure, has agreed to two more years of
limits on its machine tool exports to the US, with the Bush administration
promising the 'voluntary' restraints will be phased out by 1993.
Japan bowed to similar US pressure for a two-year extension of the five-year
quotas in April.
In 1986, both countries agreed to limit their exports to their 1981 market
share in several categories of machine tools.
The Association for Manufacturing Technology, which won the administration's
support for an extension on grounds of national security, said the new pact
would give additional breathing space to the industry and its workers.
Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, said the understanding would
allow US companies 'to complete necessary programmes for advancing US
national security interests while providing a gradual return to
market-determined competition'.
The new agreement with Taiwan will allow machining centres, lathes and
milling machine imports to be raised over their current levels by 29 units
in 1992 and 281 units next year.
The US industry claims large gains during its period of protection. Its
exports rose from Dollars 600m in 1986 to Dollars 1.1bn in 1990 and 1991.
Companies affected have increased their annual investment by 78 per cent.

<TEXT>
SHARES AT Vosper Thornycroft, the ship-building and electronics firm, have
been performing well since the beginning of the year. Following good
year-end results, three directors have sold a total of more than 400,000
shares at 342p.
The company did, however, report a strong order book at the time of the
figures and, while others were selling, Martin Jay, the managing director
and chief executive, bought 1,460 shares, increasing his holding by more
than one-third.
Perkins Foods, the food manufacturing and marketing company, has seen its
shares underperform considerably over the past year. But the tide could be
turning as Howard Philips, the chief executive, Ian Blackburn, the finance
director, and Terence Finn, a non-executive director, have bought a total of
145,000 shares at prices around 100p. Each director already held a
considerable number of shares but their investments remain significant in
money terms nevertheless.
Following interim results at Metro Radio, an independent local radio
services provider in Tyne and Wear and Cleveland, Michael Johnson, an
executive director, sold 40,000 shares at 175p. Within the past year he has
sold approximately one-quarter of his holding.

FT  20 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Enterprise Oil Dollars 150m preference
issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENTERPRISE Oil, the independent UK oil producer, said yesterday that it had
raised Dollars 150m (Pounds 81m) via the issue of fixed-rate US dollar
preference shares.
The company gained shareholders' approval last month to allow it to issue up
to Dollars 300m of the shares. It initially intended to offer Dollars 100m,
but this was raised to Dollars 150m in response to investor demand.
Mr Andrew Shilson, treasurer, said an over-option facility of up to 15 per
cent could boost the final size of the issue to a maximum of Dollars 172m.
The funds will be used for general corporate purposes and for its long-term
investment programme - particularly in Europe and the Far East.
The shares will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and were priced to
yield an annual net dividend of 7.88 per cent, equivalent to a gross yield
of 10.5 per cent.
Enterprise is the first UK non-bank company to raise equity capital through
preference shares in the US.
Preference shares pay a fixed coupon like a bond, but rank below all debt
holders in the event of the company being wound up.
Aviva Petroleum, the US-based but London-quoted oil company, said yesterday
that it had re-scheduled its term loan with the Royal Bank of Scotland and
converted interest due to the bank of Dollars 1.17m into ordinary shares at
58p each. It is also selling its 70 per cent holding in Aviva Petroleum
Canada to Gulf USA for Dollars 2.5m.
Aviva said the moves solved the company's short-term cash problems and would
help meet development costs in Colombia.

FT  20 JUN 92 / How To Spend It: Attention paid to bike with no chain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX WILKINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS mildly pleasant for a middle-aged man to become a centre of attention
among the golden youth that promenade in Covent Garden on a mid-summer
morning, writes Max Wilkinson.
The object of their curiosity was a bicycle (pictured above) with no chain,
which I was test-riding near Muji, the retailer which is importing it from
Japan.
The verdict? Well, it certainly gets them chattering. One American student,
who picked it up and spun the back wheel critically, pronounced the direct
drive through a lightweight axle and gears, 'pretty impressive'.
The mechanism seemed well made, and transmitted the power of the pedals
efficiently. But in spite of this, the clean look and its exemplary
lightness, I did not much like this bike. It comes in only one frame size
(490mm or 19.3 inches), which for a six-footer like me, gives an awkward
pedalling angle, with the handlebars too near the seat. The gearing ratio is
rather low (fine for uphill but tedious on the flat or down). The gears are
old fashioned three-speed, rather than the more efficient chain shift; and
for Pounds 650, I would expect a pair of mudguards.
Round the corner at Covent Garden Cycles I could choose from a range of
mountain style 25 speed bicycles with custom-built frames in exactly the
right size for Pounds 400 or less. And for a mere Pounds 438 at Bike UK in
the YHA shop a block away, I could have bought a truly beautiful 14 speed
lightweight racer/tourer - better looking, faster, more comfortable and two
thirds of the price of the Muji talkabout.
But if you do not mind the price, hate dirty chains, care little for bicycle
geometry and enjoy being stopped in the street, by all means try a Muji.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Capital gains and indexation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS TABLE allows you to work out your capital gains tax liability after
indexation for assets sold in May. Multiply the amount of money you paid for
the asset by the figure shown for the month in which you bought it. If you
then subtract this figure from the amount you received for it on the sale,
this will give you your taxable gain or loss.
Suppose that you bought shares for Pounds 6,000 in February 1985 and sold
them in April 1992 for Pounds 14,000. Multiplying the original cost by the
February 1985 figure of 1.515 gives a total of Pounds 9,090. Subtracting
that from Pounds 14,000 gives a gain for tax purposes of Pounds 4,910 -
which is below the 1992-93 Pounds 5,800 CGT allowance. If you are selling
shares bought before April 6 1982, you should use the March 1982 figure.
The value of the retail prices index, used to calculate many index-linked
pension schemes was 139.3 for May (where the index at January 1987 is 100).

FT  20 JUN 92 / Kings of the bouncy castles set for a hard landing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAS the bounce finally gone out of the market for inflatable castles? 'Too
many people have jumped on the bandwagon in the last two years,' said one
castle-maker, 'and now there are just too many castles to go around.'
Newspaper advertisements persuaded thousands of budding entrepreneurs to
become self-employed hirers of bouncy castles, for which all they need is
Pounds 1,000, a car and a love of children.
Inflatables now appear regularly at service stations, fetes and shopping
malls, as well as at children's parties, as the legion of hirers seeks fresh
business in a market that industry observers estimate turns over Pounds 15m
a year.
But margins have come under pressure as competition increased. A small
bouncy castle for a private party typically costs up to Pounds 40. Now,
prices as low as Pounds 20 are being quoted.
The popularity of inflatables has also caught the attention of the Health
and Safety Executive which has issued a sombre document entitled New
Guidance On Inflatable Bouncing Devices, after a flurry of minor accidents.
Insurance rates for operators have risen accordingly.
In spite of these rumblings of pessimism, both manufacturers and hirers
remain outwardly confident that the industry's expansion can be maintained.
'We've got hundreds of different types of inflatables, not just castles,'
said Mr Brian Turner, managing director of Bee-Tee inflatable products, of
Wakefield, West Yorkshire.
Bouncy castles and other inflatables were imported from the US during the
1970s, mainly for use in fairgrounds. The past decade, however, has seen the
reduction in size of inflatables and the development of what Mr Turner calls
'a cottage industry' of producers and hirers.
While some insiders admit to a degree of saturation in the bouncy castle end
of the market, the specialist larger inflatable business continues to grow.
'Companies and organisations are continually looking for something different
to both entertain clients and advertise themselves,' said Mr Mark Shears,
general manager at Jumbo Inflatables, which supplies personalised bouncy
inflatables for between Pounds 1,500 and Pounds 3,000.
A leading building society recently bought a 30-ft high Egyptian
pyramid-style castle, British Gas an inflatable oil rig, and a Scandinavian
shipping group a bouncy cruise liner.
And while there may be an air of deflation over one side of the market,
there is great excitement at the latest development which involves
Velcro-wearing participants hurling themselves at a wall of the same
material - contained within an inflatable structure - and hoping to stick.
'This,' predicts Mr Shears, 'will be as big as bouncy castles.'

FT  20 JUN 92 / Russian banking reform forum launched in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A HIGH-LEVEL initiative to restructure the Russian banking and financial
system and to explore the possible creation of a Russian-American investment
bank was announced in New York yesterday.
The initiative, to be known as the Russian-American Bankers Forum, comes
from the US Federal Reserve, the central banking system, and top advisers to
Russian president Boris Yeltsin.
The forum, co-chaired by Mr Gerald Corrigan, president of the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York, and Mr Yuli Vorontsov, the Russian representative
to the United Nations, will hold its first meeting in Moscow next Thursday.
Mr Corrigan said the new group had the full support of Mr Alan Greenspan,
chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and Mr Nicholas Brady, the US
treasury secretary.
Mr Vorontsov said that restructuring the banking system would be 'the
mainstay of a new market economy'. He and Mr Corrigan added that the
eventual formation of a new Russian-American Investment Bank could help to
channel US private sector capital investments in Russia and to lay the
groundwork for the development of US commercial bank operations in Moscow.
Mr Corrigan said the initiative was the culmination of a series of informal
co-operative ventures over the past 12 months, and was 'based on a precept
of private and public sector co-operation'.
He said the forum, with secretariats in Moscow and New York, would provide
policy and technical support for working groups of US experts who would
report to Mr Yeltsin's aides.
Among the US members of the forum are Mr David Rockefeller, former chairman
of Chase Manhattan; Mr Cyrus Vance, former secretary of state; Mr John Opel,
former chairman of IBM; Mr John Whitehead, former co-chairman of Goldman
Sachs; and Mr Richard Debs, ex-president of Morgan Stanley.
The first working group will give the forum details next Thursday of what is
required to develop a Russian retail banking network, a payment system to
steer the Russian economy away from its largely cash-based operations, the
development of an interbank market and the creation of a market for
government securities.
Other working groups might be formed to deal with issues such as
privatisation, direct foreign investment and the regulation of financial
markets. The US partners in the forum will include the financial Services
Volunteer Corps, a technical assistance group chaired by Mr Vance .
Mr Corrigan said the forum would be financed by the Russian government, the
US Federal Reserve system and by US banks and private sector companies.
The first working group includes present and former officials from the
Federal Reserve Board in Washington, Federal Reserve banks in New York and
Boston and US commercial banks.

FT  20 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It looks as though perhaps a sixth of Lloyd's Names will bear three-quarters
of the Pounds 2bn of 1989 losses which the insurance market is expected to
announce next Wednesday. Those getting off lightly will no doubt sleep
easily this weekend - but they should be under no illusion that the burden
sharing threat has permanently been headed off. A formal bail-out fund has
indeed been abandoned, but given the hugely disproportionate share of the
risks many Names will genuinely be unable to pay. Although the Central Fund
has already been topped up to Pounds 1bn to deal with such eventualities, a
further call on members' pockets one day cannot be ruled out.
Individual hardship aside, the important issue is whether Lloyd's will
remain a dominant force in the 1990s. As Names defect, there are obviously
question marks over the market's medium-term capacity and its ability to
retain critical mass. The gloom, however, should not be overdone. The
capping of losses will ultimately make Lloyd's more attractive, and
corporate capital will doubtless be tapped. Moreover, some sort of
correction was not only inevitable but desirable after the overcapacity of
the 1980s.

FT  20 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It looks as if overseas investors have been more grudging in funding Mr John
Major than the gilt market originally thought. This week's provisional money
supply figures suggest foreign purchases of gilts were only about Pounds
500m in May after Pounds 464m in April. That left domestic investors
responsible for absorbing the vast proportion of gilts sold since the
election, despite anecdotal evidence to the contrary. The statistics may
fail to capture the true picture. Some domestic buying may actually be for
overseas accounts. Even allowing for that, however, the Bank's figures
suggest that foreign buyers actively supporting the market before the
election have become less interested since. Admittedly, domestic
institutions have sufficient cash to cover the entire PSBR, but only at the
expense of investment in equities.
The apparent lack of foreign interest in April and May suggests the yield
margin between gilts and German government bonds became too narrow after the
election. Presumably domestic buyers were motivated less by the convergence
theory on European interest rates and more by the belief that a new Tory
government would sacrifice growth in the fight against inflation. The margin
over German paper will have to rise above its current 135 basis points to
entice foreign investors back in a sizeable way. Even if only modest inflows
are required, it cannot go much lower. The Irish vote on Maastricht went the
market's way, but nervousness will remain until September's French
referendum.

FT  20 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: WPP
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As a rule companies do not like seeing their accounts qualified by the
auditors. But WPP may be an exception. Arthur Andersen's stark observation
yesterday that a going concern basis may cease to be appropriate usefully
underlines the urgency of agreeing terms for the marketing services group's
capital reconstruction.
It has long been clear that WPP was heading for a mid-year crunch,
precipitated by a combination of subdued cash flow from trading, earnout
payments to executives of acquired businesses and interest and debt
repayment deadlines. Not for the first time in the history of once
high-flying UK stocks, though, a group of preference shareholders is
attempting to extract a better deal. Armed with a clear majority of the
votes - and gambling that the banks will not dare pull the plug when the
money runs out next month - they are hoping to do better than the present
draft offer, which requires them to convert their holdings into ordinary
shares at four times the normal rate.
It looks like a dangerous and greedy game. The ordinary shareholders, to be
sure, are in a weak position with the pref holders enfranchised. But the
further they are diluted the weaker the incentive for those WPP executives
on whom a recovery in the company's fortunes ultimately depends. Nor are the
existing terms exactly miserly, when compared with say the Brent Walker or
Brown &amp; Jackson schemes. Allowing for future earnouts, pref holders will
control a bigger slice of the cake than they would under the original
conversion, a cake which will be increased by the banks' Pounds 150m
debt-for-equity swap.
In the absence of a Saatchi-style put option, the banks appear to have the
whip hand. The effective preference offer of 35.3p per share compares with
an average price over the last four months of 28.7p. With bank debt trading
at 65 per cent of its nominal value, it would not do for the pref holders to
push their luck.

FT  20 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Lowered expectations
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Thanks partly to Ireland's vote in favour of the Maastricht treaty, equities
closed yesterday in better shape than some might have feared on Wednesday
and Thursday. The Footsie shed only 19 points over the week, and there is
some evidence of support below 2,600. This level hardly seems demanding on
fundamental grounds, but it is still difficult to dismiss the array of
negative factors confronting the market.
The most eye-catching of these - the GPA flop and the unsettled tone
overseas - are not as immediately significant as ICI's sudden profits
pessimism and 3i's postponed flotation. Both developments set the tone for a
weak recovery which will do little for corporate earnings. Indeed, reaction
to the ICI downgrading suggests that investors may remain too optimistic
generally on the earnings outlook.
Any demand for equities now seems likely to favour companies which can
demonstrate quality earnings with good cash flow and comfortable dividend
cover. Investors who were reluctant to shell out for GPA will not
necessarily prove so cautious over Wellcome, but that does not imply much
overall bounce for the market.
Inflationary pressures at the factory level may, as the CBI says, be at
their lowest for 25 years, but that takes the market back to the kind of
low-growth, low-inflation environment of the mid-1960s when equity prices
only crept upwards. While investors adjust to that, there are few reasons
for London to outperform if New York should take another turn for the worse.

FT  20 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets: Ireland stalled after GPA aborts
take-off - Dublin's underperformance has caused brokers to cut their growth
forecasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dealers on the Irish stock market have been holding their breath for the
past week, awaiting two of the biggest events of the year that could have
made a significant impact on the market. As it happened, the effects of one
cancelled out the effects of the other.
GPA's crash on take-off on Thursday has deprived the Irish market of what
would have been its biggest quoted stock, boosting its current market
capitalisation of IPounds 7.9bn (Dollars 13.45bn) by some IPounds 2bn.
The good news yesterday, however, was the approval of the Maastricht treaty
in what was expected to be a cliff-hanger referendum. The fall on the Danish
market following the 'No' vote there at the beginning of the month had
created expectations of similar falls in Dublin and a slump in confidence if
the vote went against the treaty.
Share prices firmed yesterday as reports came in from around the country of
what appeared to be a two-to-one vote in favour.
The failure of the GPA flotation had caused deep disappointment among
brokers, institutions and corporate financiers who feel the market is too
often viewed from abroad as a financial backwater, harbouring a few graceful
swans but accompanied by a lot of unexciting ducklings.
As one broker said: 'It is a problem of scale. No foreign institution is
going to hold a significant chunk of Irish stock, and although there is
interest in the bigger stocks, most feel they cannot justify a commitment of
resources to specifically follow the Irish market.'
Nonetheless, trading has been showing greater signs of life this year,
following a decline in business towards the end of last year. According to
Mr Tom Healey, the exchange's general manager: 'the first quarter of this
year has shown the highest level of business of any quarter since the
beginning of 1990. This has been achieved without once-off 'boosts' such as
the Greencore and Irish Life privatisations last year and the Iraqi invasion
of Kuwait in August 1990.'
Average daily turnover has averaged IPounds 16.3m so far this year, 17.3 per
cent up on the 1991 average.
Market values, having rallied in the first part of the year, have since slid
back. The ISEQ index stood at 1,361.8, up 6.4 on the day but down 1.4 per
cent from the end of 1991, and almost 10 per cent down on last year's peak
of 1,510.
'The new finance bill this year has made bank deposits a lot more attractive
than equity investments and there hasn't been the money flowing into the
institutions,' says an equity analyst at Solomon's stockbrokers in Dublin.
The bill has given a tax advantage to putting money into bank deposits,
rather than into equity-linked savings and has created a furore in Dublin's
financial community. Under pressure, Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister,
has said that, in general, he will consider extending similar tax benefits
'to certain types of investments'.
Yesterday's slight advance in the ISEQ on the news of the referendum vote
was not as great as some had expected. 'It's a small market and will take
some time for it to digest the impact of the GPA flop,' according to
Solomon's.
Irish Life, Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland, which together had hoped
to dispose of some Dollars 18m of GPA shares in the aborted combined offer,
all suffered falls on Thursday, and, although they recovered yesterday, the
gains were not as great as most had expected, given the referendum news.
The underperformance of the Irish market has resulted in brokers revising
downwards their bullish 15-20 per cent growth forecasts of earlier this
year. Mr Kevin Barry, head of research at NCB stockbrokers, says: 'I would
be surprised to see it up by more than 10 per cent now, given there is only
six months of the year left.'
Brokers remain hopeful though, that foreign buyers will move in looking for
bargains. 'There is no fundamental problem of corporate earnings. The
underperformance of the Irish market does make the stocks look increasingly
cheap,' says Mr Barry.
Gilts turnover continues to be by far the biggest business of the exchange,
amounting to IPounds 20.2bn for the first five months of the year, or an
average of IPounds 195m per business day. Earlier this month the stock
exchange introduced a new gilt turnover service, which is now publishing the
daily turnover.
Mr Healey said that there had been resistance to publishing the figures,
similar to that encountered when the equities turnover service was
introduced. 'The small size of the market here, and the dominance of a few
big brokers and institutions, made some people nervous that it might be
possible to easily identify the source of any big movements of funds.
'Those fears disappeared though when we introduced the equities turnover
service, and most people are pleased with the market's greater
transparency.'

FT  20 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Maastricht vote lifts
continental bourses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIGNS that Ireland had voted in favour of the Maastricht treaty gave a boost
to most continental bourses, writes Our Markets Staff. Stockholm was closed
for a holiday.
FRANKFURT, which had been closed on Thursday for a public holiday, saw out
yesterday's quadruple witching hour comfortably, swelling turnover to
DM13.9bn. The FAZ index shed 0.91 to 705.48 at midsession while the DAX was
1.11 ahead at 1,772.89. On the week the indices lost 0.6 and 0.5 per cent
respectively.
The four contracts which expired simultaneously were the June DAX futures,
options on the DAX future, options on 15 leading stocks and an option on the
index.
Technical trading dominated the session while the lack of corporate news
kept dealing fairly quiet. Fashion group Escada registered another steep
fall, down DM30 to DM275. The stock has been declining since the death of
the group's founder earlier this month. It has shed more than 50 per cent of
its value since February when it attained a 1992 high.
Lufthansa gained DM4 to DM133, having fallen earlier in the week on worries
that it might be affected by the transatlantic price war between airlines.
Schering lost DM7.90 to DM711.20 and Hoechst fell DM3.10 to DM256.00, while
Asko was down another DM11 to DM749. BASF advanced 60 pfg to DM245 and later
said that its east German subsidiary was expected to make another loss in
1992.
PARIS closed higher but off the day's best levels as Thursday's drop in the
CAC 40 index below its 200-day moving average around 1,885 prompted
investors to pick up bargains among the blue chips. The CAC 40 index went as
high as 1,925.89 before closing up 22.12 at 1,913.92, for a fall of 0.7 per
cent on the week. Turnover was steady at FFr2.7bn.
Among the most active stocks, Michelin added FFr5.70 or 2.9 per cent to
FFr199 and Alcatel added FFr13 to FFr630. Saint-Gobain picked up FFr6 to
FFr567 while Eurotunnel jumped FFr1.15 or 3.4 per cent to FFr35.30 on
speculative buying.
MILAN ended slightly lower, but preliminary results from the Irish
referendum in favour of European union lifted the market above its session
lows. The lira, which had fallen earlier in the week on devaluation fears,
also recovered strongly in response to the Irish results. The Comit index
closed 1.91 down at 469.88, 1.1 per cent lower on the week, in turnover
estimated at around Thursday's L86.7bn.
Fiat, which had eased L33 to L5,315 lire at its official fixing, rallied to
L5,425 after hours while Montedison, which shed L30 to L1,413 lire, bounced
back to L1,432.
But Italcementi, weighed down by its capital increase, fell L17 to L10,383.
The most heavily traded stock on the telematico was Pirelli, which closed
down L5 at L1,335 with 4.05m shares traded.
AMSTERDAM was firmer with Philips shares regaining some of their value lost
earlier in the week. The CBS Tendency index rose 0.7 to 126.5, but was down
2.3 per cent on the week.
A number of analysts remain positive on Philips, noting that while the
consumer electronics division is suffering difficult trading conditions,
other areas of the group, such as lighting, should contribute good profit
growth in 1992. It ended up Fl 1.20 at Fl 31.10.
ZURICH gained ground in line with other bourses. The SMI index closed 6.8
higher at 1,869.3 but was 0.5 per cent down on the week.
Lower domestic interest rates helped financial stocks, with Union Bank
bearers up SFr10 at SFr3,710 and Swiss Bank bearers SFr4 higher at SFr264.
Ciba-Geigy's registered share ended SFr30 lower at SFr3,250.
OSLO fell again on Friday, for the 14th consecutive session. Prices were up
in early morning trade on news of a likely 'yes' in the Irish referendum,
but fell back later amid general pessimism. The all-share index was down
2.20 to 415.08, down 5 per cent on the week, in trading worth NKr381.6m.
Shipping stocks fell the most, with the index dropping 6.51 to 374.74.
Bergesen A shares lost NKr3 to NKr95.5 while its B shares were down NKr2.5
to NKr96. The industry index, which includes oil stocks, dropped 2.43 to
715.01.
BRUSSELS closed slightly higher on a technical rebound as the Bel-20 index
inched up 5.75 to 1,181.97, down 2.4 per cent on the week, in turnover of
BFr753m.
VIENNA fell sharply at the opening but recovered some of the losses by the
end of the session. The ATX index closed 4.62 lower at 972.18, down 2.1 per
cent on the week.
MADRID's general index gained 2.98 to 249.49 for a 0.4 per cent rise on the
week.

US stock markets, aided by higher equity prices overseas, recovered from
three days of losses yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 11.23 at 3,285.35 in
turnover of 234m shares. Other leading indices also ended firmer. The more
broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up 2.71 at 403.67, the Amex
composite up 1.90 at 379.39 and the Nasdaq composite 5.03 higher at 554.20.
After falling 80 points, or 2.4 per cent, in just three sessions, analysts
were expecting the Dow to bounce back yesterday. Overnight gains on foreign
stock markets provided the necessary excuse for a firm opening, and with
many investors judging that domestic equities had been oversold in recent
days, a steady stream of buyers lifted share prices across the board.
Some investors remained wary of the effect on prices of the afternoon
'triple-witching hour', when futures and options contracts on stock indices
and underlying stocks expire simultaneously.
Most of the leading stocks were higher in busy trade. IBM added Dollars  3/8
at Dollars 95, Merck put on Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 48 1/4 , Bethleham Steel
firmed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 56, General Motors rose Dollars 1 to Dollars
43 7/8 and Philip Morris climbed Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 72 5/8 in turnover
of 2m shares.
Dow Chemical fell Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 57 1/4 on the news that its joint
venture with Corning, Dow Corning, will take a Dollars 45m pre-tax charge
for the discontinuation of its controversial breast implant product. Corning
was untroubled by the news, and rose Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 37 1/4 .
Conner Peripherals slumped Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 18 1/2 in turnover of 2m
shares after unveiling plans to expand its product line. The stock was also
damaged by a downgrade from broking house Bear Stearns, which put the stock
on its 'hold' list.
IMC Fertilizer also bucked the trend, dropping Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 44
3/8 on a warning from the company that it expects fiscal fourth quarter net
income to be hit by depressed product prices.
EQK Green Acres fell Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 8 after the company cut its
quarterly dividend to 27.5 cents a share, from 34.5 cents a share, as part
of a financial restructuring programme.
Telefonos de Mexico continued to recover from losses incurred earlier in the
week on the heels of big declines in its home market. Telmex added another
Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 47 3/4 in turnover of 2.6m shares.
On the Nasdaq market, Heart Technology plummeted Dollars 3 1/8 , or 21 per
cent, to Dollars 11 5/8 , in heavy trading after asking customers to suspend
use of its coronary rotablator after three such devices reportedly failed.
Going the other way were CK Federal Savings, up Dollars 2 1/8 at Dollars 20
1/2 on the news that SouthTrust had signed a letter of intent to buy CK
Federal in a stock swap valued at Dollars 32.7m.
Canada
TORONTO share prices closed lower in moderate trading. According to
preliminary figures, the composite index fell 6.28 points, or 0.19 per cent,
to close at 3,350.89. Declining issues edged advances 276 to 252.
Volume was 21.602m shares, from 26.511m shares, and trading value fell to
CDollars 250.2m from CDollars 308.4m. On the week, the composite index lost
about 57 points.
The gold group posted the day's biggest decline, falling 1.9 per cent. The
sub-group's most heavily weighted stocks, American Barrick and Placer Dome,
were off  5/8 to 32 1/8 and off  3/8 to 12 1/2 , respectively.

FT  20 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Abbey hit by broker revision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and COLIN MILLHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGH street clearer Abbey National failed to benefit from a bounce in the
banking sector, retreating on high turnover after one agency broker weighed
in with a heavy forecast cut. Following a discussion with the bank, James
Capel is now widely believed to be expecting profits to be no more than
Pounds 580m, for the current year, down from its previous forecast of Pounds
635m, and well below Abbey's 1991 profit of Pounds 618m. Capel cut the
following year's forecast by Pounds 40m to Pounds 710m.
There were suggestions that at least one other securities house will soon
follow suit - possibly going as low as Pounds 560m - in order to take
account of losses on mortgage repossessions, and higher provisions in the
company's European subsidiaries. The shares were 6 higher early in the
session but when the news of the forecast cut leaked into the market they
fell back to end 7 off at 269p, the day's low as volume rose to 8.5m shares,
unusually high for Abbey.
Pilkington active
Hefty turnover in Pilkington helped the shares gain 6 1/2 to 137p and added
further fuel to rumours surrounding the speculative intentions of fellow
glassmaker, PPG Industries of the US.
More than 12m shares were traded yesterday as talk in the market suggested
PPG may have picked up 4m. There was further speculation that the stock was
part of the old BTR stake, a large chunk of which failed to find a home last
month. Pilkington was also very active in the traded options market where
the equivalent of 4.2m shares were dealt.
However, the talk failed to be substantiated and analysts were generally
sceptical about the possibility of a bid. 'PPG would run into regulatory
problems on both sides of the Atlantic,' said Mr Lawrence Ambold at Carr
Kitcat &amp; Aitken. 'But this is a low point in Pilkington's share price and
there have been a lot of people waiting in the wings ready to jump aboard -
perhaps including PPG,' he added.
Dark clouds overshadowed British Aerospace as a clutch of brokers took a
negative view on the outlook for profits this year, sending the shares into
retreat. The downward slide started after Strauss Turnbull decided that the
company would make no profits this year, having previously forecast
full-year profits of Pounds 170m, to allow for provisions on the company's
regional aircraft division.
The cut was made following an analysts trip and discussion with the BAe
chairman at the Berlin Air show. Strauss remain buyers of the stock. UBS
Philips &amp; Drew and SG Warburg were also reported to have turned sour.
Dividend fears again dogged the shares which, at the day's worst, were down
19 at 258p. Bargain hunters helped them rally off the bottom to end 10
lighter at 267p on turnover of 4.3m.
Enterprise Oil gained 11 to 414p on announcing a successful attempt to raise
funds through a Dollars 150m (Pounds 81m) issue of fixed rate perpetual
preference shares. Analysts regard the deal as good for Enterprise, because
it means the company, with high borrowings and a full capital spending
programme, can avoid going cap in hand to the banks. It was suggested that
gearing will be around 80 per cent by the year-end.
There was some question however whether the fund raising exercise was enough
on its own to account for yesterday's share price rise. Traders suggested
that a fairly illiquid market in the shares and the fact that there is no
traded option facility added support.
Lasmo continued to fall, losing 5 1/2 to 193 1/2 p, reflecting the company's
high level of debts and Strauss Turnbull's recent forecast of a loss this
year and next. County NatWest downgraded its profit forecast for the company
and agreed with Strauss that the dividend is unlikely to be covered.
ICI was subject to a series of downgrades, following Thursday's gloomy
meeting with analysts, and the shares tumbled 18 to 1217p. Kleinwort Benson
lopped Pounds 50m off its profit forecast for 1992 down to Pounds 850m,
while Hoare Govett is looking for Pounds 830m, down Pounds 70m.
Banks outperformed a rising market, recovering from recent falls which had
left the sector oversold. Midland jumped 6 to 426p on unusually heavy
turnover of 13m, benefiting from the improvement in the HSBC share price in
Honk Kong. Barclays gained 11 to 345p while National Westminster improved 7
to 330p.
Reuters was in in demand ahead of next week's launch of Globex, the
company's new derivatives dealing system. The shares bounced 15 to 1109p.
Ladbroke reversed its recent decline on the back of Thursday's buy notes
from two brokers. The shares jumped 9 to 217p. Forte edged up 3 to 212p as
it announced an Italian hotel coup and the continuation of its long-winded
negotiations to sell its Gardner Merchant subsidiary.
Granada was in demand, the shares climbing 14 1/2 to 267 1/2 p.
However, Rank's dismal run continued as worries resurfaced over its Rank
Xerox subsidiary, the shares shedding 6 to 673p. News that 49 per cent owned
associate Rank Xerox's Crum and Forster insurance unit has agreed to fund a
Dollars 128m (Pounds 69.1m) settlement in the US underpinned the worries.
Mining group RTZ Corp fell 10 to 610p after Smith New Court trimmed its
profit estimate for 1992 and 1993. The house cut its forecast of
attributable profit for 1992 to Pounds 380m from Pounds 385m and to Pounds
479m from Pounds 498m for 1993. The shares also suffered from an overhang of
stock.
Ratners, which little more than a week ago announced the sale of its Watches
of Switzerland subsidiary, continued to attract concern about its debt. In
high turnover of 3.7m, the shares fell 2 1/2 to 10p, and have lost a third
of their value since the start of the month.
Suggestions that negative comments about Boots had been overdone, after the
company's results earlier this month, particularly with regard to the costs
of the Manoplax drug, lifted the shares 6 to 453p. Dixons also rallied after
recent selling pressure, climbing 9 to 254p.
Williams Holdings shed 4 to 319p on reports of a James Capel profits
downgrading.
Shares in Vosper Thornycroft continued to benefit from an institutional
visit organised by broker Charterhouse Tilney earlier in the week. The
shares ended 14 better at 345p.
Hopes that the groundwork is in place for a gradual economic recovery
supported food retailers. Among the big three supermarket chains, Argyll
rose 8 to 358p, J. Sainsbury improved 6 to 468p, and Tesco put on 5 to 282p.
Iceland was also firm, rising 8 to 523p. Shoprite, with interim figures due
next week, climbed 9 to 545p.
Tate &amp; Lyle continued to suffer from adverse comments from analysts,
declining 8 to 352p, while United Biscuits, the subject of a failed attempt
to place a large block of shares on Thursday, slipped 4 to 358p. Unilever
has been one of the best performers of the sector this week, and put on 5 to
940p.

'A Mars a day helps you work, rest and play' - does not mislead consumers,
the Independent Television Commission has ruled.
It rejected a complaint by Action and Information on Sugars, a pressure
group concerned at the amount of sugar in the UK diet. The slogan has been
used for 35 years.
The commission said: 'To uphold the complaint would be to carry literalism
beyond any reasonable bounds justified by the needs of consumer protection.
There was no doubt the product offered at least fuel for work and play. We
are satisfied consumers would not be misled by the 'rest' component of the
slogan which, on analysis, was the only part open to some question, if taken
as a nutritional claim.'

TAX RELIEF on mortgages should be phased out, Mr Tim Melville-Ross, chief

conference of the Institute of Housing in Harrogate for reforms to bring
about 'a more effective and balanced housing policy'.
He also said there should be 'a mortgage benefit subsidy to mirror housing

Government figures showed that Department of Social Security assistance paid

<TEXT>
A GROUP of Names is to seek an extraordinary general meeting of Lloyd's of
London to press for reforms at the insurance market, Richard Lapper writes.
One hundred and ten of the market's more than 20,000 Names - the individuals
who provide the market's capital - have signed a motion that will be
submitted to Lloyd's on Monday, according to Mr Richard Astor, a lawyer who
has organised the move. Under the society's rules, Lloyd's must convene the
EGM within four to six weeks once it has been requested.
The meeting will act as a focus for the anger of Names facing heavy losses,
who have been disappointed by this week's decision to reject a bail-out plan
to pay for past losses. A minority of Names will bear the brunt of losses of
about Pounds 2bn for the 1989 year which Lloyd's will report at its annual
meeting on Wednesday.
The Names' motion alleges that the council - the Lloyd's governing body -
has failed to manage the affairs of Lloyd's properly and to ensure
protection of Names.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Former Lotus chairman is jailed for fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR FRED BUSHELL, the former Group Lotus chairman, was jailed for three years
and fined Pounds 2.25m yesterday for his part in a conspiracy that defrauded
De Lorean Motor Cars, the Belfast manufacturing subsidiary of Mr John De
Lorean's abortive sports car venture, of Dollars 17.65m.
Lord Justice Murray, sentencing Mr Bushell in Belfast Crown Court yesterday,
described him as a key figure in 'a bare-faced, outrageous and massive
fraud'.
The Belfast venture collapsed 10 years ago after nearly Pounds 78m of
taxpayers' money had been invested in it.
The government and Cork Gully, the receivers, are still seeking to recover
funds from Mr De Lorean and others. So far, about Pounds 14m has been
retrieved. The government is also suing Arthur Andersen, the De Lorean
auditors, for Pounds 240m, claiming the firm should have been aware of
mismanagement.
Mr Bushell pleaded guilty to conspiring with Mr De Lorean, the late Colin
Chapman, founder of Group Lotus, and others to defraud the Belfast company
over a four-year period to December 1982.
Lord Justice Murray said both Mr De Lorean and Chapman would have merited a
sentence of 10 years for their part in the conspiracy. Mr Bushell was
receiving a reduced sentence because of his late decision to plead guilty
and his poor health. Mr De Lorean faces arrest should he return to the UK.
Mr Bushell was also ordered to pay Pounds 100,000 costs and was warned that
his sentence would be increased to four years if he failed to pay the full
fine. The judge ordered that Pounds 702,010 frozen in a Swiss bank account -
and now part of the Pounds 2.25m - be made the subject of a compensation
order.
The court was told that Mr Bushell had received Dollars 848,000 in the
fraud, much of which had never been recovered. The judge said he was making
the costs order because he was satisfied Mr Bushell had engaged in hindering
activities.
Earlier, the court had heard how De Lorean Motor Company had entered into a
Dollars 17.65m contract in 1978 for Lotus to develop the prototype. The work
was supposed to have been paid for by US investors, but instead was paid for
by De Lorean Motor Cars, the government-funded Belfast manufacturing
subsidiary.
None of the money was received by Group Lotus. Mr Bushell and his fellow
conspirators kept it after it had been funnelled through a
Panamanian-registered, Geneva-based company, GPD Services, which had been
set up a year earlier by Chapman and Mr Bushell.
The work was later carried out by Group Lotus but paid, on another invoice,
by the Belfast company.
The prosecution said the fraud had inflicted a serious financial loss on the
De Lorean company and was one of the factors that led its collapse.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Blue Arrow accused may dismiss lawyers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TWO defendants in the second Blue Arrow fraud trial are likely to
dismiss their lawyers and defend themselves in court because they face heavy
tax bills on their fast rising legal costs.
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew has agreed to pay the legal fees incurred by Mr Paul
Smallwood and Mr Tim Brown, former equities directors with the company, who
are charged with conspiracy to defraud over their roles in the 1987 Blue
Arrow rights issue.
Under Inland Revenue rules, those payments will be treated as benefits in
kind to be taxed at the 40 per cent top rate - leaving both with possible
income tax liabilities of up to Pounds 400,000 if convicted.
The total bills for the two defendants, both represented by MacFarlanes, the
City solicitors, and barristers led by Mr Anthony Arlidge QC, are each
expected to approach Pounds 1m by the end of the trial.
The prospect of such large tax bills forced both Mr Smallwood and Mr Brown
to consider giving up the services of their lawyers.
Although they have yet to reach a final decision and are still examining the
possibility of receiving legal aid to pay for new lawyers, both have
effectively reconciled themselves to mounting their own courtroom defences
without qualified legal assistance.
The trial, which is expected to last about three months, is due to start
early in October.
Both Mr Smallwood and Mr Brown are believed to be well aware of the strains
and pitfalls of mounting their own defences - as demonstrated earlier this
year by Mr Roger Seelig, a former Morgan Grenfell corporate finance
director, prosecuted over his role in the Guinness affair.
Mr Seelig's trial was abandoned after the stresses of defending himself
drove him to the brink of a nervous breakdown. Court proceedings had been
slowed by Mr Seelig's emotional outbursts and psychiatrists brought in to
examine him expressed concern that he had become potentially suicidal.
The tax liability has not arisen with those Blue Arrow defendants formerly
employed by County NatWest. Unlike Phillips &amp; Drew, County has undertaken to
meet the personal tax liabilities of all former employees prosecuted by the
Serious Fraud Office over the affair.
The issue is now understood to be the subject of 'sensitive' discussions
between County and the Inland Revenue.
Mr Justice Brooke, the judge in charge of the two forthcoming Blue Arrow
trials, yesterday rejected claims on behalf of the four remaining defendants
that charges against them should be dropped because they could not be given
a fair trial.
The trial of Mr Charles Villiers, a former County chairman, and Ms Elizabeth
Brimelow, a former County compliance director, is expected to start in
January.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Partner at BDO resigns after coup
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NATIONAL managing partner of BDO Binder Hamlyn, the eighth-largest UK
accountancy firm by fee income, resigned on Thursday night after a
partnership coup removed him from his post.
Mr Chris Swinson was replaced by Mr John Norton, the existing senior
partner, at a meeting of the firm's national partnership committee. Mr
Swinson resigned from the firm shortly afterwards.
Mr Swinson said yesterday that his resignation had followed 'a dispute about
the future management of the business'. He said: 'It was just untenable to
continue with the firm.'
He denied that the dispute was over a possible merger with another
accountancy firm,
'I have a mixture of emotions,' Mr Swinson said. 'Some of it is relief, some
of it is disappointment. I am currently examining my options and enjoying
the company of my family.'
Mr Swinson has been an outspoken voice in the accountancy profession and he
failed to win the vice-presidency of the Institute of Chartered Accountants
in England and Wales this year. He had been widely credited with saving BDO
when he was appointed a few years ago.
Earlier this month BDO reported fee income down by more than 4 per cent, one
of only four of the top 25 firms to report an absolute decline. The result
reduced its ranking from seventh to eighth-largest UK firm.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SYMBOLISM rather than substance dominated the first negotiations yesterday
between Northern Ireland Unionists and the Irish government since 1973 - or
since partition in the 1920s, depending on definitions.
This was not 'strand two' of the talks on Northern Ireland's future. It was
about drawing up an agenda for the point when the Irish government will
formally enter to talk about relations between north and south Ireland. Sir
Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, has still to announce when that
will be.
As befitted a meeting no side wanted to overpromote, delegations were of
officials or MPs, not party leaders and ministers.
Arrivals were in modest official saloons or black cabs. Confidentiality was
kept.
The Rev Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist party was expected to be the most
recalcitrant. He wants strand one - on devolution, and still supposedly
taking place in Belfast - finished before strand two starts. But he sent his
daughter Rhonda and Mr Nigel Dodds, a former lord mayor of Belfast - the
grandest post in Ulster's local politics, even if its responsibilities
stretch only to bins, bogs and burials.
As for other portents, Dr Chris McGimpsey, of the Ulster Unionist party,
wore a green tie.
The nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party - the most keen on strand
two and strand three (the final strand) - arrived 10 minutes late. 'Bomb
scares all over the place,' said Mr Seamus Mallon, SDLP deputy leader.
The independent chairman was Sir Ninian Stephen, former governor-general of
Australia. He has had a rapid lesson in the nuances of Northern Ireland
politics.
Inside, the delegations sat around a rectangular ash table with green inlay.
They talked, broke for lunch, then met again.
Late in the afternoon, as a storm broke over Westminster, a statement was
agreed. 'The parties completed consideration of a possible agenda for strand
two,' it said. As with the thunder, it was not clear what was foreshadowed.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Some MCC businesses to be sold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OFFICIAL Airline Guides, bought by Robert Maxwell for Dollars 750m in 1988,
is to be sold to meet some of the debts of Maxwell Communication
Corporation.
OAG, a provider of airline schedule and fare information, along with a
number of other MCC information businesses will go by trade sale or public
offering.
Price Waterhouse, the administrator, has divided the main MCC assets in the
US into two parts: the Macmillan publishing businesses, which are to be
retained; and the information businesses, which will be sold.
Macmillan Publishing, which includes college, trade and reference books, is
likely to be floated next year.
The sale of the US businesses is expected to raise a total of between
Dollars 700m (Pounds 375.2m) and Dollars 1.1bn, as well as about Pounds 100m
from UK businesses, net of tax and other costs.
The proposals for Macmillan and OAG do not cover the group's 56 per cent
shareholding in Berlitz International, which is the subject of legal action.
Ownership is contested between Macmillan and a number of financial
institutions, to which the shares were allegedly pledged by private Maxwell
companies as security for loans.
No agreed list of creditors has yet been drawn up, but the total sum owed is
estimated at about Pounds 1.6bn.
The administrators say the Macmillan and OAG businesses are well managed and
profitable, and will be held as long as necessary to achieve full value.
MCC is in administration in the UK and under Chapter 11 protection in the
US. Administrators in both countries have been trying to find common legal
ground between the different requirements of UK and US bankruptcy law.
Apart from OAG, the administrators plan to sell:
Standard Rate &amp; Data Service, which compiles and distributes media and
marketing information to US advertising agencies.
Molecular Design, the supplier of information management systems for
pharmaceutical and chemical research.
PF Collier, which publishes and markets the Collier Encyclopedia.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Maxwell saga enters new phase: How the investigations may
develop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ARREST and charging of Mr Kevin Maxwell and Mr Ian Maxwell this week -
together with Mr Larry Trachtenberg, the US businessman who was one of their
investment strategists - propels the Maxwell investigation into a new phase.
Media reporting about the Maxwell brothers and Mr Trachtenberg is now
restricted by the rules of contempt of court. The recent flood of
'signature' stories - about who allegedly signed which documents and when -
had started piecing together a public explanation of how the money may have
vanished. The flood will now largely stop.
But the investigation by the administrators of Robert Maxwell's collapsed
business empire and by the provisional liquidators of the raided pension
funds continues, and so will the accompanying civil cases in the courts over
the ownership of the assets of the Maxwell empire.
Several pressing questions remain to be answered.
First, how much can be recovered for the pensioners? The Maxwell pension
funds should have been worth more than Pounds 670m. Instead, Pounds 448m of
the assets are missing.
Some cash is now in the hands of the banks. The tussle between banks and
pensioners will be one of the focuses of civil actions that will occupy the
next few years.
Meanwhile, MPs from both sides of the Commons have declared that the banks
have a 'moral responsibility' to return some of the money. Mr Peter Lilley,
social security secretary, announced last week a government trust to solicit
contributions for the Maxwell pensioners. Mr Lilley suggested that financial
institutions might feel they had some responsibility to recompense Maxwell
pensioners.
The trust arose out of the intense public pressure of the past two weeks,
both from the press and from the recent pensioners' march on the Commons.
Its aims may well be too optimistic; financial institutions have reacted
with indignation, saying they are not responsible for the alleged fraud. The
issue will be systematically and probably more effectively tackled in the
courts, but that will take years. Until the response of the banks is
clearer, the government has allocated just Pounds 2.5m as an emergency fund
for the Maxwell pensioners.
There will also be civil actions against individuals. Robson Rhodes, the
accountancy firm appointed to try to recover pension money, already has
actions for recovery of assets against both Maxwell brothers.
The second main question awaiting an answer concerns the mysterious overseas
Swiss, Gibraltar and Liechtenstein trusts set up by Maxwell. Up to this
point, investigators' have been rebuffed by laws of confidentiality of those
countries.
But those trusts, which are the ultimate owners of some of his companies,
also handled hundreds of millions of pounds of cash in the last year of
Maxwell's life, flowing in and out of his more accessible UK and US
companies.
So far, the investigators have not found evidence of a hidden Maxwell pot of
gold that would offer some comfort to the creditors and pensioners'
difficulties. If there is one, though, it lies in some of those trusts.
Last week saw a second, unexpected response to press and public pressure:
the first press conference by Dr Werner Keicher, director of the secretive
Liechtenstein-based Maxwell Foundation, which is one of the owners of the
Maxwell corporate empire. Dr Keicher indicated that he was willing to
co-operate with UK investigators in establishing whether money could be
retrieved for victims of the Maxwell fraud.
Attention is also likely to turn to the question of whether the professional
firms involved - auditors, actuaries, merchant banks, stockbrokers -
fulfilled their responsibilities. Similar questions can  - and will - be
directed against Imro, the fund management watchdog, which had the
responsibility for licensing and supervising the Maxwell pension management
companies.
The alleged offences in the charges made against the Maxwell brothers and Mr
Trachtenberg occurred between November 1990 and December 1991, five weeks
after Robert Maxwell's death. The questions that may be directed to
professional firms are likely to cover whether they should have detected
worrying patterns of behaviour as far back as 1989. Robson Rhodes has said
that in its view some of the pension funds' trading may have been highly
irregular from that date.
Robert Maxwell's last will and testament left more than Pounds 2m to his
family and friends, with the rest of his personal estate going to a variety
of causes. It is expected to go to probate. Once that happens, it will be in
the public domain and will form part of the assets to which the various
creditors have claims.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A DEVICE to block construction of a road by selling small plots of land to
protesters was dismissed as 'frivolous and vexatious' by the High Court
yesterday.
The Norfolk branch of Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure
group, had paid about Pounds 2,000 for a  3/4 -mile stretch of disused
railway line lying across the proposed route of the Wymondham bypass. It
then sold plots to 1,700 supporters and claimed that the Department of
Transport had failed in its legal duty to notify each individual plot owner
of its plan to acquire their land through compulsory purchase orders.
Mr Justice McCullough ruled that the scheme was a device to frustrate the
department.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Pilots' union picks former Communist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FORMER Communist has been elected general secretary of the British Airline
Pilots Association (Balpa) - a union that has traditionally prided itself on
being non-political but which is thought to have a relatively high
proportion of Conservative voters.
Mr Chris Darke, 42, an official of the MSF general technical union for 15
years, won 57 per cent of the votes in a ballot that attracted a 61 per cent
turnout among Balpa's 5,300 members. He will start the Pounds 45,000-a-year
job next month.
Balpa's national executive had backed Mr Darke, but supporters of Mr David
Lebrecht, Balpa assistant general secretary and the only other candidate,
said most members were unaware of Mr Darke's political background when they
made the decision in March.
During the election campaign Mr Lebrecht's supporters enlisted Mr Norman
Tebbit, former employment secretary and Balpa member, who warned that the
union was in danger of losing its apolitical reputation if it elected Mr
Darke.
Mr Darke said yesterday he had never tried to hide his former membership of
the Communist party. He had left the party in 1985 'because I fundamentally
disagreed with what they were doing' and now described himself as centre
left in the Labour party.
The job of general secretary of Balpa was not about politics, he said. 'If
Balpa did subscribe to any political view my first advice would be to
isolate from it as speedily as possible.'
Mr Darke wants Balpa to play a central role in developing the European
Cockpit Association, an embryonic European union for flying crew. 'It has
tremendous potential to become the first truly European union,' he said.
Mr Darke's election follows the death last year of Mark Young, who was
general secretary for 17 years.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Levy is threatened to curb packaging
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LEVY may be introduced to curb extravagant use of paper and packaging for
food, clothing and other consumer goods if voluntary action fails, Mr David
Maclean, a junior environment minister, warned in the Commons yesterday.
He supported demands from all quarters of the Commons for further pressure
to be imposed on packagers and retailers to reduce unnecessary packaging and
waste.
Mr Maclean acknowledged the advantage of action on a European Community
basis to deal with the issue, but emphasised the importance of ensuring that
taxation of needless packaging should be handled at national level.
Although the government had no objection in principle to 'an economic
instrument such as a packaging levy', he stressed that the role of the EC in
fiscal policy needed 'very careful consideration'.
Mr Maclean said officials of his department had met representatives of the
packaging industry three times in the past six months to discuss ways of
eliminating unnecessary packaging and reducing the amount of wrapping that
is thrown away.
The government had indicated that it was prepared to take action 'if the
industry does not produce substantive proposals'.
Mr Maclean said the British Retail Consortium had recently issued guidance
on retail packaging to its members and their suppliers. Next week, he said,
the industry would announce an initiative to deal with complaints about
over-packaging.
Illustrating his department's commitment to recycling, Mr Maclean said 230
tonnes of waste paper had been collected since October 1990.
He predicted that the target of recycling 25 per cent of household waste
would be achieved in the year 2000.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Shipper for trial on Nissan UK charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TORE ARNE THORSEN, managing director of Scansiris AS, a Norwegian
shipping agency, has been committed to Southwark Crown Court for trial on
charges alleging corporation tax fraud at Nissan UK, the former importer and
distributor of Nissan vehicles in Britain, Kevin Done writes.
Also named in the charges against Mr Thorsen are Mr Octav Botnar, chairman
and managing director of Nissan UK, and Mr Michael Hunt, deputy chairman and
assistant managing director of Nissan UK. Mr Thorsen was committed for trial
by Teesside magistrates on Thursday.
A warrant for the arrest of Mr Botnar was issued by the Inland Revenue in
January, when he was in Switzerland. He has not returned since to the UK.
The Swiss embassy said yesterday there was no agreement between the UK and
Switzerland for extradition on alleged tax offences.
Mr Hunt and Mr Frank Shannon, a former Nissan UK finance director, were
committed last month by magistrates in Worthing, West Sussex, for trial on
related charges of corporation tax fraud. Their trial, which was originally
set for the Old Bailey, will also now take place at Southwark Crown Court.
The charge against Mr Thorsen alleges that 'together with Octav Botnar and
Michael Hunt' he sought to defraud the Inland Revenue of corporation tax.
The charge alleges that with Mr Botnar and Mr Hunt he dishonestly arranged
for invoices to be prepared by Scansiris with falsely inflated freight
charges due from Nissan UK.
The amounts were allegedly entered in the Nissan UK accounts for the years
1983 to 1992, resulting in Nissan UK's pre-tax profits being understated by
Pounds 100m.

FT  20 JUN 92 / PM gives charter renewed impetus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR underlined his commitment to improving public services
yesterday and gave fresh impetus to the Citizen's Charter, making clear that
it would remain a priority.
A discussion for cabinet ministers and senior officials at Downing Street,
chaired by the prime minister, represented an important element in
attempting to shake off the charter's 'pre-election gimmick' label.
Mr William Waldegrave, the public-services minister, said after the meeting:
'The whole charter programme has become a fundamental part of the way
Whitehall is doing its work. The Citizen's Charter is with us and with you
permanently.' Mr Waldegrave emphasised that the benefits from a continuing
programme of rising standards would become ever more apparent as the
initiatives became more entrenched.
Departments should understand that setting real standards that might be
missed at first was preferable to setting targets so low they were bound to
be achieved.
Pointing out that raising standards could provide savings and did not
inevitably involve more public spending, Mr Waldegrave said that in effect
he had a veto over whether his colleagues could invoke the charter in their
spending discussions with the Treasury.
A white paper will be published in the autumn and there will be a further
seminar early next year to mark progress.
Among specific measures highlighted were:
Education: fuller information about every school is to be available locally
from next year, and the task of providing information is to be taken away
from local education authorities. Also included is the higher and further
education charter, whose provisions will include the right of students not
to join the National Union of Students.
Health: the aims involve an extension of the patients' charter to include
standards in GP services; as well as guaranteed waiting times for certain
routine operations, such as hip and knee replacements and cataract removals,
to be reduced from two years to 18 months from April next year. Transport:
the London Underground charter is to be published next month - it was
originally scheduled for the end of March. Also included is better
information for road users and a trial project of bus-stop indicators giving
the arrival time of the next bus.
Other measures include consideration by the Department of Trade and Industry
of 'first-stop shops' to provide a point of contact for small business.
There will also be a further extension of performance-related pay, and a
pilot scheme in Birmingham to test the benefits agency and the employment
service working together to make applying for benefits easier.
However, Labour attacked the charter for failing to protect consumers from
steep price rises in privatised utilities.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow trade and industry secretary, said every family was
paying Pounds 390 a year in contributions to the pre-tax profits of the
privatised utility companies. He called for an immediate cut in prices and
the introduction of ombudsmen to oversee the utilities.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Tokyo boosted by hopes of public works package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE JAPANESE stock market rebounded yesterday on hopes that the government
might soon boost the economy with a package of public works spending of as
much as Y5,000bn-Y8,000bn (Pounds 21bn-Pounds 33bn).
The Nikkei market index, which earlier this week had fallen to its lowest
level for five years, jumped 474.31 points to 16,519.87 as investors took
heart from indications that the government might start serious preparations
for a supplementary budget to expand the budget already agreed for the
current financial year, which started in April.
Investors were particularly interested in indications that the ruling
Liberal Democratic party was increasing pressure on the bureaucracy to act
before the summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations in Munich
early next month.
Mr Shin Kanemaru, the LDP's vice president, urged that a secondary budget be
prepared soon, in order to prevent the country coming under pressure for
extra public spending from the US at a later date.
Mr Kanemaru also told a meeting of LDP officials that he wanted a budget of
Y8,000bn, substantially more than a proposal of Y5,000bn which had
previously been informally discussed by the party. The party officials
agreed to prepare specific plans by the end of the month.
However, the Ministry of Finance rebuffed Mr Kanemaru's appeal, saying it
was still too early to judge the full impact of spending measures approved
in March, when public works planned for the second half of the financial
year were advanced into the first six months.
Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, rejected calls to stimulate the
economy.
He told journalists: 'People suffering from diabetes want to eat a lot but
if you give them as much as they want, it will ruin their health.'
Despite Mr Hata's protestations, it is widely assumed in Tokyo that there
will indeed be a supplementary budget. However, there is a serious debate in
the government over its size and timing.
Finance Ministry officials would like to see a budget of no more than
Y3,000bn or so, and would prefer to wait until September for a decision. LDP
leaders, however, want at least an announcement of intent by the end of this
month, to be followed by a concrete plan before elections to the upper house
of the Diet (parliament) at the end of July.

THE FBI has arrested and charged two people with the kidnapping of Mr Sidney
Reso, the head of Exxon's international division, who disappeared from his
New Jersey home on April 29, Alan Friedman writes from New York.
But in a bizarre twist to the seven-week saga, law enforcement authorities
said last night they had not yet found Mr Reso even though they had two of
his suspected kidnappers. They said Mr Arthur Seale and his wife Mrs Irene
Seale, both from New Jersey, were being charged with kidnapping and
conspiracy to kidnap and commit extortion.
The FBI said the two had been identified as the authors of a ransom note
sent early last month claiming that Mr Reso was being held by a militant
environmental group called the Rainbow Warriors. But the FBI believed there
was actually no such group.
The bureau said Mr Seale was a security employee at Exxon, but left six
years ago. The two suspects were arrested while returning a rental car in
Hackensack, New Jersey, that the FBI said had been used in connection with
the abduction of Mr Reso.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Japan adds a new number to its exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE LATEST Japanese export to hit the UK is not a car or a new kind of
electronic camera but the mathematics textbooks of Mr Toru Kumon.
For decades, British educators have assumed they had little to learn from
Japan. Even though Japan's schools produced well-trained young people, it
was generally thought their good academic results were achieved mainly at
the cost of excessive discipline.
Mr Kumon, a 78-year-old retired teacher, believes the methods he has used in
Japan for over 30 years work well with children anywhere.
His books have been introduced in the US and elsewhere but until recently
they were virtually unknown in the UK. Now he is expanding fast. At the
start of 1992, there were just two British Kumon-trained teachers. By the
end of the year there will be 50.
Mr Kumon has no time for teaching 'concepts' or letting children 'discover'
maths for themselves by playing with coloured bricks or pocket calculators.
Instead, he relies entirely on children working their way through 3,800
pages of repetitive exercises. The worksheets are designed so that children
can work on their own all the way from kindergarten games to differential
calculus.
The teacher guides children through difficult stages and corrects answers to
make sure that a child gets full marks before moving from one level to
another.
With Mr Kumon, the only acceptable mark is 100 per cent. For lower scores
the sole remedy is more practice.
Mr Kumon talks with a passion which belies his years. 'Almost all children
can do better if only they are properly taught,' he says. 'If a top teacher
teaches an average child, the child's ratings go up. If a top child is given
an average teacher, the child's ratings go down. Those educators who are not
willing to learn themselves should give up teaching.'
Mr Kumon, himself a retired teacher, devised his methods in the early 1950s
when he was helping his young son with his maths homework and later devised
programmes for learning Japanese, English and other languages. Now he has
1.6m pupils in Japan and 1.9m worldwide.
Like a magician pulling rabbits out of a hat, Mr Kumon loves to give
examples of the achievements of Kumon-trained children.
His current favourite is a five-year-old Japanese girl studying English who
can write critical evaluations of university-level texts.
He holds up her worksheet, complete with comments scrawled in five-year-old
handwriting on a passage from Mr Edwin Reischauer, a noted American scholar
and former US ambassador to Japan.
Mr Kumon also has available assessments of the merits of his methods.
Unfortunately, there are none from Japan because the Ministry of Education
does not allow his materials to be used in schools, nor has it carried out
any comparative tests. But outside Japan, where Kumon materials are mostly
used in regular schools, the method has been examined more rigorously.
For example, at Christ Episcopalian School in Texas, the average maths score
of six-year-old children rose during a year from 53 per cent to 81 per cent,
as measured by a widely used American test. The average score for
10-year-olds rose from 76 per cent to 94 per cent.
Other schools in Texas, and in Alabama, Michigan and Mississippi reported
similar advances.
Critics say that the samples are too small to offer conclusive proof. Even
though thousands of American schools have studied Kumon materials, only 300
have actually introduced them.
Critics say Mr Kumon puts too much emphasis on repetitive drills. The
workbooks, they say, are boring and expensive, and the method itself is
little more than glorified rote-learning.
Mr Kumon's supporters in the US reply that the results speak for themselves.
Most American teachers who use Kumon materials do so for just 15 to 20

FT  20 JUN 92 / Czechoslovaks agree to form two nations
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CZECH and Slovak leaders announced early today that they had agreed to
prepare the splitting up of Czechoslovakia into two separate states,
Agencies report from Bratislava.
The announcement came after almost 14 hours of negotiations in Bratislava
between teams headed by Mr Vaclav Klaus, the Czech leader, and his Slovak
counterpart, Mr Vladimir Meciar. The planned orderly break-up of the
74-year-old Czechoslovak federation comes in the wake of elections two weeks
ago.
In the poll Mr Meciar's nationalist Movement for a Democratic Slovakia
(HZDS) performed strongly in the Slovak region. Mr Klaus, who as finance
minister carried through post-communist reforms, had a political victory in
the Czech republic.
The two leaders said they had agreed on forming a new interim federal
government and on its functions. The new government would 'prepare, if it is
authorised, conditions for a smooth functioning of two sovereign states with
international status,' Mr Klaus said.
The two men said the regional Czech and Slovak parliaments would decide on
how best to divide Czechoslovakia into two states. The legislative process
would begin in both parliaments on September 30.
Mr Meciar said: 'Both victorious political parties consider as a common task
to initiate by constitutional means a process that will lead by September 30
to an agreement between National Councils (regional parliaments) on the
issue of the state set-up.'
Mr Meciar had wanted to transform Czechoslovakia into a confederation. But
Mr Klaus's Civic Democratic party (ODS) rejected this, saying that if the
present federation was to be so loosened, it would be better to split.
The Slovak side also previously said it wanted a referendum on independence
early next year, postponing dissolution of the federation until the end of
1993. But such demands are unacceptable to the Czechs, who fear the crisis
could delay integration with the west.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A PERMANENT United Nations force that would respond to outright aggression,
'imminent or actual', has been proposed by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN
secretary general.
His recommendations for measures to increase the world body's effectiveness
in the post-Cold War era are contained in a 52-page document, requested by
the Security Council at the summit meeting in January initiated and presided
over by Mr John Major, the UK prime minister.
Mr Boutros Ghali is to visit London early next month and will be amplifying
his ideas in talks with Mr Major.
The possibility of establishing a permanent force was envisaged when the UN
was founded in 1945 but the Cold War, during which no fewer than 279 vetoes
were cast, blocked formal action.
Observing that the UN 'must never again be crippled as it was in the era
that has passed', the secretary general also said the collapse of communism
presented an opportunity not to be squandered. However, his proposal accords
more with ideas long advocated by Moscow than with what the west has been
prepared to accept.
Mr Vladimir Petrovsky, a former Soviet deputy foreign minister and now a
senior UN official, helped draft the report. Mr Edward Perkins, the US
ambassador, was not consulted during its preparation and the State
Department voiced reservations last April about any proposal to negotiate
agreements to provide the Security Council with permanent troops under the
control of the Military Staff Committee.
Noting that the Council had not so far used military force coercively, Mr
Boutros Ghali recalled that in the Gulf War members 'chose to authorise
member states to take measures on its behalf'. But having UN troops ready
and on call could serve as a means to deter breaches of the peace. Mr
Giandomenico Picco, the UN negotiator who obtained the release of western
hostages in Beirut, including the last two Germans freed this week, is
resigning for personal reasons, it was announced last night.
He is in Vienna this weekend for talks with Iraqi officials on a possible
resumption of oil shipments. His resignation takes effect on July 31.

FT  20 JUN 92 / WEU to be given military units for peacekeeping role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN and defence ministers from nine European countries agreed in Bonn
yesterday to give the dormant Western European Union defence organisation a
genuine military capability to enable it to take part in international
peacekeeping and peacemaking operations.
But it was clear that member states continue to disagree on the precise
circumstances in which their troops would be made available.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, with the Yugoslav conflict
clearly in mind, emphasised that if peacemaking meant that member states
would be prepared to impose a political solution by force, he believed that
was excluded 'both in practice and in theory'.
The Germans and French, however, were much more prepared to envisage a
peacemaking role for WEU forces, though Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign
minister, conceded that Germany would not be 'in the forefront' of those
advocating such a role because of its constitutional restrictions on
employing German troops abroad.
What was made clear in the so-called 'Petersburg Declaration,' named after
the mansion on the outskirts of Bonn where the conference was held, was that
the WEU would take part in peacekeeping, and humanitarian operations only at
the request of other international organisations such as the United Nations
and the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE).
Every decision to answer such requests would be taken on a case-by-case
basis and individual member countries would reserve their sovereign right to
participate or not.
Though the ministers, who hailed their declaration as an important step
towards forging a European defence identity, said they were ready to make
available to the WEU military units 'from the whole spectrum of their
conventional armed forces', no final decision was taken on precisely which
units would be assigned to the organisation.
However, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the British defence secretary, said there had
been wide support for his proposal that multinational units such as the
planned Dutch-Belgian-German-British Nato rapid reaction force and the
UK-Netherlands amphibious force should also be put at the disposal of the
WEU under so-called 'double hatting' arrangements.
Though France and Germany are also prepared to make available to WEU their
proposed joint 'Eurocorps', Mr Rifkind indicated that Britain and some other
member countries had expressed 'ongoing concerns' about the confusion that
would arise from the fact that German troops came under Nato command, while
French forces were outside the Nato command structure.
In a special declaration on Yugoslavia, the ministers said the WEU was
prepared, 'within the bounds of its possibilities', to contribute towards
the effective implementation of UN Security Council resolutions on the
application of sanctions against Serbia.

FT  20 JUN 92 / The Irish Referendum: Maastricht wins a vital breathing
space - The main problem for the treaty is that governments have moved ahead
of their voters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN he heard that the Danes had voted No in their Maastricht referendum, a
very senior Commission official summed up the situation with undiplomatic
frankness: 'Nous sommes dans la merde]' The Yes vote in the Irish referendum
goes a long way to restore morale and rectify the balance, as does
yesterday's vote in the French National Assembly. But neither of these
events, welcome as they are, can change the fundamental problem: that the
treaty has been rejected by one of the signatory states. In this sense, we
are still 'dans la merde'.
Instant solutions on offer tend to fall into three categories: 1, Dump the
treaty. 2, Dump Jacques Delors. 3, Dump the Danes. The Danish referendum is
invoked to prove that the treaty is no good, and should be
abandoned/weakened/strengthened. Alternatively, Mr Delors is a symbol of
everything that is wrong with the Community, because he is too
federalist/French/socialist/European/successful/foreign/Christian
Democrat/pleased with himself; so, off with his head] Finally, the Danes
have shown that they are unsatisfactory Europeans, so they should be bundled
out of the new Europe.
Unfortunately, none of these nostrums will quite do. The twelve may very
well be driven to a renegotiation, if they want to salvage anything from
Maastricht. But to pretend that this road offers a simple solution is just
not serious; does anyone know exactly why the Danes voted No and what would
make them vote Yes?
The British government's campaign against Mr Delors borders on the
contemptible. Last December Mr John Major described Maastricht as 'Game, set
and match to Britain'; he surely cannot now insinuate that a treaty which
was negotiated by 12 sovereign governments was in fact foisted on them by Mr
Delors.
Dumping the Danes runs up against a battery of objections: it would be
illegal, unconstitutional, anti-democratic, uncivilised and un-European. But
the most serious objection to this particular prescription is its underlying
assumption that this is a problem confined to Denmark. In fact, there are at
least three large member states where Maastricht is or could be in trouble.
Six months ago British spokesmen were adopting a most condescending attitude
towards the ratification problems facing other member states; Britain, they
said, was the only properly functioning democracy, it had had its debate,
and parliament was solidly on board. Today, it appears that the government
simply could not command a majority to ratify the treaty.
One might expect Maastricht to have a hard time in Britain, because the
British government remains as sceptical about the Community as ever. But the
French and German governments are the chief architects of the new Europe,
and they too are going through rough water.
Reports from Germany say that ratification should eventually come right. But
in the meantime, the debate is stirring heavy passions, and giving rise to a
serious constitutional power struggle between the centre and the Lander.
In France the parliament is half way to the necessary revision of the
constitution; but the ratification referendum planned for the autumn will be
fiercely contested by nationalists across the board, and no one can be sure
that it will not go wrong for the government.
These passionate debates throw an instructive light on the Maastricht
dilemma. The commonest criticism of the treaty is that it is a portmanteau
of heterogeneous ingredients, which is as muddled as it is unreadable.
People do not like it, because they do not understand it; therefore, the
argument goes on, we should improve the treaty by simplifying it.
The passion of the arguments between the pros and the antis suggests an
entirely different diagnosis. Yes, the treaty is an amalgam of different
ingredients, which makes it baffling to the casual reader. This is a serious
disadvantage at this stage in the ratification process, because we cannot
know precisely why the Danes voted No, nor whether some small detailed
revisions would get them to change their minds.
But it is clear from the debates in Britain, France and Germany that their
political elites understand the thrust of the treaty very well indeed: some
like it, and some hate it, but they all know that this is a treaty with
colossal political implications.
It is these political implications which set Maastricht in a different class
from previous agreements in the development of the Community. The customs
union and the single market could be regarded as predictable, pre-defined
policy contracts, from which the economy of each member state could be
expected to draw separate national advantages. But Maastricht is quite
different, in the sense that the two central pillars - monetary union and
foreign policy - will involve jointly negotiated policies for maximising
collective advantages in the name of the common interest.
This does not, of course, mean that the Community is about to become a
federation. But it does mean that going along with Maastricht calls for a
much greater depth of political commitment than seemed to be required by the
Treaty of Rome.
This is perhaps the heart of the problem. The key characteristic of
Maastricht is that it includes far-reaching objectives for action in the
future. The member governments clearly believed that a large leap forward in
Community integration was both necessary really count on their electorates
to follow them?
If that kind of commitment is to be reliable, then surely the treaty must be
supported by more than a bare majority of the electorate. It must have a
breadth of popular support which could survive a change of government. Does
anybody think that Denmark would be a dependable partner in the construction
of a common foreign policy, if the referendum had gone the other way, but
only by 50.7 per cent?
And what about France? Opinion polls predict three things: a majority may
vote for Maastricht in September; the Gaullists may lead a right-wing
government after the next general elections in March; and Mr Jacques Chirac,
the Gaullist leader, will be a front-runner in the presidential elections in
1995. Yet half the Gaullists are bitterly hostile to Maastricht, and the
party is so divided on the issue that Mr Chirac dare not say anything about
it.
If the Irish had voted No, Maastricht would have been lost with all hands.
The fact that they have voted Yes gives the Community a desperately needed
breathing space. But Europe's governments need to use the space, starting
with their Lisbon summit next week, to consider whether they, like the
Danish elite, have moved too far ahead of their electorates, and if so, what
they need to do to get back in touch.

<TEXT>
THE result of the Irish referendum was greeted with delight and relief in
the German government yesterday.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl said: 'The people of Ireland have read the signs of
the times correctly. Now we must press ahead to European union swiftly and
with determination.'
Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, said at a meeting of Western
European Union foreign and defence ministers in Bonn that the result showed
that 'Europe indeed lives and the European train is gathering steam. There
is no alternative to European union.'
Nevertheless public opinion in Germany is increasingly sceptical about the
advantages of European integration, and above all about the replacement of
the D-Mark with a single European currency.
Mr Kohl has admitted that the treaty is far from perfect, but he is
determined to press ahead with ratification in Germany in spite of the
public misgivings.
He faces a key meeting next week with the prime ministers of the 16 German
states to resolve differences over the future control of EC policy between
the central government and the states.
Western Germans would narrowly reject the Maastricht treaty if it were put
to a referendum, an opinion poll found yesterday, Reuter reports from Bonn.
Only 42 per cent would support a political union with a common currency,
said the Emnid Institute poll due to be published by the weekly Der Spiegel.
The poll was conducted after Denmark rejected the treaty but before the
Irish referendum result.
Emnid said it would conduct another poll next week with the same question,
adding: 'The result of the referendum in Ireland will certainly influence
opinions.'
The poll was conducted only in western Germany, the politically dominant
four-fifths of the reunited nation.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Irish government may have cleared the referendum hurdle, but it faces a
tougher battle to resolve potential conflicts between EC law and Ireland's
anti-abortion laws.
The anti-abortion lobby, prominent in the No campaign, has promised to do
battle again in the autumn, this time on another referendum specifically on
abortion.
At Ireland's behest, a protocol was inserted into the Maastricht treaty
under which the subsidiarity principle would apply to Ireland's
right-to-life 1983 constitutional amendment, giving EC courts no
jurisdiction over Ireland on this issue.
However, a Supreme Court ruling last February, allowing a 14-year-old rape
victim to go abroad for an abortion, interpreted the 1983 amendment and the
protocol in such a way as to permit abortion in Ireland in cases where the
mother's life was threatened.
A subsequent memorandum of understanding has been signed by EC foreign
ministers, committing them to accommodating within the Maastricht framework
any further changes in Ireland's abortion laws.

BELGIUM, the Netherlands and Luxembourg want guarantees of the rights of
small states when the European Community gets larger, Portuguese officials
said yesterday, Reuter reports from Lisbon.
If agreed at the Lisbon summit on June 26 and 27, a clause on guarantees
could be added to the Maastricht treaty.
It would be similar to an addendum proposed by Britain to enshrine the
principle of subsidiarity.
Several small states are worried that expansion of the 12-nation EC will
limit their impact on Community decision-making and deprive them of control
over key areas of policy.
Portugal hopes the Lisbon summit will agree on a strategy for enlarging the
Community.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK, which takes over the rotating EC presidency in 10 days' time, will
try to calm fears of unaccountable supra-nationalism by spelling out what
'subsidiarity' means.
This principle, which Maastricht the treaty incorporates into European law
for the first time, in theory means that decisions should be taken at the
lowest practicable level of government. In EC terms, it means the Community
acts together only when doing so is more effective than individual countries
acting alone.
The British government believes highlighting this principle will mollify
those resisting what they see as a drift of decision-making to Brussels. In
fact, generally only the Commission can make proposals, while only the 12
governments can make decisions, and the European parliament has limited
amending powers.
One of the ironies for the UK is that had Britain accepted the Dutch
presidency's compromise on social policy at Maastricht, this would have
strengthened subsidiarity by requiring the Commission to prove that its
proposals could not be better handled nationally or regionally.
With the 11 trying to press on with the treaty rather than re-negotiate it
to accommodate Denmark, it is difficult to see how they can produce a
re-definition of subsidiarity with a similar, legally binding force.
However, Commission president Mr Jacques Delors seems already to be
considering a re-organisation of the Brussels executive and rationalisation
of its powers.
This has every appearance of a strategy agreed with the three large member
states - Germany, France and the UK - in return for their leading moves to
reappoint Mr Delors for a further two years at next week's Lisbon summit.
The 17-strong Commission ends its four-year term in December.
Since the Danish shock, the Commission has undoubtedly pulled in its horns,
showing deference to the Council of Ministers (of the 12), even in matters
like EC trade policy, where it has long-established competence.
Mr Delors and UK Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan have floated the idea of
giving back to member states certain Commission powers, like the regulation
of water standards.
Beyond this, senior Commission officials indicate that a larger revamp is
being considered. Mr Delors and close colleagues are expected to work
through the summer preparing a clear delineation of what powers should
remain with the Commission and what should be handed back.
He is also, one senior official suggests, likely to submit his reappointment
to the approval of the European Parliament, something a Commission president
would not be obliged to do under Maastricht until 1995. Mr Delors would also
expect clear endorsement of those powers the Commission intends to retain.
Internally, there will be more political oversight of major policy areas,
for the sake of greater coherence and nipping in the bud meddlesome
interventions in national affairs.
One consequence is that there is likely to be a re-grouping of functions
inside the Commission, fusing, for instance, the several commissioners and
departments dealing with external affairs or regional policy.
While all this may improve the image of Brussels, it does not deal with the
main way in which Maastricht promotes secretive and remote decision-making.
This involves the new areas of foreign and security policy and justice and
home affairs co-operation, to be agreed between governments, outside EC
institutions, and at some remove from national parliaments.
Maastricht foresees a constitutional review in 1996 to decide whether this
inter-governmentalism - the antithesis of the EC's institutional development
 -should be brought into Community decision-making. Already there is
pressure to make decision-making by the Council of Ministers much more
transparent.
But much sooner than 1996, inter-governmentalism could become the focus of
hostility.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Secret Maxwell trusts are real 'last will', says MP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY and DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROBERT MAXWELL'S last will and testament was yesterday described as 'a death
mask designed to deceive'.
If accepted at face value, it would have 'Maxwell laughing all the way down
the Mount of Olives', said Mr Frank Field, the Labour MP.
Mr Field believes the real 'will' behind the public document, which was
published in full in the Financial Times yesterday, is a series of
confidential Swiss trusts set up in 1984.
Mr Field, chairman of the House of Commons select committee on social
security which investigated missing Maxwell pension fund money, supplied the
FT with a copy of the will. The person who gave the MP details of the trusts
 -some of which are believed to be for the benefit of family members -
behind the Liechtenstein-based Maxwell Foundation also gave him a copy of
the will.
The trust for Mr Kevin Maxwell, former chairman of Maxwell Communication
Corporation, is called Oratio, Mr Field believes. Apart from Oratio, the
trusts include Nessi, Junqo, Akim, Alandra, Markant, Baccano, Corry, Iban
and Looping.
Mr Field's main priority is to try to find as many surviving assets as
possible and he hopes publication of the names of the trusts will help in
the search. A variety of assets is also believed to be held in Swico
Anstalt, a Liechtenstein-based trust.
It holds blocks of shares in three private Maxwell holding companies: Pounds
500m stock in Robert Maxwell Group, about Pounds 150m in Headington group
and about Pounds 100m preference shares in Headington Investments. The debts
of the private companies are so great the shares will be worthless.
But it also holds all of PH(US) Inc, a company that has moved funds around
the world from other parts of the Maxwell empire. It is also believed to be
the holding company for the California computer games company Sphere, which
continues to trade.
In the will, Maxwell left a total of Pounds 2m to family and friends.
Any bequests seem certain to be challenged by creditors as soon as it has
passed through probate.
Last night Maxwell's former personal assistant at Mirror Group Newspapers,
Miss Jean Baddeley, said she was waiving any claim to the Pounds 100,000 he
had left her.
Mr Field said yesterday that if he is chairman when a new social security
select committee is set up he will ask Dr Werner Rechsteiner, a Swiss lawyer
who worked for Robert Maxwell, to give evidence. He believes Dr Rechsteiner
might be able to clarify the intentions of Robert Maxwell over the trusts.
Meanwhile National Westminster bank said yesterday it was planning to return
shares worth Pounds 33m to the Maxwell pension funds. The bank holds the
shares in an Israeli company, Teva Pharmaceuticals, as collateral against
Dollars 27.3m loans to Maxwell.
On June 10 it applied to the High Court to decide whether the shares
belonged to the pension funds or to the Maxwell private companies. Though
the case has not yet come to court, NatWest said last night that talks
between itself and the Maxwell private companies, the pension funds, and the
administrators had gone well. It expects to be free to release the funds
soon.
While NatWest has relinquished its claim to the Teva shares, ownership
between the Maxwell pension funds and one of the private Maxwell com-panies
is still in dispute.
Robson Rhodes, liquidator to Bishopsgate Investment Management, manager and
trustee of the Maxwell pension funds, is due to argue its case for ownership
in the high court on July 6, against Arthur Andersen, administrators to the
private Maxwell empire, which claims shares may belong to Robert Maxwell
Group.
However, Andersen is believed to be at the point of waiving its claim.

FT  20 JUN 92 / CBI chief forecasts 'patchy' economic recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WEAKENING order books for British manufacturers and a sharp downturn in a
leading consumer confidence index suggested yesterday that the UK's recovery
from recession will be sluggish and hesitant at best.
The Confederation of British Industry reported that manufacturers expect
output to grow only slowly over the next four months following a partial
reversal of an earlier improvement in orders. The latest consumer confidence
survey by Gallup, the market research company, showed the biggest drop in
consumers' confidence about the UK economic outlook since January 1991.
However, the CBI said tough competitive conditions had brought inflationary
pressures at factory level to their lowest point for more than 25 years,
indicating further progress towards making the UK a low-inflation country.
Commenting on the CBI's latest monthly industrial trends inquiry, Sir John
Banham, CBI director-general, said the signs of recovery were 'rather less
substantial' than a month ago. 'It would be wrong to say that the recovery
has stalled, but it is hesitant and seems likely to continue to be slow and
patchy.'
Mr Gordon Heald, Gallup's managing director, said the consumer confidence
survey showed greatly increased fears of rising unemployment and that 'any
post-election euphoria disappeared in the second half of May'.
The CBI polled 1,461 companies in 50 industries between May 22 and June 17.
Together they are responsible for more than half UK manufacturing employment
and exports.
It found that orders overall deteriorated in the period, although there was
a less significant weakening of export demand. Output expectations were
revised down in response, but manufacturers' replies during the past three
months suggest that they still expect to increase production. The CBI found
that 28 per cent of companies expected to increase output in the next four
months against 20 per cent that predicted a cut.
The resulting balance, indicating the trend, was a positive 8 per cent
compared with 13 per cent in May and 5 per cent in April. The survey showed
13 per cent of companies planned to cut prices compared with 9 per cent
intending rises. The resulting 4 per cent negative balance indicated the
weakest producer price expectations since October 1966.
Gallup's survey of nearly 2,000 people in the first two weeks of June showed
the balance of respondents expecting the economy to improve over the next
year dropped from 30 per cent in May to 13 per cent.
It also noted a big increase in the balance of people expecting increased
unemployment and a deterioration from 14 per cent to 5 per cent in the
balance expecting their financial situation to improve.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Major challenges Tory Euro-sceptics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR last night sought to isolate Conservative opponents of the
Maastricht accord with a pledge to use his forthcoming presidency of the
European Community to keep Britain 'at the heart of Europe'.
Welcoming the endorsement of economic and political union in the Irish
referendum, the UK prime minister rejected calls from Tory Euro-sceptics for
a renegotiation of the deal. He stressed the gains Britain had secured from
Maastricht, saying an attempt to re-open the agreement would cast the
government in the role of 'political gazumpers'. Conservative opponents of
closer European integration, however, said that disappointment at the Irish
result would not deflect their efforts to prevent ratification of the
treaty.
The rebels argued that Denmark's rejection of the treaty earlier this month
could not be 'cancelled out' by its acceptance in Ireland. The
anti-federalist European Reform Group has invited leaders of the Danish 'no'
campaign to a strategy meeting at Westminster next week aimed at bolstering
opposition in the British parliament.
Mr Major acknowledged that there was no prospect that the UK government
would re-introduce legislation to ratify Maastricht until the Danish
government had clarified its position and until after the French referendum.
Some ministers are speculating that the British legislation could now be
deferred until after the EC's Edinburgh summit in early December.
But in terms calculated to confront head-on the critics in his own party Mr
Major said: 'If we were now to set aside our word we would not be trusted
again. We would lose our influence to determine events.'
His speech - designed to detach waverers in the Conservative party from the
hard core of Euro-sceptics - stressed that Britain could not exercise
authority if it stood on the sidelines. 'I want this country to be at the
heart of Europe,' he said. 'Only if we are there can we have real influence.
We need that influence to build the Europe we want.'
Mr Major signalled that Britain, which takes over the presidency on July 1,
would seek to rescue the Maastricht agreement by emphasising that it did not
represent the 'federalist closed shop' that many feared.
That would be achieved by pressing Britain's agenda for the next few years.
It included pushing ahead with enlargement, curbing centralism, exercising
control over the powers of the Commission and the creation of a genuine
single market.

THE IRISH people have over-whelmingly approved the Maastricht treaty, giving
the kiss of life to closer European union.
The two-to-one 'yes' vote in Thursday's referendum was welcomed yesterday by
European Community governments. They felt it showed that the treaty's goals
of political and economic union were still on track in spite of their
rejection in a referendum in Denmark earlier this month.
Welcoming the result, Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said:
'It is a great day for Ireland and a great day for Europe . . . Our decision
will give renewed momentum to the ratification of the treaty across Europe.'
The decision lifts some of the atmosphere of crisis from the EC summit
meeting in Lisbon next week.
Following telephone conversations with Mr Jacques Delors, president of the
European Commission, and other European Community leaders, Mr Reynolds said:
'There is a lot of relief in the cabinets of Europe today.'
Had the treaty been voted down as some had feared, it would have had to be
reneg-otiated from scratch. Yesterday's result improves the odds on what
will still be a very difficult passage for the treaty in the rest of the
Community.
With a 'yes' vote of 69 per cent on a 57 per cent turnout, the Irish
ratified what the Danes had rejected by a narrow margin.
Mr Delors praised Ireland for choosing 'active participation in the
construction of Europe rather than isolation without perspective'.
Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister, said: 'For the first time
since the Danish referendum a positive signal for Europe has been given.'
Mr David Andrews, the Irish foreign minister, said: 'Ireland can now hold
its head up very high in Europe in a leadership role. This vote not only
saves European union, it strengthens it. It will give a lead to other
European countries that may have had doubts about Europe.'
EC foreign ministers gather in Luxembourg today to prepare the agenda for
the Lisbon summit. This is expected to focus on further EC financing,
choosing sites for institutions like the European Monetary Institute and a
progress report on developing a common foreign and security policy.
Portugal confirmed yesterday that, at the summit, it would propose Mr
Delors' re-election for a further two-year term as head of the Commission.
The Irish vote was a defeat for a coalition of environmentalists, supporters
of Ireland's neutrality and anti-abortion groups.
Rural areas in Ireland voted heavily for the treaty, while working class
urban areas had a lower turnout and higher 'no' vote.
Maastricht supporters were worried that the vote came in the wake of EC
disagreement about Mr Delors' plans for a larger community budget. They
feared that Ireland - which already gets much more from Brussels than it
puts into EC coffers itself - might vote 'no' because it seemed less likely
to get a big anticipated increase in regional aid funds.
In the event, it appears voters were swayed more by longer-term economic
benefits than what Mr Reynolds called 'irrelevant and scaremongering
issues'.
Robert Mauthner adds from Bonn: Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, at a
meeting of the Western European Union, described the Irish result as 'good
for Britain and good for Europe'.
Two uncertainties, however, remained: the French referendum, which will
probably be held in the autumn, and the need to know how the Danes intended
to use the time given to them.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Private View: Living in another world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOMORROW is our summer solstice, a high point in the calendar for disciples
of the New Age. At the sacred sites of Britain - Avebury, Stonehenge,
Glastonbury, Arthur's Seat, Callanish - there will be little pagan
ceremonies, accompanied by music and dancing, pot-smoking and the police.
The New Age is difficult to define. It is a mildly apocalyptic vision of a
post-technological world in which Man lives in harmony with Nature. It has
no fixed doctrines or liturgy: it is a syrupy mixture of primitive animism,
Christianity and Oriental mysticism. It is about saving the planet and being
nice to others, but especially about feeling good. It is a revolt against
rationalism, science and materialism, with a metaphysic as spongy as
marshmallow.
To find out whether the New Age is more than any other other brain-softening
cult I went this week to see Michael Irving, a publisher of New Age
pamphlets and organiser of the Avebury summer solstice sit-in. He lives with
his girlfriend, Karen Jones, in a rented bungalow in the West country
looking out at Glastonbury Tor.
I discovered a normally intelligent, softly-spoken 40-year-old with a pale
face and innocent, grey-blue eyes. There was a sickly smell of scented
candles in the house and the new baby sat in his playpen, chubbily smiling
like Buddha.
Within a minute of our meeting, however, I learned that the bungalow is
built on the dragon line that runs diagonally from St Michael's Mount in
Cornwall to Bury St. Edmunds in Suffolk. There are two of these dragon lines
circling the world, one positive, one negative. They are harmless, my host
explained as he handed me a glass of pure orange juice.
Michael Irving does not like the term 'New Age' because of the way it is
used in the papers. 'You often see people with crystals saying very funny
things. I'd rather not be associated with that. It's quite a serious
business.' Instead, he talks of Leading Edge, New Thought or Inspiration.
Why do you celebrate the summer solstice?
'I think it's because of seasonal changes in the planet, as the sun moves up
and back again, a movement of energy, I suppose, across the earth's surface.
The ancients found strong places of that flow and built their temples
there.'
Some New Agers claim to be able to plug into the earth's current when they
touch standing stones and generate energy by dancing in and out of them.
Irving said he had not reached quite that degree of sensitivity, having been
so 'shut down' in his early life.
He had had to retreat from life after the disciplines of public school and
the unfulfilling experience of working in his father's kitchen equipment
shop on the Isle of Man, he explained.
He studied mechanical engineering at Farnborough College of Technology,
worked for the 600 Group in project engineering but a bout of bad health
sent him off to learn Transcendental Meditation. He became the cook at a TM
academy in Derbyshire and later, in the TM settlement in Skelmersdale,
learned to design and print T-shirts, stationery and menus.
In 1983 his life was changed by meeting Sir George Trevelyan, a prominent
New Age guru.
'He awakened my consciousness, a deeper sensitivity that up to then nobody
had really reached in me.'
Sensitivity to what? I asked.
'It's like a magnification inwards, an inner opening and expansion. You feel
things like hope, deep meaning and the significance of things.'
Had you been depressed before?
'Yes. Normally depressed, as I would say.' He smiled. 'I didn't really know
till then that I was depressed.'
Under Sir George's influence he produced a scrapbook of favourite quotations
from people like the Apollo astronauts, Mother Theresa - and Sir George
himself. An 'oak dragon camp' brought him to Glastonbury. He pointed out of
the window:
'We camped three miles over there in the Glastonbury zodiac. Marvellous
things started to happen to me: sitting in the circle feeling something
tremendous as the talking stick passed round. I heard people saying
interesting things, and real things, like they were fed up with the person
in the tent next to them, or singing a song, or just holding the stick for a
couple of minutes.' Driving round, he could feel the energy flying across
the land.
Next weekend 100,000 people will descend on the nearby village for the
Glastonbury Festival. Irving is afraid there will be violence because, he
explained, some people were not used to celebrating and feeling good about
life. It seems the violence is due to a certain pre-millennial tension.
New Ageism is a 'holistic' view of the world and making 'connections' is
important. This includes connecting the left brain (the rational hemisphere)
with the right (intuitive) side.
I asked if the notorious Travellers were making these connections.
'I think they're totally right-brained without any left brain, plus a bit of
anger. They feel the connection of things a bit too much. Like they want to
just pick up anything and throw it in their van. They're a bit too
connected. They don't have the discrimination to know what doesn't belong to
them.'
I asked about the Brew Crew (they drink Special Brew) and the Crusties (who
don't wash).
'I think they are basically very confused people. Life isn't working for
them but they don't know why.'
A clue to the New Age revelation, according to some disciples, is contained
in crop circles. When I said they had been exposed as hoaxes, Irving
insisted some were genuine.
Apparently they fulfil the prophecies of a Red Indian 'rainbow dream
vision', a 20-year programme of enlightenment leading to the millennium.
According to a certain Harley Swiftdeer, when the winged or feathered
serpent wheels turn again we will see rainbow lights in our sleep. These
rainbow lights accord with the seven coloured chakras or energy centres in
our body. And, said Irving, the crop circles contained symbols from the
rainbow dream.
I was losing the drift. Who makes these circles? I asked.
He hesitated. 'Well I know who I think. I'm pretty sure it's
extraterrestrial intelligence.'
You really believe extraterrestrials make these marks?
'If you ask me personally, yeah. I have seen three spaceships quite close
up.'
He was meditating one night near Warminster on the edge of Salisbury Plain
when three of them came over his car about 100 yards off. He chased after
them. 'They were about 25ft in diameter and there were windows in them going
round. I saw nobody at the windows but my heart opened. I felt incredibly
wonderful.
'Eventually they went over a clay hill and I saw them going round over a
stand of trees, very peacefully, before flying off towards Stonehenge and
Avebury.'
He believes they had chosen him in order to convey something. The message
was 'about getting people into circles, about raising our consciousness.'
Irving went on to explain something called the Birth of the Cosmic Child,
which is about recapturing lost innocence and spontaneity and sharing one's
experiences.
I suggested psychoanalysis would do the trick without the need for earth
currents or dream visions. Irving replied that both Freud and Jung had
foreshadowed the New Age solution: just as the sun's energy radiates from
earth's core to its surface, so we must learn to allow the heart chakra to
radiate its energy to the body.
I see, I said.
I asked if he believed in God.
'What I do believe in is a consciousness that brings us all together.'
Isn't what you are talking about pagan?
'I'm not too bothered about what things are called. It's just whether it
feels OK and works. As a matter of evolution we had to remove ourselves from
experiencing things directly. We split off and we're on the point of
rejoining the flow.'
We did not have to go back to living in mud huts, he added. We could keep
the benefits of technology provided we restored the balance. I suggested
that was dropping out. He said: 'It's dropping in. It's a paradox, a
turnround in our appreciation of life.'
If I said you were childishly escaping into a primitive world of rituals,
symbols and ignorance, what would you say?
'It's not just being childlike, it's not just living in the country, it's
not just being artistic. You're making a left-brain. Something else is going
to happen. I would say stick around because this thing is going to happen.'
What is going to happen?
'I don't know. A good thing might be to go and stand in a good crop pattern
and see what one feels. See if you feel good or excited or expanded.
What would you like to happen?
'I'd like to relax. I would like to not feel that I'm totally anonymous when
I go out in the world. That on the High Street we know how to say hallo to
each other, that we could start helping each other. We could start creating
this prediction of Heaven on Earth. We could bring more celebration, more
street parties.'
It sounded OK. But it was a disappointing climax to my initiation into the
New Age - especially because - as it happens - we're having a street party
already.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Boring for England: Dominic Lawson knows why soccer fans
turn to rioting . . .
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THOSE comforted by the traditional and the familiar, events in Stockholm
have been reassuring.
Cold wars come and go, the world's climate may dissolve in a puff of ozone,
but still we can be sure that the England soccer team will lose
ignominiously and that English fans will riot.
The riots are always followed by a marvellous outpouring of
what-is-to-be-done-ism. The most amusing part is the attitude of those on
the left, who normally advocate extreme leniency in custodial sentencing and
the highest standards of police evidence of wrong-doing, but who, in the
case of football hooliganism, propose salutary punishments and rough
justice. The football hooligan is the most politically incorrect of
individuals: he is, apparently, racist. Worse: he is in favour of macho-male
dominance.
It has become fashionable to deny any causal link between football games and
violence. It is said that these are thuggish, clannish young men, who merely
choose soccer games as the pretext for their anti-social activities.
I find this puzzling, Why are these outbreaks of hooliganism never
associated with Rugby League, or with the support of Essex County Cricket
Club? I fear that football must be the cause, and the self-interested
denials of this by the Football League should not be swallowed whole by the
public and newspaper leader writers.
The connection, however, is not an obvious one, and has eluded commentators
until now.
It is that association football is boring. And it is well known that boredom
and crime are linked. Soccer is boring because it is impossible. Nobody,
apart from the odd South American freak, can play it. It is just too
difficult for the normally constructed human frame to control a ball with a
foot. (I discovered this at an early age, and determined at school to play
in no other position except goalkeeper).
At amateur level this impossibility is evident even to the players. They
shout, curse, foul, and occasionally cry as the ball ricochets, defying
reason or control.
But the same is true at professional and even international levels. There is
none of the satisfying rhythm and discipline which characterise the
ball-handling games such as cricket and rugby. Watching soccer on television
is like watching a pinball game - interesting only if you have money at
stake.
This can be demonstrated most clearly by a video recording played at
fast-forward. There is no pattern at all - except that one notices, with
shock, that the ball is only in play for about half the game, so impossible
is it to control.
But the problem is that the soccer fans do not realise that they are
supporters of an impossible game. They think it should make sense, that
there should be glorious flowing movement from player to player, from end to
end. The fans become increasingly frustrated and violent, as their idols are
shown to have boots of clay, and as players described by the tabloid
newspapers as geniuses and prodigies boot the ball into touch or simply fall
over it.
The fans then turn back to the tabloids to read - if they can - the
explanation. There they are told that it is not players' fault; oh no, it is
the manager's fault. Read yesterday's Sun back page: 'Sunsport Verdict:
'Turn it in, Taylor: GO NOW.'' Underneath this headline is a picture of
Graham Taylor, the England football team manager, disguised as a turnip.
Poor Taylor. He is not a turnip. He knows that football is impossible; so
random that nothing can be predicted. But it is more than his job is worth
to admit it. So the careful massaging of the vain hopes of the dejected
football supporters will continue, leading to more disappointments and
frustrations and further riots, as inarticulate youths give vent to their
anger.
I gather that Conor Cruise O'Brien, a great Irishman, last week proposed as
a solution, that large areas are set aside in the major cities, in which the
football fans can drink to their hearts' content. He advocated that these
areas should be surrounded by riot police, who would be the only people to
observe the football fans beating each other up.
I think O'Brien is on to a good thing, but he misses the point. Without the
unendurable frustration of having to watch football, the youths would become
maudlin, but not aggressive. The riot police would pack away their gear. The
only people to suffer would be newspaper leader writers.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Helping Perot prepare for power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I WAS IN Vail, Colorado, last weekend, hobnobbing with the rich and
powerful. I took the chairlift up Vail mountain. Swam a dozen lengths a day.
Played tennis. Got face-burn. Rode a bay horse named Pete along a river-side
trail at dusk. Bought a pair of shoes. Read Elmore Leonard. And met Ross
Perot, the chirpy Texan gunslinger who has injected a gust of drama into the
race for the White House.
First, they looked me over. I was in the village, eating my dinner,
struggling to make sense of The New York Times, when my table was surrounded
by a dozen men in suits, some speaking into microphones or listening to
ear-pieces, all carrying briefcases stuffed with documents, Ivy League
types, not a Texan to be seen, so that I completely lost the drift of
whatever it was I was eating. Elk, I suspect, though it could have been buck
deer.
They patted me down, checked my ID, asked me some questions. Satisfied, they
led me to a table at the back of the restaurant and introduced me to Ross
Perot. He was wearing a blue suit and a blue-striped tie.
The reason he wanted to talk to me, said the man who would be president, was
that one of his people had shown him last week's column, in which I outlined
my plans for a British Board of Referenda.
'My people,' said Ross Perot, 'tell me that you share my belief in
electronic town halls and on-line forums as a means to hash out national
issues. That you, like me, advocate demographic databases and electronic
conferencing so that groups of voters can listen to discussions, ask their
questions, and then use touch-tone pads to vote on far-flung matters. That
you understand teledemocracy - top-down, bottom-up links between voters and
their president. That you are part of the vista of technopolitics. In short,
that you are a can-do kinda boy with whom I might do business.'
I said nothing.
'Tell me,' said Ross Perot, 'what is the one thing that will get me into the
White House? Don't bother with issues, downtown stuff like that. And don't
think in sound-bites. Stick to personal qualities. Take your time, boy.
They'll keep your dinner hot.'
'Mr Perot,' I said. 'The one thing that will get you into the White House is
preparation. Nothing is so small you can afford to overlook it. You must
attend to every detail.
'Let me tell you what the late Marlene Dietrich told her orchestra in Las
Vegas the night before she opened. She and the orchestra and her musical
director, Burt Bacharach, had just completed 32 hours of strenuous
preparation, and Bacharach had announced that rehearsals were over.
'But Dietrich was a perfectionist, and inexhaustible. So she addressed the
orchestra. 'All right,' she said. 'Burt says rehearsals are over. It's time
to stop, time to go, and Burt knows. He knows your union rules . . . He
knows your freeways and your lawn sprinklers and your swimming pools and
your televisions, your standards and your aspirations. And so you must go
home to your little wives in your little houses in the hills or the San
Fernando Valley. I am prepared and willing to stay here all night. All night
and all tomorrow, too. To get it right. To justify this thing we are doing,
this act of theatre. But no. Your pools and martinis and television sets and
wives are waiting, so never mind. Never mind that we open tomorrow night
before the most cynical audience in the world. And we are not ready for
them. But go. Go home and relax. And as you do, think that we open tomorrow
night, and tomorrow night will be . . . a disaster.'
'But it wasn't,' I said. 'Marlene was a triumph.'
Perot was spell-bound. 'OK,' he said. 'Write me the sort of referendum
question I should be asking as president.' He gave me a gold pen.
'Gun Control,' I wrote. 'President Perot says he wants to take guns out of
the hands of violent people. Not all the people. Just drunks and crazies.
Here's what he wants to do. Anyone who's had a cocktail or three and is
caught handling a firearm will be sent down-river for 25 years. No ifs or
buts. If you're in favour, vote 'Yes' on your touch-pad. If not, 'No.' But
remember: we've got to make America safe for decent folk. Support President
Perot. Vote 'Yes' for sanity.' When I showed Perot my question, he hissed
through his teeth with glee. 'You'll do fine, boy,' he said. 'Welcome to the
team.' Then he gave me Dollars 35,000 and sent me to finish my dinner.

RADIO 1 is the most socially active of all channels. This week, Race through

inserted into the programmes where likely to be heard, followed by brief
advice. Mark Goodier's 7 o'clock slots interview familiar players who have
triumphed over prejudice. (The Irish are included.) There is a helpline,
0800 500 800, and a Commission for Racial Equality booklet is free to those
who ask. May it all come off well.
I keep in touch with Radio 4's Hospital lest the staff should become cosy
familiars. But this week Dr Patel, on duty for 27 hours with only 15
minutes' sleep (no helpline for him]), only addressed his colleagues, staff
and patients, and Nick West's liver-transplant was free of extraneous drama,
though the replacement organ was a dud. I wonder if the ill-mannered
emergency admissions staff knew their voices were being recorded? This
obsessive interest in hospital procedure is inexplicable to me, but it has
long been around.
Science programmes on Radio 3 usually approach us as if we were insiders,
but Is it really science? on Wednesday called on philosophy as well as
physics. The unanswerable question debated was the one we all ask after
reading Stephen Hawking's best-seller: under what laws did the Big Bang
become the Big Bang? Bill Newton-Smith (philosophy) and Paul Davies
(science) discussed this with Bryan Magee. There must have been laws of
something, Newton-Smith held. Just the unchanging laws of science, Davies
insisted. Might other laws have existed? No, all laws came under a
'superlaw'.
Everything mathematically ordered, Magee quoted, suggests intelligence. We
were slipping, albeit modestly, into philosophy, even theology. Consoling
myself that more science came on Radio 3 later that evening, I reckoned I
must do with that. It was only the second Ecology Debate, though, less
interesting now the Earth Summit is over.
Radio 3's Sunday play was John Clifford's brilliant Ines de Castro. Ines
(Deborah Findlay) is a Spanish girl, lover of the Portuguese prince Pedro,
and has born him two children. Spain and Portugal are at war, so Ines is
reckoned a spy, and the King reckons she must be put down. He promises Pedro
that no such thing will happen, but commissions his agent Pacheco to do this
service as soon as Pedro resumes his command at the frontier.
Pacheco duly beheads the children and their loyal Nurse, then cuts Ines's
throat. Unluckily for him, Pedro wins an unlooked for victory and returns.
When the King dies and Pedro assumes the crown, he initiates a dreadful
vengeance. Five years buried, Ines's body is dug up and robed as Queen. At a
great state banquet, Pacheco is killed, slowly and publicly, while guests
are made to hold Ines's decayed hand.
Clifford shows no bias between truth and fancy. Supernatural characters seem
as natural as the ably-drawn human. Ines is consoled by the Devil (an old
woman, Margaret Robertson, great) with talk about the state of Hell. At
Ines's funeral service, the people chat about the meat trade, and the tailor
measuring he body for her robes moans that he wasn't told whether to use
inches or centimetres.
The play was commissioned for the Traverse in 1990. The guitar music by
Jeremy Taylor has been added for radio, but, with respect to able director
Marilyn Imrie, it breaks the continuity of thought too often. Deborah
Findlay's calm, pure Ines was perfect.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Arts: A cubist of classical order - William Packer visits a
Georges Braque exhibition in Martigny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARTIGNY is the small, ancient town that commands the Swiss end of the St
Bernard Pass, where it comes down into the Rhone valley above Lake Geneva.
It is the sort of place where the traveller might think of stopping for an
agreeable lunch, or overnight perhaps, but no more than that.
And yet here, for the past dozen years, in the Foundation he set up in
memory of his elder brother, Leonard Gianadda has been putting on
exhibitions of international museum quality. It is a most unusual
institution - concert hall, Celto-Romano archeological site, sculpture
garden, motor museum and gallery all in one. A member of the audience may
well find himself sitting within a fragment of Roman wall to hear the music,
or further back with a current masterpiece at his shoulder.
From Klee, Goya and Giacometti, Schiele and Lautrec, to Moore, Modigliani
and Chagall, the record speaks for itself. Until the autumn it is the turn
of Georges Braque, in a full but succinct retrospective. No-one goes to the
Fondation Gianadda in expectation of the copious and exhaustive review: the
hanging space is but the four walls of the central hall, augmented as
necessary by a screen or two, with a small side-gallery usually reserved for
drawings or, as in this case, prints. But it is no bad thing for the
exhibition organiser to submit to such discipline, as the Gianadda shows
repeatedly bear witness. The Braque show is characteristically beautifully
chosen, full of surprises and closely focused.
Braque was born in 1882, a year younger than Picasso, his great partner in
the Cubist adventure. He died in 1963, loaded with honours - yet, of all the
heroes of the School of Paris in its golden age, he remains an oddly shadowy
and elusive figure, at once acknowledged and overlooked. He was no such
prodigy as Picasso, his student work competent enough but remarkable only
for being his student work. He was no radical innovator such as Matisse, and
the fauve paintings here seem tentative and even academic against those of
Derain and Matisse himself.
Yet the seriousness of his engagement is always clear, and with the
transition from fauve to proto-Cubist, hinting at Cezanne in 'The house on
the hill' of 1907, the mature and distinctive artist declares himself. The
subsequent encounter with Picasso was, of course, decisive, changing his
life, and yet who would now say who was the dominant partner of the two? The
issue is still critically alive, questions of actual authorship still
unresolved. Yet the difference between the two protagonists comes into
focus, and the wonderful run here, of Braque's analytical cubist and later
synthetic cubist paintings and collages, advance the process remarkably.
Braque is, above all, the cubist of classical order and simplicity, calm,
stable, the work set not rigidly but essentially upon the vertical and the
horizontal. Picasso, by contrast, was ever the expressionist in sensibility,
the work active, mouvemente, working off the dynamic of the diagonal. While
Matisse was in sort ever the fauve, and Picasso by turns all things to all
men - expressionist, symbolist, surrealist, classicist and expressionist
again - it was as a cubist that Braque came to himself, and so in essence he
remained throughout his life.
Cubism turned him from the fauve colourist he could never be to the tonal
painter he truly was. And it was by cubism too that he fixed upon the
still-life, which was to be his constant subject and which supplies the
greater part of this exhibition. There are unevennesses, of course, and a
falling-off towards the end, though not without interest in the small late
landscapes that pay modest homage to Van Gogh.
But the strength of the show lies with the magnificent sequence that takes
us through from cubism to the large still-lifes and studio interiors of
1930s and 1940s, that have the space and scope of landscape, and yet the
close intimacy of the known place and the familiar object. The space is
diffracted yet open and coherent, the form fragmented yet resolved, the
whole contradictory yet imaginatively convincing, the surface
undemonstrative yet dense, rich and subtle. It is the work of a profound
master, and a lovely exhibition.
Georges Braque: Fondation Pierre Gianadda, Martigny Switzerland; until
November 8

FT  20 JUN 92 / Arts: Exotic drama from Spain in Vienna - Jackie
Wullschlager gets caught up in zarzuela, flamenco and peasant ritual
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HOLY Roman Emperor Charles V is supposed to have said'I speak Spanish to
God, Italian to women, French to men, and German to my horse.' Polyglot
sophistication was the triumph of this year's Vienna Festival, which between
Carmen and The Barber of Seville presented a showcase of Spanish drama in
English, French, German and even Romany. Among the most exotic theatre to
tour Europe' s summer festivals - Avignon, Paris' 'Cycle hispanique',
Seville - in the next months will be Spanish plays. The three I caught were
eye-openers: idiosyncratic, highly-charged exports unlike anything else in
the European repertory.
Imagine HMS Pinafore playing in the Pyrennees and you get a sense of Spanish
zarzuela tuning up in Vienna's stately but decaying Ronacher Theatre.
Habaneras, fandangos, a parched courtyard, serenades up to wooden balconies,
women rushing in with cakes balanced on their heads, men in straw hats
singing hymns to an accordion; this is the local colour of Spain's folk
opera-cum-musical theatre. The zarzuela, its golden age a century ago but
its evergreens still as popular as contemporary hits, is Spain's equivalent
of Viennese operetta or Gilbert and Sullivan. Like them, it tells much of
national character, it is satirical and it depends on caricature and catchy
numbers; unlike them, it concentrates on ordinary people, those who hang
about village squares or courtyards, their lives a public entertainment.
Alain Maratrat's Zarzuela] Historia de un patio, a French co-production
between Vienna, Avignon and Peter Brook's Bouffes du Nord, is based on Tomas
Breton's zarzuela about the festival of the patron of Paloma, La Verbena de
la Paloma (1894). It opens in brilliant daylight, extras throwing water
across the stage to cool the courtyard and the rising passions. Julian, the
jealous lover, seeks his rival; Don Hilarion, the old apothecary in
threepiece white suit, sungla sses and walking stick eyes the girls
nostalgically; Mari-Pepa the coquette flutters her eyelids randomly from her
window.
Castanets, fans, bursts into dance and songs about Espana set the tone, but
this is also any small town on a summer bank holiday, where lovers' tiffs
and quests escalate into violence, harmless raconteurs are threatened with a
gun because there's not enough to do. The celebrations twist suddenly into
fear; the stage darkens, the courtyard becomes a mesh of nooks and doorways,
Mari-Pepi's lover creeps out to declare himself, to be confronted by three
others with the same idea. A fight turns as quickly into a joke, a clown
with a pig-tail strums a lantern-lit love-song on a pianola.
Musically, I found my first zarzuela an agreeable hotch-potch. Voices range
from the full-bodied mournfully mellow Julian (tenor Rodolfo Acosta) to
actors singing hits; solo instrumentalists are both competent and fine
comedians, from acrobat-violinist Manuel Solans to the guy playing wine
bottles like a xylophone. It's light-hearted summer fun, earthy, knowing,
anarchic in its alliance with the underdog: women have power, men are
romantic fools; a brass band shambles around the auditorium as a mocking
march erupts at the verbena: 'le gouvernement parle/De la question sociale'.
Spain's great modern dramatist Federico Garcia Lorca once wrote a poem about
joining in the verbena to get close to folk gossip and the disorder of
everyday life. To show Lorca's intense Blood Wedding just after Maratrat's
Zarzuela] was a triumph for Vienna, an example of how at a festival
illuminating contexts can enhance enjoyment of even very strong individual
productions. Blood Wedding, Lorca's rural tragedy of lust and revenge, seems
in Theatre Pralipe's Romany version a natural successor to the Spanish folk
musical. Ritual courtship, jealousy, murder are played out on a public stage
through mime, dance, music. Classic types - the Mother, the Bride - are
pushed to enact 'honourable' roles that tear them apart within.
The entire play is encompassed in an opening choreographed duel and love
affair played to the Habanera from Carmen. There is a fight between
cockerels on a barely lit platform. In a fevered ballet lovers swing towards
each other and apart holding on to blood red sashes. A dance with forbiddden
fruit has oranges meekly swapped by the married pair, gnawed to scraps by
the lovers. An actor playing the Moon covers the rivals with a gold shroud
before a forest of candles with a shrine of the cruxifixion.
The seasons, the heat, inflammatory village talk, day turning to night; in
all this the stage becomes a self-contained world rooted in peasant ritual.
Yet Lorca was writing in the 1930s and grafted expressionist anguish on to
popular Spanish lore. The success of director Rahim Burhan's iconography is
to draw hallucinatory fear out of the sentimental, naive tale. In his
poetry, Lorca saw gipsies as emblems of ordinary folk vulnerable to
authority, to the Civil Guard with their 'souls of patent leather'. This is
the second time I have seen this gypsy production; it is now exquisitely
stylised yet still raw, fresh, and not to be missed as it winds across
Europe.
From Lorca to Hemingway: both obsessed by death, blood ritual, Andalusian
landscapes and customs, but the one lyrical, the other macho in response.
Hemingway would have loved Jan Lauwers' Needcompany's setting of his
stories, Invictos, which opens with an enormous stuffed bull rotating
centrestage and a burst of flamenco. Tough-talking guys in sharp suits and
sunglasses cut and thrust at one another while touching up the beast; they
smoke, drink whisky, direct one another across the stage, each to his place
at the foot of a wooden panel with a porthole through which grins a large
fish.
You guessed it - they are actors and writers whose story of artistic failure
is told through the metaphor of a shipwreck. Of course, as the title
suggests, they are not conquered in the end, because their failure becomes
an art - hence the play, which is riddled with such tail-chasing wisecracks.
Deconstructionist twists, gallows humour, corpses dug up because bribes
haven't been paid, intermingle with tourist numbers like 'Spain is a burning
rose'. There are longueurs, but I was won over: by speed, slick timing,
breathless improvisation of language - it plays in Spanish, German, Dutch or
English according to venue - and text, which seems to adapt to participation
even from babies in the audience.
Zarzuela] Historia de un patio, sponsored by Rank Xerox, is at the Avignon
Festival in July; another zarzuela, La Del Monojo de Rosas, is at the
Theatre Europe, Paris, from June 23. Invictos is in Berlin (16-20 June),
Amsterdam (27 June - 1 July), then Seville. Blood Wedding is also to tour
Europe this summer.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Arts: Schubertiade moves house
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAS SCHUBERT moved house for good? The Schubertiade letter-head still reads
Schubertiade Hohenems even though it has moved, lock, stock and barrel, to
nearby Feldkirch (like Hohenems, a medieval town in the Vorarlberg). Last
year the move might have seemed temporary; the main Hohenems venue, its
medieval palace, had been renovated and was hosting an exhibition. This year
(it opened on June 12) it begins to look permanent. Why?
It has partly been a question of facilities. The Hohenems palace seats only
300 people and the authorities have been too short-sighted to provide any
alternative. Feldkirch, with 27,000 inhabitants, is twice as big and can
boast a concert hall, the Montforthaus, with room for 1,100 people. The
Feldkirchers have also created other venues, like the courtyard of the local
fortress (200 seats) and an open air stage in the forest (500). Above all
they have renovated a hall with room for 500 in the local music
conservatory, the former Jesuit school of Stella Matutina.
Their dynamism has even created a brand-new headquarters for the festival
administration in a new square by the river Ill (the Schubertplatz,
naturally) and a rustic footbridge over one of its tributaries leading to
the open-air theatre and the mountainside beyond. You begin to wonder
whether the special flavour of the Schubertiade won't suffer.
Of course, growth was inevitable. There were only 3,000 tickets sold for the
inaugural event in 1976; seven times as many are sold today. This growth may
not continue too dangerously. This is essentially a festival of lieder,
piano and chamber music. That means a strictly limited, self-selecting
public. There will never be popular operas here, so the danger of the place
developing into a second Salzburg is remote. The intimacy should remain, and
with it the charm of being able to bump into Brendel or Peter Schreier on
your afternoon walk.
Musical standards also seem secure. This year you could hear singers like
Schreier and Olaf Baer, Gruberova, Margaret Price and Fassbaender in the
space of a couple of weeks (Fassbaender will also exhibit some of her own
paintings). The Emerson and Alban Berg quartets are here. And best of all,
Andras Schiff is playing all 18 Schubert piano sonatas.
The Schubertiade is a rare bird among musical events in being
self-supporting. The annual budget - 9-12m Austrian schillings, say Pounds
0.5m - is met entirely from ticket sales; seats range from Pounds 15-Pounds
40 for average recitals, rising to Pounds 25-Pounds 80 for major events,
including orchestral concerts. This year about 23,000 tickets have been
sold. Of the patrons, a quarter come from Austria, 40 per cent from Germany
and 20 per cent from Switzerland; Britain, with 5 per cent, is well ahead of
the other non-German countries. On average each spectator attends four
events.
That means serious money. I was told that between 15,000 and 18,000 hotel
beds are booked over the 18 days of the festival; the patrons spend a
further estimated Pounds 1m. One can only wonder at the Hohenemsers letting
their share of that go. Franz Schubert means hard cash today, unlike in his
lifetime; I wonder if he will ever move back to Hohenems.

THE longest day of the year falls this weekend and midsummer music is in
full swing. The blossoming of music festivals has become one of the most
agreeable features of the English summer and it is difficult to picture June
without them - sun-drenched walks along the beach at Aldeburgh, picnics at
Glyndebourne, the gentility of Buxton and Georgian elegance of Cheltenham
soon to follow.
One of the favourite works at this time of year is inevitably Mendelssohn's
A Midsummer Night's Dream. The music always wins a ready following, but it
is only the more adventurous festivals that perform it with Shakespeare's
play, as intended. At home a recording of text and music together might seem
an unsatisfactory prospect and yet this is what EMI has just issued and with
conspicuous success.
Of all the sets of incidental music, this is perhaps the most intricate.
Mendelssohn sprinkles a magical dusting of music over the whole play. The
arrival of Titania and Oberon, for example, provokes a short greeting of
sprite-like delicacy and their ensuing conversation is accompanied by a
myriad little phrases of will-o'-the-wisp orchestral filigree. Jeffrey Tate
and his Rotterdam orchestra give an agreeable account of the score and
actors from The Peter Hall Company speak the text. The two halves, moreover,
have been put together in a convincingly atmospheric acoustic.
Purcell's The Fairy Queen is also a Midsummer Night's Dream entertainment,
though in this case music and play remain pretty well separate. There is
little argument for including the text on a recording, but it is a shame
that when Benjamin Britten recorded the piece in 1970, he saw fit to make a
drastic arrangement of the music. Most of the score is re-ordered; some is
omitted altogether. There is always a case for hearing what Britten made of
another composer's music and this Decca re-issue remains an important set;
but not all the singing matches the best that we have heard since.
There are echoes of Britten and - even more - Walton in Summer's Last Will
and Testament by the never-quite-forgotten Constant Lambert. This is a
choral work with orchestra, written in the 1930s to words by the Elizabethan
poet Thomas Nashe. In his poetry summer becomes an evil season when plague
and pestilence start to spread (Nashe himself is believed to have died of
the plague c1601). There is plenty of jazz-based energy in the score and
Lambert's distinctive fingerprint is on every bar. But in the end this is a
disturbing work, which shows for once the depressing depths that lurked
beneath the composer's sunny exterior. Strangely memorable.
In Haydn's Die Jahreszeiten ('The Seasons') summer arrives in a blaze of D
major. This is the noon-day sun at its height, celebrated by a chorus of
villagers in music of radiant affirmation. The mood, however, soon changes:
a tenor solo in the minor tells of the drought that follows, of 'wilting
flowers, parched fields and fountains run dry' - a reminder that summer had
its downside long before the phrase 'global warming' had ever been invented.
In that passage on Archiv's new recording Anthony Rolfe Johnson is the
marvellously sensitive tenor and he is but one of three exemplary soloists.
Barbara Bonney is the wholly delectable soprano and Andreas Schmidt an
eloquent baritone, just a mite short on open-hearted rustic vigour. The
standard of choral singing and playing under John Eliot Gardiner is as
immaculate as one might expect and little, in terms of pictorial vividness
or expressive feeling, seems to escape the conductor's notice.
In 1991, for the Mozart bicentenary year, the Glyndebourne Festival invited
five British composers to write wind serenades loosely based on that
festival's Mozart operas. The most successful of the pieces drew an
appreciative, if small, audience in the gardens and now EMI has gathered
them together on an imaginative new disc. It is difficult to imagine a less
painful way to get an introduction to some of our brightest younger
composers. I especially enjoyed Robert Saxton's dramatic paraphrase on
Idomeneo and Stephen Oliver's haunting, pensive octet derived from La
clemenza di Tito.
Best of all, though, is the Figaro serenade by Jonathan Dove - open-air
music, breezy, glinting with evening sunshine. This is perfectly conceived
summer garden entertainment: a different choice for midsummer night this
year, if Mendelssohn does not mind.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROLL call of major contemporary art dealers shutting up shop in the face
of the recession is assuming apocalyptic proportions. This week Nigel
Greenwood, who championed artists as diverse as Glenn Baxter and Jeffrey
Camp, joined Odette Gilbert, Kasmin, Fischer Fine Art, Nicola Jacobs and
Anne Berthoud among the notable names who have abandoned their West End
galleries.
Apart from Gilbert, where the banks pulled the plug, the others were
unprepared to struggle on with ever increasing rents and property charges
and ever falling sales. Most have decided to deal privately from home. Even
so, the contemporary art market in London faces the biggest crisis in its
history.
It was bound to happen. For a start there are very few collectors of
contemporary art priced at over Pounds 50,000 and, apart from Charles
Saatchi, they are virtually all foreign businessmen whose buying depends
upon the profitability of their companies. At the moment they are just not
interested.
By the very nature of the art there can be no copper bottom reputations and
taste changes rapidly. Then the success of dealers in forcing up prices in
the 1980s, and their self deception that the spiral would continue, made
re-stocking suddenly expensive; dealers are now stuck with pictures whose
market value has almost halved.
In contrast dealers in Old Masters and decorative art, with connoisseur
clients and stock that has not risen so rapidly in price, are holding on.
Their most splashy event, the Grosvenor House Fair, which ends today, has
hardly set the bells ringing. On the other hand most dealers have sold
something and turnover generally is on the level of a year ago. With many
dealers reducing their prices daily, the old fashioned gentleman collector
is realising he can afford to buy again and is re-appearing from out of the
wood work.
The top dealers desperately need a good Grosvenor House because it is the
only time during the year that they can mount a collective challenge to the
salerooms - and judging by the lacklustre auctions planned by Sotheby's and
Christie's this June the dealers can reckon to have won the contest.
It is ironic then that the adversity of the dealers is proving much needed
relief for the auction houses, who often get the task of cashing in the
assets when a dealer packs up shop. Sotheby's has disposed of unsold
paintings for the Heim Gallery and this week offered silver and jewels, the
old stock of Tessiers of Bond Street. On July 1 Sotheby's is selling over 70
Hockney prints once dealt in by Kasmin at prices up to 40 per cent lower
than two years ago. Christie's has acted as undertaker for Sparks, the
Chinese dealer, and for Odette Gilbert.
With the market in such depression this is a strange time for Hugues Joffre
to quit as expert in charge of contemporary art at Sotheby's. The most
logical explanation is that he will join arch rivals Christie's. Such a move
across Piccaddilly is almost unprecedented: neither firm wants to get
dragged into the poaching game: it would enable top specialists to play one
off against the other.
But Joffre, whose knowledge of buyers and sellers has enabled Sotheby's to
capture over 70 per cent of the contemporary business, may be just too
tempting for Christie's.
Keith Cooper is moving from director of PR at English National Opera to
director of PR and marketing, at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. He
replaces, after a gap of over a year, Ewan Balfour.
With such mixed loyalties Cooper put on both his hats to dismiss the flier
in The Times that David Mellor's Department of National Heritage was
planning a brand new opera house on the South Bank to be ready by 2000 for
the millennium celebrations and as a new home for a merged Covent Garden and
ENO.
With both houses about to launch multi-million pound rebuilding appeals such
a rumour could devastate their fund raising campaigns. Hence a quick move to
scotch such fanciful kite flying. The chairmen of the ROH and the ENO are
considering a joint denial, and Mellor has let it be known that he has not
yet given the matter a second's thought - although some major arts building
to mark the next thousand years is a Government ambition. Merging the ENO
and Covent Garden is, however, a favoured scheme of The Times editor, Simon
Jenkins.
Opera 80 was unhappy with its name. In the nineties it seems to be the last
vestige of Thatcherite Britain. So it has changed it - to English Touring
Opera, the kind of name that could have been around for years. As indeed it
was - it was the original name for the company now known as City of
Birmingham Touring Opera. English Touring Opera was the best that six
months, and Pounds 10,000 of research, could come up with, winning out over
more creative options like (hard to believe) Moving Opera and Aria. The
feeling was that the potential customers of Opera 80 might not be able to
pronounce Aria.
At least English Touring Opera exactly describes the work of the company,
which is subsidised by the Arts Council with Pounds 620,000, plus more from
sponsors, on its visits to medium sized venues. English National Opera was
not best pleased with the change: but it survived London Festival Ballet
transforming into English National Ballet and it accepts that few of its
customers will mistake small scale ETO for Coliseum based ENO.
The Arts Council is doing its bit for the disabled, raising its budget for
handicapped performers from Pounds 91,000 to Pounds 150,000 in a year and
persuading a Duke (Westminster) and two Lords (Palumbo and Rix) to attend a
Theatre and Disability Conference in Manchester next Friday.
But it seemed to be carrying its commitment beyond the pale with a special
grant of Pounds 25,000 to enable Bolton Octagon to put on Titus Andronicus
employing disabled actors. The prospect of the armless or the tongueless
coping with Shakespeare's most bloody play, packed with such amputations,
was surely too much. It turns out that the play will use deaf actors.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Arts: Quick, witty and very New York - Malcolm Rutherford
reviews 'Six Degrees of Separation'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS good that American theatre should make forays into mainstream London
for it teaches us that the British still have some tricks to learn. Tony
Kushner's Angels in America, which has been playing at the National Theatre
for most of this year, is one example. John Guare's Six Degrees of
Separation, which opened at the Royal Court this week, is another. The plays
are serious, witty and, above all, fast, a technique that must have been
learned from the best of American cinema. They rely heavily on texts, acting
and good direction, and otherwise can be remarkably spare in their
requirements.
The set for Six Degrees consists of a simple background of colourful
American abstract art. The only props are a few equally colourful chairs and
the odd glass. Yet in this minimalist setting, there is a style, a flair and
self-confidence that you would not normally associate with the Royal Court
nor even with the National Theatre. The best of contemporary American
theatre depends on talking fast, and talking well.
Six Degrees is very New York. It assumes several degrees of knowledge in the
audience. Within a few minutes we have been through the psychology of
Catcher in the Rye and how the book may have contributed to the killing of
John Lennon and the attempted killing of Ronald Reagan. Since this is New
York, the subjects of race and money are never far away. South Africa comes
in at the start because it combines the two. South African money can finance
the purchase of a Cezanne by an upmarket New York art dealer, who can sell
it on to Japan, although even to mention South Africa requires the right
tone of voice. The nuances of political and social correctness can produce
very good theatre.
The dialogue in Six Degrees is superior to the plot, but even the latter is
way above average and is based, for what it matters, on a true story. A
young man called Paul claims to be the son of Sidney Poitier, the movie
star. He inveigles his way into Fifth Avenue apartments and charms the
occupants by offering them walk-on parts in his father's screen version of
Cats. This is a hard choice, for they tend to regard the musical as the
lowest of the low. Nevertheless, they are delighted to accept.
Paul, played by Adrian Lester, is a homosexual who has been trained into
con-manship by one of the cleverest of the Fifth Avenue children, now at
MIT. The homosexual scenes are not nearly as explicit nor as central as in
Angels in America and, against the trend, Paul does not have AIDS. This is,
after all, a comedy. Yet the homosexuality is still handled better and more
openly than I have seen in any British play. It is accepted as a fact of
life, neither to sniggered at nor to be paraded as a cause.
Six Degrees has its pretentions, not least in the title.
For the rest, it is simply a witty play almost entirely devoid of the
besetting fault of American theatre: sentimentality. Where it scores apart
from in the writing is in sheer zest. When the kids come home from Harvard,
they do it in explosive fashion, demonstrating all the intellectual
arrogance of youth. There are some little gems of dialogue all along, like
the question about the people on Fifth Avenue: 'Are they rich?' and the
answer 'No, hand to mouth on a higher plateau.' Low jokes as well: the
Harvard course on the holocaust and ethics has been retitled 'Krauts and
doubts'.
Conventionally one should single out Stockard Channing as Ouisa, the female
lead, and she is magnificent, but plainly she knows that this is a team
performance. The play is directed by Phyllida Lloyd, who is British. London
should rise to it.

I'VE SEEN THE BEST OF IT
by Joseph Alsop with Adam Platt
W W Norton Pounds 19.55, 495 pges
JOSEPH ALSOP was a very clever, but very fat and rather unattractive child.
He grew up in what he describes as the Wasp (white anglo-saxon protestant)
ascendancy in New England. Although his background was not rich by the
standards of the time and place, it was certainly comfortable. When it was
decided that he was unsuited either for business or the law, his grandmother
recalled that he had sent her some well-written letters from Harvard, so why
not journalism?
Nobody in the family had ever gone in for that before, nor knew anyone else
connected with it except for the Ogden Reids, who happened to own the New
York Herald Tribune and were friends of Alsop's grandmother. A word in the
right ear and Alsop was on his way to becoming one of the best-known
political columnists the world over.
Alsop died in 1989 with his memoirs not quite completed. They have been put
together by Adam Platt, another American journalist, but there should be no
doubt that this is the Alsop story. Essentially I've Seen The Best Of It
should be a book for journalists, and it is certainly that: it is also one
of the best personal memoirs I have read for several years.
The Washington to which Alsop was sent as a junior reporter in the 1930s was
totally different from that of today. 'No-one hurried and few ever worked
later than 5 pm . . . there was no really great restaurant, nor was it
missed . . . We never locked our doors and never so much thought of the
horrible word 'security': crime was non-existent . . . Anyone invited to
dine with the president and Mrs Roosevelt simply drew up to the front door
of the White House and rang the bell.'
Alsop describes it as a paradise for political reporters. Being
well-connected both by birth and education, he had no problems of access.
Even as a young man, he could wander in and see the secretary of state every
day. It was from there that the idea of a political column began.
Alsop lays down some of the early ground rules he established for himself.
On reporting, for example: don't ask foolish questions, don't waste time by
being diverted from the subject in hand, and 'no matter how big a bastard
you have to talk business with, never be rude unless the bastard is rude
first'. Alsop says that one one of the few bastards with whom he ever broke
his own rule was Senator Joe McCarthy.
There were also rules for columnists: for example, any column that gets too
far from the headlines is bound to be disregarded; 'never write about
serious overseas problems without being overseas long enough to smell the
weather on the streets'; and 'don't make extreme assertions on your
authority.' The trick of writing a column, Alsop thought, was rather like a
debased version of the trick of writing sonnets: it had to be well
organised. And, of course, you had to work at the facts.
That was how the Alsop column became a model. Sometimes he did it with a
fellow journalist, often his brother Stewart. Earlier he had twinned with an
economics specialist so that the best of political and economic knowledge
could go into the same column, a practice that might be resumed today.
Column-writing, however, has its hazards. One of them stems from becoming
too involved in the political processes you are seeking to describe:
pomposity or partisanship can creep in. There seems little doubt that this
is what happened to Alsop over time. In the late 1960s and early 1970s he
was a great supporter of American involvement in Vietnam and fell out with
many of his old friends in the process.
This is how his diary could read on a trip to Saigon: 'Monday, 18 March, Air
France 191, arr. Saigon, 5.05 pm, dinner with Amb Ellsworth Bunker, Stay
with Amb Bunker, Tuesday, 19 March, morning at American Embassy, 2.30 pm,
Gen Philip Davidson (chief of intelligence, Westmoreland's staff), 7.30 pm,
dinner with Gen Westmoreland.' And so it went on, through President Thieu
and Vice President Ky the next day before back to dinner with Ambassador
Bunker. There was not much there of smelling the weather in the streets.
Some people would say that the older Alsop had broken the young Alsop's
rules.
Nevertheless, Alsop young and old could write and every door was open to
him. This book is full of stories - like the time when he threw Guy Burgess
and Donald Maclean out of his Washington house before it was known they were
spies, or when he asked Churchill about younger Tories. 'There's Hogg,' said
Churchill, 'he's an ass. Don't know any others.'

HITLER'S DIPLOMAT
by John Weitz
Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 20, 336 pages
SUAVE AND shallow seems an apt summing up of Joachim von Ribbentrop. He
added the 'von' himself, to enhance his status as son of a wine merchant.
So, unlike the bully boys who formed the Nazi Party, young Ribbentrop joined
as a toff.
The louche, cabaret ambience of pre-war Berlin gave him contact with the
young riff-raff of the party. He presented these roaring boys in his home as
'men who have a programme for Germany'. It was an early example of radical
chic, as Tom Wolfe remarks in his preface to John Weitz' fluent and
fascinating biography of Hitler's ambassador to London.
In some ways, the young Ribbentrop resembled the yuppies of yester-year: he
had money, married well, had good connections and was an ardent social
climber. He had a certain cosmopolitan polish gained from travel abroad; he
even played a good game of tennis. He might have lived a casual, rich,
social life, but instead he became thoroughly besotted with Hitler.
Hitler wanted someone to translate the London and Paris papers, Ribbentrop
was recommended. Hitler became a guest at the house, usually on his own,
because of his table manners - 'he was not someone you could invite anyone
with]' according to Anelies von Ribbentrop. Finally he got a minor job in
the office of Hess, the party deputy.
Gradually, he inveigled himself into a position where he ran foreign errands
for Hitler. He expanded his office into an organisation. He became Hitler's
advance man in his campaign for an alliance with Britain. (The author is
especially revealing on English society of those years.) By 1935 Ribbentrop
had become Ambassador Extraordinary on special mission, by-passing the
London and other embassies. He negotiated (his diplomatic technique was
'take it or leave it') a Naval Agreement with the British Government which
was hailed by Hitler as a triumph.
Posted in 1936 as ambassador to the Court of St. James, he proved way out of
his depth. The bitchy, witty society of that time, as recorded by Chips
Channon, made fun of him. His worst gaffe was at the Palace: bowing out of
the audience chamber, after presenting his credentials to George V1,
Ribbentrop three times half-raised his right arm in a modified Hitler
salute. The press got to hear of it and went wild: 'Ribb Heils King]' The
gaffe quickly reached Berlin; even Hitler was dismayed.
And so it goes on, a figure more foolish and ambitious, maybe, than
monstrous, but utterly tainted. Because even if he did not know what he was
doing at the start, he soon learned the truth about the Nazis. A sort of
slavish admiration of Hitler, devoid of any moral sense, led him on. The
world of diplomacy was far more glamorous than importing wines. In the end,
fallen from his glory as foreign minister, even Ribbentrop came to realise
that his pact with the devil could only end one way: by his execution. His
ashes were deposited unceremoniously with those of the other war criminals
in a small stream near Munich.

SPIRIT WEDDINGS

Hutchinson Pounds 13.99, 215 pages
PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST'S WIFE
by Barbara Anderson
Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 13.99, 309 pages
HOME RULE
by Clare Boylan
Hamish Hamilton Pounds 14.99, 220 pages
GILLIAN TINDALL, a reliably intelligent writer, offers an unusual novel that
combines the effortful suspense of a good detective story with a shrewdly
observed family saga and some outstanding travel writing.
The Great City and the Great Land are imaginary places a long-haul flight
east of Bombay. Thither goes Stephen, a widowed, middle-aged country doctor,
persuaded to return by his son, Christopher, a pretentious travel writer.
Nowadays the Great City is, in Christopher's words, 'an archetype of late
20th century urbanisation, the equal of New York, Tokyo and Hong Kong, yet
itself, and only itself . . .' Stephen knew the place before the war, when
it was an undeveloped colonial outpost smelling of 'salt swamp water and old
cooking oil'. The reason for his return is Christopher's excitement about
the existence of a peasant doppelganger, Bhat Way, who may be his first
cousin, the son of his dead aunt Tessa.
This is only the beginning of a drama which also involves Stephen's elder
sister, Pauline, a hectoring vicar's wife, who reacts in a violent and
apparently uncharacteristic way when her husband runs off with another
woman. In the telling it becomes clear that narrator Stephen is not the
sympathetic and reliable chap that he first appears. As the true story of
Bhat Way's origin emerges we see the damage that even well-meant
interference can inflict on innocent lives.
In the end it is only the peasant, Bhat Way, uniting the ill-fated lovers
that he considers were his parents in a 'spirit wedding' who finds any
consolation. It is all ineffably sad, though I would argue with Tindall's
insinuation that the custom of sending colonial children 'home' to boarding
school led to entire generations of emotional cripples.
Barbara Anderson is a New Zealander, born in 1926, and Portrait of the
Artist's Wife follows the activities of a group of friends from pre-war
childhood to a distinguished middle age. Sarah Tandy, the wife of the title,
is one of New Zealand's leading painters, while her husband, Jack
Macalister, is a prize-winning novelist. In the opening pages she is
accepting an award for her husband's posthumous novel at a ceremony which
encapsulates all that is awful about the provincial arts scene anywhere -
the platitudinous Minister's speech, the bitchy gossip of the guests, and
the scant supply of warm white wine. We then return to their childhood on
Hawkes Bay where Jacks's father had a sheep station and Sarah's was a
doctor, and nobody even imagined that 'the arts' would ever be a part of
their everyday lives.
Anderson has a sharp eye and ready wit, but also, alas, a tendency to become
over-fond of her characters and to sentimentalise them accordingly. What
promised to be a challenging look at 20th century New Zealand turns into a
touching love story about a marriage which survived against the odds. The
early days in Hawke's Bay and the lives of Jack and Sarah's parents'
generation are of much more interest than the progress of the protagonists
and their contemporaries, who say things like :'Any conversation that is not
about literature bores me.'
Home Rule is described as a 'prequel' to Clare Boylan's first novel, Holy
Pictures. The latter was inspired by her mother's upbringing; the 'prequel'
takes off from the life of Boylan's grandmother, Daisy Devlin, who grew up
in working class Dublin at the turn of the century. Daisy's mother was an
English Protestant who was warned that if she married an Irish man he would
give her 10 children and leave her destitute, and this is exactly what
happens. Until her husband's death, this unfortunate woman took refuge from
the hard realities of her life in a front parlour decked out with trinkets
salvaged from her Kensington home. As the parlour disappears into the
pawnbroker's Mrs Devlin's frail sanity starts to disintegrate too.
At her best, Clare Boylan combines a wicked sense of humour with a talent
for deadly accurate imagery. Here her strengths are overwhelmed by the
relentless demands of the massive family saga with its sentimental set
pieces and melodramatic climaxes. The hard facts of history (25,000 men
locked out in Jim Larkin's 1930 strike, 49,000 Irishmen dead in the First
World War, 1,198 drowned in the sinking of the Lusitania) pale against the
string of violent deaths, seductions, betrayals and reversals of fortune
endured by the Devlin family. The result is an uneven sort of book, where
scenes that belong in a more down market novel are suddenly lit up by a
flash (a cat's 'painted trap of fangs'. 'lawns small and neat as crustless
sandwiches') that reminds us how very good the real Clare Boylan can be.

Joseph Brodsky

WATERMARK
by Joseph Brodsky
Hamish Hamilton Pounds 12.99, 135 pages
THE CITY of Leningrad in 1940, when Iosif Brodskii was born there into a
Jewish family, was not an environment hospitable to poets. Even so, in spite
of the hostility of the authorities, poets lived and worked there, notably
the great Anna Akhmatova.
At the end of the war in 1945 she was preparing a major collection of work
and establishing links with the West when suddenly the authorities clamped
down on her. Her poetry was described as 'ideologically harmful'; the
print-run of a book she was about to publish was destroyed and Akhmatova was
expelled from the Soviet Writers' Union. After Stalin's death in 1953, and
the beginning of de-Stalinisation in 1956 under Khrushchev, she began to
publish again. By the end of the decade Akhmatova had become literary
godmother to a group of free-minded young poets based in Leningrad.
One of them was Anatoly Nayman, who became Akhmatova's secretary and whose
interesting book Remembering Anna Akhmatova was published in the UK last
year by Peter Halban (Pounds 18). Another was Joseph Brodsky, as he is now
universally known, who wrote the introduction to that book. After the fall
of Khrushchev in 1964, the climate for poets worsened again and this time
the backlash of repression struck at the 24-year-old Brodsky. As a poet who
did not belong to the Writers' Union, Brodsky was a non-person and he found
himself facing trial. The charge was parasitism or vagrancy (tuneyadstvo in
Russian).
At his trial Brodsky showed a similar resilience to that of Oscar Wilde when
affirming from the criminal dock the right of an artist to practise his art
in whatever circumstances.
Judge: 'Who recognised you as a poet? Who gave you the authority to call
yourself a poet?'
Brodsky: 'No one. Who gave me the authority to enter the human race?'
Judge: 'Have you studied for it?'
Brodsky: 'For what?'
Judge: 'To become a poet. Why didn't you take secondary education at school
where they prepare you, where you can learn?'
Brodsky: 'I didn't think poetry was a matter of learning.'
Judge: 'What is it then?
Brodsky: 'I think it is . . . (in confusion) . . . a gift from God.'
And as in the case of Wilde, Brodsky's brilliance of response did not do him
much good. The female judge passed a sentence of exile in a remote locality
for a period of five years hard labour. The young Brodsky was sent to serve
it at a state farm near Archangel. Akhmatova and others did what they could
for him. Eventually after two years Brodsky, in poor health through
suffering the intense cold of the Russian north, was pardoned and released.
He recovered, continued to write poetry, and found a job in a
publishing-house in Moscow.
Nicholas Bethell, who translated the above transcript, went to see him, and
made versions in English for the first collection of Brodsky's poems to
appear in the UK - Elegy to John Donne (1967). In 1972 Brodsky became 'an
involuntary exile' from the Soviet Union and after brief periods in Vienna
and London he went to live in the US, turning down two invitations to
emigrate to Israel. In 1980 A Part of Speech, poems translated into English
verse by various poet-translators, was published; and most recently in 1988
To Urania: Selected Poems 1965-1985, some of which are translated by Brodsky
himself. In 1987 Brodsky was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature and
currently he is poet laureate of the US.
The intellectual intensity of his poetry - no wonder he wrote a poem in
praise of Donne - shines powerfully through these translations, especially
when he is writing about women he loves. A fine poem entitled 'The
Butterfly', in which he ponders the fate of a gorgeous creature whose entire
life-span lasts for less than a day, strikes a typical note of thoughtful
lyricism. Brodsky's poetry stimulates the reader and challenges his
assumptions, like Auden at his best. And he has written a remarkable essay
about Auden, in a collection of prose, Less Than One (1987, to be reissued
in August by Penguin); and now, just published, we have a long prose-essay
by Brodsky about visiting Venice, written in English in 1989.
It is a charmingly wayward and evocative rumination. We are dealing here
with a major writer who, like Nabokov, has successfully managed the
transition from his native Russian to an English prose style of so great an
ornateness that it might be modelled on that of Sir Thomas Browne ('Eyesight
is the instrument of adjustment to an environment which remains hostile no
matter how well you have adjusted to it').
Brodsky has been adjusting to the environment of Venice, both hostile and
friendly, in a series of sojourns in that city ever since he first visited
it in 1972 at the age of 32. He captures its impact upon a sensitive
traveller - exile, poet, lover, acute observer - with the same obliquity and
insinuating use of non-sequitur that is typical of his poetry. The habit of
hinting at a truth, of presenting it with calculated ambiguity, a technique
cultivated by many Russian writers to outwit the censor, dies hard.
The most recent example of Brodsky's way of conducting an argument by taking
two steps forward and one step back may be seen in A Philby Fantasy
published in the American weekly The New Republic (April 20 1992). This
piece is a speculation on the probable effect of Philby on the formulation
of Soviet policy towards the Arab world. It was inspired by Brodsky's shock
at seeing a blow-up of the traitor's face, taken from the Russian
postage-stamp commemorating Philby, on the cover of the London Review of
Books in a bookshop in Hampstead. Nowadays Brodsky gets around.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Books: A poet of passion - The 60th birthday of Geoffrey
Hill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL GLOVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS WEEK it is the 60th birthday of the poet Geoffrey Hill, one of
England's great, flawed, stuttering intelligences, a man much admired but
less read.
He was born in the village of Fairfield in the West Midlands, the only son
of a policeman.
From Keble College, Oxford, he went on to academic posts in the English
departments of Leeds, Cambridge and - since the late 1980s - Boston
university, although his decision to teach in the US should not be read as
an act of wilful self-exile in the Auden mode.
His achievements as a poet and scholar are incontestable (some have called
him the greatest English poet since the second world war) but a wide
readership has eluded him. Perhaps one reason is that he always has been
difficult to get to grips with; his prose can be maddeningly gnomic and
olympian. Critics have tended either to circle around him warily, as if he
were not so much a poet as some kind of intellectual explosive device, or to
genuflect and over-praise him.
His most recent book, The Enemy's Country (1991) - which is substantially
the text of the Clark lectures delivered at Cambridge in 1986, and an
important work of cultural and literary criticism - was virtually ignored by
the national press when it was published last year. And his poetry appears
only intermittently; his last book, a long poem entitled The Mystery of the
Charity of Charles Peguy, was written 10 years ago. Since then, there have
been only a handful of poems.
Yet, Hill's poetry has been disturbing the consensus since the end of the
1950s when it seemed to mark a sharp break with both the traditions of the
recent past and the habits of the poets who were fashionable at the time.
Much of the poetry of the 1940s is marked by a kind of verbal and visionary
extravagance, a steep dive into the innermost recesses of the self, as if
the terrors of actuality - war and its immediate aftermath  - had been
altogether too much for poets to contemplate.
In the 1950s came the denial of all that, with Kingsley Amis and others
proclaiming the need for a more modest, humdrum art altogether, a poetry
that would have something to do with everyday life: love affairs, motor cars
and kitchen utensils. And then, along came Hill, all formal music and
blustering rhetoric. For the Unfallen (1959) is a body of poems that was as
turbulent and bloody as any Jacobean tragedy, with 'death' the first, third
and fifth word in his vocabulary.
Although having no fixed religion, he was writing poems of passion and an
almost stifling fervour - gloomy closet dramas full of lurid cameos from the
history of England and elsewhere, complete with grunts, cries and
ejaculations. Out of key with the times? Hill seemed to care not one jot.
Ten years later, King Log was published, equally impassioned but, this time,
even more uncomfortable in its subject matter. There were poems about the
atrocities of the Third Reich and a bloody return (in sonnet form) to the
Wars of the Roses.
Perhaps most memorably, there was a poem called 'History as Poetry' which,
in one brief phrase - 'the tongue's atrocities' - raised a question which
has been of paramount importance in Hill's work: can the poet write about
the terrible immoralities of our time without being guilty of the luxuries
of the bystander?
A second great theme is the poet's difficult relation to language itself:
how he must wrestle with this recalcitrant medium if anything of enduring
value is to be yielded up; and how language itself must be made clean if it
is to become a tool for clear and exacting expression.
The guiding spirit of The Enemy's Country is John Dryden, in Hill's eyes a
poet 'ingenuous and at bay.' Dryden, a Catholic whose fierce loyalty to
James II caused him to be deprived of his public offices after the
abdication, was doomed to be a scribbler all his life by what he once
memorably described as The Vocation of Poverty.
His tyrannical publisher, Tonson, held him accountable for every last line
that he wrote and Dryden himself was driven by hatred of, and contempt for,
his patrons - who included the Earl of Rochester, a considerable poet in his
own right, of course.
Yet Dryden toiled on, cheerful, optimistic in spite of all odds, picking his
difficult way through the Enemy's Country, outwitting the 'treachery of
words,' bringing public utterance and private feeling into harmony and
writing, in his many prefaces and postscripts to his plays and translations,
with a great, plain eloquence.
Geoffrey Hill, on his birthday, might choose to learn something from Dryden
 -for example, a lesson in plainness and good manners which might stop him
in future from writing such a sentence as: 'It is, of course, a matter of
common observation that the actual mechanics of quotidian life  .. are
inevitably a matter of ambivalent regard.'
Such lofty abstractions, handed down from such a great height, do not sit
well with his considerable talents.
Hill's birthday is celebrated in a special double issue of Agenda magazine.
It costs Pounds 8 and can be obtained from 5 Cranbourne Court, Albert Bridge
Road, London SW11 4PE.

IMAGE ON THE EDGE: THE MARGINS OF MEDIEVAL ART
by Michael Camille
Reaktion Books Pounds 25/Pounds 10.95
176 pages
IN THE British Library, there is a beautiful and precious manuscript called
The Luttrell Psalter. Made sometime in the 1320s for Sir Geoffrey Luttrell,
a wealthy Lincolnshire lord, the text of the Psalms was written by just one
scribe. It took a team of artists to illustrate it. For the Psalms
themselves, they made some fine historiated initials. But when it came to
the margins and foot of each page, they went mad.
One scholar has suggested that the best of the Luttrell illustrators, known
as 'Hand A', was mad. What sane person, he marvelled, could have come up
with such a bevy of fantastic, brilliantly-coloured monsters?
But it was not just monsters which were permitted to disport themselves
around the edge of King David's sacred words. The margins of the Luttrell
Psalter stand as a kind of visual encyclopaedia of late medieval culture. It
swarms with a bizarre medley of images: religious scenes, birds, flowers,
beasts, wild men and unicorns, heraldic devices, knights at combat, and
now-famous scenes of everyday life: toiling peasants, the Luttrells
feasting, singers, dancers, and mummers.
Scholars find it very difficult to account for the riot of marginal images
which irrupted in northern European books between about 1230 and 1400. How
can such a love of complexity, of the parodic and grotesque, be reconciled
with texts which were generally of a devotional nature, and were
commissioned by pious men and women? And still more surprising, to a modern
eye, are the 'rude' images of love-making, bare-arsed figures and
defecation.
In Image on the Edge Michael Camille opens up this fascinating and
problematic subject for a non-specialist audience. Slim and seductively
designed, this book appears with only the most rudimentary acknowledgement
of the sober reality of the medieval paleographer's world. There is no
index, and only confusing notes and references - Camille appears less than
keen to acknowledge his debts to other sources. His approach is slapdash.
From the margins of the page, Camille swiftly extends his scope to corbels,
gargoyles and misericords - the semi-hidden images on the edge of peoples'
bottoms, a subject in which he takes a keen interest. Of all the myriad
types of marginal image, Camille dwells longest on the 'rude' ones.
How important, quantitatively, are these obscenae? Were they standard fare;
more common in England than in France; in one period than another? These are
exactly the kind of down-to-earth questions which do not interest Camille.
He does not blush to describe the Rutland Psalter as if it were
distinguished, above all, for its anally compulsive artists. And yet, I have
it on good authority that only a tiny percentage of its playful
illustrations show arrows up bums.
With great ingenuity, Camille reads sexual inuendoes into apparently
innocuous images. Snails, he suggests, were popular in manuscripts and
carvings not because of their formal appeal, but because they symbolise
female genitalia. A woman in a strange head-dress is a 'conscious' phallic
reference. The flaccid turban was 'perhaps' inspired by the Latin word
conturbata in the text. But would an English artist in 1300 have known the
Persian word, turban?
The fundamental problem with this book is that behind all the superficial
cleverness, the flitting hither and thither across the 'sexiest' topics of
medieval historiography, it rests on an obsession with a flawed metaphor.
Years ago, sociologists and anthropologists fell in love with the notion of
'the marginalised'. Every society thrusts on to its margins those ideas,
forms of behaviour and social groups which constitute a threat to social
order. To marginalise something is, then, to reaffirm the dominance of the
centre.
Camille strains away at this metaphor: for example, beggars appear in the
margins of books just as in medieval Paris they tended to live by the walls.
Marginal art constituted, therefore, the zone where medieval society
permitted artists - themselves a 'marginal group' - to let rip. The text
alone had meaning: outside it, artists were free to create images of those
whom he claims were 'marginalised' - prostitutes, peasants, fools,
vagabonds, cripples, beggars, sinners, lovers, the entire female sex.
Unfortunately, Camille displays no real grasp of the role of any of these
groups within medieval society. The result is a book which exemplifies the
arrogance, pretentiousness and anachronism which characterise
post-structuralist thought at its worst. We may applaud the deftness with
which he turns his argument at the end into an attack on the Moral Majority.
But on the way, he has produced a travesty.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Motoring: In the midnight sun with the roof down - Stuart
Marshall tests the Saab cabriolet in an Arctic summer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPRING WAS a little late this year in northern Norway. In early June, snow
still lay thickly on the tundra. The stunted birch trees were as bare as
they had been all winter.
Then, overnight, the temperature shot up. The snow began to melt, the rivers
ran in spate and the trees grew green almost as you watched. Three days
later Spring was over. Summer had come.
All this I learned last week when I drove a Saab 900 convertible, roof down
in brilliant 24-hour sunshine, from Alta to the North Cape (Nordkapp) and
back again.
Country and car were perfect partners. With the all-round visibility of an
open car, I smelt the countryside, felt the sun and the wind and savoured
Norway's arctic north to the full. Well wrapped up and with the heater on,
it was pure pleasure to drink in the scenery on the 134 miles (215 km) drive
from Alta to the Nordkapp.
The road first crosses Stabbursdalen National Park, one of Europe's great
wildernesses, then runs up the Porsangen inlet to Kvfjord. From Kvfjord, a
super-modern ferry which seems hardly to have docked before it is off again,
takes vehicles to Honningsvvg, from which the Nordkapp is another 22 miles
(35 km).
It is an easy drive. The metalled road from Alta to Kvfjord is beautifully
engineered, well surfaced and almost deserted. You have to keep an eye open
for suicidal reindeer. And the hood had to go up for the 3 km long Skarvberg
tunnel. Water still pours through the roof, just as it did when I drove to
Nordkapp from Rovaniemi, 300 or so kilometres to the south and exactly on
the Arctic Circle, in the late 1970s.
Then it was a tough drive, on dirt roads all the way. Now only the last
stretch from Honningsvvg to the cape is unmetalled. It will not be for much
longer. Already the bulldozers are busy, which I am sure will please drivers
of tourist buses taking thousands of visitors to Nordkapp.
The 300 metre high cliffs that fall vertically into the Arctic Ocean are a -
literally - fearful sight. But the simple stone hut that, 17 years ago, sold
postcards and not much else has given way to a Nordkapp complex. It has
restaurants, a multi-screen cinema and huge, picture- windowed viewing area
from which to see the Midnight Sun.
Seventeen years ago, on midsummer midnight, I had stood freezing on the
cliff edge, waiting for the sun to kiss the horizon before climbing skyward.
But a snowstorm had swept in from the east and I saw nothing.
This time I watched from the comfort of the viewing area but, once more,
nature had the last laugh. At midnight, the sky was cloudy. Only while
driving back down to Honningsvvg did the half- past-midnight sun blaze out
again.
Though quite a veteran among convertibles, the Saab 900 is still one of the
best. It was conceived at the request of Saab's US importer, unveiled as a
prototype at Frankfurt in 1983 and put on sale three years later.
The easy way of making a saloon car into a convertible used to be to chop
the top off, weld some extra metal on the pressed-steel chassis platform,
fit a folding hood and hope for the best.
It did not always work. Some hardtops turned into soft tops used to shake
like unset jellies on all but billiard table road surfaces.
Saab's way - and to be fair, it is now the way of all major manufacturers
adding soft-tops to their ranges - was to redesign the entire structure so
none of its rigidity or crash protection would be seriously compromised.
(One has to say, though, that people riding in the back seat of an open car
that rolls over must be at greater risk than they would be in a saloon).
Saab also wanted its 900 cabriolet to be a proper four-seater, not a cramped
2+2, with a roomy boot. It had to be refined as well as a good goer, and
comfortably usable all year round. So the power-operated hood was triple
layered to keep the heat in. There is a defroster in the glass rear window.
At first, Saab thought it would make a couple of thousand cabriolets for two
or three years, and that would be that. But its launch coincided with a wave
of fashion for soft tops in the US. Demand was double that forecast, and
waiting lists grew.
Last year, 7,765 cabriolets were sold, with 10,000 expected this year.
Although the veteran 900 is nearing the end of its life the cabriolet will
stay in production for some time after the its successor appears.
Eventually, there will be a cabriolet version of the new 900. No-one is
saying when, but cabriolets can be remarkably long lived. The VW Golf
cabriolet, which is based on the original Mk. I Golf, is still with us,
eight years after the Mk. I Golf was replaced by the Mk. II which was itself
superseded by the Mk. III last year.
Saabs are generally reckoned to be strongly masculine cars, but women love
the 900 cabriolet, buying more than one in four of those sold in Britain. I
found it a rewarding car to drive. The light-pressure turbocharged engine of
the manual and automatic versions I drove gave adequate rather than
kick-in-the-back acceleration. But the ride was excellent and the whole car
felt as solid as - well, a Saab.
With the hood up, one was aware it was not a saloon only because the rear
quarters field of vision is restricted. And the rather shallow windscreen -
a sign of age - did make it seem beetle-browed when closed up.
At Pounds 19,245 to Pounds 26,895 - it depends whether the 4-cylinder,
2-litre engine is naturally aspirated, light-pressure or higher- pressure
turbocharged, plus Pounds 832 for automatic transmission instead of a
5-speed gearbox - the cabriolets are at least 25 per cent dearer than
equivalent 900 saloons.
That makes them quite expensive. But then the best things in motoring life,
Saab's car for all seasons included, never have come cheaply.

FT  20 JUN 92 / As they say in Europe: Scene: a blasted heath
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HEADLINE in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung read: 'Anti-competition
of the game destroyers.' Football editor Peter Hess continued by asking:
'How was it before?'
Hess then contemplated the dismal state of the game: 'Was scoring a goal
really once the mind and purpose of the game of football? Or what? And the
highest aim: was it, in fact, to get just one more goal than the opponents?
. . . Is football played to please the manager or the public?' (This is
actually taken from Franz Beckenbauer's aria, 'Extra Time,' from Wagner's
unpublished work, 'Die Meisterspieler von FC Nurnberg').
Hess's commentary appeared over the report of the lamentable England-France
0-0 draw of last Sunday which British television commentators described,
uniquely, as a good performance (and that says something or other about
English football). The headline was a prophetic masterpiece: 'The depths
successfully plumbed: England can't, France won't' Unfortunately, the FAZ
report did not appear until Tuesday. German newspapers carry little news of
the day before as they close most of the pages at about four in the
afternoon under what seems to be some sort of non-competition agreement
between publishers - the media equivalent of a 0-0 draw.
It has been said that soccer is a game for gentleman played by cads, and
rugby a game for cads played by gentlemen, but the great French footballer,
Alain Giresse, is the ultimate gentleman. He has a question-and-answer
column in the sports paper L'Equipe. When asked why the English made so many
errors against France, he referred only to the 'intensity and the power of
the defence.'
What a contrast with Hess, who retold an obscure joke made after the game by
England manager, Graham Taylor, adding: 'This touch of English humour could
not make up for the damaging boredom of the preceding 90 minutes. That would
have required an hour and a half of Monty Python's Flying Circus.'
His comments appeared before the best game of the tournament: Scotland 0,
Germany 2. The Scots arouse a lot of affection in football circles. Giresse
was asked: 'Will Scotland change one day?' He replied: 'Good question] It is
incredible, the years pass, competitions come and go, but every time it is
the same Scots, faithful to their traditions. Here (in Sweden) they live in
town, stroll about, laugh and appear relaxed in all situations. And yet,
always animated by a formidable state of mind but deprived of technical and
attacking skills; always hard to beat but, at the end of the day, always
beaten.'
Now this from Le Monde diplomatique: 'You don't go to Macbeth to teach
yourself Scottish history, you go to learn what remains of a man when he
gains a kingdom and loses his own soul.' That introduced a huge feature
entitled 'Football reveals the major antagonisms of our societies,' which
showed that there is a good deal more to the game than many believe. Bill
Shankly, the late manager of Liverpool, got it right when asked if football
really was a matter of life and death. 'No, it's much more serious than
that,' he said.
The Monde quotation was from an anonymous work to be published this year
called The Football Match: Ethnology of a partisan passion in Marseilles,
Naples and Turin. It argued that 'one may decently lend to a football match
the dignity and allegorical depth of a great drama.' Le Monde's Christian
Bromberger said the game provides an opportunity 'for the affirmation of
collective identities and local and regional antagonisms.'
And national] The Dutch hatred of Danes, which I revealed exclusively here
two weeks ago, has shown itself again in the pages of NRC-Handelsblad.
Elsbeth Etty, in a comment headed 'Something Rotten,' wrote of the perfectly
good Dutch goal against the CIS that was disallowed last Monday. 'It was bad
enough when 11 European countries were thrown off course by a single
referendumette, but to do it again to 11 Dutch footballers is going too far.
It was indeed a Danish linesman who said 'no' to Marco van Basten's
beautiful goal. That was not clear only to Dutch television viewers; even
the BBC ('It's a goal, no doubt it's a goal') agreed.'
Footnote: Jean, at the Scottish Football Association, tells me that a
Macbeth played for East Fife (of course) in 1927-30.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Dial 'C' for customers - A food
supplier who found clients in the Yellow pages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK GARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'I STARTED with only a domestic fridge and a freezer in my own home. I had a
copy of the Yellow Pages, hired a mobile telephone, and drove around,
looking for customers. In the first week, my turnover was Pounds 439.'
That was the start, back in October, 1989, of Ian McFarlane's entry into the
food business. Since then, his company, selling chilled victuals to hotels,
restaurants and delicatessens has notched up sales of Pounds 225,000 in its
second full year. While McFarlane's salary remains modest, and the
business's overall profit margin a skimpy 10 per cent, Glendower Foods has
supplied the 25-year-old with a new career.
'I trained in hotel management and was working for a surveying company in
the City valuing hotels,' McFarlane said. 'The company has gone out of
business, but I left it before then. I got bored.'
Someone advised him that a niche existed supplying smoked salmon. A trader
at London's Billingsgate fish market generously gave McFarlane the name of
his Scottish supplier. Pounds 300 purchased the fridge and freezer.
McFarlane realised straightaway that a 30 per cent margin was available,
selling the fish.
Within a month, he also realised that the advice was duff. The niche was
minnow-sized, too small to supply a living. Subsequent events only confirmed
this. 'So many people are smoking salmon, the market is flooded. The whole
thing has been blown apart. Margins on fresh salmon are also very tight,
partly because the Norwegians are dumping.'
Operating then from a flat in a village outside Oxford, McFarlane began
adding frozen prawns and home-made cakes.
Last year, Glendower Foods moved into a small retail building in the
beautiful village of Ardington, near Didcot, and, this year, to a
1,000-square-foot unit in the same village. Its handsome inventory of
products - encapsulated in a bound 'menu' with coloured pictures - now
includes pate and marinated goat's cheese, duck breasts and foie gras,
Spanish sausages and gravad lax, as well as cooking chocolate, oils,
vinegars, ice-cream and yoghurts.
'Turnover this year will be just short of Pounds 500,000. We would hope,
within the next two years or so, to get up to Pounds 1m or more.'
Glendower offers about 500 different foods, uses 40 suppliers, and has 150
or so regular customers. Hotels take up to 70 per cent of supplies,
restaurants a further 15 per cent, and delis a similar amount.
McFarlane runs the business from a small office, using an IBM computer
purchased for Pounds 2,600, and a Pounds 400 fax. There is a staff of three.
'Each one has a particular set of customers. It's very important to keep
personal contacts. Most customers will be visited at least three times a
year.'
The village is part of the Lockinge Estate, from which Glendower rents the
property for Pounds 6,250 a year on a nine-year lease. McFarlane has spent
Pounds 8,000 on three walk-in freezer and cooler units. A Mercedes delivery
van cost Pounds 12,000, with a further Pounds 6,000 absorbed in the
conversion of it to a freezer vehicle. The company also runs a second van.
During its first year, Glendower generated a gross return of 29 per cent and
a pre-tax profit return of 16.5 per cent. Since then, expansion of the
business - done without any real recourse to the banks - depressed margins
to 10 per cent. Last year, it made a gross profit of Pounds 66,000 on its
turnover of Pounds 225,000, and a pre-tax profit of Pounds 22,000. McFarlane
expects a pre-tax return of less than 10 per cent again this year. His
salary was Pounds 13,600 last year.
Net profits have also been hurt by the general trading climate. McFarlane
says: 'All chefs are being told by their food and beverage managers to 'hit
targets or you are out'. They have become much more aggressive at getting in
products at good prices.' The average restaurant gross margin of selling
food at the dining table to buying it in is 60 to 68 per cent.
He is still extracting customers from Yellow Pages and hotel and restaurant
guides, as well as by cold calling. 'One of the worst things about the
business is that you do lose customers to other suppliers. We used to get
customers on price, but I think we now sell on customer service.'
As an example of what it sells, Glendower offers, excluding VAT, a
four-litre tub of raspberry and rhubarb ice-cream for Pounds 7.25, sliced
side of smoked salmon at Pounds 7 a pound, and 250 grammes of Jersey-milk
Bonchester cheese for Pounds 3.40. Glendower is also the local distributor
for New Covent Garden soups.
McFarlane says the company suffers almost no food wastage. Some items, like
fresh fish, usually leave his premises the day after they are delivered.
As with so many businesses, though, the owner of Glendower has never been on
a business course. 'My biggest drawback is that I have struggled to find
things out because I've never worked in distribution before. You know -
where to get supplies, what margins to seek. I've learned on the hoof. The
most difficult thing is knowing when to take a risk. Bringing into the
business someone new, or buying a van, can each cost Pounds 20,000.'
One point McFarlane is already conscious of is what to do with the business
if its sales start climbing towards Pounds 2m. 'You think you could sell it
and that would relieve you of all the problems associated with expansion.
I've got the feeling, though, that I'll stick with it.'

FT  20 JUN 92 / Gardening: What men do best - Robin Lane Fox provides some
pointers about plant pots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS a heavenly week for gardening; June and July have been rolled into
one; the season is crazily advanced and the evening light is showing
everything to its best advantage. It is so marvellous that I will even give
in to pressure.
Some of you still want to know where to buy a good garden pot - if you are
not weather-beaten Sloanes and cannot buy unseen from potteries away in
Warwickshire.
Others of you want to know more about crystals which retain water for pot
plants - but you are not in a position to send away for bulk deliveries from
Gloucester.
Last week, I wrote about Things Which Every Woman Does; the men have been
feeling left out but, by the end of this piece, I promise that they will
feel thoroughly wanted with a role that is all their own.
First, the pottery. Scavenging as always, I have headed for the shop called
Patio at 155 Battersea Park Road, London SW8; I owe the tip to Roy Strong
and his wife, who use it for the terracotta pottery in their garden on the
Welsh borders. The shop is not at the smart and newly-Tory end of Battersea
and its stock is not ridiculously over-priced.
Patio's partners import the very pots which make you wish you had brought
the car or left more room in it when you meander round the Mediterranean;
they have lemon pots from Italy, thick country pottery from Provence, and
decorated clay cases from Spain. Some of them are still available after my
pre-emptive strike last week.
Treated properly, the pots ought to be frost-proof in British winters.
Patio's owners will advise you responsibly, but you must stand the pots on
bricks or blocks during the winter. If the rain cannot drain through, it
will form ice and split the bottoms.
No doubt there are little men in the Tuscan hills moulding terracotta lemon
pots for less than Pounds 57 for a 24-inch diameter: nonetheless, you have
to cart them home. I recommend this wide and simple shape because it allows
for a wide range of half-hardy plants.
For looks, I would match these lemon pots with Patio's rope pottery, made in
Spain, up to 14 inches across and finished off with a rope pattern in clay
round the rim.
For another Pounds 10-Pounds 15, you can add very thick pots up to 12 inches
wide, cast with swags and stamped in the self-same village in which those
French peasants begged for rain and said their prayers in the sub-titles of
those two famous films on harsh rural life.
Patio's owners import in bulk and go on pot-hunts in promising corners of
Europe; thus, stocks vary. But their prices fall halfway between those thin,
ugly clays from an ordinary centre and the guaranteed terracottas fired in
one of the top British potteries. I am happy to have bought five big pots
for the sum set aside for only two or three in others' lists.
There are shapes for all tastes, most of which are elegant: blue salvias,
pink verbenas and silver leaves will all trail invitingly over Patio
terracotta which ought to survive frost.
They will trail even more invitingly if their soil is wet and the pottery is
weathered. Wetting the soil is no longer such a problem: if a bulk-buy of
Broadleaf P4 is beyond your means, check the local garden centre for an
alternative which is priced less economically but sold in small quantities.
The most-widely available is Swel Gel, at prices up to Pounds 3: one pack
suffices for two seriously-large lemon pots. Water the soil first and then
work in the dose of Swel Gel like bath salts.
Water again and the crystals will expand, retaining water in the soil,
reducing the boring round of hoses and watering cans to twice a week. (If
only dogs could take it, too, we could all go on holiday or long weekends
with a clear conscience.)
Be warned not to increase the dose. One keen gardener hated watering and
tipped an entire packet into one small flower pot, hoping to settle it for
weeks. He woke up to find that a jelly-like substance similar to frog spawn
had erupted from the soil and run all over the terrace.
Lastly, the weathering. Newly-fired pots look too new for several seasons;
and although people recommend dressings of sour milk, brown fertiliser or
stewed leaves of comfrey, the owners of Patio have a brisk recipe.
Gents, this is your chance to use the most natural weathering method of all.
You can do your very own Thing That All Men Do.
Perhaps this gardening tip was what set Freud off on a characteristic train
of thought. Perhaps you remember the Great Man's explanation of the origin
of the division of labour between the sexes.
Out there, on the primaeval plains, our hunting ancestors lit camp fires;
but when the time came to dowse them and move on, only the men could oblige,
aiming at them in a Freudian bout of competitive male relief.
Women had to drop out of the contest: they, therefore, withdrew to the tent,
got landed with the cooking and, nowadays, with the bother of the picnic for
Glyndebourne.
It is magnificent nonsense, but the male fire extinguisher can re-cycle
itself nowadays as the useful patinator. Choose your moment, avoid the
verbena and, after a few adventures, the experienced owners of Patio assure
me that new terracotta will have P for patina more quickly than by any other
means.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Gardening: Sow now to make sure you reap - Arthur Hellyer
discusses how to propagate biennials and recommends ways to use herbicides
effectively
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS IS a good time to sow the seeds of biennial plants such as foxgloves,
Brompton stocks, wallflowers, honesty, Canterbury bells, sweet williams,
forget-me-nots, Iceland poppies and evening primroses. As conditions are
right for rapid germination without a need for any extra warmth, the sowing
can be done outdoors or in an unheated frame. There is still enough good
growing weather ahead for the seedlings to make sturdy plants by October, at
which time they can be planted out in the places where they are to flower
the following spring.
Some of these plants will do it all for themselves. In my garden,
forget-me-nots come up wherever I scatter the old plants I have pulled up.
In recent years, this place for temporary litter has been the ditch beside
the hedge in the farm lane which runs right down my property. For a week or
so, it looks rather untidy, but the plants soon dry up and the grass and
wild flowers grow over them. The reward is a blue haze of flowers in May and
early June without any effort on my part.
Years ago, I used to spread many of these dying forget-me-not plants around
apple trees in my orchard, where they performed a similar role. Then, when I
started to use paraquat (Weedol) to keep circles of clear soil around the
trees, I found, to my surprise, that although all the grass and most of the
weeds (except the strongest perennials) were killed, the forget-me-nots were
unaffected.
One year, I ran out of paraquat at a crucial moment and used glyphosate
instead. This eliminated forget-me-nots not only for that year but for the
following one as well. But they returned gradually to normal, partly because
I scattered more fading forget-me-not plants to replace the seed but also, I
think, because of residual seed in the soil already. I still use both
herbicides: paraquat for the quick effect - especially on grasses of all
kinds, and on annual weeds - and glyphosate on ground elder, bindweed,
docks, nettles, brambles and all the more persistent weeds which are
despatched most efficiently when they are in full growth.
Glyphosate recently has become available in a new formulation known as
Roundup GC. This is different from the Roundup been sold to farmers and
commercial growers for many years, and is claimed to be even more effective.
Like other formulations of this herbicide, it acts solely through the leaves
of growing plants and is bio-degraded quite rapidly by micro-organisms in
the soil into carbon dioxide, carbon, phosphate and nitrate.
It is not poisonous to animals or human beings and there is no need to keep
children away from areas which have been treated. Roundup GC is effective
against deep-rooted weeds, especially if it is applied when they are growing
strongly and have a vigorous circulation of sap. But it is just as fatal to
garden plants as weeds, so it must be kept off their leaves.
I digress, though, from the subject of biennials. . . .
There are many garden varieties of these - improved varieties, many
gardeners say, although the improvement might be no more than a change of
colour or an increase in flower size. For example, the forget-me-nots I grow
are of the common variety: a clear, light blue with an occasional appearance
of a pink or pinkish-flowered plant.
If I bought seed, I could have a choice of several varieties such as Marina,
a deeper blue; Rosie, which is rose pink; and Blue Cloud. They are much like
what I have, but without the variation. If I introduced any of these,
though, I would have to keep each variety right away from the others or from
what I have already; otherwise, it would cross-pollinate with them and be
swamped. The same is true of all other plants raised readily from seed, as
are all biennials. If you want some particular variety, you must grow it in
isolation or buy it anew each year.
All the seedlings, whether from your own or bought-in seed, will need to be
thinned or transplanted as soon as they can be handled easily. With many -
such as wallflowers and honesty, which make quite sturdy seedlings - this is
not difficult to do outdoors, preferably in a nursery bed set apart for such
a purpose and cleared thoroughly of weeds before it is used.
With others which, at first, are very small - such as the seedlings of
Canterbury bells - it is really easier to handle them in trays filled with
special seed compost, whether it be soil-based, peat-based, coir or
something else. Then, the main problem becomes watering, which is no problem
if you are there to do it but a very serious one if you are away from home a
lot.
The compromise is to prepare a special bed for these special seedlings with,
if necessary, a good topping of pure seed compost. This will give the fine
texture needed for picking out tiny seedlings and the benefit of a
subterranean supply of water which, in emergencies, can be supplemented with
some form of trickle irrigation.

<TEXT>
BUYING a house for a university student son or daughter once seemed a good
idea: student got three years' accommodation, parents got cash from lettings
during holidays - and made a handsome profit at the end of their offspring's
stay. That was the theory. Now alarm bells are starting to ring.
'Our financial planning did not work,' say Miranda's parents. They bought
her a flat in Edinburgh, which seemed a good idea for several reasons. In
the event it brought nothing but trouble and a negligible capital gain.
Julia's parents bought her a terrace house in Oxford to live in while she
was up at the university, but problems with mortgage interest relief and
insurance mushroomed when she came down.
Rebecca, another Oxford student, says: 'Be as specific as you can when you
make the contracts with the others (sharing the house), and do not let
friends be brought in who do not contribute.'
Ever since the property boom of the late 1980s, students and parents have
found buying a flat or house a mutually appealing idea. The young get a base
of their own and are freed from dreary halls of residence or ruthless
landlords. 'Digs' are often simply too expensive. (It is a long time since
I, when an Oxford undergraduate, had two rooms and a cooked breakfast,
within walking distance of my college, for Pounds 3 a week; the Oxbridge
college of today is furiously building accommodation with the aim of housing
all its students.)
If you buy a house or flat for your child, the fellow students he or she
selects will contribute to the outgoings and mortgage, almost certainly
paying less than to a conventional landlord. Rebecca's housemates pay Pounds
125 a month for rent before the outgoings on utilities: a good price, but
much dearer than living in college.
After Miranda's first year in a 'grotty flat' in Edinburgh, her parents were
posted abroad and decided to let the family home. She needed somewhere
better as her base in Britain. A long rental in Edinburgh was impossible;
buying was the alternative. Her parents paid a third more than they
expected, but set against it the prospect of selling while they were abroad
and, as non-residents, escaping capital gains tax.
They think now that they are lucky to have sold it at all - at a price which
has produced only a small gain. But unexpectedly, they came home a tax year
early. so they may be deemed resident for the time of sale - and taxable.
And as for all that cocktail party chat about money from letting for the
Edinburgh Festival, it turned out to be a mirage, as agents wanted a huge
commission. Finally, it was hard to get the flatmates to pay their share of
the bills or keep the place clean.
Julia's complications at Oxford were different. Her parents gifted the house
to her as a long-term transfer of assets and an investment to pay for
itself. She became the owner-occupier, responsible for the mortgage and
receiving the mortgage tax relief (MIRAS), with her housemates' payments
going towards the mortgage. But when she left Oxford, they were no longer
housemates. It became a commercial let, with different rules, and she
another university landlady.
The trouble started with the insurance policy, which was solely for people
living in their own house: if there was a fire or burglary and she was not
living in the premises, the insurance company might not pay up. With Julia
gone, expensive business tariffs applied. Then the building society put the
mortgage up by 2 per cent and, as a matter of course, told the tax man she
lived elsewhere. So her MIRAS disappeared.
Rebecca recommends specifying in writing at the start what rights the
housemates have to introduce boy or girl friends, for how long, and on what
terms. Other people's lovers are nothing but trouble, Rebecca has
discovered, one night's stay often turns into a week - or even a term. She
does not, however, have trouble with the utility bills. 'I wait till the red
one comes, and then pay up, and collect from the others. Itemised telephone
bills are a great help.'
Her father bought the house in her second year when she was still in
college, and let it through Carter Jonas (0865-511444) to a New Zealand
couple for nine months until she came in. She will be there for two years;
more, if she stays on for post-graduate work. Then there will be a gap while
he lets it again until - the family hopes - Rebecca's younger sister can use
it. Her father sees the house as an investment and will sell it in five or
six years.
Julia's father says: 'It is not so simple as it looks.'
Even if finding the cash is not a problem, think carefully before you put
your money where your child is. Siren calls of what a good investment it
will have been in five years' time should be the last consideration.
