FT  20 JUN 92 / Property: Charm in a little corner of Chelsea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HANSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FINEST surviving house in London by Charles Robert Ashbee (1863-1942),
the influential architect, designer and romantic socialist, has come on to
the market.
It is 38 Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, a tall, narrow, red-brick building with high,
thin windows and a steep, white-painted gable, in the middle of which is a
large rose window. Built in 1898-99 for an artist, Miss CL Christian, it
stood originally between two other Ashbee houses, only one of which
survives.
Ashbee's first house was at 37 Cheyne Walk, on the corner of Oakley Street;
it was built in 1893-94 for his mother, with an office and studio for
himself. Known as the Magpie &amp; Stump, after an inn that used to stand on the
site, it was demolished in 1968 to make way for a block of luxury flats.
When No. 38 was built, Ashbee erected the adjoining house, 39 Cheyne Walk,
at the same time, as a speculation. It survives, although altered
internally. (A perspective of both was exhibited at the Royal Academy in
1900.)
For all his socialist ideals, Ashbee was quite an important contractor and
developer in his own right, and he made this little corner of Chelsea his
own. Between 1893 and 1913 he designed no fewer than 30 houses in Cheyne
Walk. Not all were built; but those that were (at 71-75), and those he
repaired and altered for clients (at 118-119), were destroyed by German
bombs in 1941. That leaves No. 38: listed Grade II for its architectural
interest.
'We tried to take the house back to what it was in the beginning,' says
Ninky Phipps, who bought it with her husband 10 years ago and restored it
carefully. They used a Scottish architect, Alastair Gourley, who has
captured the spirit of Ashbee and laced it with a touch of Charles Rennie
Mackintosh. He re-designed the kitchen, bathrooms and cloakrooms and
installed fitted cupboards in the bedrooms and display shelves on the
stairs.
The Phipps also have used the house as an art gallery, and it would make an
ideal home for an art collector because its drawing room on the first floor
was the main studio: 39 ft long with a ceiling 17 ft high, and steps to a
gallery running along one side. There was another studio 32 ft long and 15
ft high, on the third floor, and a third studio on the top floor, 20 feet
long, with an exposed timber ceiling, lit by the circular rose window facing
south over the Thames.
These former studios are now used as bedrooms, and there are two other
bedrooms and three bathrooms. The dining room, kitchen and breakfast room
are on the ground floor, which is reached through ornamental gates and
railings topped with golden balls, designed by Ashbee and made by his Guild
of Handicraft. At the back of the house is a secluded walled garden, part of
it with Tudor brickwork thought to date from 1519, when the site was part of
Shrewsbury House.
Offers of Pounds 1.65m for the freehold are being sought by Knight Frank &amp;
Rutley (tel: 071-824-8171), which is acting jointly with Russell Simpson
(071-225-0277). Freeholds are unusual in Chelsea, as most of the properties
are held on lease from one or other of the traditional landowners such as
Smith's Charity, Sloane-Stanley or the Cadogan estate. But there is another
freehold on the market at 3 Cheyne Walk, another Grade II-listed Georgian
house. Offers of Pounds 1.95m are being invited by Strutt &amp; Parker
(071-235-9959).

FT  20 JUN 92 / How To Spend It: A slice of history - but the historians
disagree / A report on an archaeological row in York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VISITORS to this month's York Festival (until July 5) will have a chance to
walk round what what York Archaeological Trust has hailed as one of the most
important archaeological reconstructions of recent times - but they will
also be walking into controversy.
The Pounds 1.2m Barley Hall project was planned by the trust as a worthy
sequel to the hugely successful Jorvik Viking Centre, which was opened in
1984, attracts 800,000 visitors and earns Pounds 1m a year for the trust.
Barley Hall is a reconstruction of what is thought to be the UK's only
medieval hospice - a sort of hotel for clerics visiting the city. The trust
plans to turn it into a living and working medieval household - a form of
museum unique in Britain, it says.
However, the project has drawn fire from the verbal equivalent of a medieval
siege engine in the form of the SPAB - the Society for the Protection of
Ancient buildings. SPAB chairman James Boutwood has described Barley Hall as
'yet another contribution to our Disneyland heritage,' while secretary
Philip Venning has dubbed it 'an appalling scheme that should be damned
utterly.'
Venning has applied to the Department of the Environment on behalf of the
society to have Barley Hall de-listed as a building of architectural and
historical interest.
At the heart of the controversy is the fact that the trust took down the
building to ground level before reconstructing it. In the process, says the
SPAB, the restorers destroyed its entire history. 'It is now virtually
worthless as an object of serious study,' Boutwood says.
The response from the trust has been vigorous. Director Dr Peter Addyman
describes the work at Barley Hall as 'the most detailed archaeological
investigation of its kind to be undertaken in this country.'
The result, he says, is that it has been possible to reconstruct an exact
replica of the original building using many of the original timbers. Only
elements of the original building too badly decayed to be re-used were
discarded.
The remains of the original timbers have been blended with 4,000 pieces of
new oak, some weighing up to seven tons, in a massive carpentry operation.
'All survivors of the 520 or so timbers that constituted the original
building were recorded and the whole process was monitored by an academic
advisory committee,' says Addyman. 'The history of the building is now
understood for the first time. So how can it have been destroyed?'
The reaction of the public to the project in the coming weeks will be vital.
Throughout the festival tours of the hall are taking place twice daily.
Members of the public can see inside Barley Hall for the first time and hear
from guides how the building was rediscovered beneath a jumble of buildings
of assorted ages, and the painstaking way in which the reconstruction was
undertaken.
The judgment of visitors will determine the fundraising, which has reached a
crucial stage. Although the project is slightly above budget the recession
has reduced the numbers of companies prepared either to dip into their
funds.
So far Pounds 100,000 has been raised, and although the building work is
complete, the trust needs another Pounds 350,000 by July to enable it to
continue to furnish Barley Hall and turn it into the 'living museum' it is
planning.
The eventual aim is that visitors to Barley Hall will be able to witness
people inside replicating a working household, living in the fashion of
their 15th century forbears, carrying out the same tasks in the same sort of
way, in rooms looking exactly as they did in the 1480s.
The trust's researches have revealed much about the original occupant of the
building, Alderman William Snawsell, a goldsmith and former Lord Mayor of
York, and his family.
July is decision month. when the trust's council must decide whether to
abandon, at least temporarily, completion of the project. If this were to
happen the 'mothballed' building might prove an equally fascinating - if
better preserved - find for archaeologists in 500 years time as its
predecessor's remains did for Addyman's team.

HOLLY Golightly, you will remember, took herself off to Breakfast at
Tiffany's whenever the mean reds hit her. For me, N. Bloom &amp; Son, the
jewellers at 40 Conduit Street, London, W1 has played much the same role. If
ever I win the pools, N. Bloom is going to be where I head first.
It has always specialised in exactly the sort of antique pieces that are
deliciously pretty and eminently wearable. For a combination of reasons,
mostly connected with the fact that the lease is about to expire and, I
daresay, not unrelated to it being hard times for one and all, N. Bloom is
about to move and it is therefore having a sale. All jewellery is reduced by
40 per cent and all silver by 30 per cent.
This means that, for instance, a Cartier diamond, ruby and sapphire arrow
and target brooch is down from Pounds 2,400 to Pounds 1,440, a cameo brooch
is down from Pounds 1,450 to Pounds 870. Anyone with Pounds 35,000 to hand
will be able to save Pounds 23,500 on an enchanting diamond necklace (once
priced at Pounds 58,500).
Price's Patent Candle Company is one of those old-fashioned companies that
most of us know and love. Although in recent years its image has become a
little faded, it has been taken over by new owners who intend to breathe
fresh life and energy into it.
Next weekend, on Saturday June 27 and Sunday June 28 at its factory at 110
York Road, Battersea, London SW11, it will be having a grand clearout of old
stock. Prices will start as low as 20p. A wonderful chance to buy some real
archive models. On the Saturday only the factory shop (just around the
corner) will be selling church candles (more than 40 different sizes),
creamy composition candles (from 26p to Pounds 39.50 for the largest size, 3
ins diameter by 36ins high) and hand-made beeswax candles (50p each for  3/4
ins diameter by 6 ins high). Stock up now for Christmas.

FT  20 JUN 92 / How To Spend It: New worshippers for Japan's Muji cult - UK
retail sales may be gloomy but Lucia van der Post finds a store chain which
is expanding thanks to its no-frills philosophy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST about a year ago a strange concept arrived in this country from Japan -
a selection of clothes and household products that were almost monastically
simple. They were sold by the 'no brand goods' Muji shop, at 26 Great
Marlborough Street, London W1. Although in Japan Muji had become something
of a cult, with some 221 shops spread throughout the country, in the UK they
were almost unknown.
Based on the notion that there must be a demand for well-made, well-designed
simple clothing and household products, and that it was not always necessary
to have a high-profile label and a glitzy front to appear desirable, the
shops homed in on a kind of sophisticated simplicity that was a refreshing
change from the 'look-at-me' excesses of the 1980s.
In the UK, the first shop, the product of a joint venture between Ryohin
Keikau and Liberty, echoed faithfully the philosophy of the Japanese model.
Austere, rusty (but purposefully so) metal shelves displayed the clothing
made from mainly natural materials and the small range of essential
household products and stationery accessories. Clothes were primarily those
that were meant to be worn and used and not just to adorn. Household
products were functional, often of traditional design.
Now that simplicity and an air of elegant austerity have become fashionable,
it is not surprising to learn that the first shop has prospered. The
matt-black yuppie crowd, which once went in for lots of gleaming steel and
instantly-recognisable labels, took to its ranges as they embraced their
changed status in the 1990s. They went for the stationery and storage boxes
in particular while the Muji T-shirt, dead plain in white or grey, with all
the proportions just so, goes on selling and selling at Pounds 8.95 a go. So
successful has it been that, yesterday, a second, much-enlarged, lighter,
brighter Muji opened in London's Covent Garden at 39 Shelton Street.
The new site - some 2,200 square feet in an old Victorian warehouse - means
the shop will be able to sell some products that are part of the core Muji
range in Japan.
Design aficionados will be interested in the bicycle pictured right - first
shown at the Tokyo Creative Exhibition at Liberty - where the catalogue
described it as 'a bike to hang on your wall as well as to ride.' Designed
by Satoshi Yasui, its chief claim to fame is that it has dispensed with that
source of dirt and aggro, the chain, and substituted a shaft.
It is not the first shaft-driven bicycle but it is still new enough for most
of us to be intrigued and fascinated. The Muji bike certainly looks good -
simple, minimalist, streamlined, practical. It is the sort of bike that
appeals to the designer brigade - it speaks of a love of clean, understated,
unadorned aesthetics. The price of these aesthetics, it has to be made
clear, is dear - the bike costs Pounds 650. There are probably plenty of
people who prefer to broach their bicycle-buying from a more practical
standpoint - like, what is it like to ride? Who better to ask than bicycle
fan Max Wilkinson, Weekend FT editor, who reports on his test-ride in the
accompanying story.
Apart from the bicycle, another new line for the British Muji is furniture.
Now this is not the sort of product for those of you with country houses and
rustic hideaways - these are brushed metal tables and shelf units, metal
trolleys, drawer units and storage boxes, the sort of things you might need
to fit out a workroom or a home office, to put order into a larder or a
studio. The Muji boxes have been one of the great hits of the existing shop
 -in polypropylene, galvanised metal or just plain brown cardboard they are
the basics of many a highly-organised filing system, whether for home or
office. Boxes range from about Pounds 3.50 to Pounds 34 for the very largest
size in acrylic, but there are lots at under Pounds 10.
Also look out for more clothes. Those who have admired traditional Japanese
Mingei workwear - all those loose-wrapped, strong easy shapes in cotton
indigo, seersucker and linen - will now have an authentic selection to
choose from.
These, you will not be surprised to hear, are not clothes for wearing to
Ascot, for wowing them at the Caprice or carrying the day in the boardroom.
Not for nothing do they call them One Mile Wear. The loose-fitting tops and
drawstring pants make comfortable clothes for relaxing in at home, for
wearing in your local neighbourhood, while doing the shopping, or pottering
round or doubling as pyjamas and dressing-gowns.
If that build-up sounds as if they are cheap the answer, I am afraid, is
that they are not. By the time Japanese labour costs, standards of living
and strong yen have been taken into account they emerge on our market as
very expensive indeed, clothes strictly for those, I would say, for whom the
Mingei cult is beguiling enough to make them pay the premium rate.
Sketched below is a set of trousers and jacket made from hand-dyed cotton,
available in medium size only for men or women, Pounds 175. The traditional
kimono is Pounds 100.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Food: A supersaver's Cotswold delight - Nicholas Lander pops
down to Gloucestershire for lunch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE JOURNEY to the restaurant cost me Pounds 9, the cost today of a taxi
ride across central London. Instead, it was the 10.05 British Rail
supersaver from Paddington which took me through 100 miles of English town
and country and deposited me at 11.30, just in time for an aperitif, at
Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire.
A brisk five-minute walk from the station and I was in the high street, a
broad, tree-lined avenue which must have been a glorious sight in its
heyday. Today, sadly, it is an incongruous mixture. At one end, in Cotswold
stone, is the only inviting police station I have seen, but it faces a
supermarket and an ugly complex of retirement homes. The rest of the high
street contains antique shops, tea rooms, pubs, hotels, and two fish and
chip shops.
On a corner is the Marsh Goose restaurant and food shop, which opened in
November 1990. It has three owners: Gordon Campbell-Grey, Leo Brooke-Little
and Sonya Kidney, the chef.
When I asked her whether a relatively small restaurant with three owners was
not a recipe for disaster, she said they had all worked together for four
years at the Feathers Hotel in Woodstock, Oxfordshire, and that, anyway,
Campbell-Grey lives in New York. He checks on his investment with a weekly
telephone call.
The Marsh Goose could almost be a village corner shop - you have to lower
your head as you walk in, and there are piles of food here, cases of wine
there - except for the quality of produce on offer: half-pints of home-made
soup, a variety of pates and terrines, excellent lightly-cured gravadlax and
some delicious breads and croissants, as well as biscuits and cakes from the
kitchen's pastry section.
The Pounds 100,000 the partners have invested has been spent more noticeably
on the restaurant next door. Skylights allow natural light into almost all
of the building. Square, purpose-made dining tables with upright, padded
chairs provide an air of comfort and elegance. The atmosphere and the food
in the restaurant are distinctive, too. This is partly because of the
partners' good taste, and partly because Kidney, 38, and Brooke-Little, 26,
have not worked in very many other restaurants before. Indeed,
Brooke-Little's only job before the Feathers was on a building site. Thus
both have felt free to break the rules.
Front of house at the Marsh Goose, this manifests itself in three ways.
First, the dining tables are not pre-set with cutlery - they are 'laid up'
only after your order is taken - which gives them an uncluttered look.
Second, the waiters wear eye-catching bow ties (modelled on one worn by a
guest to the opening).
Third, the partners realised from their time at the Feathers just how
critical the pricing of their menu would be, particularly at lunchtime. That
menu, therefore, begins with a list of starters and light meals (from Pounds
2 to Pounds 5.50), then a main course salad (Pounds 7.50) and, finally, a
range of the more obvious hot main courses at Pounds 8-Pounds 10. This,
together with a no-minimum-charge policy, has attracted more women and
visitors at lunchtime, and caused the restaurant to rely less on local
businessmen.
None of these thoughtful policies could have borne fruit without Kidney's
obvious talents. Born in Barbados, she went to catering college in Wales and
then to a succession of hotels and restaurants around England, including a
stint at Sharrow Bay in the Lake District.
Her style is simple and direct. A smoked trout mousse wrapped in smoked
salmon was rich and creamy but lightened by a well-dressed salad. A fillet
of brill was cooked with top-quality saffron. And what could have been a
sharp, iced, rhubarb terrine was sweetened by some delicious ginger
shortbread.
I caught the train back to London, after an excellent meal, with some
gravadlax in my bag for a more abstemious lunch the next day. My strongest
memory, however, will be of looking through the kitchen door, watching a
happy Sonya Kidney at work with an inspirational glass of mineral water at
her side.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Drink: An Italian pioneer - Wine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDMUND PENNING ROWSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN GREAT demand in Italy, widely exported, particularly to Germany and the
US, the wines of Collio and Colli Orientali are known in the UK only in
specialist circles.
Indeed, not many wine amateurs in Britain could readily place them on the
Italian wine map, for they come from a little-visited district on the
extreme north-east frontier, pressing on the borders of what is now
Slovenia: the region of Friuli-Venezia-Giulia. Two-thirds of the Collio
vineyards are actually in Slovenia, and some Italian growers possess small
vineyards across the border.
Their particular quality derives from the micro-climatic position on the
first folds of the Julian Alps that protect the vineyards from northerly
winds and ensure moderate weather from the Adriatic. The controlled
appellation applies only to the hillside slopes.
The huge, flat vineyards, extending to the sea, produce enormous quantities
of modest- quality dry whites, notably Grave del Friuli. Altogether Friuli
contributes 1.5m hl to Italy's average output of 60m hl of red and white
wine, but of this Collio produces only 120,000 hl and Colli Orientali
150,000 hl. Ninety per cent of the former is white; 70 per cent of the
latter.
The success of the wines is, by historic standards, recent. Generally,
Italian white wine lacks distinction, although the wines of the Trentino and
Alto Adige are improving and there is a small amount of very variable,
expensive Gavi. However, 25 years ago Collio wines were almost unknown
outside Friuli and were not all that special then.
Much of the initiative for improvement is generally attributed to Mario
Schiopetto, a man born in Udine, who studied engineering in the 1950s but
did not finish the course. Instead, Schiopetto says, he drove trucks all
over Europe and played rugby.
In the early 1960s he opened an hosteria in Udine. The only wines available
for sale were just plain rosso and bianco of undisclosed origin. If any were
varietal this was not advertised.
However, Schiopetto visited vineyards in France and Germany, and in 1964 he
began traditional vinification methods by leasing 16 ha, which he acquired
in 1988, from the Archbishop of Gorizia in the leading wine commune of
Capriva. He said he used German techniques and French finesse on Italian
grapes, and produced most of the wide range of white wines common in Collio,
including Tocai, Sauvignon, Pinot Grigio, Malvasia and Ribolla Gialla.
He sold these in his hosteria to those who liked what he described as
natural wine, not sugared, not excessively high in alcohol nor blended with
wines from other regions. He took his wines to exhibitions in Bologna, Milan
and elsewhere, where he won gold medals between 1967 and 1969.
In 1969 he sold his hosteria in order to concentrate on wine production. He
wrote letters to professional men in Bologna, Milan and Turin, and took wine
samples in a cold box to those who responded. This helped him introduce his
wine to restaurants, where supplies tend always to be dominated by the big
concerns. But his well-off private customers started to ask there for his
wine. Since 1978 he has started using French barriques to ferment his wine -
but only for red wines.
He, like most of the other leading Collio growers, is against oak barriques
for the local whites, which have good varietal qualities, because oak
produces tannins that are not natural, and change a wine's character.
This was echoed by another leading producer, Puiatti, whose wines are
available from Wine Cellars, 153-155 Wandsworth High Street, London SW18.
(Tel: 081-871-3979/3970). Puyatti says that oak 'standardises' the wines. He
puts 30 per cent of his red wines (made from Merlot Cabernet) into barriques
for one year; they are bottled after almost three, and the whites after six
months.
Ninety per cent of Schiopetto's wines are sold to restaurants all over
Italy. His latest vintage was sold out by January at the fairly high price
of 12,200 lire (Pounds 6) a bottle. His production averaged 140,000 bottles.
The elegant, flowery Tocai 1991 that I tasted would, he said, be better
after two years, and I agreed.
I also sampled the typical but not aggressive Sauvignon 1991, with lots of
flavour, and a delicious Pinot Bianco, from 1990 which contained 35 per cent
Chardonnay and showed it on the bouquet. A 1990 Cabernet-Franc, just
bottled, was closed but a Merlot '87, very light in colour, had a real
'claret' nose - a light wine to drink, for the Collio reds are not for
keeping.

<TEXT>
HOLIDAYING in Herefordshire and Worcestershire, I was struck by the beauty
of the scenery and the charm of the small towns - particularly Tenbury Wells
and, just over the Shropshire border, Ludlow. The pleasures of the table
were also considerable.
Hereford is famous for its beef. There are fine cheese-makers to be found in
the surrounding area, good flour mills and bakers, and apple juices, cider
and perry made from the fruits of local orchards. Soft fruit and vegetable
growers are also plentiful, many organic.
One of the things we enjoyed most was meat from a small, Q Guild family
butcher's shop, which that has been buying on the hoof, slaughtering and
butchering, for 90 years: T H Checketts, of Ombersley, nr Droitwich (tel:
0905-620284).
Tony Checkett hangs his meat properly and shares my belief that heifer eats
better than steer. The staff in his shop are young, friendly and
knowledgeable. The forerib of beef that I bought (from a heifer, hung for
three weeks) made a memorable roast. Also excellent were their own bacon and
meaty, simply-seasoned, pork sausages. I met other shoppers in the queue who
come regularly from 20 miles away. I am not surprised.
Another highlight was succulent asparagus bought from Goodmans, of Walsgrove
Farm, Great Witley, Worcs (tel: 0299-896272). They grow several varieties,
some with deep purple tips, some the palest of greens, Geynlin, Franklin and
a juicy whopper from Holland called Boonlim. The asparagus season is over,
alas, but the soft red fruit season is getting into full swing. Freshly
picked strawberries, raspberries and tayberries can be bought at Walsgrove
farm gate or you can take a basket into the fields and pick your own.
Recommended to serve with the berries are soft fresh cheeses, yoghurts and
creams by Pru Lloyd of The Dairy House, Weobley, nr Hereford (tel:
0544-318815). Her products are available at the farm and in many shops
locally.
For hard cheeses we went to Old Ley Court, nr Churcham, just outside
Gloucester (tel: 0452-750225). There Diana Smart and her son, Jamie, produce
traditional hand-made Double Gloucester from full cream unpasteurised milk,
and the lesser- known, fresher tasting Single Gloucester, which I like even
better, which is saying quite a lot.
The cheeses can be ordered by telephone and sent by post, or can be
collected from the farm - which gives you the chance to see the lovely old
cheese presses in the dairy, and to choose your own cheese from the cool of
the cheese store.
One of the most enchanted spots in Herefordshire is the nine-bedroomed Hope
End Hotel, near Ledbury (tel: 0531-3613 fax: 0531-5697), where Elizabeth
Barrett Browning spent many of her young days and time seems to stand still.
The house, with its minaret towers, arches and walled courtyards (one with a
quince tree, the other with spring water tricking from a scallop shell into
a small pool), lies in a cup of lovely parkland.
Patricia Hegarty's family have lived thereabouts for 600 years. Her cooking
is firmly based on using the produce of the area and in particular on the
offerings of the garden, where her husband, John, grows fruits, vegetables
and herbs in the traditional way.
As result, the menus feature seasonal treats such as seakale, ruby chard,
salsify, cardoons, butternut squash, cottagers' kale, morellos,
whitecurrants, mulberries and many old varieties of apple and pear,
including Black Worcester pear, recorded in the area in the 16th century,
still displayed in the city's coat of arms.
ARTICHOKE &amp; CRAYFISH (or LOBSTER) FLAN (serves 8)
Patricia Hegarty uses her own home-made curd cheese for this, and artichokes
grown in the walled garden at Hope End. Saltwater crayfish is also known as
crawfish, spiny lobster or langouste. It is not the same thing as freshwater
crayfish.
For the pastry: 3 oz of 100 per cent wholemeal flour; 2 oz unsalted butter;
1 tablespoon finely grated Parmesan or Cheddar cheese; up to 2 tablespoons
cold water to bind.
For the filling: 6 medium sized globe artichokes; 1 freshly cooked saltwater
crayfish or lobster; 3 large eggs;  1/4 lb curd cheese; a little finely
grated Parmesan or Cheddar cheese (optional).
Make the pastry in a food processor or electric mixer, and let it rest for
at least 20 minutes. Roll it out very thinly on a cold floured surface, use
it to line a 9 inch flan tin with a removeable base, and blind bake.
Boil the artichokes for 45 minutes. Take them apart. Save the fleshiest
'petals' to decorate the finished dish, discard the chokes and chop the
artichoke bottoms into  1/2 inch dice. Cut the crayfish or lobster meat into
pieces of the same size.
Scatter both ingredients over the base of the pastry case. Beat the curd
cheese with the eggs and season with sea salt and black pepper. Spoon the
mixture over the shellfish and artichokes. A little grated cheese on top is
nice too.
Bake at 350`F (180`C) gas mark 4 for 20-30 minutes until set. Serve warm or
cold, surrounded by the reserved artichoke petals, with the green herb
dressing to spoon over the flan, and a salad of buttercrunch lettuce and
blanched courgette slices on the side.
GREEN HERB DRESSING
1/4 pt green virgin olive oil; 1 oz cider vinegar; 1 tsp Dijon mustard
(optional); basil or tarragon.
Mix the oil and vinegar with sea salt and mustard. Whizz in the chopped
herbs at the last moment.
BUTTERCRUNCH AND COURGETTE SALAD
1 Buttercrunch lettuce; 6 young courgettes about 4 inches long; a little
landcress or sweet marjoram; sunflower seeds or toasted sesame seeds.
Cut the courgettes into one-eighth inch slices. Blanch them for 1 minute in
a little boiling water. Drain quickly, refresh in cold water and pat dry.
Break the lettuce leaves into large bite-size pieces, mix gently with the
remaining ingredients and dress just before serving.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Food: Alf Tupper's FT treat - Street food
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS A BOY I encountered fish and chips twice a week. On Tuesday evenings,
after cub scouts, at least 20 of us would invade the local chippy. On
Fridays my comic would arrive, containing the latest episode in the life of
Alf Tupper, the long-distance runner who vanquished all-comers on a diet of
fish and chips.
I never fell for the life-enhancing properties of this wonderful
combination, but I have never forgotten just how satisfying good fish and
chips can be anywhere, from fairly sublime locations (on a beach near
Sydney, in a garden in Auckland, even a romantic fish and chip lunch in
England at the Flora Tea Rooms in Dunwich, Suffolk) to the more mundane
repast eaten before or after the cinema.
I have developed tastes for more sophisticated fish and chips. At The
Square, London SW1 (tel:071-839-8787) I recently ate a very good rendition
re-christened 'crusted turbot on a bed of creamed potatoes' and, at the
occasional cocktail party, I have enjoyed a tiny portion of fish and chips
served inside a miniature FT.
But these more sophisticated dishes only highlight why fish and chips work
so well together.
When the fish is fresh, its taste (even that of the humble cod or plaice) is
so delicate that it can easily be overpowered. Potatoes, simply cooked, are
the perfect accompaniment. One of England's finest fish chefs, Richard
Stein, of The Seafood Restaurant in Padstow, Cornwall, acknowledges this in
his book English Seafood Cookery (Penguin Pounds 7.99), and simultaneously
gives a recipe for coq d'or potatoes - thickly sliced potatoes covered in
chicken stock and baked in the oven, a most delicious accompaniment to fish.
Convenience is almost as compelling a reason as taste for visiting a good
fish and chip shop. A brief spell in the kitchens of Brady's, a fish
restaurant in Wandsworth, south London, convinced me just how hot, sticky
and potentially dangerous this relatively simple cooking process can be.
In front of two fryers containing vegetable oil at 375`F - most chip shops
now use good quality vegetable oil rather than animal fats - you must skin
and bone all your fish (that is how most customers like it).
For the chips you must secure a reliable supply of Maris Piper potatoes  -
according to Luke Brady those grown in Essex are far more suitable for the
fryer than ones from Scotland. Put them through a mechanical peeler, rinse
them twice, cut them mechanically, rinse them twice again and then blanch
for 60 seconds in hot oil - making sure the temperature does not drop (the
biggest cause of soggy chips). Preparing two 55lb bags, enough for 70-80
customers, will take three to four hours.
To cook the fish, dip both sides in what the trade calls 'horseshoe', ground
up rice husks, then in a flour and water batter. Cook it in the oil for 3-4
minutes. The chips need less time but both must be drained before being
served.
The final ingredient, mushy peas, might not be to everyone's taste but they
are still popular and any chippy's most profitable line. A 25lb sack of
marrowfat peas costs Pounds 4 but will generate 200 portions at 60p each,
having been soaked overnight, cooked in sugar and salt with the assistance
of cooking tablets which help to break the peas down.
Behind the counter, it was the smell from the continuous frying that I was
not prepared for. According to Luke Brady, you grow accustomed to it
although you need to change your clothes after every service.
But it will take more than that to put me off fish and chips. Only if a
really soggy version, wrapped in one of my articles, were served to me would
I consider transferring my allegiance.
Among the best fish and chip shops and restaurants in London are: Nautilus,
NW6; Sea Shell, NW1; Bradys SW18; Geale's W8; Seafresh SW1; Maxwell's of
Ealing, NW3; Harry Ramsden's, Heathrow Airport Terminal 1 and in Guiseley,
Yorkshire (0943-874641).

FT  20 JUN 92 / Food: Time to bag a bagel - Appetisers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LEGEND has it that in 1683 a Viennese baker, honouring the king of Poland,
created a quirky roll to resemble a stirrup because the monarch's favourite
pastime was riding (bagel comes from the German Bugel, for stirrup).
Bagels became very popular in Poland, where they were given as gifts to
women in childbirth (and by mothers to their children as nutritious teething
rings). They were sold on strings in Russian towns, and were said to bring
good luck and to have magical powers. Jewish immigrants fleeing persecution
in eastern Europe introduced the bagel to the US where it is now part of the
food culture.
Bagels are also big business in the UK. Eaten by the Jewish and east London
communities for years, they were bought from small local shops, or from
pushcarts on the streets. They were made by hand and eaten warm. You can
still buy these from Bagel Bake at 159 Brick Lane, London E1. The bakery is
open seven days a week, 24 hours a day (except Jewish holidays); it is worth
the journey.
Elsewhere in Britain, the New York Bagel Company has brought its products to
supermarkets. Tesco, Sainsbury, Safeway, Selfridges and Boots stock them, at
83p for a pack of four, and they come plain or with onion, cinnamon and
raisin, garlic, or topped with sesame seeds or poppy seeds.
I have eaten them sliced, buttered, toasted or warmed, with and without
various fillings, but I still prefer the plain bagel filled in the American
way with pastrami and cream cheese.
If you work in the Docklands area of London, head for the Hot Bagel Shop at
4 South Quay Plaza, Marsh Wall, Isle of Dogs, E14, which sells very special
filled bagels from only Pounds 1.
***
Cuban and Philippino cuisine will be featured at festivals planned for later
in the year in the St James Court Hotel, Buckingham Gate, Westminster,
London. (Tel: 071-834-6655. Fax: 071-828-5802).
Cubana Airlines will be flying two chefs to London to prepare authentic
Cuban lunch and dinner menus, from September 14-25. The Philippine Festival
will take place between November 9 and 20. On both occasions three-course
lunches will be available at around Pounds 15 and dinner menus at Pounds 18.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Travel: It was a dark and stormy night . . . in Camelot -
Nicholas Woodworth goes in search of the archetypal Cornish fishing village
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'BUENOS DIAS]' There was a rattle at the door, a key turned, a floorboard
creaked by my bedside.
'Buenos dias]' it came again, a cheerful, determined voice. A cup of tea was
set on the bedside table. 'Eight o'clock, morning tea. Breakfast in 30
minutes precisely. Hasta la vista]' The voice retreated, the door closed.
I focused on the ceiling. I was not, so far as I knew, in Spain, but
Cornwall. This was not Fawlty Towers but a bed-and-breakfast called Dunoon.
The man bringing tea was not Manuel, but David Castle, Cornishman, retired
military man, and the proprietor of Dunoon.
Outside, the wind alternately sighed and screamed in the telephone wires.
Seagulls cried faintly. Far below the house, at the bottom of the cliffs,
sea waves crashed against the rocks. I drifted back to sleep, for 30 minutes
precisely.
'Ocho y media]' Ocho y media]' A terrific din broke out at the bottom of the
stairs. David Castle was vigorously swinging a large bell. 'Eight thirty]'
he shouted up. 'Breakfast is on the table]' Like a new recruit I swung into
my trousers, fumbled my way into shoes and shirt, and tumbled down the
stairs.
***
David Castle, it turned out, is not completely potty, just enthusiastic
about beginning a new life in Spain. He has lived most of his life in Port
Isaac, and had enough of its moaning winds, plaintive seagulls,
cliff-crashing waves and winter isolation. He knows that other, milder
worlds exist.
As a young man his military career took him to the Mediterranean, and over
the years he has made holiday escapes to Menorca no fewer than 16 times. Now
he is ready to buy his dream house there. Dunoon is up for sale, and he is
taking Spanish lessons in preparation for his departure. Far to the south, a
gentle land of sunshine, Aertex shirts and golden beaches is waiting.
To an urban visitor like me, of course, the wild maritime terrain, bracing
climate and out-of-season isolation is the whole point of going to a place
like Port Isaac. There are few spots left on the English coast, especially
in the vacationland of the south-west, that have not been over-run by
tourist mobs, seafront amusement arcades and sticks of rock. Your chances of
stumbling across a quaint Cornish fishing village are about as good as
getting an authentic Cornish pasty from a dispensing machine at a motorway
snack bar. Both exist, both are almost impossible to find.
But Port Isaac is about as close to the ideal as you can come these days.
Here on the rugged North Cornwall coast, a 40-minute drive around the Camel
estuary from Padstow, topography and a local conservation order have saved
Port Isaac from over-development. There is no coastal road along this shore,
for unlike other parts of Cornwall there are few sheltered harbours, sandy
beaches or means of access to the sea. Precipitous 200-ft cliffs range the
shoreline; sturdy sheep, occasional cliff-path walkers and the odd tractor
are the only company you will run across.
July and August see an influx of summer tourists to Port Isaac, but even
that has its limits. Built into a rocky, high-sided inlet, the village and
everything about it is steep and tiny. Seventeenth-century slate and stone
houses built on different levels cluster round a miniature walled harbour.
Crooked lanes tail away into stepped footpaths. With many streets barely 6
ft wide, parking near the port is impossible except in the harbour-floor
'tidal parking lot' - an option with nasty consequences for all but the
shortest of short-term holiday-makers.
If topography is one limitation to tourism, so is weather. This is one of
the windiest places in Britain - so windy, in fact, that the country's first
electricity-generating wind-farm, a futuristic vision of vast, winged
turbines, sits not far inland. An ever-present, inescapable element, the
wind batters the cliffs, deforms bushes into ragged, lop-sided shapes, and
brings in ocean storms with lightning speed. But for those who like the
wilder, more unpredictable side of nature, cliff, sea, wind and storm all
make for a grand show.
I began not with a natural, but a human show. After breakfast I set off in a
blustery wind for Tintagel - better known to lovers of Arthurian legend as
Camelot - half-an-hour away by car.
Although there is not much left of the castle at Tintagel, its site is
romantic enough. Perched high over the roaring sea on a headland connected
to the shore by the thinnest neck of rock, it is a wild place where, among
crags and ruins, one can imagine Arthur and his knights gathered at the
Round Table.
Unfortunately, not a scrap of evidence exists to show that King Arthur ever
set foot in the place. If it was the 12th-century Geoffrey of Monmouth who
invented the famous legends several hundred years after Arthur was supposed
to have lived, and Thomas Mallory who popularised them some 300 years after
that, it was a visit to Tintagel by Tennyson, and his subsequent Morte
d'Arthur, that linked this place to the myth.
More unfortunately still, the Round Table in Tintagel these days is not a
round table at all, but a bandwagon. The town's King Arthur's Hall of
Chivalry is only the beginning of it. As I walked back from the castle to my
car, I passed just a few of the establishments cashing in on the legend:
King Arthur's Bookshop, King Arthur's Cafe, the Pendragon Gallery, Merlin's
Gift Shop, the King Arthur's Arms. If there is a Chinese laundry in
Tintagel, it probably has an Arthurian name.
Very different was a long cliff walk the next day around Pentire Point and
along the Camel river estuary to the Padstow ferry. It is a hike that took
me through some of the most colourful, and this time authentic, chapters of
Cornish tradition.
This was once one of the most dangerous coasts in England. From St Ives Bay
to the Devon border extends a rocky, exposed shore which, for more than 80
miles, has no safe harbour where ships could run in rough weather. Sailing
vessels were wrecked along here by the hundreds, and the Cornish population
developed as fearsome a reputation for 'wrecking' as for smuggling. Wreckers
were opportunists who, from the cliff-tops, would follow a ship in trouble
until it foundered and was driven ashore, then strip it of everything from
cargo to cabin doors.
There are many dark tales of wreckers deliberately luring ships to
destruction. On stormy nights, it is said, they would tie a lamp to a cow's
tail and send it wandering off along the cliffs. Swinging to and fro like a
ship's masthead light, it would draw vessels and their crews to certain
death.
Padstow Bay and the mouth of the Camel estuary would appear to be one of the
few safe havens along this coast, but in fact it was one of the most
dangerous traps of all. This is the site of the dreaded Doom Bar, a broad
expanse of sand stretching across the estuary mouth, through which only one
narrow deepwater channel existed. If the name of that worthy organisation,
the Padstow Harbour Association for the Preservation of Life and Property
from Shipwreck, was somewhat long and awkward for use in split-second
emergencies, it was none the less successful in rescuing many a mariner from
a watery end on the Doom Bar.
I saw no wrecks on the day I walked along the sands at low tide, just the
wind-whipped little church of Saint Enodoc, where John Betjeman is buried,
and scores of bright orange and yellow wind-surfers making spectacular leaps
over the waves of Padstow Bay. While the town of Padstow may no longer have
to save vast numbers of sailors, it continues an equally admirable service;
at Granny's Pasty Shop near the waterfront it makes a pasty that any
Cornishman would be proud of.
The most pleasurable part of a stay in Port Isaac, though, is simply
spending time around Port Isaac itself. Not even dirty weather detracts from
the atmosphere; it adds to it. Down at the tiny harbour, locals stand about
stacked lobster pots in the drizzle, talking fish. In the Port Isaac
fisherman's co-op you can take refuge from spring gales and buy some of the
finest cooked crabs around. In the Golden Lion on wet and foggy Saturday
nights you can sip a pint and listen to wildly Celtic fiddle-playing.
And on the hill at a wind-battered house called Dunoon, of course, you can
practise your Spanish with a man who would give it all up, just for a bit of
sunshine.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Travel: Walk in a dry landscape - Michael J Woods finds life
teeming in rocky Andalucia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL J WOODS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT COULD have been Devon. The hillside dropped abruptly to the river below
and the oaks clung to the slope. But these trees were different, their lower
trunks naked like the smooth tanned legs of girls in tweedy shorts. The
reason for this was that their cork bark had been harvested to stopper a
million wine bottles.
We wandered down to the river below, although there was no water running in
its stony bed at this end of summer, and came to rest among red-flowered
oleanders. Here our host, Hugh Arbuthnott, unloaded cake, fino and home-made
lemonade from one of the pack mules and distributed generous portions as we
lounged in the shade.
Our short walk through the sierras of Andalucia proved to be a holiday for
sybarites. We started near Gaucin and finished at Ronda. In between came
gentle strolls through beautiful countryside from one relaxing stop to the
next.
Sometimes Jane, Hugh's wife, would be there to meet us with rations of
ice-cool apple juice or a basket of grapes. At others we relied on supplies
carried in the panniers, or called at a farm and sat in the cool shadows of
a spotless kitchen sipping drinks chilled by solar-powered refrigerator.
The Arbuthnotts have established a remarkably well-organised and comfortable
walking safari in this corner of Spain. Under the surface is a carefully
oiled machine run with a precision that reflects Hugh's military past.
Perhaps the most obvious clue to his attention to detail is the colour-coded
tape which appears on your luggage on the first day and which ensures that
you never have to lift it again. Cases and bags disappear from your room
after you leave and are already waiting by your bed when you arrive at your
night's destination.
Much of the cooking is done by Jane. At their farm, La Almuna, from where
the walk begins, she grows fresh vegetables and herbs for their guests.
Excellent local dishes are served on tables spread with white linen under
shady trees.
The centrepiece of the week is the time spent in an African-style safari
camp which uses large ridge tents imported from Kenya, big enough to house
two duvet-covered single beds. The tents have been extended by Hugh to
include a bathroom with hot shower. A ring of a sheep's bell brings staff
bearing warm water to fill the shower container through a gap in the roof.
Probably the most exciting day's walk took us over a pass and into the
Parque Natural de la Sierra. Although the initial climb was rather stiff,
there were donkeys for those who needed help. When you crest the rise a
limestone landscape of clints and grikes stretches away between the grey
flanks of higher mountains. The water-worn fins of rock look as though they
have been drawn up like clay between fingers, leaving small ridges behind.
The rock is pink blushed or subtly greyed with lichens like a delicately
made-up face. In crevices inaccessible to the ubiquitous goats we found tiny
ferns and the purple petals of autumn crocuses. Blue-winged grasshoppers
flitted before our feet, a praying mantis buzzed past, a black spider
scurried away; we even experienced a frisson of excitement when encountering
a small scorpion.
Overhead, a griffon vulture was visible in the bright sunlight, spiralling
in a generous gyre. Its wings were finger-feathered and broad - 'like a
tea-tray in the sky,' as the field-guide put it.
We came down from the mountains to a golden valley, the Llano de Libar,
sprinkled with chestnut Andalucian cattle and well-fleshed horses, as if we
had stumbled on to the set of Rawhide.
The only person we saw was a Spaniard with a luxuriant moustache, carrying a
lamb on his shoulders. Fluttering black redstarts chattered from the shade
as we squinted up at a mewing buzzard during our post-picnic rest.
Like the other pueblo blanco in the area, Ronda is stunningly white, too
bright to look at around mid-day, and is strung out along the lip of a
honey-coloured cliff.
Its narrow streets and shady gardens are a delight, but the poisonous River
Guadalevin which runs - grey, murky, foaming - under its famous bridge,
emits a noxious stink that permeates the town. Ronda redeemed itself by
offering wonderful views of a couple of peregrine falcons perched near the
clifftop within yards of the hotel garden. These, too, reminded me of Devon,
but in England I have neither seen them so closely nor watched them for so
long.
The Andalucian safari run by Hugh and Jane Arbuthnott is offered by
Abercrombie &amp; Kent (071-730-9600). Uphill stretches can be steep but the
walking overall is not hard. Whenever possible, activity takes place during
the cooler times of day. For this reason, safaris are not run during the
second half of July or in August.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Cricket: Sussex seek spin success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERESA MCLEAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUSSEX have never won the county championship. Back in the days before the
championship as we know it, Sussex were declared 'champions of the south' by
the senior cricket year books, Wisden and Cricketers' Companion. That was in
1871, when Sussex were already established as one of the 'celebrated
counties', along with Surrey, Kent, Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire.
But celebration has never led Sussex quite as far as first place. Not in the
county championship, anyway, although Sussex sometimes do better in one-day
contests. They did not distinguish themselves in one-day last year, but they
look back cheerfully to the way they won the first one-day contest ever held
in Britain, the 1963 Gillette Cup, against all expectations.
Sussex have always been a county of surprises. They are a quixotic crew.
Only with Sussex could CB Fry, world record long-jumper, England cricket
captain, footballer, wit and scholar, man who was offered the throne of
Albania, have blossomed in all his eccentric splendour. The county retains
its capacity for the unexpected and when Paul Parker was relieved of the
captaincy and signed for Durham last season, after 17 happy years with
Sussex, he generously declared that he expected Sussex to win a trophy
within two years.
It is possible. Breakthroughs are permanently possible at Sussex. It is
greatly to the county's credit that they appointed a youth development
officer last November, to organise local talent into a breakthrough squad
for years to come. 'It was expensive but it was worth it,' said the Sussex
coach, Norman Gifford, placidly watching his team being pulverised by
Leicestershire last Friday and Saturday (Sussex 171 and 103; Leics. 251 and
24 for 0), before beating Leicestershire easily in the Sunday game. 'We're
investing in the future and the future lies in producing your own players.'
A noble policy, consistent with Sussex's recent hard work on their second
XI, a good number of whom are Sussex born and bred. While the first XI got
the wooden spoon in 1990, the second XI were top of the Rapid Cricketline
second XI championship. They fell to seventh place last year, partly because
some of their best young players, such as Bradleigh Donelan, an off-spinner
with a fast, flat and most effective arm action, became regulars in the
first team. They must mature on the job. 'It takes time. You have to allow
time for these young players to find their feet and get used to first class
matches.'
Gifford spoke between puffs on his pipe, thoughtfully and certainly. He
positively oozes patience and encouragement for the up-and-coming players in
whom he places his trust; whether he has the hard edge to push them past
their problems must be doubtful, but he recognises that problems exist.
'We've played better. We must do better than this, we can and I think we
will.'
The keys to Gifford's hopes of success are: Martin Speight, batsman (1991:
batting average of 39); Peter Moores, wicket-keeper and batsman (1991: 56
catches and six stumpings); Ian Salisbury, leg-spinner (1991: 48 wickets);
Donelan, off-spinner (1991: 34 wickets and batting average of 35).
These last two make that most rare and dangerous of bowling forces, a
partnership in complementary spin, hungry for blood. The emancipation of
spin bowling has been one of the delights of this summer's cricket and
Sussex, under Gifford's benign patronage, are in the forefront.
For those of us brought up on the glamorous batting of Ted Dexter, the Nawab
of Pataudi and Imran Khan, it is strange to find Sussex's weakness today
seeming to be with bat rather than ball. Although they pulled themselves up
from last to 11th place last year, none of their batsmen, except Alan Wells,
did himself justice.
The Wells family are one of the family dynasties that have long been a
feature of Sussex cricket and Alan, a native of Newhaven, was helped by
strong local support in his difficult task of taking over the captaincy from
Parker before the end of the season. His batting blossomed and he managed
calmly and well. Neil Lenham, a member of the old Lenham dynasty from
Worthing, also batted well. With David Smith, he made a good but not
inspired opening pair. Alan Wells' all-rounder brother, Colin, was hampered
by injury; Jamie Hall and Speight were slightly disappointing; and Franklyn
Stephenson, this year's newly-acquired all-rounder from Nottinghamshire,
owes Sussex a few runs.
Stephenson was a brave choice because Sussex had to get rid of Tony
Dodemaide, the Australian all-rounder who had served them well for three
years, to make room. They have an unhappy reputation for getting rid of all
their best players, but they were clear about their reason for removing
Dodemaide: they wanted a strike bowler to rip out wickets, not a good,
steady bowler who takes wickets without terrifying the opposition.
Success is always unpredictable at Sussex, which is a county of individuals,
of hit-and-miss achievements. They have made themselves fast and furious
fielders, but that is not enough and they are in danger of remaining always
on the brink of doing well without ever doing it.
Their more experienced contingent needs to work more closely with the young
players and Gifford believes Wells's leadership and Salisbury's move into
Test match circles will help this happen. 'It inspires the young players to
see one of them making his way up through the system like Salisbury. They
start to believe everything is possible. We'll miss him but it's a lovely
thing for us.'
Lovely things have been thin on the ground at Sussex in the last few years,
but the club's members are 'a loyal lot' who seem to be finding this year's
mixed fortunes entertaining. Whatever else it is, cricket at Sussex is
seldom dull. It is talented, needing only organisation and confidence before
it comes into its own.
Sussex no longer play on the windswept old racecourse ground at Hastings,
'beautifully embosomed with hills' (The Field, August 1859), but Hove and
Eastbourne remain capitals of the county's seaside cricket and the enjoyment
that has always graced it.
There can be no better way of describing the modern county cricket ideal
than Gifford's: 'What we want in Sussex is the happy medium between
hungriness to win, such as Essex and Middlesex have, and the love of club
traditions.'

   By JOHN BARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT FIRST glance it would seem that Jim Courier, the world No. 1 and top
seed, has been dealt a tough hand for the 106th Wimbledon Championship which
starts on Monday.
His first opponent, Markus Zoecke of Germany, stands 1.96 meters in his
socks and delivers one of the fastest serves in the business. But the rest
of his game is brittle. Courier would then meet the winner of the section
containing the No 16 seed David Wheaton, a semi-finalist last year, and two
former champions, John McEnroe and Pat Cash. If he survives, there will be
in his path either the tall Frenchman Guy Forget, seeded 9, or the
diminutive American, Michael Chang, seeded 7. Finally, his prospective
semi-final opponent is the No. 4 seed, Boris Becker, three times the
champion, and a finalist six times in the last seven years.
Chatting with Jim this week on the Centre Court, I was impressed by his
quiet confidence. He points out: 'Everyone talks about the importance of the
serve on the fast grass and assumes that guys like Becker, Edberg and Stich
will have it all their own way. But you have to break the serve to win, so
service return and ground strokes are really more important. After all I got
to the quarters last year and so did Andre (Agassi). I'm a better player now
and once I've adjusted to the bounce then I feel I have as good a chance as
anyone else.'
He makes a good point. The five consecutive victories of Bjorn Borg in the
late 1970's were won mostly from the back of the court and Stich's success
last year was based as much on the quality of his backhand returns and
passes as on the penetration of his serve.
Although in theory Courier's game is not ideal for grass, he does have a
wonderful serve and has been in the final of four of the last five Grand
Slam championships, winning three of them. He has won his last 23 singles
matches. That sort of record cannot be ignored; it reveals a strength of
character and a technical adaptability superior to any of his current
rivals. Tennis matches are won in the mind, and Courier has proved that he
has the strongest mind in the business.
In a difficult year for forecasters, I believe Courier to be the most likely
men's champion - although Stich, with a win on grass in Rosmalen last week
and a soft draw as the No. 3 seed, must have a strong chance. He is due to
play Pete Sampras or Richard Krajicek in the quarter-finals, and then Stefan
Edberg in the semi-final, a match he won last year without breaking serve.
Edberg will be burning for revenge.
The most fascinating thing about this year's Wimbledon is the return of
Monica Seles after her mysterious non-arrival in 1991. Like Courier, the
world champion is supposed to have a game unsuitable for grass. But cast
your mind back two years: do you remember that spectacular quarter-final on
Court No. 1, Seles against Zina Garrison? For sheer drama it was quite
unrivalled - the issue was in doubt until the last nail-biting second.
Garrison had an inspired day, and kept hitting the lines with her volleys to
inflict a 3-6 6-3 9-7 defeat on Seles.
And, like Courier, Seles has the most destructive ground strokes of the
modern era. Already the reigning US, French and Australian champion, I
believe that her improving serve, a greater readiness to volley and, of
course, those relentless two-fisted drives will carry her to a first
Wimbledon title.
Is there anyone who can stop her? I suppose Steffi Graf, the present
champion, might - but the faithful forehand is not the weapon it was, and
the anguish of losing the French final two weeks ago (after so many chances
to win) will have its effect. Nor can I be too sanguine about the chances of
last year's finalist, Gabriela Sabatini. Her nerve, on the great occasion,
remains suspect. As for Martina Navratilova: her first-round loss at
Eastbourne this week, added to a lack of match play, will militate against
her.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Tennis: A terribly English revolution - John Barrett goes
behind the ivy to find out how Wimbledon has become the leading tournament
in a commercial world without losing its garden party feel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE two-week tennis festival that begins on Monday on the lawns of the All
England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club (yes, they still wield the mallet
there) will attract crowds approaching 400,000 to watch the best players in
the world competing for record prize money of Pounds 4,416,000. The
tournament will generate a surplus in excess of Pounds 12m for the Lawn
Tennis Association, which will be ploughed back into the game, and the
tennis will reach a worldwide television audience of 1.5bn.
After 117 years of growth, Wimbledon has become part of England's sporting
psyche, as unmistakably English as Royal Ascot, Henley or the Lords Test. In
a thoroughly commercial world it is remarkable that the relaxed garden party
atmosphere at the Church Road ground has been maintained. How has this
delicate balancing act been achieved? Professional amateurism. All the best
features of the old traditions have been retained, and skilled professional
managers have been introduced to guide the growing business in the best
interests of British tennis.
The only commercial pressure at the first championship meeting in 1877 (for
gentlemen only; women were not invited to compete until 1884) was to raise
enough money to repair the broken pony roller. Play was suspended so that
everyone could enjoy their two traditional days at Lord's for the Eton v
Harrow cricket match. Some 200 spectators turned up on finals day, each
paying two shillings. A profit of Pounds 10 ensured that the roller could be
repaired.
The referee of that meeting was Dr Henry Jones, the man who had been the
moving force behind the introduction of lawn tennis to the All England
Croquet Club in 1875. He wrote for The Field, and had persuaded the then
editor, J H Walsh, that the magazine should donate a cup, worth 25 guineas,
as a prize for the first championship. I wonder what the good doctor would
have thought about this year's singles champions, who will collect about
Pounds 250,000 each.
The importance of Wimbledon to the LTA as the chief source of funds can
hardly be overestimated. Ever since the move, in 1922, from the old ground
in Worple Road to the present site, there has been an agreement to pass the
full annual surplus from the championships to the governing body. In the
pre-war years the surplus was about Pounds 30,000. In 1954 this had become
Pounds 60,445. Ten years later it was still only Pounds 57,712. Following
the introduction of open tennis in 1968, the revenues rose rapidly. In 1974
the surplus was Pounds 87,478; eight years later it passed the Pounds 1m
mark. By 1985 it had reached Pounds 5m; by 1988 it was Pounds 7.6m. Last
year it was Pounds 11.9m.
The tournament has always been alive to the need for change. It was the All
England Club which prodded the International Tennis Federation into adopting
open tennis by holding a professional tournament on the hallowed lawns in
1967. It may seem unthinkable that the club at the heart of the
Establishment could be so revolutionary but this has always been Wimbledon's
strength - to do what is right for tennis without losing the precious
atmosphere.
Two traditions have been crucial in keeping Wimbledon's feel: the
perseverance with grass and the royal connection.
Until 1974 three of the four Grand Slam Championships were played on grass
courts, with the French Open alone played on their traditional terre battu,
which we refer to now as clay. In 1975 the US Open at Forest Hills changed
from grass to Har-Tru, before moving in 1978 to Flushing Meadows and
DecoTurf ll, an asphalt surface with a high, fast bounce. In 1988, the
Australians moved from grass to Rebound Ace, a hard court which becomes
uncomfortably hot in summer. Ever since then, there has been pressure on
Wimbledon to change surface.
Yet Wimbledon was wise enough to know the value of being unique. Only at
Wimbledon (and at the few lead-up tournaments) can the great players of
today compete on the surface on which the giants of the past made their
reputations.
Grass courts have always presented a unique test, because the bounce is
never quite the same two days running. This calls for adaptability, speed of
reflex and speed off the mark. There is no time to think on a grass court,
so a player must have fast hand-eye co-ordination and rely on instinctive
reaction to get to the ball in time to make a shot without being rushed.
Technique, too, is put under the severest pressure, and the swing has to be
shortened to cope with the fast bounce. With briefer rallies than on clay or
cement, concentration is crucial. One lapse can cost you a match.
The grass courts themselves are part of the mystique of Wimbledon. So are
the customs of asking the defending champions to open the Centre Court
programme on each of the first two days, the insistence on predominantly
white dress, the provision of public picnic areas in Aorangi Park, the daily
starts at 2pm on the Centre Court and No. 1 Court, the bow to royalty in the
Royal Box, the limousine service, and afternoon tea with strawberries and
cream. All these little touches have preserved a link with the past. It is a
continuity the players respect and enjoy.
Ever since the then Prince of Wales, later George V, visited Wimbledon for
the first time in 1907, and consented to become the club's first president,
the championships have benefitted from the royal connection.
Star status has been a factor ever since Lottie Dod, the Cheshire
schoolgirl, won the first of her five Wimbledon singles titles in 1877 - at
15 years and 285 days old - to become the youngest-ever champion.
Wimbledon soon succumbed to foreign invasion. In 1905 the ladies' singles
went overseas for the first time through the success of May Sutton, the US
champion. Two years later Norman Brookes, a talented left-hander from
Melbourne, carried off the men's title to launch an invasion that would
overwhelm the home players. Since the First World War, only one British man
and five British women have won the singles at Wimbledon.
The arrival of Suzanne Lenglen, the mercurial Frenchwoman, in 1919, and the
arrogant American, 'Big' Bill Tilden, a year later, marked a turning point.
Through their successes Wimbledon became recognised internationally as the
world's greatest championship, a status it has never lost. Suzanne, an
attractive figure in coloured bandeau and matching cardigan, won six singles
titles with a balletic grace that captivated an admiring audience.
Tilden, a tall commanding figure with a complete repertoire of strokes and
the natural showmanship of a film star (he was a keen but poor amateur
actor), won three Wimbledon and seven US Championships. In the opinion of
his contemporaries Tilden was the greatest player the game had produced.
The period up to the Second World War saw revival in British fortunes. Fred
Perry's three successes in 1934, 1935 and 1936, together with Dorothy
Round's two Wimbledon singles successes in 1934 and 1937, marked the
pinnacle of British achievement.
The stars of the post-war era flared brightly but briefly before
disappearing into the professional void. Kramer, Trabert, Hoad and Rosewall
were names to conjure with before they were swallowed up.
With the arrival of open tennis in 1968 it was inevitable that commercial
interests would intrude on what had been a staunchly amateur scene. While
other tournaments leapt at the chance to maximise their income by allowing
advertising to proliferate around the perimeters of their show courts, the
Wimbledon approach was far more subtle. Direct exposure was restricted to a
small number of companies - Rolex on the clocks and scoreboards, Coca-Cola
on the drink dispensers, Robinsons on the bottles of Barley Water, Slazenger
on the canvas surrounds. This preserved the uncluttered look on all the
courts and with fast rising revenues from television, ticket sales, the hire
of entertainment marquees, and the merchandising of the Wimbledon name
produced the growing surpluses.
Britain's standings on the two international ranking lists are at their
lowest ever level. While other leading tennis nations were investing in
building new indoor and outdoor clubs, promoting the game against the rival
claims of other leisure activities, the British were basking in the growing
success of Wimbledon.
A succession of great champions enhanced Wimbledon's image. Rod Laver, the
greatest player of those years (probably of all time), won two Grand Slams,
as an amateur in 1962 and in 1969 as a professional. Margaret Court won the
singles three times at Wimbledon as she collected 62 Grand Slam titles.
Billie Jean King won her 20th Wimbledon title in 1979, to become the most
successful champion. Bjorn Borg won five in a row, proving that baseliners
could win on grass; Martina Navratilova claimed a ninth singles title in
1990, thus passing Helen Wills Moody's record. These stars made their
reputations at Wimbledon. In return, they have maintained Wimbledon as the
world's leading tennis tournament.
Perhaps the greatest lesson that Wimbledon has learned is that it must adapt
to changing circumstances. Ever since the move to Church Road, the club has
protected its interests by purchasing the surrounding land for parking and
expansion. The annexation of the former Barkers Sports Ground in 1967
(leased to the New Zealand Club until 1987 and renamed Aorangi Park) allowed
the construction of four more courts and the provision of extra space for
public restaurants and picnic areas. This helped to preserve the garden
party atmosphere.
This year the new, higher Centre Court roof has transformed the appearance
of the old stadium. The removal of pillars makes it seem bigger and more
modern, as well as providing a perfect view from all but 50 or so seats. A
self-service cafeteria opens this year - and Radio Wimbledon starts
broadcasting.
Yes, change is in the air. But, when it comes down to it, there will be the
same sense of expectancy as new names appear on the scoreboard, the same
tingle of excitement as the matches move towards their climax, the same
sense of occasion as the champions receive their trophies from royal hands.
Whoever they are, these two young athletes will have become part of an
enduring tradition. 'Wimbledon champions.' It doesn't get any better than
that.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Golf: A superstar signs in
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Phil Mickelson turned professional rec- ently, he did so to a roll of
drums and a fanfare of trumpets. Not since Jack Nicklaus was a fat, crew cut
teenager with a high pitched voice has a young amateur excited the world of
golf like Mickelson.
It is not just because he is left handed, good looking in an aw-shucks sort
of way and inordinately polite. He refers to Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer
as Mr Nicklaus and Mr Palmer. Nor is it that every manufacturer of golf
equipment has been after him to sign a contract to use their clubs and every
agent has tried to lure him into their stable. It is that on known form he
is the most exciting amateur to join the paid ranks since Ben Crenshaw 20
years ago. There is even a suggestion that he is as good as Nicklaus was
when he turned pro 30 years ago.
But Nicklaus did not become an instant millionaire the moment he signed as a
pro. Mickelson did. He has signed a contract to play Yonex clubs for which
he is reported to receive a annual salary of Dollars 500,000 (Pounds
294,117) and annual incentive bonuses of the same amount again. This is in
addition to a signing bonus of Dollars 1m (Pounds 590,000). He was 22 last
Tuesday. Some birthday present.
Mickelson began hitting shots when he was 1 1/2 years old. At five he played
his first round, accompanying his father. He was so keen he ran between
shots. A natural right hander, Mickelson plays golf the other way around
because of the way he was taught. He would stand facing his father and copy
exactly what his father did.
Last Wednesday Mickelson sat at a dais, three feet above his questioners, in
a room at the US Open. At his feet were America's golf writers. The
symbolism was hard to avoid. 'I have seen the future and I'm frightened,'
said one reporter after hearing Mickelson speak. There was none of the
cockiness that Nicklaus had at the same age, nor, for that matter, much of
the tongue-tied, golly-gosh syndrome that other young men demonstrate.
Instead, we watched and listened to a young man who has been guided every
step of the way these past few years by a coterie of advisers who include
Dean Reinmuth, his golf teacher, Steve Loy, the Arizona State University
golf coach, and sports psychologist Bob Rotella. He was nervous all right
but that's no bad thing. At least he was gracious.
In my memory some players are filed under a section marked memorable stroke
or incident. Seve Ballesteros's bunker shot with a three-wood during the
1983 Ryder Cup is one such stroke. The sight of Nicklaus conceding that putt
to Tony Jacklin in the 1969 Ryder Cup is another. Mickelson playing a chip
to the 15th green during the Walker Cup at Portmarnock last summer is a
third.
The hole is praised and feared for its beauty and difficulty. To the right
of the green, no more than two yards from the edge of the putting surface,
is the beach. The green is elevated. The flag was in the middle of the
green. Mickelson's ball had rolled off the putting surface and dribbled down
the bank. He needed to loft the ball 12 or 15 feet in the air to get it up
the bank and drop it as softly as he could so that it would stop near the
flag.
Most other golfers in such a position would have chipped their ball with a
straight-faced club, trundling it up the bank. Mickelson thought
differently. The moment he pulled a sand wedge out of his bag a frisson of
excitement went around the spectators. He was going to flop it onto the
green. Peter Alliss was commentating and remembers thinking that such a shot
could not be played. 'He's an idiot to try it' Alliss thought.
Alliss and the rest of us were confounded when Mickelson's soft swing seemed
to do little more than caress the ball. It inscribed a gentle parabola
pitched by the flag and halted two feet further on. Having the nerve to
consider such a shot was one thing; being able to bring it off quite
another. It was clear then that we were watching a man of extraordinary
talent. 'No one else in the world could have played that shot' said Jim
Gabrielson, the US team captain. 'No one.'
As they say in soccer circles, Mickelson now 'has it all to do.' Many young
men have turned pro after dazzling amateur careers, one of the most recent
being Scott Verplank who won one tournament on the pro tour while he was
still an amateur - as did Mickelson. Whether Mickelson, who hit 68 to lie
third after the first round of the US Open on Thursday, can succeed where
they failed remains to be seen.
'Pressure is something exterior' he said once. 'It's what the media put on
you, what other people say. A ten-foot putt is a ten-foot putt whether it's
for Dollars 100 or Dollars 1. Pressure is something that shouldn't affect
you inside.'
Brave, bold words. One hopes they do not come back to haunt this likeable
young man. Golf needs him.

DOES indexation relief on capital gains on quoted shares apply to the period
between the grant of an option to acquire a share at its current price at a
future date and the exercising of the option?
I was granted the option in 1987 to acquire some shares under an Inland
Revenue approved scheme and exercised the option in 1991. I then sold the
shares and made a capital gain. The Revenue wish to charge capital gains tax
on the difference in price between 1987 and 1991 with no indexation
allowance.
The cost of the option ranks for indexation from the month in which the
option was granted to the month in which it was exercised. The cost of
exercising the option is added to the indexed cost of the option, and the
total ranks for indexation from the month in which the option was exercised
to the month in which the shares were sold.
If the shares were sold less than ten days after the option was exercised,
however, the cost of the option ranks for indexation from the month in which
it was granted to the month in which the shares were sold - and there is no
indexation relief on the cost of exercising the option.
Ask your tax office for pamphlet CGT13: The indexation allowance for quoted
shares.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE moved from my home as a result of changing my job and I am renting
out my main residence. I am considering purchasing a second property for
investment purposes and renting that out as well.
1. Can the excess interest on the loan for the second property, over and
above rental income, be used to offset tax on the income from letting my
original home?
2. Does it matter, for tax purposes, on which house the loan for the second
property is secured?
3. Can qualifying expenses incurred in the tax year immediately prior to
letting these properties, and solely related to preparation for letting, be
used as an allowance for tax purposes against rental income in the current
tax year?
4. Can you recommend a thorough text which covers residential lettings in
detail?
The solicitors who act for you in the purchase will, of course, be able to
guide you through the income tax and capital gains tax maze. (Before
formally appointing a firm to act for you, however, it would be prudent to
check that it has someone who is competent in the tax aspects of domestic
property transactions.)
1. Yes; subject to the conditions set out in section 355(l) (b) of the
Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 by virtue of section 355(4).
2. No; it is the use of the borrowed money which matters - not the security
for the loan by virtue of section 354(l).
3. No. However, such expenditure may be deductible in calculating the
chargeable gain when the house is sold, by virtue of Inland Revenue
statement of practice D24:
'Expenditure on initial repairs to a property (including expenditure on
decorations) undertaken in order to put it into a fit state for letting, and
not allowable for the purposes of Schedule A, is regarded as allowable
expenditure for capital gains tax purposes under section 38(1) of the
Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992.'
4. You are probably better off talking to your solicitor.
The following free pamphlets from your tax office may be helpful, but they
oversimplify the intricate and arbitrary rules laid down by Parliament: CGT4
 -Capital gains tax: owner-occupied houses; IR87 - Rooms to let.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Chill extends beyond tree line
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOUNDARY between our property and the neighbouring property has been a
tree line roughly 75 yards long with the mutual understanding that the trees
themselves belong to our neighbour. There has never been a boundary fence in
place.
We painted our house last September, which is surely our prerogative. Ever
since our neighbours have been distinctly 'cold'.
Our neighbour has now decided that the boundary line needs clarification. We
have looked at garden plans which reveal no means of assessing the boundary
line save the garden area (which is complicated by the fact that the shapes
are irregular).
I maintain that the boundary line is the tree line with my neighbour in
possession of the trees, which is consistent with my area measurement. He
insists that it is several feet past the trees on my side.
On whom does the onus lie to alter this mutually accepted boundary? I have
no wish to involve myself in any legal expenses when I am not disputing its
present position. Can my neighbour erect a fence where he assumes it lies?
What are my rights in this case?
We have lived in the house since 1987 and have carried out many mutually
beneficial improvements which our neighbour appreciated until now. We are a
young family with three children and no wish to cause ill feeling or incur
large expenses.
You have no obligation to do anything to resolve or fix the boundary.
However, if your neighbour puts up a fence within your land you have little
choice in practice other than to challenge him in court or by physically
removing the fence. If you do not he will acquire title to the strip of your
land which he has thus enclosed once 12 years have elapsed.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Pension investors to face bonus
squeeze - Moves to cut returns on contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PENSION investors could face sharp cuts in bonuses and radical changes in
the way these are allocated.
The Institute of Actuaries wants to see rates for pension contracts, based
on traditional and unitised with-profits funds, changed to reflect the poor
returns of the late 1980s and the predicted low yields of the 1990s.
The institute is alsolooking hard at how actuaries are dealing with unitised
with-profits contracts. Little is known about the long-term implications for
investors of these products; yet, by mid-1992, three-quarters of providers
had replaced their traditional with-profits contract with a unitised
version.
With-profits pensions have been available for the self-employed and those in
non-pensionable employment since 1956, initially in the form of
self-employed retirement annuities and, since July 1988, as personal
pensions. Until three years ago, traditional with-profits contracts formed
the backbone of this thriving market.
Under a traditional contract, the investor secures a substantial guaranteed
sum at maturity, to which annual or reversionary bonuses are added. These
bonuses, which smooth out fluctuations over the long term, are guaranteed
and, once allocated, cannot be taken away. On top of this, there is a final
or terminal bonus which is discretionary and reflects actual performance
over the past 15 months.
This method of distributing profits to policyholders became more complex
with the introduction of a two-tier annual bonus system. Originally, bonuses
were paid as a percentage of the sum assured plus any attaching bonuses from
previous years. Now, however, most providers allocate a lower bonus to the
sum assured and a higher rate to the accrued bonuses. In this way, providers
hope to cut overall payouts at the expense of the shorter-term contracts.
A second trend in recent years has been for providers to place greater
emphasis on the discretionary final bonus. Under a Standard Life 25-year
with-profits contract, for example, the terminal bonus accounts for more
than 60 per cent of the total payout at maturity. At the other end of the
spectrum, Commercial Union's terminal bonus accounts for under 30 per cent
of final payout.
Advocates of the terminal bonus argue that it gives greater investment
flexibility since a smaller part of the underlying fund has to be set aside
in a special reserve to cover future guarantees. The pro-guarantees lobby
argues that the shift in emphasis towards final bonus constitutes a
significant change in the risk profile of these contracts.
In future, though, bonus rates may be cut severely as actuaries follow the
guidelines expected to emerge from an investigation by the institute headed
by Chris Headdon, senior assistant actuary with Equitable Life. He is
chairman of the institute's working party on future bonus prospects which is
examining how quickly, and by how much, bonus rates should be cut because of
the influence of the European exchange rate mechanism coupled with a
prolonged period of low inflation and low investment returns.
Headdon says: 'It is generally accepted that bonus cuts have not gone far
enough, although there are signs that the old reluctance to cut is being
replaced by a more realistic attitude. The industry has not done itself any
favours by treating the high declared bonus rates of the past as a sacred
cow.'
At the same time, the institute is examining the whole concept of the
unitised with-profits contract. In spite of marketing claims that these
products are easier to understand than the traditional contract, unitisation
is not synonymous with simplification. This product does not offer a
guaranteed sum at maturity; thus, the provider does not have to set aside
such large reserves to meet its obligations. Also, the bonuses are declared
in a different format from traditional contracts.
Most providers increase the value of the unit price but a minority,
including Sun Life and Legal &amp; General, maintain a fixed unit price and add
bonuses through the allocation of extra units. Within these two systems,
there are a host of variations on the way profit is distributed.
Moreover, one-third of providers - including Provident Life, Prudential, Sun
Life and Scottish Equitable - do not offer a guaranteed minimum bonus. The
rest provide a minimum of about 4 per cent per annum. Unitised funds also
apply a final bonus, but the product has only been available for a few years
and a clear pattern has not emerged.
The institute's working party on unitised funds is keen to investigate
whether actuaries are tackling in the best way what is a relatively new
product that now accounts for the majority of new pensions (and endowment)
business.
Unitisation also heralded the arrival of the controversial market value
adjuster (MVA). These adjusters are used as a safety net for providers in
case of a mass exodus of clients following a drop in the markets, and allow
them to reduce the value of units. In this respect, the guaranteed nature of
the accruing bonuses is not so solid after all.
The working party on unitisation, which draws on expertise from the
government actuary's department, life offices and actuarial consultants,
requested detailed information from providers to determine how bonus rates
are calculated and how the MVAs operate. The survey also examined investment
policy and the level of reserves held to meet future obligations. The
working party is expected to publish its findings shortly and could issue
guidelines to actuaries operating unitised funds.
William Hewitson, chief actuary in the life insurance division at the
government actuary' s department, says: 'In most cases, life offices
introducing the product have at the same time withdrawn their traditional
with-profits contract. The institute felt that this new concept should be
the subject of a professional study to see what sort of practices were
developing with the idea of setting some broad industry standards.'
The investigation also spotlights concern over the almost wholesale
abandonment of the traditional with-profits concept. This seems odd at a
time when volatile markets and pension scandals have sent investors in their
droves seeking lower risk pension policies underpinned by guarantees.
Providers claim that unitisation benefits the investor. But the
proliferation of unitised contracts has taken place over the past three
years when the call for life offices to cut bonuses and reduce pressure on
reserves has intensified.
Since it is almost impossible to compare the two types of bonus rates,
cynics might argue that the switch to unitisation has given providers the
opportunity to revise contracts to suit themselves without inviting
unwelcome publicity.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Cautious mortgage lenders redo their
sums - Expenditure and net income are becoming part of the home loan
calculations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR many years, income has been the standard yardstick for judging the size
of the mortgage which a house buyer can afford.
For couples the formula has been three plus one: that is, three times the
larger income plus the smaller income multiplied by one. A single person can
expect to get a mortgage of up to three times his or her annual salary.
As many families can ruefully testify, borrowing on this scale can be quite
painful, particularly if you take out your mortgage when rates are low and
then find yourself struggling to keep up with the monthly payments when
interest rates are higher.
In the 1980s housing boom, that fact did not deter some building societies
from lending much larger amounts to their customers. Some lenders were
willing to advance up to five times a customer's annual income.
If you are applying for a mortgage these days, you may well find yourself
being asked to fill in a form listing your monthly outgoings or you may have
to give information to your mortgage broker who will perform this task for
you.
Calculations are based on post-tax net monthly income, and existing
borrowing, mortgage and any car loans only. Utility payments such as gas and
electricity bills are not necessarily needed.
Nationwide, the second largest building society, now asks customers whose
loans are over 90 per cent of the value of the property to supply details of
their income and spending, some other societies do the same.
These details are usually not very rigidly policed, but they do give the
lender a more exact idea of how affluent (or not) its prospective customer
is. Borrowers are forced to think about exactly how much cash they will have
in hand each month, once the direct debit on the mortgage starts to operate.
Affordability measures of this sort are also used behind the scenes by some
lenders as a way of double-checking whether they should make a particular
loan or not.
If you get into trouble keeping up your payments on an existing mortgage,
you will find that your lender quickly steps in to measure your monthly
outgoings.
National Westminster, the second largest high street bank, asks customers
who have missed two month's mortgage payments to fill in a form on monthly
outgoings to help assess their ability to recover
Customers are not obliged to fill in the form, though anyone two months
behind with the payments on their home is not best-advised to get on the
wrong side of their lender.
The most radical step has been taken by BNP Mortgages, the UK offshoot of
the French bank, which asks its customers to go through a much more complex
set of measurements of their disposable cash to show that they can afford
the mortgage they are contemplating.
Donald Cameron-Moore, chief executive of BNP Mortgage says that BNP will
lend mortgages whose monthly payments are up to 35 per cent of the net
income of a customer, after tax and other deductions including car and
travel expenses.
'The result is that we lend less than competitors using the traditional
multiple, but we do lend more on joint applications on mortgages up to
Pounds 100,000,' says Cameron-Moore.
He believes that some intermediaries appreciate the system since it reduces
the risks for both borrowers and intermediaries.
'I have my doubts about whether these new measurements will make much
difference to the market. The question is what happens to interest rates. If
they go up again, you will have the same problem.' says Ian Darby, managing
director of John Charcol, the mortgage lender.
There are already some signs that building societies do not like cumbersome
restrictions which interfere with the flow of business in a thin market.
For example, in a move designed to make mortgage fraud more difficult, some
lenders were demanding that borrowers produce identity documents such as a
birth certificate, driving licence or community charge book if they came
from intermediaries, but they now seem to be relaxing these requirements.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Trustees told: do your job properly -
A High Court rebuke to NatWest - and its implications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE GARNHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HIGH Court last month fired a shot across the bows of trust fund
managers. Although Lord Justices Dillon, Staughton and Legatt decided
unanimously in the Court of Appeal that the National Westminster bank had
not been in breach of its duty as administrator of a will trust, they made
several stinging criticisms.
Lord Justice Staughton said the bank had fallen 'woefully short' of
maintaining the real value of the fund, let alone matching the average
increase in the price of ordinary shares. He added that the trustees had
failed to conduct a regular and periodic review of the investments and spoke
of 'incompetence and idleness.'
Lord Justice Dillon said the bank had 'little to be proud of' in its
handling of the fund. But the most damning comment came from Lord Justice
Legatt, who declared that "no testator would choose the defendant bank for
the effective management of his investment."
The facts are simple. A man named Nestle died in 1922, leaving an annuity
fund of about Pounds 37,000 and two subsidiary funds of about Pounds 5,000
each. He appointed the National Provincial Bank (later incorporated into
NatWest) to look after them as a trustee for his family.
In 1986, when the trust ended, a woman descendant was paid Pounds 269,203 as
the sole beneficiary. But she claimed this was not enough and that NatWest
had misunderstood its powers of investment. She said the bank had put money
only into fixed-interest securities and bank and insurance shares rather
than in a wider range of equities which probably would have performed better
through the 1970s and '80s.
Case law on the liability of trustees for breach of their investment duties
has remained relatively static since the last century. In 1886, Lord Lindley
said the duty of a trustee was to be just as careful as an ordinary prudent
man when investing for the benefit of others.
In 1961, the Trustee Investments Act set out in further detail the duties of
trustees. They should:
Diversify investments so long as this suited the circumstances of the trust.
Decide if particular investments were suitable. Get and consider proper
written advice about whether the investments were satisfactory.
Review the investments at regular intervals to decide if they should be kept
or changed.
The woman, who had already lost before Mr Justice Hoffman in the High Court,
lost again because the judges ruled she had failed to show that the fund's
value had performed less well than it would have done if the bank had not
misunderstood the investment clause.
They said the fund had kept pace with the cost of living and had
outperformed certain unit trusts. It had not kept up with the FT-SE share
index, but it was accepted that this could be difficult for any investment
manager to achieve.
So why, then, were the judges so critical of the trustees? Possibly because
the fund had increased eight times under NatWest's management; thus, despite
the bank's poor administration, the judges could not find that it was liable
for breach of trust.
The case might not have been the best one to bring before the Court of
Appeal, since the fund had performed reasonably well. But the judges did
feel it was appropriate to warn all professional trustees that, if they were
charging a fee, they should provide a professional service; and that any
trustee which failed to preserve a fund's capital value through incompetence
and idleness might not treated in the same way as the trustee in this case.
The decision is, however, disappointing for both settlors and beneficiaries
who might be left feeling they cannot get redress from the courts for
anything other than a disaster resulting from incompetence and idleness. A
trustee may be judged by absence of default rather than lack of success.
This puts the onus back on settlors and beneficiaries alike to keep an eye
on their trustees' performance.
So what can a settlor do to keep his trustees on their professional toes?
Certainly, if you have not yet set up a trust, there is nothing to stop you
taking advice on how to impose special duties and obligations on trustees.
In addition, you could reserve power in the trust deed, either for yourself
or a third party, to remove the trustees without explanation. (You could
find, however, that trustees would resist these clauses or refuse to be a
trustee at all).
For trusts already in existence, it might not be possible to add such
provisions. If you are a beneficiary, you should first ask your trustees for
information on how they are administering the fund. If you are not happy
with this, you should then remind them of their investment duties.
Only if this fails should you consider removing them, although this could
mean going to the courts - which could be time-consuming and costly. Even
then, success is not guaranteed.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The cracks begin to show - Investing
in . . . Italy - A market for the risk-takers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF ART mirrors life, then the news last week that the Colosseum in Rome is
beginning to fall apart is an apt metaphor for the political and economic
problems afflicting Italy.
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro has only this week been able to appoint a
prime minister by asking Giuliano Amato, deputy leader of the Socialist
party, to form Italy's 51st government since the war.
This is a full two months after the latest elections in which a resounding
vote of no-confidence was given to the ruling Christian Democrat-Socialist
alliance.
Italy has been leaderless at a time when important decisions are needed and
constitutional reform is on the agenda.
The frustration was made clear by Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, governor of the Bank
of Italy, when he called earlier this month for the urgent introduction of
an austerity package to tackle the country's deteriorating economy.
Sentiment has not been helped by the brutal assassination last month of
Giovanni Falcone, Italy's leading anti-Mafia magistrate, and revelations
about a municipal corruption scandal in Milan.
These uncertainties depressed the stock market, until the news that the
appointment of a new prime minister was imminent caused a short-lived rally.
The market started its downward slide almost exactly a year ago. The BCI
index at June 4 was 10 per cent below its February high for the year
according to JP Morgan and has underperformed the FT-A Europe index since
then by 15 per cent. Most investors are underweight in Italian equities and
JP Morgan recommends them to stay that way.
Should Italy be left well alone until it sorts itself out? Or is this a low
point representing a good buying opportunity for brave investors?
There are certainly plenty of negatives. The main problem worrying fund
managers is the growing size of Italy's budget deficit. Dino Fuschillo, of
the fund management team for the Lazard European Growth unit trust,
estimates this at L160,000bn-185,000bn for 1992, or around 11 per cent of
gross domestic product.
This compares with 4 per cent in Germany, 1.5 per cent in France and 4 per
cent in Spain. Yet, if Italy is to meet the convergence timetable set by the
Maastricht treaty, it will have to reduce the figure to 3 per cent by the
end of 1996.
Total public debt - more than 100 per cent of GDP - and retail price
inflation of around 6 per cent also distance Italy increasingly from its
main EC partners.
'Italy has to face up to a whole range of problems which, in the short term,
it cannot do,' says Stephen White, fund manager of Foreign &amp; Colonial's
Eurotrust.
For this reason, he has taken the Italian weighting in the fund down to 3
per cent - the lowest since June 1986, when it reached a high of 9 per cent.
Apart from inflation and the budget deficit, White points also to the
increasing industrial competition being faced from neighbours such as France
and Germany.
'Italy is locked into a fixed exchange rate. But its costs are rising in
D-mark terms, and companies like Fiat are suffering because they used to be
in a protected market,' he says.
Yet, the Italian situation is paradoxical. The wealth of its private sector
is in stark contrast to the poverty of the public sector, but its economy
remains the world's fifth-largest and is ahead of the UK's.
It is the second-biggest producer of capital goods in Europe after Germany,
and a 2 per cent growth in real GNP in 1990 was higher than the US and the
UK.
There are some signs of an official determination to confront the economic
problems. In January, the government imposed a six-month freeze on capital
spending projects to hold down the public sector deficit; the caretaker
administration extended this by three months.
Some fund managers see potential for a turnround. 'There is no law that says
Italy always has to be in a mess,' says David Sachon, managing director of
Hill Samuel unit trusts.
'There is potential for significant returns over 12 months because wage
inflation has been brought under control, which is allowing the economy more
space.'
Sachon believes the government recognises that it will have to tackle the
economic problems seriously if Italy is to play a full part in Europe.
The Italy weighting in Hill Samuel's European unit trust is 8 per cent,
which is greater than in most other collective funds investing in Europe.
Sachon says there are no plans to increase it because of the risk of
continuing political instability. But he regards the Italian market as a
stock-picking opportunity rather than one in which to spread assets.
'The private investor should think of Italy as a small part of his portfolio
and identify reputable companies with a solid basis,' Sachon notes. These
include Eridania, an agro-industrial company, responsible for the
improvement in the operating results of Montedison, the Italian chemical and
agribusiness concern.
The Italian market is certainly cheap in price to cash flow terms of 2.8
compared with 6.6 for France, 5.8 for Germany and 5.8 for West Europe,
excluding the UK which is 10.0.
'You can pick up 15-20 stocks at low levels but you have to be selective,'
says Francesco Ricciuli, Italian equity market analyst at Paribas.
He favours Sirte, Stet and Italcapel in the telecoms sector; Sai and Ras in
the insurance market; Sme in food; Credito Italiano and Banco Lariano in the
banking sector; and Teleco Cavi, the equipment manufacturer.
Trading volume, though volatile, has been generally thin and it is unclear
where the demand for a stream of new issues due on the market is to come
from.
The potential for volatility means that the opportunities that might exist
in Italy still are reserved very much for risk-takers.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Nerves begin to surface - The latest
flotations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE unexpected news that GPA, the aircraft leasing company, was pulling its
global flotation this week gave many private investors a fright. Should they
still be keen to buy shares in the companies that are coming to the market?
Almost a dozen flotations are planned by the end of the year, the first such
rush since the 1987 crash.
The issues scheduled for this month are from Country Casuals, the ladies
wear retailer, Kenwood Appliances, the kitchen appliance maker, the Daily
Telegraph newspaper, Anglian Window, which makes double-glazing, and Taunton
Cider.
Two large flotations are due in July, from MFI, the furniture retailer and
Wellcome, the pharmaceuticals company, which hopes to raise Pounds
2bn-Pounds 4bn.
These issues are very different from the privatisation stocks which most UK
shareholders own. Most are aimed at institutions, with Country Casuals as a
stock market placing.
The privatisations had a simple application process and were priced
attractively as part of the government drive to promote wider share
ownership among the British public.
But this is not the case with the planned flotations. David Jones, chairman
of Sharelink, the execution-only sharedealing service, which was set up with
backing from BT for its privatisation issue, says: 'Many of the new issues
are not being structured in a way that makes it easy for private investors
to get involved.'
The companies will have to get the best price possible without overpricing
the issue so that the market falls after dealing begins.
Take advice from a stockbroker before deciding whether to buy. The small
print on the two biggest offers imminent, from Wellcome and MFI, goes as
follows:
Wellcome. The Wellcome Foundation, which owns more than 73 per cent of
Wellcome, is reducing its holding. Wellcome was originally floated in 1986
at Pounds 1.20 a share and these now trade at around Pounds 9.45. The shares
may be offered at a discount to the market price. Investors who buy through
the public offer will not have to pay stamp duty or commission; they can
register now and apply for shares from July 6.
The minimum investment is Pounds 1,000. Shares can be put into a personal
equity plan within 42 days of the issue - any longer and they will have to
be sold and bought back. Reyker Securities, the Share Centre and Sharelink
are offering to 'pep' the shares at low cost. Reyker charges a fee of Pounds
40 for a Pounds 6,000 general Pep and a 1 per cent annual mangement fee from
the 1993 tax year. Charges at the Share Centre are a flat fee of Pounds 50
and at Sharelink, a 0.75 per cent annual administration fee subject to a
Pounds 20 minimum.
Wellcome has prepared a guide to the share offer obtainable from the Share
Information Office on 081 944 1242. Its prospectus is due to be published on
25 June.
MFI. The furniture retailer's name gives it an inherent advantage in its
appeal to private investors. In 1987, it was the subject of the largest
management buyout then seen after a merger with Asda, the food retailer,
which owns 25 per cent of the company.
The minimum application in this case is Pounds 2,250. The price of shares
will be announced on July 2, with dealing starting on July 17. Once again,
stamp duty and commission do not have to be paid on purchase of the shares,
which can be 'pepped.'

FT  20 JUN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Insurers curb independents -
Commission is being paid even if unwanted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSURANCE companies are blocking the way for fee-charging independent advice
by paying commission to intermediaries even if they do not want it. A survey
published this week by London adviser Blyth McKenna showed that only two
life offices out of 28 - Eagle Star and Scottish Widows - offered total
flexibility by allowing full or partial surrender of both initial and
renewal commission on endowment policies. Half the companies contacted had
no facilities at all for commission sacrifice - come what may, they will pay
it.
Intermediaries can always pass the commission they receive straight to their
customers. But if this happens, the customer has to pay income tax on the
refunded commission, as it was meant originally as income for the
intermediary. In any case, it would be more appropriate to use the money to
enhance the investment; if the investor is prepared to part with it, it
might as well be used to invest for profit in a relatively tax-efficient
way.
The companies which did not offer any opportunity to enhance with-profits
policies by re-investing commission were National Mutual, Provident Mutual,
Scottish Equitable, Commercial Union, General Accident, Guardian Royal
Exchange, Royal Life and Scottish Mutual. For unit-linked policies, the
companies which would not allow any rebate were Scottish Amicable, Scottish
Equitable, Abbey Life, Albany Life, Allied Dunbar, Commercial Union, General
Accident, the Life Association of Scotland, Royal Life, Skandia Life and Sun
Alliance.
Most of these offices pointed out that pension policies were much more
flexible, typically with a range of commission re-investment options.
Endowments remain inflexible.
The insurers' replies to Blyth McKenna show a wide range of attitudes.
Standard Life sent a seven-page letter detailing the effects of re-investing
commission, while Scottish Life provided five pages of notes on how returns
could be increased by giving up all or part of a commission.
Others were less helpful. Allied Dunbar said: 'You will appreciate that as
we receive very few requests to provide this facility, we are unable to
comply with your request at this moment in time.' Provident Mutual explained
its approach by saying: 'This, I suspect, arises from the fact that there
has in the past been little or no demand for such contracts from the
independent intermediary market.'
Re-investing commission can make a big difference - for example, Clerical
Medical increases the sum assured on a 25-year policy by 7 per cent if the
adviser gives up all his initial commission. There will, of course, be a fee
to pay on top, but enhancement is likely to be better - over 25 years, the
increased sum within the insurance policy has a good chance of snow-balling
into a significant sum.
Ian McKenna, of Blyth McKenna, says: 'Many independents are keen to see us
move quickly away from the commission system. I believe we are ready. It is
the insurers who are standing in the way.'
Not all brokers are as happy about fee-charging advice as he is. But his
argument that insurers should be forced to offer intermediaries the
opportunity to waive their commission has some merit, as it would remove one
of the greatest obstacles to a system of fee-charging independent advice in
the UK.
James Clancy, a fee-charging adviser based in Northumberland, also suggests
that advisers should lobby with insurance companies for more flexibility.
Ultimately, the insurers' responses suggest that more consumers asking to
pay by fee could also have a big impact.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Deadline for BT payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 1.8m partly-paid British Telecom shareholders will have received their
call notices this week for payment of the second instalment of the stock by
July 7, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu. However, the Treasury says cheques
must be received by Lloyds Bank, the issue registrar, by Thursday July 2 to
be cleared.
The second instalment will cost 120p per share but around 630,000
shareholders qualifying for the instalment discount, will only need to pay
105p per share on the first 1,000 shares.
If you miss the deadline, you could lose your shares as well as entitlements
to special incentives such as instalment discounts or bonus shares. However,
the Treasury says it may pay a refund of a maximum of 110p per share.
Shareholders could receive less if the Treasury makes a loss once it deducts
selling and administrative costs from the price obtained for the shares.
A number of special deals on the sale of BT partly-paid shares are being
offered by some of the government-nominated share shops. Norwich and
Peterborough is cutting its minimum commission to Pounds 15 on sales.
Barclays Bank's commission rate is 2 per cent subject to a minimum of Pounds
15 and this charge will cover a further three members of the family.
Bank of Scotland's charges are 1.5 per cent commission with a minimum of
Pounds 15 for postal dealings and Pounds 20 for telephone dealings.
The Share Centre (0442- 890800) is also offering a competitive deal. The
selling commission is 1 per cent, subject to a Pounds 10 minimum.
Brokers Dunbar Boyle &amp; Kingsley (071-247-8898) will sell for a 1.5 per cent
commission or a Pounds 15 minimum. This single charge will cover up to 10
investors. The offer ends at close of business on June 23.
Lloyds Bank has set up a helpline for BT shareholders. The number is
0903-503733.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: TSB back in black - The Week Ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TSB, the sixth largest UK banking group, is forecast to make a return to
profits when it announces its half year results on Thursday.
A year ago, TSB dismayed the markets by unveiling pre-tax losses of Pounds
150m after Hill Samuel, the merchant bank bought by the group in 1988, made
a loss of Pounds 319m after bad debt provisions of Pounds 344m.
This time around the news from Hill Samuel is still expected to be fairly
grim, but reduced provisions and improved profits on the retail side should
mean a pre-tax profit for the group of between Pounds 77m and Pounds 100m.
This is still way below the Pounds 175m pre-tax in the first half of 1989,
but the market is more worried about further bad news than hopeful of a
return to good times at TSB.
Airtours, the holiday company, is likely to report an interim pre-tax loss
of Pounds 7.25m on Tuesday, up from a loss of Pounds 6.2m in the comparable
period because of an expansion in the number of holidays on offer.
Traditionally, its first-half is always far weaker than its second. On that
basis, and notwithstanding any collapse of demand or excessive discounting,
the company should make an increased full-year profit of Pounds 36.5m
compared with Pounds 27.5m.
Three more regional electricity companies are expected to announce bumper
profits this week.
On Wednesday, London Electricity should report pre-tax profits of around
Pounds 145.5m, up 41 per cent on last year's pro forma result.
Both Southern Electric and South Wales Electricity results are due on
Thursday. Analysts expect an increase of around 50 per cent from Southern,
giving pre-tax profit of close to Pounds 160m.
South Wales Electricity, the smallest of the 12 companies, is expected to
report a comparatively modest rise of just below 30 per cent, giving pre-tax
profits of just under Pounds 75m.
Three water companies are due to report next week. Wessex Water is likely to
show a 17 per cent increase in fiscal 1992 profits to Pounds 77m on Tuesday.
Yorkshire Water is forecast for a 10 per cent increase to Pounds 125m on
Thursday.
Southern Water is pencilled in for a 14 per cent rise to Pounds 111m on
Friday.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Where to use your cards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU are planning to leave home with your credit cards, you should know
where you can use them. Acceptance varies significantly from country to
country.
If you need money in an emergency, all the major credit cards (Visa and
MasterCard) and cash cards (American Express, Diners Club and Link) offer
you cash withdrawals. Interest accrues just as it does if you use a credit
card in a UK cash dispenser, so they are best regarded as a last resort.
Check before you leave to find if interest dates from the transaction or the
first statement after it. The typical transaction charge for each deal is
1.5 per cent.
A recent survey by Which?, the magazine of the Consumers' Association, found
dispensers were three times more likely to cause problems - either by
rejecting cards or refusing to dispense money - than other transactions
using plastic cards. But their record still was good. Which? found no cases
of cards being swallowed by a foreign machine, and no significant
differences between brands of card.
Cards require a personal identification number (PIN). Many people do not
bother to keep this but issuers can send you a reminder. You should ask for
your PIN a few weeks before you leave, but do not write it down unless you
have to.
Next, check the limit on cash withdrawals for the card; usually, it will be
different from the limit for purchases. Also, it can be wise to take out
card protection insurance, as risks of theft increase when you go abroad.
This should cost less than Pounds 10.
Finally, keep cash receipts - interest can mount up and you need to have
records to check the charges.
Availability is as follows;
American Express has 43,000 automatic teller machines (ATMs) world-wide but
they are concentrated, as you might expect, in the US where there are
28,000. There are 4,500 in Spain, 1,800 in Portugal and 1,500 in France, but
you can probably afford to leave home without the American Express card if
you are going to Greece, where there are only 100 machines, or Germany (50).
Diners Club has access to 40,000 ATMs world-wide, mostly in the US and
Canada. It also has widespread facilities at airports, thanks to a link with
British Airways, and claims greater strength than its rivals in Africa.
MasterCard, generally known as Access in the UK, now has more than 95,000
ATMs. Its main strengths are the US and Europe, where is known as Eurocard.
By the end of this year, it plans to have 10,000 ATMs in Spain, 8,000 in
Germany, 6,000 in France and 3,000 in the Netherlands. It will also have
more than 1,000 outlets in Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Italy and Portugal.
There are, however, none in Luxembourg.
Link, offered by a number of building societies and smaller banks, is
something of a maverick network. Not all Link-offerers in the UK have cards
which can be used internationally. Those which do include Abbey National
Co-operative, Girobank, and the Britannia, Norwich &amp; Peterborough, Portman
and Yorkshire building societies.
Link cards from these companies and a few smaller building societies, as
well as Diners' cards, allow you access to the Plus system of 70,794 ATMs.
Plus is weak in Europe (it has only 3,000 machines, all in Spain), but
better in Latin America (where the 809 machines include 585 in Mexico and
157 in Puerto Rico) and the Asia-Pacific region (where there are 10,622,
including 511 in Australia, 291 in Hong Kong and 262 in Japan).
The cards also come in useful in North America - there are 10,622 ATMs in
Canada and 46,689 in the US.
Visa has the world's largest ATM network: 110,000. These include 15,625 in
Spain, 1,360 in Portugal, 7,160 in France, 1,030 in Italy and 39,885 in the
US. But it has only 536 in Germany, a much weaker position than MasterCard.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Plastic has the edge but don't ditch
paper yet - What you pay for the money you spend abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GREAT British package holiday is now complete. Not only can the
Englishman abroad go to the Costa del Sol and still buy a pint of Watneys
and a portion of fish and chips: he can also put his credit or bank card
into a hole in the wall and withdraw the local currency from it.
The logos of the main plastic card issuers - Visa, MasterCard, Diners Club
and American Express - are ubiquitous. They follow you all around the world.
Increasingly, banks are plugged in to international networks, and plastic
does the work once done by legions of clerks and tellers. But should this be
taken to its logical extension - abandoning paper when making foreign
transactions?
This logic is seductive, but the time has not yet arrived to throw away
paper altogether. Diversification is always desirable. Give yourself access
to as many forms of payment as possible, even if some are less convenient
than others.
Then, there is the issue of cost. The surface simplicity hides two factors
that can mask the true rate you pay: the bank which issued the card, and the
exchange rate.
MasterCard and Visa are just brand names into which banks can plug, setting
their own terms in the process. Some will charge more than others for
foreign currency. The exchange rate is something else. Visa and MasterCard
apply a basic conversion rate - generally regarded as reasonable - which
different issuing banks are free to alter. This allows them effectively to
add extra commission.
This can easily be quantified, but even the banks seem confused. The
Consumers' Association recently asked them for details of commission via
credit cards. The AIB, Amex, Barclays and Northern banks, and the Chelsea
and Leeds Permanent building societies replied unequivocally that they did
not alter the basic exchange rate. Others, including Lloyds, declined to
answer.
The CA found that several banks refused to reveal details of changes to
exchange rates when asked by customers. But others gave the CA the following
information:
Beneficial adds 0.25 per cent in commission via the exchange rate.
Clydesdale adds 0.6 per cent to Visa rates and 1.6 per cent to Access rates.
Halifax adds 1.9 per cent for transactions in Europe and 2.75 per cent for
the rest of the world.
NatWest adds 2.75 per cent to the standard rate.
National &amp; Provincial adds 1.25 per cent.
Royal Bank of Scotland adds 1.75 per cent.
TSB Northern Ireland Bank adds 2.75 per cent.
Ulster Bank adds 2.75 per cent, and;
Yorkshire Bank adds 1.2 per cent in Europe and 0.6 per cent in the rest of
the world.
First Direct and Midland say only that 'the exchange rate will be within 2
per cent of the typical tourist rate as advertised in the UK press.'
Barclays uses its own rate, which it says will be 'within 2 or 3 per cent of
published commercial rates.' All issuers apply the same rate for currency
withdrawals as they do for purchases.
None of these rates is outrageous compared with those available elsewhere,
but they add up when they are placed on top of commissions and high interest
rates for withdrawing currency.
When you are making a purchase, credit cards are much more competitive.
According to the Credit Card Research Group, which is funded by credit
card-issuers, the cost of Dollars 100 on June 1 this year would have been
Pounds 56.21 via a credit card, Pounds 58.15 for cash, and Pounds 58.83 by
travellers' cheque. These figures take the average of CCRG members' credit
card rates plus the average of five high street foreign currency rates
(including three clearing banks), and five travellers' cheque rates. For
5,000 pesetas, you would have paid Pounds 28.08 by credit card, Pounds 30.42
for cash and Pounds 31.57 via travellers' cheques.
This helps to explain the verdict reached in a recent issue of Which? which
compared plastic and paper: 'Plastic generally wins for flexibility and
cost, but it's not wise to rely on it completely. In theory, cards should
give you access to cash 24 hours a day, but there can be problems.'
Paper money comes in more forms than the simple travellers' cheque. For
business travellers, Eurocheques have attractions. You pay a stiff annual
fee - from Pounds 4 to Pounds 10 - and there will usually be commission of
around 1.6 per cent on each transaction. But you can then write a cheque in
the local currency, debiting from your normal current account at a standard
retail exchange rate.
You also receive a guarantee card, which can be used to withdraw money from
cash machines - a useful service in Germany where there are 10,650
Eurocheque dispensers compared with 5,449 for Mastercard and 536 for Visa.
The cheapest accounts, according to Which? come from the Northern and Ulster
banks (Pounds 4 annual fee), Clydesdale (Pounds 5) and AIB bank (Pounds 6).
Girobank offers Postcheques, which enable you to draw money from 90,000 post
offices around the world but cannot be used for purchases of goods. A book
of 10 cheques costs Pounds 6, with a limit of two books per year. The
maximum amount you can withdraw varies from Pounds 100 to Pounds 140, and
there is a flat 1 per cent commission on each cheque with no variable
foreign charges. These may be a slightly expensive way of giving yourself a
stop-gap, but they are secure and convenient.
Charges on travellers' cheques vary widely. They have the big advantage of
security, provided both by the ability to provide replacements and the usual
need to produce identification when cashing them. But they are more
cumbersome than credit cards, so it is worth buying a few cheques for low
amounts - Pounds 10 or Pounds 20. If you are in the US, dollar-denominated
cheques change hands as easily as hard cash. Cheques in any other currency
are more or less unusable.
According to Which?, best buys for travellers' cheques come from Britannia,
Halifax, Northern Rock, Portman and Yorkshire building societies, and
Northern Bank, at only 1 per cent commission with no minimum.
Finally, it is worth shopping around for other good deals. The advent of new
payment mechanisms, and the increased willingness of Britons to travel,
particularly to Spain, have brought several innovative products in their
wake. Travelex, an operator of bureaux de change, is allowing customers to
sell back up to 30 per cent of the original amount of their unused currency
or travellers' cheques at the same exchange rate and without paying
commission. This removes the irritation of spending less than you expected
on holiday and getting hammered by the new exchange rate when you return.
All the Great British package holidaymaker needs to do is shop around before
he leaves, and the Watney's he drinks in Benidorm could be so much cheaper .

FT  20 JUN 92 / Markets: At the core of BET's problems - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BET, the business services company, used to have one of the catchier
corporate advertising slogans; 'You look after the core businesses; we'll
take care of the chore businesses.'
After buying more than 150 businesses in five years, it is difficult to see
what BET's core is. In spite of 1991 results published on Monday, which
demonstrated laudable progress, John Clark, chief executive since April last
year, still has more than a little house-cleaning to do.
Eighteen months ago, BET was a company in deep trouble. Expansion under the
chairmanship of Nicholas Wills, the son of the previous chairman, had led to
a Pounds 163m outflow of cash in the first six months of 1981 after five
years of acquisitions.
This expansion had taken BET into interests as diverse as road haulage,
cleaning services, engineering, television, publishing, joinery and plant
hire.
The company had also concentrated heavily in the UK, which was moving into
the worst recession for at least a decade.
The business had spiralled so far out of control - or had been swept along
in the general 1980s euphoria - that last year was the first time since 1986
that BET generated any cash.
The year ending March 1992 will go down as a turning point. Granted, pre-tax
profits fell from Pounds 217m to Pounds 18.5m, after a series of exceptional
costs relating to asset right downs and business closures, on sales down 11
per cent at Pounds 2.34bn. And the dividend was more than cut in half to
6.5p, a level the company is unlikely to be able to lift again for some
time.
But the company has removed Pounds 62m of costs and started the very
necessary process of trimming the number of operating companies, including
selling at a very full price its Biffa waste management company to Severn
Trent.
Most encouraging, however, was the very strong cash flow, which allowed debt
to be reduced from Pounds 425m to Pounds 107m, and led Clark to hope the
company would be ungeared by the end of this year.
Although Clark's new management has brought BET to this turning point, he
admits that there are two more years of work to return the company to a
growth path.
Looming largest is the not insignificant chore of dealing with Dollars 500m
of auction market preferred shares, a hybrid form of equity and debt that
effectively raises BET's gearing to over 300 per cent.
Some analysts believe that even if BET were to continue its impressive cash
generation the company would do little more than nibble at the edges of the
AMPS debt without a large disposal or even a rights issue.
There is even talk that Boulton &amp; Paul, the loss making joinery business may
have to be sold.
BET will also have to finance higher levels of working capital when recovery
arrives and it will have to resume a more realistic capital spending
programme.
Normally, a business's depreciation would be higher than capital
expenditure, if it is growing, or at least at the same level if capital
stock was being properly maintained. Last year, however, BET spent, after
disposals, less than 20 per cent of its depreciation charge on capital
expenditure.
Given that Clark now has the right management team, augmented by Bob
Mackenzie, a former Hanson executive, as finance director, shareholders at
least stand a chance of seeing their company make the transition from a
financial holding company to an operating company.
But investors will have to be patient. With the possibility of the company
seeking to refinance its AMPS with a rights issue - as ECC, the china clay
company, did in February - they may also need to have deep pockets.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Markets: Perot's campaign upsets the Apple cart - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Vice President was in town this week on his annual bash-the-Big-Apple
campaign, but it was that other giant of contemporary politics, Ross Perot,
who ended up doing the most damage to New York's sense of well-being.
Such is the would-be-president Perot's current stature, it was nothing he
did or said that put the collywobbles up the stock market this week, but
what he might do in the autumn elections that troubled Wall Street the most.
In the space of three days the Dow Jones index dropped 80 points, or 2.4 per
cent, in part because of the wildly uncertain political climate that Perot
has done so much to create. While there were plenty of other factors behind
the decline in prices - of which, more later - this week was the first time
that Perot was widely mentioned as a market-moving influence.
It is difficult at the moment to come up with any hard reasons why investors
should fear Perot, either as candidate or as President. He has said precious
little about what he might do if elected, and the usual platitudes about
getting America back on its feet have hardly added up to an economic policy
deserving of Wall Street's scrutiny.
Yet his unsettling presence on the political scene, and the trouble he has
been giving the Bush White House, have undermined the market's confidence in
its ability to correctly gauge the political future. Perot's apparent
popularity - several recent polls showed that he would take California from
Bush and Clinton if an election were held now - has forced investors to
re-evaluate their long-held yet increasingly shaky forecast that George Bush
will win the election this November.
After all, Bush's successful re-election was priced into equities as far
back as the Gulf War, when the master of the New World Order was riding high
in the polls with 80 per cent-plus approval ratings. Only now, with Bush
down at 35 per cent in the approval ratings, are investors realising that it
may be time to give back some of that generous discount.
Even Perot in one of his hyper-confident moods, however, cannot claim all
the credit for the market's decline this week. The entrails of the US
economy continue to provide uninspiring reading. On the bright side, housing
starts jumped 11 per cent in May, the biggest rise in more than a year.
On the darker side, however, there was a puny 0.6 per cent increase in May
industrial production, a smaller-than-expected 2,000 drop in weekly jobless
claims, and a widening in the monthly trade deficit, which rose from Dollars
5.6bn in March to Dollars 7bn in April.
The trade numbers were especially worrying in that they suggested second
quarter real gross domestic product growth will probably not break 2 per
cent as expected, and will certainly come in below the 2.4 per cent growth
achieved in the first three months of the year.
The strength of overseas demand for US-made goods has been one of the few
bright spots during the past year. The biggest of the foreign economies,
however, are now either contracting or stagnating. Over the short-term they
cannot be expected to provide much additional momentum to the domestic US
recovery, although the recent weakness in the dollar (down 6 per cent
against the D-Mark and more than 5 per cent against the Yen in the past six
weeks) may provide some compensation.
If the economic outlook offers investors little cause for celebration, US
monetary policy is likely to be equally unaccommodating. Wednesday's release
of the Federal Reserve's 'Beige Book', its report on nationwide business
conditions, offered only frustration for policy watchers.
The picture the book painted of the economy lived up to the bland colour of
its cover: neither bullish enough to suggest corporate earnings might pick
up sharper than expected, nor bearish enough to suggest the Fed might be
prompted into another interest rate cut.
If interest rates are staying where they are, if the recovery remains
lethargic, and if the billionaire Texan continues to muddy the political
waters, then the stock market could be in for a long, hot summer.
But one the market's hottest stocks of the past year, Telefonos de Mexico,
ran into some heavy selling this week following sharp declines in its home
market. That man Perot was again partly to blame, say analysts. His
protectionist tendencies have cast a cloud over the future of the North
American Free Trade Agreement, which Mexican investors believe is so vital
to their country's economic future.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Markets: It's nicer to stay in bed - London Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR MUCH of the week, investors must have wished they had imitated Pandora
Maxwell's brisk way with early-morning callers. If only they had stayed in
bed, everything would have been fine. It's getting up that causes the
world's problems.
On the other hand, there are sometimes unforeseen consequences of drawing
the duvet firmly over your head. Take the GPA flotation, for example. When
that nice Tony Ryan came knocking at the door, offering stock in his
aircraft leasing company, the UK's investment community rolled over in bed
mumbling: 'Wake me when it's over.' So did everybody else in the known
investing universe, except the retail customers of Nomura in Japan.
Judging, wisely, that 10,000 Osaka housewives were unlikely to prove a
stable capital base, the company pulled the flotation in the early hours of
Thursday morning - at about the time, curiously enough, as the TV crews
clambered into their Range Rovers and set off for their dawn vigil outside
the Maxwells'.
At this point, Pandora Maxwell was not the only one to feel a cold chill
creeping in under the bedclothes. GPA itself was a bit of a special case: a
giant company based in a small economy, market leader of a business that is
viewed generally as the financial equivalent of heavier-than-air flight. (Do
you really understand how a jumbo stays up? Well, neither do I; and that
goes for aircraft leasing, too).
But no matter how special GPA was, the failure of its flotation was bound to
send ripples through the market. In Thursday's trading, it is hard to
disentangle the impact of the GPA announcement from the after-effects of
falling share prices in New York and Tokyo, factors which themselves
contributed to GPA's decision. Nonetheless, GPA certainly contributed to
Thursday's 35.7-point drop in the FT-SE 100 index.
And its impact will linger. A string of other issues - most importantly, the
sale of a big chunk of the stock in Wellcome, the drugs company - hang over
the market. Although shares bounced back on Friday, investors are likely to
be jumpy until the Wellcome sale is safely out of the way in mid-July.
They have a lot to be jumpy about. The chart alongside shows what has
happened to the FT-Actuaries All-Share index over the past five years:
nothing.
On July 16 1987, the peak of the 1980s' bull market, the All-Share closed at
1238.57. On Thursday, it closed at 1,238.10. If you had owned a
representative portfolio of shares worth Pounds 50,000, you could have sold
them in the summer of 1987, bought them back again this week, and still had
enough change for a pint of beer and a packet of crisps.
You can come to two conclusions about the market's inability to stay above
the 1987 peak for long. The first is that the last leg of the 1980s' bull
market was an aberration, an unsustainable leap into the stratosphere which
should be ignored when you plot a steady trend of long-term growth for
equity values.
The second, less comforting, is that things have changed: UK equities cannot
clamber back above their 1987 levels because, for the foreseeable future,
the domestic economy is trapped in a tunnel of slow economic growth and low
returns.
On the first view, UK equities may be going nowhere for the moment, but that
is purely a temporary phenomenon: the only thing holding them back is high
German interest rates and, when the markets start to expect a decline there
early next year, equities will take off again.
Coming from one of Britain's top fund managers, that view sounded plausible
enough this week. There is only one snag: it is exactly the same case he was
making at the turn of the year, when he was expecting German interest rates
to come down in the spring of 1992.
That date has now slipped a year. If it slips much more, the debate over
whether we are in a normal pattern (slightly delayed) or in some new
unpleasant phase becomes simply one of nomenclature: the substance is the
same.
Support for this thesis came from economic and corporate announcements this
week. Retail sales volume, seasonally adjusted, rose by only 0.3 per cent in
May; averaged out over that month and the two before, sales were 0.1 per
cent lower than in the previous three months. Manufacturing output in April
rose 0.3 per cent, continuing an upward trend that began in February.
Recovery from recession clearly is proving slow and painful. On Thursday,
ICI warned analysts that signs of an upturn it had noticed in UK demand
during late March and early April had petered out. 'We can only hope rather
than expect an economic upturn to help us in the second half of the year,'
said Ronnie Hampel, ICI's chief operating officer.
All this could be seen as evidence that, clamped in the European Monetary
System - a vice that became a bit more robust this week as Irish voters said
yes to the Maastricht treaty - the UK has no choice but to come to terms
with German or French standards of economic competitiveness.
Of course, if you believe, like that fund manager quoted earlier, that the
UK's big manufacturing companies have been through their restructuring and
are now fully competitive with their international rivals, then you have
reasonable grounds for thinking that the present economic unpleasantness
will soon be over. On the other hand, Monday's trade figures showed a 25 per
cent rise in import penetration since the trough of the last recession.
Looking at those numbers, you might conclude that the problems are
deep-seated ones of training, finance, and industrial structure.
On this, more pessimistic view, UK equities will really break away from 1987
levels only when the economy as a whole is more competitive. While we wait,
I think I'll slip back to bed for just a few minutes more . . .

FT  20 JUN 92 / Markets: Smaller companies slump again - At A Glance

Small companies endured another bad week. The Hoare Govett index (capital
gains version) fell 3.27 per cent from 1272.1 to 1231.81 over the seven days
to June 18. County NatWest's smaller companies index fell 3.1 per cent to

on May 26 and added: 'Patience among institutional investors is wearing
understandably thin. Too much should not be made of this fact, but it is not
the stuff of which bull markets are made.'

FT  20 JUN 92 / Markets: Fixed rate mortgage offer - At A Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
National &amp; Provincial building society launched two fixed rate mortgages
this week. The rates are fixed at 9.85 per cent until June 1994 or 9.95 per
cent until June 1995. The 9.85 per cent rate will apply to loans up to 85
per cent of the value of the home for both years, while the 9.95 per cent
rate applies on loans between 85 and 95 per cent.
These rates are dependent on building and contents insurance being taken out
with N&amp;P. There is a Pounds 150 arrangement fee for the 1994 option and
Pounds 200 for those taking the fixed rate to 1995.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Markets: Fines warning for directors - At A Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Directors of British companies will be liable for penalties of up to Pounds
5,000 if they do not file their accounts on time. The deadline is July 1.
Companies' House, an executive agency of the Department of Trade and
Industry, says that the level of the fine depends on whether the company is
public or private, and how late documents have been filed. Public companies
have seven months to file and private companies ten months.
Directors of companies which refuse to file documents can be taken to court
and prosecuted. Those which file late and do not pay the penalties swiftly
will be passed on to a private debt collector.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Markets: Thailand finds favour - At A Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Thailand market seems to be back in favour with international fund
managers, despite its record of extreme volatility. Its latest sharp upward
movement follows the reappointment of Anand Panyarachun as premier last
week. Although he is only regarded as a caretaker, this did much to soothe
market worries following the two-month political crisis which culminated in
the shooting of 49 pro-democracy demonstrators in May. Based on economic
fundamentals, the future outlook is promising, according to analysts.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Markets: Profits pale for pharmaceuticals - At A Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK no longer wants to take its medicine, judging by the recent
performance of pharmaceuticals stocks. They outperformed the market strongly
last year, buoyed by the belief that they had strong defensive qualities in
times of uncertainty, but since the election they have underperformed
greatly, as sectors perceived as vulnerable to political risk have
recovered. This week, shares in companies such as Glaxo, SmithKline Beecham
and Wellcome were depressed by a profits warning from Upjohn, the US
pharmaceutical group.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Markets: Cheque law brings banks to account - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PECULIAR anomaly was ended by the Cheques Act, which came into force this
week. Until now, accountholders who crossed their cheques with 'account
payee only' in the belief that this made them non-transferable were wasting
their ink. Their diligence did not have the force of law and cashiers could
ignore the instruction.
Now, however, cheques crossed in this way may be paid into the account of
the named party only. Save &amp; Prosper was the first to issue cheques already
crossed with 'account payee only' last year. It was followed by Nationwide
building society and Lloyds and Yorkshire Banks.
The act started out as a private member's bill sponsored by Conal Gregory,
then MP for York, with the backing of the Consumers' Association. Its main
intention was to protect accountholders from fraud.
The Consumers' Association says few people realised that their cheques could
be intercepted in the post and paid into an account other than the intended
person's with no more than a signature on the back. Fraudsters would not
even have to worry about forging the payee's signature accurately since the
bank into which it was paid would not have bothered to check its
authenticity.
Under the Cheques Act, any bank that accepts wrongly a crossed cheque for a
third party account is now responsible for the costs of correcting the
error.
This is excellent news for customers. Bank and credit card fraud have been
increasing, partly reflecting the large number of plastic cards and bank
accounts held by the British. According to a study called European Retail
Banking 1992, to be published next week by Datamonitor, the market analyst,
the British have the highest number of accounts in Europe, with 2.4 per
head. And even though 17 per cent of Britons have no bank account, compared
with only 3 per cent in Switzerland, more Britons have a cheque book and
plastic cards than other Europeans.
Unless they have been clearly negligent, it is unfair that individual
customers, rather than banks, should have to bear the cost of bank and
credit card frauds although the balance has been swinging more in favour of
the customer recently. Under the Code of Banking Practice issued at the end
of last year, which sets out minimum standards for the industry, the onus is
now on banks to prove in disputes over card transactions that it was used by
the customer.
Banks must also comply with the wishes of customers who do not wish to use
their cheque cards to draw money from cash machines. In such cases, personal
identification numbers will not be issued so that stolen cards cannot be
used to withdraw cash.
More a declaration of goodwill than a document aimed at setting the world
ablaze, the code should nevertheless improve the quality of services offered
to the customer. For example, banks have said they will no longer pass on
information about their wealthier customers to their insurance and financial
subsidiaries so the clients can be targeted for direct mail advertising.
Now, the banks will need the customer's consent in order to send him junk
mail. These are small steps but they are in the right direction.
Other measures that banks and building societies should take to improve
services would be to streamline tax-exempt special savings accounts (Tessas)
to remove the myriad penalties and bonuses that have made it increasingly
difficult to compare the performance of one Tessa with another.
In a recent report, the Office of Fair Trading expressed concern that Tessas
were the first deposit-based products to have concealed costs in a manner
similar to those on life products. Tessas were meant to be straightforward,
easily-transferable products and the complications that banks and building
societies have brought in go against the spirit of the legislation which
introduced them.
The OFT report also called for changes to the financial limits on
compensation to consumers which, it said, varied 'without rhyme or reason.'
Under the protection scheme for the building societies, savers are entitled
to compensation of 90 per cent of the first Pounds 20,000 in their accounts.
Yet accountholders at banks, which are more liable to collapse than building
societies, are entitled to compensation of only 75 per cent of the first
Pounds 20,000 under the deposit protection scheme. This is an anomaly that
could well do with being remedied.
Because of opposition from the banks, the code did not include a requirement
for them to tell customers in discontinued accounts that these had been
replaced with similar accounts, usually offering better rates. Customers
with 90-day accounts find themselves locked into their old accounts before
being able to switch.
Both the Cheques Act and the Code of Banking Practice were the outcome of
laborious negotiations between consumer groups and the banks. Consumer
pressure will still be needed to ensure that further steps are taken to
improve the services of the banks and building societies.

FT  20 JUN 92 / A long tradition of subtle, ingenious forgery: Two eminent
Victorians were at the centre of a literary plot that was a national
scandal. John Kitching tells the story
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KITCHING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN 1894 a first edition of Elizabeth Barrett Browning sonnets came to light,
having apparently languished unseen for more than 40 years. As a ripple went
through the literary world few realised that it was just part of a complex
mystery, far exceeding - in the judgment of the writer Bernard Levin -
anything conceived by Agatha Christie. And at the centre of the plot were
two eminent Victorians.
Harry Buxton Forman seemed a model of propriety. He was in charge of Packet
Services at the Post Office and an editor of Keats and Shelley. But he was
also a dedicated and skilled literary forger.
Forman did not pursue his dark craft alone. His accomplice was Thomas James
Wise, 17 years his junior, a hard-headed London commodity dealer who
specialised in essential oils. Wise was president of the Bibliographical
Society and was said to have one of the finest private libraries in the
country.
Together they invented a new genre: creative forgery. Book forgers usually
copy great works, but Forman and Wise created books and editions after the
event to fill a persuasive niche. They were perhaps bibliographical rather
than literary forgers. There are similarities with Piltdown Man: a missing
link between man and monkeys is predicted and then conveniently found. The
forgers' extraordinary conspiracy is now described in a new biography by
John Collins*.
For both men, and particularly for Wise, the purpose was serious: to make
money. In the heyday of Victorian capitalism Wise saw a product to corner
the market. And Forman, who wrote of his legitimate literary works: 'My
style of writing is not what turns well to the making of pots of money,'
knew the serious cash lay elsewhere.
Some literary figures suspected Forman and Wise were up to something. But
the two were not finally unmasked until 1934, by which time Forman had been
dead for 17 years.
Forman was born in 1842 in the west country and joined the Post Office in
London in 1860. In his spare time he was a poetry critic and, along with
Trollope, ranks among the Post Office's literary luminaries. He lived in
some comfort in Camberwell, was married to Laura, and knew George Eliot.
Wise came from more humble origins, but was a successful broker and lived in
Islington. For some time he had admired Forman's scholarship from afar, but
it was to be several years before the two met and conspired. Both were
members of the Browning Society: Forman was afounder, and Wise joined in
1882. Both were also to become members of the Shelley Society. A closer
relationship seemed inevitable, and in January 1886 Wise, then 27, was
invited to Forman's house.
By this time, Forman's literary reputation was considerable. He had begun
modestly in 1869 with an article on D G Rossetti published anonymously in
Tinsley's magazine. Slowly but surely his name became part of the literary
scene. In 1871, Tinsley published Forman's first book 'Our Living Poets,'
and 10 years later he took his first steps into forgery. His method then was
to determine the course of the extraordinary forging operation.
Richard Hengist Horne, an eccentric poet and one of the subjects of 'Our
Living Poets', had written in 1867 an odic cantata for the Duke of Edinburgh
called 'Galatea Secunda'. It was never published. In 1881, Forman published
it with a 'Melbourne, 1867' imprint. The first edition imprint, albeit of
false provenance, increased the value considerably. Their subtle game was
afoot.
There is no indication that Horne ever saw the edition: if he did, perhaps
he thought of it as a quaint conceit, suggests Collins in his book. When
Horne died in 1884, Forman was left all Horne's books and papers and
appointed his literary executor. He later sold many of the works, including
Lot 108 which contained 'Galatea Secunda' 'privately published in Melbourne
1867'. He netted Pounds 200, about half his annual salary. He had started to
make money as a forger.
By the time Wise arrived on his doorstep in 1886 Foreman was ready for a
full-scale conspiracy. The idea was immensely seductive to Wise. 'The cost
of 30 or 40 copies of a slim pamphlet might be Pounds 6 or Pounds 7; the
unit cost therefore about 3s 6d or 4s: and one copy could sell for Pounds
100 (about Pounds 1,500 today). This was one of the most attractive
commodities Wise had dealt in.'
Collins suggests that while Wise entered his new role with alacrity, Forman,
though at first helpful, was later dragged kicking and screaming in his
wake. 'But once in the secret he could not get out: Wise had the drop on
him.'
The forging began in earnest, using as a printer Richard Clay of Bread
Street Hill in the City of London. J R Maylett, foreman at Clays, may have
known something was amiss (perhaps he was bribed, suggests Collins) but to
Cecil Clay, managing director, Wise was just another customer.
First a collection of Robert Browning poems was reprinted with a false
imprint giving a date before the poems were written, then some Elizabeth
Barrett Browning sonnets were given the Forman-Wise treatment. A selection
of George Eliot sonnets, first printed in 1874, was reprinted by the forgers
in 1887 bearing an 1869 imprint. Wise added a bogus note of provenance to
many of these works. Tennyson's 'The Last Tournament' was published in 1896
but bore an inscription handwritten by the supposed printer: 'Not more than
20 copies. Strahan - Ludgate Hill, 1871.'
However, at least one bookseller, Bertram Dobell, had doubts. In 1888 he
wrote: 'Shelley Society meeting: Wise is still proceeding on his wild career
of reprinting or pirating Browning.'
By 1890, Swinburne, Ruskin, William Morris, Tennyson and Thackeray had been
subjected to the forgers' treatment. Several fake volumes were sold to the
British Museum.
Perhaps the most celebrated forgery was of Elizabeth Barrett Browning's
so-called 'Reading sonnets'. It was, writes Collins, 'a daring stroke which
showed how high the forgers' confidence was rising. By forging Browning's
sonnets Wise and Forman were tampering with the most celebrated literary
love story of Victorian England.' They published the poems in 1894, bearing
the imprint 'Reading, 1847'.
For more than 40 years it had been believed that the first publication of
the sonnets was in Elizabeth's 'Poems' of 1850. But in March 1894, a note
appeared in an obscure Philadelphia literary journal saying a Browning
rarity had turned up: an 1847 edition of the sonnets. In spite of the
Reading imprint there was no printer's name and nothing to indicate it had
been produced in that town. It had, of course, been designed by Forman and
Wise and printed by Clays in the City.
Yet few eyebrows were being raised at the plethora of pamphlets and books
produced by Forman and Wise. There was to be some minor sniping at the
forgeries from about 1909, but nothing serious.
It was much later, in the 1930s, that the two forgers were unmasked. Their
downfall was brought about by two young booksellers, Graham Pollard and John
Carter. Pollard, a colourful character, claimed to have got an Oxford
half-blue in spitting, achieved by beating Evelyn Waugh over a 10ft
distance. Carter had been a scholar and taken a double First in Classics.
Carter was soon on the case of the Reading sonnets: he knew there was no
copy in Browning's library; no copy in an old binding; and no copy with any
signature inscription or mark of provenance before about 1900. But this was
all negative evidence. It was Pollard who gathered the positive evidence
through research into the chemical history of 19th-century paper. Analysis
of paper from an edition of the sonnets owned by a Flora Livingston showed
it contained a significant proportion of chemical wood pulp: a substance not
used in England until 1874. The book could not have been published in 1847.
Carter tried writing to Wise, but the reply he received was of a vague
general and dismissive nature. But it was the beginning of a dogged process
which was to assume the working title of 'Wise-cracking' and the Reading
sonnets remained the cornerstone of the investigation.
By June 1934, the embattled Wise faced ruin. News placards in the street
read: 'Famous books denounced as forgeries' and 'Faked First Edition
Sensation'. The articles were based on a book by Carter and Pollard with the
gentle, donnish title of 'An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain 19-Century
Pamphlets.' In the book, all paths seemed to lead to Wise's door: but
without absolute proof they couldn't name him as the forger. Carter and
Pollard wrote: 'Mr Wise by his credulity, by his vanity in his own
possessions, by his dogmatism, by abuse of his eminence in the
bibliographical world, has dealt a blow to the prestige of an honourable
science, the repercussions of which will be long and widely felt . . . '
The Daily Herald newspaper despatched a reporter to track down Wise: again
his defence was unconvincing - and he tried to put the blame on Forman.
Three years later, Wise too, was dead.
Wise and Forman are part of a long tradition of literary forgers: Thomas
Chatterton, piler-up of poetry, William Henry Ireland (who as Shakespeare
got his play 'Vortigem' on to the stage - although without success) and John
Payne Collier, Shakespeare's dodgy biographer. Perhaps Bernard Shaw's view
that the whole thing should be treated as a joke is the right one. Did not
the rich book collectors deserve to be humbugged by the forgers? asks
Collins in his book. The fact remains that Wise and Forman acted illegally,
defrauding both buyers and authors.
To the end, Forman, the poetry critic, wrestled with his conscience, as his
literary reputation began to suffer. In contrast, Wise, 'who did not know
the prick of conscience' was defending himself on his deathbed thus: 'I am
an old man with the crematorium facing me . . .' His final words were,
perhaps, an admission that the fraud was too complicated to describe even in
the throes of death.

FT  20 JUN 92 / The Long View: Bonds lead the asset race
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
SO THE Nervous Nineties are proving . . . well, nervous. As the Tokyo stock
market plumbed new lows this week, and New York and London wobbled, those
wonderful 1980s seemed a long way away. Not that it should really come as
any surprise to investors. The extraordinary returns during the 1980s,
especially on equities, could not be sustained. The 1990s had to be
different.
It may seem a little premature to make a statistical assessment of just how
different, but within a few days, believe it or not, we shall be a quarter
of the way through the decade. How are the numbers shaping up?
First, a reminder of the joys of the 1980s. For the UK investor, domestic
equities stood out, returning almost 24 per cent a year on average in
combined income and capital gains to the tax-exempt investor. Overseas
equities returned almost exactly the same. British government bonds lagged a
long way behind at just under 15 per cent - still a good performance in
relation to average annual inflation of 6.9 per cent. Finally, money market
deposits delivered a return of 12 per cent on average.
As at 1992 1/2 the 1990s, however, are shaping up as the decade of bonds. If
you look at sterling bonds there was a reasonable positive return in 1990 at
a time when shares were experiencing their first calendar year decline since
1976; and although UK equities were strong last year - returning 20 per cent
for UK pension funds according to the WM Company, the performance
measurement specialists - the pensions' fund sterling bond portfolios were
almost as successful, returning 18 per cent. So far this year, after the
recent stock market retreat, bonds have their noses in front.
Put all this together and after 2 1/2 years sterling bonds are showing an
annualised return of some 14 per cent, while UK equities have only been able
to manage about 5 per cent, and overseas equities a seriously disappointing
minus 1 per cent or so. Note, however, that money market deposits are
showing strongly with 13 per cent, although fading a little this year.
In fact the past 2 1/2 years have by no means been all bad for equities  -
the All-Share Index showed a rise in the year ended September 1991 of 32 per
cent - but there have been some bad patches too, notably during the worst of
the Gulf crisis.
There are two main motors for share prices. They are buoyant when monetary
factors are positive, notably the money supply is growing fast and interest
rates are falling. They also rise when the company sector is prospering and
is pushing up its profits and dividends strongly. In the classic cycle the
first phase tends to lead to the second, in successive legs of a bull
market.
In recent years, however, these positive factors have been weak. Profits, of
course, have been under pressure in the UK and the US for several years and
are now crumbling in Japan and much of Continental Europe too. True,
interest rates have been falling, especially short-term rates, and this has
pushed up the US stock market in particular. But low interest rates have not
been reinforced by a buoyant money supply. Meanwhile in Tokyo, the deflation
of the extraordinary 1980s bubble continues inexorably. This process has
failed to affect other markets until now, but the stability of the Japanese
financial system is now on the line and Wall Street has itself become
high-priced enough to be vulnerable.
In normal conditions you would expect both bonds and equities to benefit
from an easier money environment in which short-term interest rates were
falling; but equities would benefit more because they are riskier securities
which are more sensitive to economic conditions. Indeed, equities have been
quite volatile at times during the past 2 1/2 years, but overall they have
failed to perform as well as bonds because of lack of support from the
corporate fundamentals. The big broking houses have been energetically
trying to compensate by forecasting big earnings recoveries just around the
corner. Indeed profits may be picking up modestly in the US but in Britain
the evidence is very scanty.
In some respects the recessionary background in the UK has been rather
similar during the past two years to that at the start of the 1980s. But
then, the returns were flattered by high inflation, and the fundamentals
were more attractive, with a dividend yield between 6 and 7 per cent, for
instance, against under 5 per cent at present. Even so, the stock market was
sluggish in the early part of 1982, only to surge later in anticipation of
strong profits recovery in 1983.
Can history repeat itself? British pension fund managers certainly seem to
think that the pattern of asset returns has been anomalous in the 1990s so
far. They have been piling ever more heavily into equities. At the start of
1990 the typical fund, according to the rival measurement service Caps, had
81 per cent in equities, while at March 1992, the latest available date, it
had an 84 per cent exposure. Last year these professional managers were
directing funds with particular enthusiasm into overseas equities,
especially Japanese.
It is hard to change a strategy which has worked for many years. But the
high stock market returns of the 1980s - at any rate the latter years - were
in part the consequence of the growing indebtedness in many leading
economies which not only boosted activity (and therefore profits) but also
at times led to the creation of euphoria and asset price bubbles; GPA would
have been enthusiastically welcomed by the market in 1986 or early 1987, for
instance.
Distortions were building for most of the decade and it would be prudent to
assume it will take much the same time to unwind them. In the meanwhile,
investors who still expect life to be much the same as it was in the
Exceptional Eighties are going to be disappointed by the realities of
Different Decade.

FT  20 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rebounds 3% in
thin trade
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE prices rallied on short-covering ahead of the weekend and on bargain
hunting, and the Nikkei average gained for the first time this week, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index recovered 474.31, or 3 per cent, to 16,519.87, after
setting new lows for the year on Wednesday and Thursday. The Nikkei has lost
5 per cent on the week. The index opened at the day's low of 16,088.52 and
reached the day's high of 16,544.66 just before the close.
Volume fell from 340m shares to 230m. Advances led declines by 759 to 200
with 142 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose
21.63 to 1,267.27 and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index lost 1.59 to 991.69.
Life insurance companies placed buy orders at low prices, and investment
trusts were seen index-linked buying. Market participants, who believed the
Nikkei was oversold relative to the Topix, also bought back shares.
Electrical blue chips, banks and brokers firmed on short-covering ahead of
the weekend.
Sentiment was helped by government announcements of possible economic
support measures prior to the summit of the Group of Seven industrialised
nations next month. Reports that the government was considering a
supplementary budget of Y8,000bn also helped confidence.
Lower interest rates raised hopes of an early credit easing. Short-term
money market rates and bond yields fell on speculation that the weak stock
market would prompt the Bank of Japan to lower the official discount rate.
The improvement in sentiment encouraged professional interest in theme
stocks. Meiji Milk Products, the most active issue of the day, rose Y50 to
Y1,030, while Morinaga Milk advanced Y13 to Y891.
Financials recovered from heavy selling earlier in the week. Nomura
Securities advanced Y40 to Y1,270 and Mitsubishi Bank rose Y40 to Y1,510.
But Daikyo, the condominium builder, fell another Y36 to an all-time low of
Y745. Although Daikyo officials have denied rumours of financial problems,
investors have remained pessimistic about the company's business prospects
because of poor conditions in the real estate market.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 132.85 to 19,276.21 in volume of 16.7m
shares.
Roundup
Some markets in the region improved in line with Tokyo.
HONG KONG recovered most of its early losses as the Hang Seng index closed
down 8.50 at 5,787.60 for a fall of 0.5 per cent on the week. Turnover was
HKDollars 3.04bn.
Utilities and commercial and industrial issues fell but property stocks and
banks bucked the trend. Hongkong Electric lost 30 cents to HKDollars 18.30
while Hong Kong Telecom slipped 5 cents to HKDollars 8.50.
SEOUL strengthened as many securities shares rose to their upper limits. The
composite index gained 7.17 to 571.02, up 0.85 per cent on the week, in
turnover of Won223.2bn.
KUALA LUMPUR was little changed in light trading. The composite index ended
0.08 higher at 596.58, a 1 per cent gain on the week.
TAIWAN continued its downward trend, the weighted index shedding 40.93 to
4,587.85, a 2 per cent fall on the week. Turnover was little changed at
TDollars 28.7bn.
MANILA's composite index lost 5.86 to 1,493.92, for a fall of 5.5 per cent
on the week. Turnover rose to 293m pesos from 184m pesos. PLDT was affected
by the overnight loss in the US and slid 45 pesos to 1,000 pesos.
AUSTRALIA's All Ordinaries index rose 9.0 to 1,633.9, but was 1 per cent
lower on the week. Stocks that had fallen this week on downward revisions of
forecasts recovered slightly. Pacific Dunlop added 9 cents to ADollars 5.16.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week In The Markets): Upbeat
gold market moves higher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CAUTIOUS optimism that has crept into the gold market of late was
underlined this week after the Belgian central bank announced on Wednesday
that it had sold 202 tonnes out of its reserves.
In a bearish market that might have led to the ringing of alarm bells about
the possibility of the move being emulated by other central banks. But in
their present upbeat mood gold traders greeted news that such a large sale,
completed two weeks earlier, had been carried through without disturbing the
price trend as a testimonial to the robustness of the market.
The London bullion market price, which was already showing a gain of Dollars
2.30 a troy ounce on the week to date when the Belgian sale was announce,
edged up 20 cents an ounce on that day and ended the week with an overall
rise of Dollars 3.70 at Dollars 343.55 an ounce.
The earlier rise was attributed to constructive technical factors and signs
that a support area was being established at Dollars 342 an ounce. Some
traders noted, however, that short-covering purchases featured prominently
in the recent rise and questioned whether that constituted a solid basis for
a sustained bull run.
At the London Metal Exchange the main features of the week were Monday's
action to end the tightening squeeze on nearby supplies of zinc and the
consequent reduction in cash premiums.
With the cash premium over metal for delivery in three months having built
up from zero to Dollars 190 a tonne in two and a half months the exchange
stepped in to establish maximum daily premiums for the June/July period
starting at Dollars 15 a tonne and ending at Dollars 5. A cash premium is
normally associated with supply tightness, but the recent widening of the
price gap had coincided with a rapid build-up in the exchange's warehouse
stocks. That build-up accelerated dramatically this week with the stockpile,
which was already at a record level, rising by an unprecedented 47,500
tonnes to 324,800 tonnes. But this came as no surprise to traders who are
expecting even more metal to arrive before the middle of July to feed the
squeeze.
With the prospects of handsome profits for delivering into the squeezed cash
market disappearing holders of long positions have been flooding out of the
market since Monday. By yesterday's close the cash price was quoted at
Dollars 1,301 a tonne, Dollars 146.50 down on the week, and the premium over
three months metal had shrunk to Dollars 103.50 a tonne. Traders said the
market was beginning to reflect its poor fundamental background, which had
been obscured by the squeeze, and suggested that the three months price
might soon test support at Dollars 1,180 a tonne.
Tin was again the strongest LME market as more and more consumers gave up
waiting for a reaction against the recent sustained price rise. After
consolidating last week's gains prices moved to 25-month highs in mid-week
and the three months quotation closed yesterday at Dollars 6,762.50 a tonne,
up Dollars 270 on the week. Some traders expect an early test of resistance
at Dollars 7,000 a tonne for three months tin, but others believe a downside
correction is needed if the market is not to become overbought.
Aluminium prices extended their decline as hopes of broad-based economic
upturn continued to fade. Cash metal lost Dollars 20 on the week at Dollars
1,251 a tonne, the lowest level for four months.
At the London Futures and Options Exchange the slide in coffee and cocoa
prices continued but sugar futures were a little firmer.
The prospect of further producer selling, notably from the Ivory Coast, the
biggest producer, sent the cocoa market to fresh 16 1/2 -year lows in
mid-week, before it ended with a slightly steadier tone. At yesterday's
close September cocoa futures were quoted at Pounds 534 a tonne, Pounds 11
off the low but Pounds 11 down on the week.
Coffee traders, appearing to hold out little hope of significant progress
towards reviving International Coffee Agreement price support at a
producer/consumer meeting in London next week, marked the September futures
price down by Dollars 21 on the week to Dollars 706 a tonne.
Sugar futures rose in line with the New York market, where buyers were
encouraged by constructive chart signals and concern about nearby supply
tightness. But profit-taking set in after the July price breached 11 cents a
lb on Wednesday. London's October position, which reached Dollars 227.20 a
tonne at one point, was quoted at Dollars 221.40 late yesterday, up Dollars
2.40 on the week.

FT  20 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEALERS reported a busy session in the derivative market as both stock index
futures and traded options saw the expiry of June contracts, writes Joel
Kibazo.
The June contract on the FT-SE opened strongly at 2,576, but after a brief
surge went into retreat and soon fell to 2,568 as its expiry at 10.10am
approached, coinciding with the expiry of the FT-SE 100 index option.
Following the expiry of June, the September contract took centre stage and
saw buyers which helped it advance from its 2,641 level at 10.30am.
Profit-taking however caused a retreat in the new contract towards the close
and September finished at 2,627, at a 43-point premium to cash and about 3
points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 40 points.
Volume in September reached over 10,000 contracts. June closed with turnover
of 2,695 contracts.
Traded options were also busy. Turnover reached 35,236 with the FT-SE option
trading 12,314 lots. Bid speculation in Pilkington made it the busiest stock
option and it had recorded a total of 4,218 contracts by the close.

FT  20 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Market ends grim week with a bounce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRICES recovered slightly on the London stock market yesterday following a
grim few days beset by political worries and corporate gloom. Nevertheless,
claims that the market has reached a floor might have shaky foundations; it
appears to be following the old traders adage: 'Sell in May, go away, come
back on St Leger Day'.
Initial impetus for a bounce, yesterday, was provided by the Japanese Nikkei
index, which rose by 474 after hitting a five-and-a-half-year low on worries
about the state of the economy.
The Nikkei's improvement enabled London to shrug off Thursday's weak close
on Wall Street and prices were marked up by 12 points at the opening ahead
of the expiry of Footsie futures and options at 10.10am.
After this technical situation was out of the way, it was confirmed that
Ireland had chosen resoundingly to accept the Maastricht Treaty on European
Union. Concerns about the way Ireland would vote had been overhanging the
market and, on the news, the Footsie sprang ahead by another 10 points,
prompted by the first genuine buying of the day.
In the afternoon, the Dow opened some 13 points ahead and gave a further
prop to the Footsie which closed 22.1 up at 2,584.8. Turnover was boosted by
three programme trades, speculation that a bidder was sniffing around
glassmaker Pilkington and active dealing among banking stocks. However, the
closing volume was 440.6m shares, compared with 517.9m on Thursday,
suggesting that the level of genuine retail business would be below
Thursday's Pounds 1.03bn.
The market had managed to shrug off the effect of poor performances in Tokyo
and Wall Street and the decision by the aviation leasing group GPA to
abandon its planned share flotation. In fact, traders appreciated that the
cash reserved for the GPA offer would now be looking for another home.
One piece of bad news the market was unable to ignore was Thursday's
statement by ICI that signs of an upturn had petered out. SG Warburg
Securities summed up the view of many when it commented; 'The prospect of a
summer which might well be marked by a steady drizzle of earning downgrades
suggests that even if the market is near the bottom any rebound may be slow
and hesitant.' The feeling was that although the Footsie might be
undervalued, institutional buyers were cherry picking on selected stocks
rather than buying the market. If that continues to be the case, London
could stall for some time.
Customer, or retail turnover in equities languished as buyers waited on the
sidelines until Ireland had voted on the Maastricht treaty.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: D-Mark firm despite Emu vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTRARY to the market's expectations, the D-Mark remained firm against most
European currencies yesterday as the Irish people issued a resounding 'Yes'
in their referendum on European union, writes James Blitz.
Ever since the Danes rejected European union in their referendum earlier
this month, the German currency has made headway on fears that the
Maastricht treaty would dissolve. Analysts had expected that the D-Mark
would give up some of those gains if Ireland calmed nerves by supporting the
treaty. But the early indications yesterday were otherwise. Sterling closed
unchanged against the D-Mark at DM2.9200; the Spanish peseta was only
marginally stronger against the German currency at Pta62.81 from a previous
close of Pta62.98; the Italian lira, which badly needed a boost after a week
of solid intervention by the Bank of Italy on its behalf, made up only a
little of the ground it has lost. It closed at 756.8 to the D-Mark from a
previous close of 758.6.
The question on many lips last night was: where does Europe go from here?
The next headline event is the French referendum on Maastricht, due to take
place in September. Until then, traders will ponder three possible outcomes:
that Maastricht collapses, that eleven of the twelve EC states go ahead with
Emu or that there will be a two-speed Europe in which some states unite
their currencies and others do not. In any event, Mr Gerard Lyons, chief
economist at DKB International in London, is a D-Mark bull: 'You will have a
background in which the German currency remains stable and nothing will
change that over the next week or so.'
Trading in the US dollar remained sluggish yesterday. The Philadelphia
Federal Reserve survey was disappointing, showing a slower growth rate in
manufacturing in June. The currency was also unable to keep any of its gains
against the D-Mark, even though the Irish vote unwound a few long D-Mark
positions. "Dollar sentiment is so sour that people automatically look to
sell every rally," said a US bank trader. "And they're waiting less and less
time before taking the profits as well.' The US currency ended marginally
up, but still at the bottom of its ranges for the week, at DM1.5700 from a
previous close of DM1.5650.
The Japanese yen slipped fractionally against the D-Mark, still injured by
the fall in the Japanese stock market the previous day. The 225-share Nikkei
average showed signs of consolidating around the 16,000 level yesterday, but
the D-Mark was still up at Y80.82 from a previous close of Y80.99. A big
test of the yen's strength comes next week, when the latest Japanese money
supply figures are due.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Money Markets: Rates unchanged
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PERIOD rates in the sterling cash market were largely unchanged yesterday,
even though the large Pounds 1.2bn shortage forecast by the Bank of England
was mostly removed in the morning.
As often happens on a Friday, players in the discount market mustered paper
in the morning to push the overnight rate down as far as possible over the
weekend. The overnight rate went down to a low of 8 per cent. But at the end
of the day, period rates firmed up as the overnight ended at around 10 3/8
per cent.
One week money again ended at 10 1/8 per cent, 1-month was marginally softer
at 10 1/32 per cent and 3-month money, often seen as the most important
indicator of market sentiment, again ended on 10 per cent, in line with UK
bank base rates.
Most of the shortage in the market was removed by lunchtime, with the Bank
of England again dealing at the established rates of 9 7/8 per cent for
Bands 1 and 2, 9 21/32 per cent for Band 3 bills and 9 15/16 per cent for
the repurchase agreements (repos).
The Bank purchased Pounds 519m of Band 1 bank bills, Pounds 146m of Band 2
bank bills, Pounds 142m of Band 3 bills, and Pounds 200m for resale to the
market in equal amounts on 8 and 9 July. The forecast was later revised to a
shortage of around Pounds 1.3bn. In the afternoon, the Bank purchased Pounds
141m of Band 1 bank bills and provided late assistance of Pounds 70m.
Trade in sterling futures reflected the bullishness in the cash markets
during the morning. The bulls were partly spurred on by the news from Dublin
that the Irish people had voted an overwhelming 'Yes' in the Maastricht
treaty on European Monetary Union (Emu). In the morning, the September short
sterling contract rose 4 ticks from its opening levels to a high of 90.28.
It later drifted back down again to close at 90.25. The December contract
plotted a similar trajectory, rising 3 ticks to a high of 90.56 but dropping
back to a close of 90.51.
Despite the encouraging news from Dublin for sterling, the market is still
expecting next week to be expensive for money. The second quarter draws to
an end, and banks face short term liquidity problems. Next week's gilt
auction of Pounds 2.75bn, will also drain the market of liquidity.

rights issue

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARES-SERONO, the Swiss pharmaceuticals group which specialises in human
fertility drugs, is raising SFr51.4m (Dollars 36.1m) through a one-for-six
rights issue to bearer shareholders and a conversion offer to registered
shareholders.
The group, 86 per cent controlled by the Bertarelli family, then plans to
split both classes of shares on a one for five basis.
The capital restructuring, similar in many respects to those carried out
recently by other Swiss companies, has been criticised in some quarters
because it will result in a dilution of the value of the bearer shares.
This is because the conversion of some of the Bertarelli family held
registered shares to bearer shares will be carried out at the difference in
their par values, SFr150 per share, which is well below the difference in
their market values.
Mr Hans Thierstein, finance director, pointed out that this option was set
when the family floated shares in the company on the stock market in 1987.
He also noted that the family had waived its right to participate in the
proposed one-for-six rights issue at par.

FT  20 JUN 92 / International Company News: Business ticking along just
nicely at SMH - The rapid progress still being made by the top Swiss
watchmaker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you believe in companies living through cycles, then you could wonder if
SMH, the Swiss watch group that developed the phenomenally successful
Swatch, is at or nearing its peak.
Some telltale signs of hubris were in evidence at this week's annual press
conference at the group's Longines subsidiary in the Jura mountains.
On tables at the entrance to the conference room were copies of a study by
an investment research organisation describing SMH as the best-managed large
company in Switzerland.
Nicolas Hayek, the expansive chairman, revealed that 50 securities companies
in the UK, Germany and Switzerland had published studies of the group, and
he estimated that the finance director and his team were now spending 30 per
cent of their time fielding queries from investment analysts.
To judge by the Swiss and international media, Mr Hayek himself spends a
good deal of his time in interviews as well. He has also become more visible
lately in support of worthy causes. He participated in the preparatory
meetings at the United Nations for the Earth Summit in March and launched a
summit commemorative model Swatch.
By now, the SMH-Hayek success story is a familiar one. The Swiss watch
industry was laid low in the late 1970s by Japanese companies that were
quicker to capitalise on quartz and digital technologies. Between 1974 and
1983, exports of Swiss watches and movements crashed from 91.1m pieces to
42.8m.
In 1982, leading Swiss banks asked Mr Hayek, a Zurich engineering
consultant, to attempt a merger and rescue of two of the largest companies.
Mr Hayek startled them by saying he would attack the Japanese head-on and
try to recapture the mass market through heavy investments in automated
manufacturing, product development and marketing. Retreating to niches, he
declared, was pointless.
The rest is history. In less than 10 years, SMH has gone from the edge of
bankruptcy to becoming a highly profitable, financially powerful world
beater. Group net profits have risen substantially every year since 1985,
jumping 31 per cent last year to SFr252m (Dollars 177.4m). No precise
forecast was given for the current year, but Mr Hayek said he was hoping for
another record result and was 'full of euphoria' based on progress so far.
Sales to the end of May were up 40 per cent.
He also announced triumphantly that SMH would this year surpass Citizen of
Japan to become the world's largest producer of watches and movements.
Mr Hayek, who vaguely resembles the Hollywood actor and director Danny De
Vito, has inevitably become something of a guru on consumer product
marketing in general and beating Japanese competitors in particular.
His main observation is that many consumer products induce an 'emotional'
response. The purchaser has a more complex relationship with them than with,
say, bread or a desk. To be successful, these products must not just have an
image, they must deliver a message.
Mr Hayek was pleased to report on the success of the group's
diversifications into wrist-watch pagers and personal telephones. His
biggest project, in co-operation with Volkswagen, is to develop an
environmentally friendly car. Mr Hayek refused to reveal details of the car,
which has attracted much speculation, but said it was 'very beautiful' and
he hoped to launch it in 1996.
Does this all add up to hubris? It would be dangerous to come to that
conclusion. For one thing, SMH is Swiss, and Swiss companies are known for
retaining their discipline for longer periods than many Anglo-Saxon ones.
For another, Mr Hayek seems to know the dangers ahead, as he emphasised
yesterday.
'The seeds of failure lie in success itself. We must be energetic and
tireless, and every day fight against the beginnings of arrogance towards
our customers. We must also be energetic and tireless against any tendency
to become presumptuous, to rest on our laurels or fall back into old habits.
This would be deadly for the enterprise.'

FT  20 JUN 92 / International Company News: Nestle bid probe leaves Perrier
'paralysed'
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOURCE PERRIER, the French maker of bubbly mineral water, yesterday said it
was in 'paralysis' awaiting the results of the European Commission's inquiry
into the FFr15.46bn (Dollars 2.9bn) bid from Nestle, the Swiss food
multinational.
Mr Jacques Vincent, Perrier's chairman, told a shareholders' meeting: 'It is
clear that we are in a vacuum that is dangerous for everyone, including
Nestle.'
Earlier this month, the Swiss group revealed that the Commission had serious
doubts that the bid might create a duopoly of Nestle and BSN on the French
mineral water market. It is contesting this preliminary finding.
'Currently, we are living in a kind of paralysis,' said Mr Vincent. The
Nestle bid was suspended in March, awaiting the Commission's ruling,
expected late next month or early August.
Perrier's turnover rose 5 per cent to FFr3.13bn in the first quarter of this
year, reflecting poor mineral water sales in Britain and the US, but growth
in the rest of the world.
Sales of the Perrier brand in the US and Britain are running at 53 per cent
of the level three years ago, just before the group withdrew its world
stocks following the discovery of benzene contamination.
Mr Vincent said the US and UK mineral water markets remain very gloomy. 'We
don't see any recovery ahead but the situation is not truly catastrophic,'
he said.
Mineral water sales in France are running at 10 per cent above last year's
levels. Outside France, the US and the UK, mineral water sales are up 25 per
cent this year.
First-quarter mineral water sales were virtually static in France at FFr1bn
but fell 2 per cent outside France to FFr989m. Cheese sales fell 6 per cent
in France to FFr260m but surged 17.5 per cent outside France to FFr609m.

<TEXT>
EURO DISNEY, which has been bombarded by bad publicity since this spring's
opening of its Euro Disneyland theme park near Paris, has received the
French government's go-ahead to build a second park and has announced plans
for a third complex.
The group, which has been trying to play down press speculation about poor
attendance at Euro Disneyland, plans to open the second park at a cost of
FFr18bn (Dollars 3.38bn) in 1996. This park, which will be close to the
existing complex at Marne La Vallee to the west of Paris, will adopt a
similar theme to the Disney MGM Studios complex at Disneyworld in Florida by
including attractions based on the imagery of US movies and the Hollywood
film studios. The complex will also house Euro Disney's corporate offices.
At one stage Euro Disney had planned to bring forward the schedule for the
second park so that it would open in 1995. However, earlier this month it
announced it was reverting to the original proposed opening date of 1996.
Euro Disney yesterday confirmed that it plans to open a third park, also at
Marne La Vallee, provisionally scheduled for opening in the year 2000. This
park will adopt the futuristic concept of Epcot, the Disney monument to
science and technology, in Florida.
Confirmation of plans for the second and third Marne La Vallee parks comes
at a time when Euro Disney is anxious to allay concern about the initial
response to Euro Disneyland.
Earlier this month the group said 1.5m people had visited the complex, by
far the most expensive theme park in Europe, since its opening on April 12.
However, Euro Disney, which has consistently refused to disclose its own
internal targets for the park, also admitted that the pattern of attendance
had been erratic with troughs during off-peak periods and that the number of
visitors from France was lower than originally expected.

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ASAHI GLASS, Japan's largest glass maker, has agreed to a gradual buy-out of
AFG Industries, one of the largest makers of flat glass in the US glass.
The purchase is being made through Asahi's Dutch subsidiary Glass
International for an estimated Dollars 60m.
The acquisition will help to progress Asahi's goal of further diversifying
its operations geographically.
In addition to the acquisition price, Asahi has agreed to underwrite up to
Dollars 150m in bonds for AFG.
The Asahi takeover follows from a management buy-out of AFG in 1988, during
which time Asahi acquired a 19.7 per cent stake in AFG, and later
transferred this to Glass International, which is a 50-50 joint venture
holding company half owned by Glaverbel, the Belgian glass company majority
owned by Asahi.
The balance of AFG shares are held by the company's management and by
institutional investors, who have agreed to the gradual buy-out, subject to
approval by the US Federal Trade Commission, which is examining the deal.
AFG had sales last year of Dollars 516m. Asahi's sales in all of North
America last year came to about Y70bn (Dollars 550m) out of gross
consolidated sales of Y1,248bn.
AFG has six float glass plants in the US and one in Canada, and claims 15
per cent of the US market. Asahi said it would leave the US management of
AFG in place for the time being.

GOLD FIELDS of South Africa (GFSA), the country's second largest gold
producer, is considering merging Libanon and Venterspost, two of its more
marginal mines, with Kloof mine.
Analysts speculate that a deal could be based upon tax savings, with the
group being allowed to offset Libanon and Venterspost's losses and capital
spending against Kloof's current revenues.
Libanon and Venterspost are two of the most vulnerable mines in the South
African gold mining industry. They made respective after-tax losses of R3.2m
and R3.3m in the first quarter of 1992, and have stock market
capitalisations of about R85m (Dollars 23.6m) and R60m respectively.
Kloof, by contrast, is one of the richest mines in the industry. It made
R111.5m profit in the March quarter and has a market capitalisation of about
R3.7bn.

FT  20 JUN 92 / International Company News: No basis for court action
against Spanish bankers

<TEXT>
MR EMILIO BOTIN, the president of Banco Santander, the acquisitive Spanish
commercial bank, was yesterday released without bail after giving evidence
in chambers to a Madrid judge trying to find out who bought Dollars 1bn of
credit assignments made by the bank between 1987 and 1989.
The Spanish tax authorities and the court suspect that many of the buyers of
the credit assignments - off balance sheet transactions designed to bypass
Bank of Spain liquidity ratios and withholding taxes  - may have used them
to launder undisclosed income.
Mr Rodrigo Echenique, Santander's managing director, also gave evidence to
the judge yesterday and was also released without bail. Banco Santander said
the judge had decided there was no basis for taking any action against the
two men.
The judge, however, made no public statement and it is possible, as a
nationwide investigation continues, that they may be recalled to give
evidence to the inquiry.
Mr Botin, on leaving the court, said the credit assignments - the sale of
loans to third parties to remove them from the bank's balances - were
perfectly legal at the time.
'Although I was not aware of it, there may have been an excess of zeal, some
negligence or a lack of information about the client's intentions,' he said.
'We have co-operated fully with the authorities in their investigation.'
The tax authorities say they have been unable to identify the buyers of
about 3,000 credit assignments and suspect that many may have been
fictitious. Most Spanish banks used the assignments but Banco Santander is
understood to have been the most aggressive seller of loans.

FT  20 JUN 92 / UK Company News: WPP's accounts qualified by auditors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WPP GROUP, Mr Martin Sorrell's marketing services company, has had its
accounts qualified by Arthur Andersen, its auditors, because it is in the
middle of a Pounds 500m refinancing.
The accounts have been prepared on a 'going concern' basis. The auditor says
that this may cease to be appropriate if WPP cannot arrange adequate
financing. The group agreed one refinancing in April 1991, but was now close
to breaching banking covenants.
Bankers say that WPP will 'hit a brick wall' in July if it cannot raise new
cash. WPP's accounts show net debt at the financial year end of Pounds 334m
but its average debt during the year was Pounds 472m. The group's borrowings
peak during the summer months before the autumn marketing campaigns get
going.
There is a small loan note due for repayment shortly, and WPP has a big
interest payment to meet in July. Also the group has to pay up to Pounds
16.5m in cash in 1992 to cover earn-outs on earlier acquisitions.
WPP's 28 banks have a deadline of June 30 to agree refinancing proposals,
which must also be approved by shareholders. The proposals involve a Pounds
150m issue of new preference shares, convertible directly into ordinary
shares, which the banks would subscribe for at 60p a share. The shares
closed yesterday at 48p, down 1p.
The issue would give the banks more than 50 per cent of the equity, unless
shareholders subscribed for the shares through a clawback deal.
The proceeds would be used to repay bank borrowings. The banks would also
put up Pounds 80m of new cash and extend the term of a Pounds 180m revolving
credit from 1993 to 1997.
The refinancing plan also involves converting existing preference shares
into ordinary shares. Some holders of the preference shares, which were
issued when WPP took over the Ogilvy Group in 1989, have appeared reluctant
to accept the terms, believing they do not give adequate compensation.
WPP's advisers have been making presentations to preference holders, saying
that they would be worse off under any circumstances other than the
proposal. One banker said: 'There are negative shareholders funds and Pounds
500m of debt. Who do they think is running the company?'
The advisers also say that preference shareholders will do better than
similarly placed investors in other recent refinancing packages. The
preference shares would be converted into ordinary shares at four times the
original conversion rate, giving each preference share 0.588 of an ordinary
share. The preference shares closed at 36p, up 1p, yesterday implying a
price for the ordinary of 61.2p.
Preference shareholders at present account for 22.9 per cent of the equity,
on the basis of the existing conversion terms, and allowing for shares to be
issued through earn-outs at an assumed 60p share price. This would rise to
26.1 per cent if all the proposals went through, and no shareholders took up
the clawback offer.
WPP's advisers are warning preference holders that under any other solution
their shares would probably be worthless.
The accounts show that the group's maximum liability to earn-outs is Pounds
70.2m over the next five years. Of this Pounds 31.3m is payable in shares,
the rest in cash. At yesterday's closing share price WPP's market value is
Pounds 26.2m. Thus, at that price, satisfying the part of the earn-out
liability due in shares would involve more than doubling the existing
ordinary share capital.
The effect of the earn-outs is demonstrated in the accounts which show two
employees, Mr Edward Calesa and Mr Thomas Ferguson, each holding stakes of
more than 3 per cent.
The accounts also reveal that Mr Sorrell's emoluments rose by Pounds 1,000
to Pounds 508,000 after he waived Pounds 145,000 (Pounds 93,000) of his
entitlement. He received no pension contributions.

FT  20 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Duggan's resignation marks change of
direction for Cabra
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN DUGGAN has resigned as chairman and chief executive of Cabra
Estates, the heavily-borrowed property company which owns Stamford Bridge
and Craven Cottage, homes to Chelsea and Fulham football clubs.
Mr Eoin Cotter, group financial director, has been appointed group chief
executive. He said Mr Duggan's resignation marked a change of direction for
Cabra. 'It's now a time for belt tightening and taking a different profile,'
he said.
Mr Duggan had come under mounting pressure to complete agreements with the
two clubs which were seen as central to Cabra's survival.
But relations had become acrimonious, and Fulham and Cabra have been locked
in a legal wrangle all week about a planning inquiry into Craven Cottage's
re-development.
Mr Duggan's departure could speed up completion of an agreement in principal
for Cabra to sell Stamford Bridge to Chelsea and reduce its debts by about
Pounds 13m to Pounds 40m.
Cabra announced yesterday that completion with Chelsea 'is anticipated in
the near future', the most positive statement on the state of negotiations
for some time.
An adviser close to the discussions said various legal obstacles remained
but the outlook was now positive.
Cabra's legal argument with Fulham remains unresolved, however. Fulham
yesterday won a court declaration stating it could give evidence to a
planning appeal investigating Cabra's re-development of Craven Cottage.
Fulham had earlier agreed with Cabra it would not jeopardise those plans.
However, Cabra has pledged to appeal against the declaration and the
planning appeal was yesterday adjourned until next month.

FT  20 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Overconfident GPA wanted advisers to
increase share offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GPA GROUP, the aircraft lessor, was so confident that its aborted flotation
would be oversubscribed that it pressed its advisers to announce an increase
in the size of its global offer from 80m to 95m shares just 10 days before
they were due to be traded.
Nomura International, which acted as global co-ordinator, yesterday
confirmed that the company wanted the advisers to announce that 15m more
shares had been issued.
But the advisers refused, arguing that demand would not justify such an
increase.
Instead, they agreed to fix the maximum amount of shares on offer at 85m
which was published with the listing particulars on June 8.
The increase was cited at the time by GPA as evidence of strong demand for
its stock.
Mr Tim Pettee, vice-president of Alliance Capital, which manages about
Dollars 60bn (Pounds 32.4bn) of pension and mutual fund assets in the US,
said: 'When I read that the issue had been increased to 85m shares I could
not believe it. It was simply not going that well to justify any increase.'
The issue was aborted on Thursday after tenders for only 50m shares,
predominantly from retail investors, were received.
Two of GPA's advisers yesterday said they felt the hype surrounding the
announcement was 'totally unjustified' and gave a 'misleading impression
that demand was stronger that it was.
Another explained that the group was obliged by the London Stock Exchange to
say what the maximum amount of shares was on offer.
While the prospectus, issued on May 14, said the group planned to issue up
to 80m, the figure was never binding.
'When we agreed that the maximum amount of shares on offer would be 85m it
should never have been interpreted as evidence that demand was strong', said
one GPA investment banker.
'The company had always said at the time of the prospectus the final amount
of shares on offer maybe more than 80m.'
A spokesman for GPA said: 'The advisers advised us on how many shares should
be on offer and they should stand by their advice.'
GPA's advisers, which also include Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch in the US
and Schroders and BZW in the UK, have forfeited their 4 per cent success fee
worth around Dollars 32m.
The advisers only received their expenses, totalling Dollars 16m.

FT  20 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Claremont in Pounds 27m expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLAREMONT Garment (Holdings), which last year demerged from Alexon, the
women's wear retailer, is set to become one of the top six women's clothing
suppliers to Marks and Spencer following its acquisition of rival supplier
J&amp;J Fashions.
Claremont is paying Pounds 27m for J&amp;J, a private company. Some Pounds 16.5m
of the consideration will be paid in cash and convertible loan notes to
J&amp;J's founders, Jennifer and Ian Rosenburg. Claremont will also take on
Pounds 10.5m of J&amp;J's debts.
To finance the purchase and pay back some of the enlarged group's borrowings
Claremont is calling for Pounds 22.4m via a 2-for-5 rights issue at 205p.
The timing of the acquisition was welcomed by analysts and the company's
shares closed down only 1p at 255p.
Mr Peter Wiegand, chairman, said the combined group would supply about 8 per
cent of M and S's ladies' clothing.
'This gives us the flexibility to supply Marks and Spencer over a range of
ladies wear. They know about the deal and are pleased to see us do it,' he
said.
Claremont, which is based in County Durham, is stronger on classic designs
with emphasis on blouses, suits and children's wear.
J&amp;J is more fashion-orientated and mainly supplies dresses, skirts and
leisure wear.
Nearly 93 per cent of the combined group's sales of Pounds 108m will be
supplied to Marks and Spencer.
'It's a very exciting prospect for us. It's a good fit,' Mr Wiegand said.
Claremont made pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.2m from turnover of Pounds 47.8m
in the eleven months to December 28. That compared with a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 300,000 from sales of Pounds 55.8m for J&amp;J last year.
Mr Wiegand said the expanded group's gearing, taking the Pounds 9m of
convertible loan notes as debt, would increase to 25-30 per cent from
Claremont's present level of 15 per cent.
The acquisition would be 'broadly earnings neutral' this year, but would
contribute next, the company said.
Mrs Rosenburg will join Claremont as an executive director with a two-year
service contract at Pounds 100,000 per year.
Claremont said it expected some benefits from merging the companies,
although there would be Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 2m of rationalisation costs in
the next 18 months.

FT  20 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Planet Hollywood goes on release in
London's Trocadero
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH film industry may be as sick as a parrot, but Planet Hollywood
is alive and well and plans a landing in London.
Robin Power, the dentist cum property baron, yesterday announced that his
Power Corporation had signed the US restaurant group as the latest tenants
in the Trocadero Centre site in London's Piccadilly Circus.
The 20,000 sq ft restaurant - to open in December - is part of a chain in
which Hollywood hardmen Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Bruce
Willis are minority investors.
It will come complete with a 90-seat cinema designed to appeal to leading
movie moguls and a glamour set anxious to show their latest wares, while
dining on down home fare of the Californian persuasion.
Planet Hollywood said the restaurant would be 'dripping' with Hollywood
memorabilia. Diners with strong stomachs would be able to watch Hollywood's
100 most famous punch-ups, while romantics could enjoy the 100 greatest
cinema clinches on movie screens around the restaurant. The total cost of
fitting out the Planet Hollywood set would run to about Pounds 5m.
For Power, the deal at an initial Pounds 32.50 a sq ft adds yet another
string to its Trocadero bow. Mr Nick Orme, Power managing director, said
some 350,000 sq ft of the 440,000 sq ft available was now let.
Planet Hollywood in the US is embroiled in an epic battle with Peter Morton,
co-founder of Hard Rock Cafe.
Mr Morton claims Dollars 1.4bn in damages from Planet Hollywood and Rank
Organisation, for alleged infringement of trade marks, theft of trade
secrets and unfair competition.

FT  20 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Label printing side behind Tinsley Robor's
Pounds 0.58m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TINSLEY ROBOR, the special-ist printing and packaging company, continued to
run up losses in the second six months of 1991-92 and is omitting the
dividend for the year.
Shares in the company remained unchanged at 8p.
Wace, the pre-press group, has a 19.7 per cent stake in Tinsley - the
acquisition of which is still being investigated by the DTI. Mr John Rose,
TR's chairman, said: 'It is not a brake on the group.'
He pointed out, nonetheless, that it was 'a great disappointment to have to
report unsatisfactory results again'.
Pre-tax profits of Pounds 335,000 for 1990-91 turned into losses of Pounds
581,000 for the year to end-March and were struck on turnover slightly down
from Pounds 24.2m to Pounds 23.5m. However, Mr Rose added that second-half
turnover of Pounds 12.7m was up on the first half's Pounds 10.8m.
Second-half losses were cut from Pounds 398,000 to Pounds 183,000, from
which he drew comfort.
Mr Rose said that Howards Printers, the label printing company, was the main
source of group losses in both halves. But he felt that the business was
worth keeping, 'in the best interests of shareholders', because he was
confident that 'what has been done in the past 18 months will bear fruit'.
He was not too concerned by the Pounds 6.7m borrowings (giving gearing of 77
per cent) at the year-end. Interest payable fell to Pounds 860,000 (Pounds
1m).
The group's main market continues to be the music industry. However, Mr Rose
thought it likely that the current year would be the last that Tinsley would
produce record sleeves 'in any material quantity', though they carry more
value per unit than CDs and cassettes.
The group increased its share in the growing CD market, and its variously
packaged formats. Volumes in the music industry generally declined 5 per
cent in the January to March quarter.
On the commercial side, where a large proportion of the work is promotional,
'many customers had delayed or scrapped projects', Mr Rose said.
Losses per share were 2.4p (earnings 0.9p). Last year Tinsley paid a total
dividend of 1p via a final of 0.25p.

FT  20 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Lynx ousting cost Pounds 131,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COST of the boardroom coup in February which ousted the chairman of Lynx
Holdings, the Sheffield-based leisure and computer services company, was
Pounds 131,000.
That was the compensation plus associated costs paid to Mr Stephen
Hinchcliffe and two other executive directors, Mr Andrew Hartley and Mr
Chris Harrison, who resigned at the same time.
The compensation was revealed when Lynx announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds
291,000 for the six months to March 31, against profits of Pounds 105,000.
The Pounds 131,000 compensation was taken as an exceptional charge.
Since the end of the period the group had moved back into profit thanks to
increased sales and reduced costs, particularly at its head office.
The shares of this USM-quoted company rose 3p after announcement to close at
31p.
In the first half turnover advanced by 83 per cent to Pounds 3.2m (Pounds
1.75m). Losses per share emerged at 2p (earnings 1.5p). The interim dividend
is being halved to 0.25p (0.5p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Caldwell Investments, the USM-quoted textile company, suffered a fall in
pre-tax profits from Pounds 152,600 to Pounds 31,600 in the six months to
April 30.
Mr Stanley Wootliff, the chairman, said that strikes in Germany, where the
company has a subsidiary, had an adverse effect on second quarter turnover
and profits after what had been an encouraging start.
However, the forward order position was good.
Turnover declined to Pounds 1.96m (Pounds 2.47m) while expenses rose to
Pounds 311,800 (Pounds 266,600) and interest charges to Pounds 31,900
(Pounds 10,100).
Earnings per share fell from 1.4p to 0.3p.
Mr Wootliff said that steady progress had been made in both establishing a
Romanian manufacturing facility and developing trade there. Efforts to
establish UK-based trading activities were continuing.

FT  20 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Interest costs leave James Crean lower
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
James Crean, the Dublin-based food, household goods and industrial equipment
wholesaler, has released its results for 1991.
The figures had been delayed so that certain matters relating to the affairs
of International Aircraft Services - in which James Crean increased its
stake to 38 per cent early in 1991 - could be clarified.
This has resulted in the adoption of equity accounting for the company's
interest in IAS. James Crean's share of the IAS result for 1991 is a net
positive contribution of IPounds 554,000 and for reasons of prudence this
has not been taken into the accounts.
In spite of a significant increase in group turnover from IPounds 179.7m to
IPounds 208.7m, pre-tax profits for the year declined by more than IPounds
1m to IPounds 18.5m (Pounds 16.9m).
However, the company said comparisons were distorted by the investments in
Valley Fresh Foods in California and Egidius Janssen in Holland in 1990, and
by the fact that the results for Valley Fresh had been consolidated in the
1991 accounts.
The directors said increases in profits before tax and interest had been
achieved in all core areas, except for the electrical business in the UK.
The interest charge surged to IPounds 6.04m (IPounds 2.74m) and group net
borrowing at the year-end stood at IPounds 57.4m, against IPounds 50.6m.
A final dividend of 10.4765p is proposed, maintaining the total for the year
at 18.3415p. The dividend is twice covered by earnings per share of 36.7p
(45.1p).

Profits before tax of Grainger Trust, the property investor and trader, fell

Jessups, the Essex-based motor dealer, is acquiring all the issued share
capital of Clarkes, a Ford main dealership based in Bristol.
Consideration will be satisfied by an issue of 767,532 new ordinary Jessup
shares of which 761,839 will be placed on the vendors' behalf with
institutional investors at 77p each in return for Pounds 586,000 in cash.
For 1991 Clarkes' pre-tax loss was Pounds 215,000 on turnover of Pounds
13.3m. Its net assets at December 31, including associated and other
indebtedness which will be repaid to Clarkes by the principal vendors,
amounted to Pounds 1.05m.

FT  20 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Ryan Hotels falls IPounds 1.2m into the red
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DOUBLED INTEREST charges and 'unfavourable market conditions' led to
increased pre-tax losses of IPounds 1.19m (Pounds 1.09m) at Ryan Hotels for
the six months to April 30. Last time losses amounted to IPounds 509,000.
Interest payments increased to IPounds 1.08m (IPounds 533,000). Losses per
share totalled 1.93p (1.11p) but the interim dividend is being held at 0.5p.
The Dublin-based hotels operator increased turnover to IPounds 8.38m
(IPounds 7.02m) mainly because of the inclusion of Carat Hotel and the
opening of the Killarney Ryan in winter months.
The company said cost cutting exercises had been introduced throughout the
group and significant reductions had already been achieved. The savings
would not be fully reflected until the first half next year as the
associated costs were being charged as they occurred.

The consequences of the EC's failure to act could result in packaging
regulations thoughout member states with differing objectives, timescales,
sanctions and compliance costs.

FT  20 JUN 92 / A hard slog ahead: Britain's stuttering economic performance
presents a puzzling picture - The faltering recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rarely has the state of the UK economy been so difficult to assess.
Official statistics over the past fortnight have provided some hope that
manufacturing activity is gathering strength and that the rise in
unemployment may be over the worst. But it is too soon to declare that the
UK's longest post-war recession has ended.
Where once Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, might have spied the 'green
shoots' of recovery, he now warns that years of hard graft will be required
to bring the economy up to the standards of France, which he sees as a
yardstick for UK economic achievement.
A cynic might say that the change in rhetoric reflects no more than the
transformation on April 9 of the government from one seeking election to one
with a secure majority for parliament's full five-year life.
But there is a genuine puzzle surrounding Britain's economic performance.
Consumer demand - the one essential ingredient for a self-sustaining
recovery - is notable by its absence. Yet it is difficult to see what the
government can do about this without radically changing policy.
There has been some good news in recent weeks. Manufacturing output rose 1
per cent in the three months to the end of April compared with the previous
three months. The 21,300 increase in seasonally adjusted unemployment in May
was only two-thirds the average monthly rise during the past six months.
Similarly, last month's growth in bank and building society lending - at a
seasonally adjusted Pounds 3bn - was above the Pounds 2.4bn monthly average
of the previous half year.
Looking ahead to the medium term, the government can draw comfort from the
trend in prices. Although May's annual rate of retail price inflation was
unchanged at 4.3 per cent, the latest indices for industrial producer
prices, average earnings, unit labour cost growth and retail price inflation
excluding mortgage interest payments all point downwards. Average weekly
earnings rose by an underlying 7 per cent in April, the lowest annual rate
for 25 years. With pay settlements hovering around the inflation rate,
annual earnings growth seems certain to fall further.
But such news, while encouraging for Britain's future competitiveness,
points to a squeeze on consumers' disposable incomes and has added to
uncertainty about consumer demand. The latest retail sales figures, showing
no revival of trading volumes in April and May compared with the first three
months of the year, have severely dented hopes that the Tory election
victory might presage a consumer spending surge. Instead they raise
questions about the durability of the past three months' recovery in
manufacturing output.
Professor Douglas McWilliams, the Confederation of British Industry's
economic adviser, warns that the increase in manufacturing production may
simply reflect an end to heavy destocking. 'We will only get a sustainable
recovery when spending comes back into fashion and we are not there yet,' he
says.
Debt is a main cause of this uncertainty. The economic upsurge in the late
1980s was fuelled by an unprecedented increase in consumer indebtedness as
borrowing rose from about 6 per cent of personal disposable income at the
beginning of the decade to 17 per cent by the peak of the boom in 1988.
Financial sector deregulation combined with economic growth to set in train
a sharp increase in mortgage lending, rising house prices and the withdrawal
of equity from the housing market by homeowners who traded up. In the
process, the ratio of personal debt to personal disposable income doubled to
114 per cent in 1990 from 57 per cent 10 years earlier.
In spite of a fall in bank base rates from 15 per cent to 10 per cent over
the past 20 months, the debt burden still weighs heavily on Britain's
households. As the chart shows, there has been little decline in the
personal sector's gross income gearing ratio, which measures the gross
interest payments of households as a percentage of disposable income. At 13
per cent at the end of last year, the ratio was close to its 1990 high of
nearly 14 per cent, three times the level of the late 1970s, and 50 per cent
higher than between 1984 and 1988 when the borrowing binge was at its
height.
Some senior policymakers believe Mr John Major, when chancellor, may have
made a mistake by keeping bank base rates at 15 per cent for a full year to
October 1990. That year of extreme rigour pushed inflation down rapidly from
its 10.9 per cent peak in October 1990. But it may also have sharply reduced
the inclination of the middle classes to borrow.
Falling house prices and rising unemployment have added to the scars
inflicted by the credit squeeze of the late 1980s, particularly in the
south. House repossessions, nearly 75,000 throughout the UK last year, are
the most emotionally charged element of the misery afflicting Britain's
biggest economic region. But rising unemployment is also curbing demand. The
Unemployment Unit, an independent research body, reported this week that
unemployment in the south-east reached a post-second world war record last
month.
The government's options for tackling these problems are limited indeed.
While the US has cut short term interest rates to the lowest levels for a
generation and seems now to be recovering from recession, the UK is tied by
the rules of the European Monetary System. The strength of the D-Mark
against sterling since the Danish referendum vote earlier this month against
the Maastricht Treaty has underscored Britain's limited capacity for
bringing interest rates below German levels. German rates - exemplified by
the Bundesbank's 9.75 per cent Lombard rate - will stay high so long as
Germany is wrestling with the inflationary consequences of unification.
Mr Lamont is making a virtue out of necessity and using Britain's membership
of the exchange rate mechanism to squeeze inflation further with the aim of
matching or bettering Japan's 2 per cent. Once this is achieved, the way may
be open for stronger growth.
But achieving such low inflation takes time and sacrifice. In the 1970s West
Germany went through a bout of inflation, recession and disinflation similar
to the UK's recent experience. The economy afterwards lapsed into
sub-standard growth, known then as the 'corrugated iron business cycle'.
The chancellor admires France's record. But while the tight monetary and
fiscal policies initiated in 1983 have produced inflation below German
levels, France's unemployment rate is still close to 10 per cent. All the
signs are that Britain faces a similar hard slog.

Sir, The assertion by Mr Courtney (Letters, June 13) that water companies

Only the director-general of water services or, eventually, parliament can
protect the customers; most certainly the managers of the monopolies have
displayed no such concern.
Furthermore, to pretend that the suppliers of water are running a business
is clearly a nonsense since business is about risk, an element almost
totally lacking within the water supply industry.

Sir, Your report 'How back pain can make you lose your marbles' (Management,
June 17) provides sensible advice on how to avoid back troubles and who to
go to if you get it.
But in quoting US statistics it ignores how bad the situation has become in
the UK in comparison. In 1990, 60m working days were lost in the UK costing
the country Pounds 3bn, compared with the figures you quote of 93m working
days at a cost of Pounds 7.6bn in the US.
A conference to discuss this issue is to be held in London in October - not
a moment too soon.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Letter: Enterprise that offers answer to improved bus
services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr G E HUTCHINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader 'A better way for buses' (June 15) neatly gave a view of
the rights and wrongs of bus service deregulation in its present form, but
regrettably jumped to the wrong conclusion when it promoted a franchising
solution for London and elsewhere.
As you rightly identify, the 1985 Transport Act put an end to low fares
policies in the metropolitan areas and funding constraints have all but
eliminated free travel for pensioners. It is these two factors, and these
alone, which have been largely responsible for the 28 per cent reported
decline in patronage to which you referred. As you point out, deregulation
can have its downsides, particularly when service supply outstrips demand in
some competitive situations. The Bus and Coach Council, the industry's trade
association, is recommending to ministers how such problems can be overcome.
Franchising is not the right approach. It produces the inflexibilities of
planned route networks designed and updated by remote bureaucracies and
usually without the knowledge and experience of bus operators. To suggest
that franchising is the answer is tantamount to throwing the baby out with
the bath water. In many areas deregulation has given bus passengers more
reliable services with better motivated staff working more efficiently. Bus
operators actively seek new opportunities to provide what their customers
want rather than what the planners say they want. The solution for London
lies in encouraging this new spirit of enterprise while ensuring that the
worst excesses of deregulation are eliminated.
To achieve this the principal need now is for firm action by both national
and local government on two fronts. First, national government needs to
insist on higher financial and professional standards for bus operators.
Second, national and local government need to take positive steps to improve
urban traffic management so that bus services can operate reliably and
efficiently. Deregulated bus services in London could demonstrate that true
effectiveness if at the same time a network of Red Routes and special bus
priorities were implemented.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Season sans spice: This year's sober social calendar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The champagne corks will be popping as usual at social events throughout the
summer, but already it is clear that much of the fizz has gone out of the
Season.
The social whirl of summer balls, Ascot, Wimbledon, Henley, Glyndebourne,
Glorious Goodwood and Cowes, which has entertained the idle rich for
generations, has been unable to escape the recession.
The signs of new social austerity are plentiful. Pembroke College,
Cambridge, cancelled its summer ball this year and only five colleges at
Oxford University are staging events, compared with twice that number a year
ago. Paid attendance was down at the Epsom Derby. Black-market ticket prices
at this week's Ascot race meeting are sharply lower than last year's. And
even Glyndebourne has been unable to sell returned tickets for its opera
season.
Companies have cut entertainment expenses heavily, threatening the viability
of some of the peripheral events and resulting in a rash of bankruptcies
among corporate hospitality agencies.
'Every event has suffered a downturn in commercial sponsorship which is
perfectly understandable in the current climate,' says Mr Richard Goddard,
secretary of the Henley Royal Regatta.
He explains: 'It is invidious to be seen to be conspicuously entertaining if
your company is not doing terribly well. My view is that this will be the
worst year for a long time. It will be a little worse than last year which
in turn was a lot worse than the year before.'
In spite of this gloom, true aficionados have remained loyal and ensured the
Season has remained on its feet. As Mr Peter Wallis, a consultant at the SRU
marketing group, says: 'Many of these events were on financial steroids in
the 1980s. It is quite amazing that they have not fallen further.'
The premier social and sporting events are reporting continued support from
long-standing devotees. They, as opposed to beneficiaries of corporate
hospitality tents, are likely to seem more prominent this year.
It seems, perhaps, appropriate that after 12 years without success, the
Queen returned to the winners' enclosure at Ascot when her horse, Colour
Sergeant, won the Royal Hunt Cup this week.
At Wimbledon, where the first serve is tossed up on Monday, supporters have
also remained loyal. The All England tennis club reports that its 46
official hospitality marquees, which cost Pounds 12,500 for three days and
include daily tickets for 35 to 40 guests, have been fully booked, mostly by
long-established backers of the championship. By contrast, unofficial party
bookings organised by outside agents are expected to suffer.
There is a similar tale at Henley, which the corporate hospitality agents
whisper is more vulnerable to recession than most events because of the
lesser appeal of rowing. Mr Goddard says: 'Support from the core of people
who are traditional supporters of the regatta has not diminished.' The
regatta still boasts 6,000 members of its Stewards' Enclosure and has a
waiting list of 1,000. Only 32 new members were admitted from the list last
year. Its official corporate hospitality income is set at a fixed level with
an outside agent.
Mr Goddard suggests it was the host of peripheral events that emerged 'up
the back alleys of Henley nowhere near the river' that have suffered most.
'There was a great swell of popular interest in the regatta and people came
along because it was a jolly. That has gone and quite right too,' he says.
While people such as Mr Goddard may welcome the retreat of fringe activities
which threatened to swamp the Season during the 1980s, it was the influx of
new money which forced improvements in the organisation of many of its
events and may have ensured their preservation.
Mr Wallis of SRU argues that the increasing influence of businessmen helped
ensure the Season's financial viability. 'The truth is that new money is
often more demanding and discriminating than old money. People want the
latest and the best,' he says.
In the process of modernising the management of the events, the Season
largely changed from being a marriage market for debutantes to a
sophisticated marketing exercise.
A decade ago the Debrett's guide to the Season had already picked up on the
trend, acerbically commenting: 'Debrett would be the first to agree that the
Season as it is today exists only with the support of the non-traditional
members of Society - it is the successful businessmen and industrialists,
not the aristocracy, who set the pace.'
Debrett may take heart from the mood prevailing in the current season. As
one society columnist remarked this week: 'Now we are returning to
restrained values. By grandeur and stealth, and by the simple fact of still
being there, old money has seen off the brassy opposition.'
The new money associated with the Season may have evaporated; but clearly
the old snobberies are more durable.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Letter: Tax free reserve plan would aid Lloyd's members to
meet losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr D H EVERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, So the hawks on Lloyd's Council have prevailed over the doves; there is
to be no assistance to hard-hit Names, but the four-year, rolling stop loss
scheme is to be enhanced by making it operate if a Name loses 80 per cent
rather than 100 per cent of his limit. This will encourage existing Names,
who have been rattling their chains, and it may even encourage some new ones
to join.
There is, however, one concession that the government should consider
granting as soon as possible.
In recent years the Inland Revenue has mounted a concerted attack on Lloyd's
syndicates and Names on the basis - totally without foundation as it has
turned out - that the syndicates were over-reserved. So aggressive has been
the Inland Revenue's approach that it has disputed or disallowed syndicate
reserves as excessive one year, only to find after 12 months that these have
proved inadequate. For the Name these disputes have meant delay in the
recovery of tax due him at a time when cash is all important.
Also, the results of this prolonged attack have been harmful, since few
syndicates have had the reserves in place to cope with a bad year or series
of bad years.
The government should introduce immediately a catastrophe reserve for
members of Lloyd's: under such a scheme a member could immediately transfer
100 per cent of his profits free of tax to the catastrophe reserve on the
basis that it can only be withdrawn to meet losses, that if withdrawn
otherwise full tax and higher rate tax are deducted at source.
This should encourage new members, place Lloyd's on an equal footing with
its continental competitors, enable the Inland Revenue to transfer some of
its staff to more productive work, preserve an institution that earns much
foreign exchange and ensure that syndicates have no need to be over-reserved
because reserves could be held in future more profitably (for all concerned)
in the hands of the member.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Lloyd's summer of discontent: The insurance market is taking
steps to meet a shortage of capital and a crisis of confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the annual general meeting of Lloyd's of London last June Mr David
Coleridge, the insurance market's 60-year-old chairman, gave a virtuoso
performance. Standing with his back to the yellow and silver escalators at
the centre of the market's glass and steel headquarters, Mr Coleridge held
court with a hostile audience of Names for four hours, explaining the
reasons for the market's first loss in 20 years.
'Tears were streaming down his face as I gave the vote of thanks,' says Mr
Robert Hiscox, who was then chairman of Lloyd's Underwriting Agents
Association.
At this year's AGM next Wednesday Mr Coleridge's task will be even more
difficult. Up to 3,000 Names - the individuals whose personal wealth
underpins the market's capital base - will be severely affected by losses of
some Pounds 2bn accumulated by their syndicates in 1989 which, in line with
the three-year accounting system used by Lloyd's, are reported this year.
The losses are the biggest the market has incurred and their burden will
fall most heavily on members of spiral reinsurance syndicates which
specialised in reinsuring each others' and company exposures to high-level
catastrophe risks. About half the market's total Pounds 2bn loss will be
borne by 15 of the 401 syndicates trading in 1989. They have been swamped by
claims arising from hurricane Hugo which devastated the Caribbean in
September 1989, and a series of other disasters. Several thousand Names on
syndicates managed by the Gooda Walker agency, which is now in liquidation,
face losses of about Pounds 500m.
Lloyd's decision this week to reject a plan to bail out the hardest-hit
Names will fuel anger among them. Some allege that working Names - market
insiders who work with agents and brokers - accepted the least risky
business for themselves and thus avoided the worst losses. Further
complaints include claims that underwriters charged rates that were too low
for the size of risks being covered, and that agents funnelled some Names
into too many spiral syndicates. A blizzard of litigation is being promised
by Names' leaders to add to the legal actions being taken by several
thousand Names against their agents and against Lloyd's itself.
Yet despite the sense of crisis that has severely dented confidence in the
market, in some respects there is more optimism than when Mr Coleridge gave
his performance last year. Several developments over the past 12 months give
for hope that once the storm is past, the market may be on the road to a new
phase of prosperity.
Virtually all sectors of the market are benefiting from rising rates, which
is increasing the flow of cash into syndicate funds, helping to alleviate
liquidity problems caused by the big catastrophe claims of 1989 and 1990 and
bringing the slim prospect of profit for 1991 business. 'Underwriters are
beginning to walk around with a spring in their step,' says an agent.
For example, rates for marine and aviation insurance have climbed steadily
upwards and insurers have attached tough new conditions to policies. The
'hardening' of the market has been reinforced by a reduction in syndicates
from 354 in 1991 to 278 this year, and stronger management by the agencies,
which manage syndicates and handle the affairs of Names. This makes a repeat
of some of the worst mistakes of the 1980s less likely.
Although the market is mired in litigation, Lloyd's has won some decisive
battles. In April Lloyd's defeated a move by 800 Names to seek injunctions
preventing the market from drawing down on their deposits to pay losses.
Several cases have been won in the United States, where Lloyd's has
successfully argued that disputes between Names and their agents must be
heard in English rather than in American courts.
Lloyd's has quashed fears, rife earlier this year, that it may even be
unable to meet claims because of cash flow or solvency problems. This month
the size of the Central Fund - which pays claims when Names are unable to
meet their obligations - was increased by Pounds 500m to Pounds 1bn. The
money was raised by a one-off levy on Names participating in the 1990, 1991
and 1992 years.
Measures to strengthen the regulation and leadership of the market could
also be in the pipeline. Early next month the conclusions of a committee
headed by Sir Jeremy Morse, chairman of Lloyds Bank, which has been
examining these issues, will be published and almost certainly acted upon by
the market.
The committee is tipped to endorse proposals which would lead Lloyd's to
introduce a greater element of external monitoring of its system of
self-regulation. It could also push for the setting up of a market board to
provide more effective business leadership.
A second committee, chaired by Sir David Walker, head of the Securities and
Investment Board, which has been examining allegations of 'insider trading',
will also report next month. Mr Coleridge, who earlier this year promised to
'string up' anyone found to have committed such offences, will hope that the
report puts an end to damaging reports which have tarnished the market's
image.
Despite progress on all these fronts the market faces the problem of a
potentially acute shortage of capital in the medium term. The exodus of
Names and the steady reduction in the size of its capital base looks set to
continue.
Since 1988 some 10,000 Names have ceased underwriting at Lloyd's. Mr Colin
Murray, a Lloyd's Council member, said this week that he expects the number
of Names to shrink by a further 10 per cent this year, taking numbers from
their present level of 22,300 to below 20,000.
Last year the market's total capacity fell from Pounds 11.4bn to Pounds
10.1bn and is set to drop to at least Pounds 9bn next year. Some pessimists
put the figure as low as Pounds 7bn.
A few critics believe this decline indicates that the capital base of the
market is beginning to disintegrate. Mr John Rew, co-author of Chatset, a
company which monitors the results of syndicates, says that without external
help the market is set to 'melt down'.
He predicts that the weight of catastrophe losses and continuing claims from
US asbestosis and pollution cases will gradually eat away at the assets of
Lloyd's Names and undermine future profitability, with the market's capacity
shrinking to as little as Pounds 4bn by 1995.
Mr Rew predicts that a further levy on Names will be needed to replenish the
Central Fund to cover losses arising from 1990 and 1991 business, which
could amount to more than Pounds 1.75bn, he says. This will have the effect
of 'cascading' the losses of the worst-hit Names across the entire market.
Other observers who take a far more sanguine view are still concerned about
capital shortages.
Mr David Rowland, chairman of Sedgwick, the international broker, who last
year headed a review of Lloyd's business practices, says capital shortages
could restrict the market's growth and reduce its ability to compete in the
international reinsurance and specialist commercial insurance markets.
Although Lloyd's current capacity of Pounds 10.1bn is well in excess of its
premium income - which reached an estimated Pounds 7bn last year - a
shortage is already apparent as rates start to rise. In other words, some
big companies are unable to buy enough insurance to meet their needs.
Two solutions have so far been devised to solve the problem of expanding the
capital base. First, a scheme to cap the losses of new Names who join next
year has been introduced. This radically modifies the principle of unlimited
liability, whereby Names commit their entire personal wealth to backing the
market. New members should be attracted to the market if their risks are
thus reduced.
Second, in the medium term, the hunt is on for corporate capital. The
suggestion that Lloyd's should tap this source of funds for the first time
was one of the most radical conclusions of the Rowland task force's report.
So far the signs are reasonably good. Lloyd's has received legal opinions
indicating that no substantial changes to the Lloyd's Act which provides for
self-regulatory status will be required. Over the next six months another
Lloyd's committee will negotiate the regulatory and tax implications of such
as move in all the markets in which Lloyd's trades. Corporate capital could
be introduced by 1994.
Meanwhile, in a supplementary move to gain indirect access to corporate
capital Lloyd's has announced measures to make it easier for syndicates to
form consortiums with insurance and reinsurance companies. They also intend
to make more use of reinsurance to offset risks.
Several agencies are getting into shape to attract corporate investors.
For instance, Castle Holdings, one of the fastest-growing agencies, last
month announced a reorganisation of its syndicates, centralising
administration of its nine syndicates and more precisely focusing the
actitivies of each.
Mr Alec Sharp, a leading underwriter with Castle, says: 'Corporate capital
is a different kind of philosophy to Names' capital.' In general, agents and
underwriters will need to operate in a more open and disciplined way.
In line with others at Lloyd's, Mr Sharp believes that the most obvious
source of capital will be the insurance and reinsurance companies which have
traditionally worked alongside syndicates. He says participation in
syndicates, possibly backed by a share stake and a position on the board of
the managing agency, would offer several advantages for insurers, such as
access to the specialist - and often expensive - skills of the most
successful Lloyd's underwriters.
Ultimately though the willingness of corporate investors - and new Names -
to commit capital to the world's oldest insurance market will depend on the
confidence it inspires in those who do business there. As Mr Coleridge rises
to speak next Wednesday he will be acutely conscious of that fact. Although
some of the signs may be good, the fate of many existing Names and the
repercussions of their legal battles could keep the market on the defensive
for some time. Mr Hiscox is confident about the market's prospects, but says
of Mr Coleridge and his task on Wednesday: 'There aren't many men who would
like to be in his shoes.'

FT  20 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Pensions after Maxwell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the least attractive features of the way in which financial services
are regulated in Britain is that no loophole or abuse is ever addressed
until a scandal of such magnitude breaks that it becomes impossible for the
government of the day not to act. Thanks to the monstrous theft perpetrated
by the late Robert Maxwell against pension scheme members in his business
empire, the time for action has belatedly arrived. The striking feature of
Maxwell's crooked dealings, which have been revealed in all their convoluted
detail in a series of articles in the Financial Times this week, is that
they were constrained by scarcely any checks and balances worthy of the
name. What lessons can we draw from this extraordinary saga for future
pensions provision and regulation?
It is tempting, especially for those directly involved in the pensions
business, to regard Maxwell as a one-off phenomenon; and certainly the scale
of the theft was unprecedented. Yet it could also be argued that Maxwell is
simply an extreme case of a more widespread problem, which is that directors
often have considerable discretion over the deployment of pension scheme
assets in circumstances that involve severe potential conflicts of interest
vis-a-vis the beneficiaries.
One narrow manifestation of that problem has emerged over the past 10 days
in the shape of news about several perfectly legal, but incestuous, deals
between companies and their pension funds. These include transactions at
groups as various as Burlington International, cooker manufacturer Belling
and LEP Group. The common feature is that the companies entered into these
transactions while financially stretched - Burlington and Belling are now in
receivership - and there are now questions about the implications for
pension benefits.
Compensation scheme
A government committee under Professor Roy Goode will shortly examine a
range of issues to do with the legal framework, the ownership of pension
scheme surpluses and the case for a compensation scheme, all of which have a
bearing on transactions of this kind. While it is a tribute to the integrity
of British employers that conflicts of interest have been so infrequently
abused in the past, it is also clear that with corporate failures running at
a high level, pension scheme assets are at risk as never before. The
government must recognise that legislation cannot wait. A ban is needed on
all dealings between companies and their pension funds.
This would not stop another Maxwell, but it would be a deterrent for those
employers who would stop at a breach of the law. It would also spare the
government a bigger spate of demands for compensation following its decision
to provide modest support for Maxwell pensioners.
The wider manifestation of the inherent conflict of interest in occupational
pensions can be seen in the argument over the ownership of pension fund
surpluses. Employers argue that they are entitled to surpluses because they
guarantee the solvency of the scheme. Yet the guarantee depends entirely on
the goodwill of the employer, since employers usually control the board of
trustees; and most trust deeds permit the trustees to change the rules at
whim, including those relating to the solvency guarantee.
Contribution holidays
One consequence of all this is that companies are often taking contribution
holidays when present and deferred pensioners are still suffering from a
fall in the value of their pension in real terms. There are also numerous
inequitable cross-subsidies in the system such as those whereby long stayers
benefit at the expense of the redundant, whose pension rights are devalued
either by inflation or penal actuarial valuations on transfer to other
funds. And since the cost of pensions funding increases as employees grow
older, employers have a powerful incentive to lay off ageing employees.
None of this seems compatible with any meaningful notion of trust. It also
points to a fundamental flaw in the legal framework, which is that trust law
was simply not designed for an arrangement where the settlor of the trust
retains a continuing interest in the finances of the scheme. The natural
priority for Professor Goode's committee will thus be to weigh the case for
reform of trust law as opposed to new pensions legislation; to consider ways
of making trustees genuinely independent and of ensuring that assets are
safely out of reach of company management; and to recommend some form of
bonding or compensation scheme to provide for the victims of abuse.
Yet it could be argued that the whole system of occupational pensions is so
fundamentally flawed that a more radical approach is called for. It is
simply impossible to escape the ill-effects of the conflicts of interest
inherent in paternalistic final salary schemes.
If pensions in the Maxwell empire had been organised on a personal basis,
the scope for theft, cross-subsidy and arguments about surpluses would have
been much reduced. Professor Goode should not hesitate to express a view on
the more radical options.

FT  20 JUN 92 / Maastricht back on track: Irish voters have brought the EC
back from the brink
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By their two-to-one vote in favour of the Maastricht Treaty, Irish voters
have firmly hoisted the EC's project for political and monetary union back
on to the rails.
It is still - and will be for many months - an open question whether the
Community locomotive will eventually reach Union Station, or hit another set
of buffers along the way. Ten more EC states have yet to pronounce on
Maastricht. Any repeat of Denmark's June 2 rejection would derail the
Maastricht train for good. And, because of Denmark's decision, it is still
unclear whether the train will have more than 11 carriages to it.
But the 'pleasure and delight' which Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime
minister, said he felt at his people's 'very clear-cut' approval of
Maastricht was yesterday felt around Community capitals.
In the very short term, the Portuguese presidency of the EC can now expect
to host a 'normal' summit next week in Lisbon. That is to say, it can be a
summit devoted largely to such traditional Community activities as
squabbling about money and sites of its institutions, rather than a crisis
session of soul-searching about the Community's future, or even its present
existence.
Another immediate consequence is that Mr Jacques Delors is sure to be
renominated in Lisbon as Commission president. Only a heavy Irish 'no' might
have led some EC leaders to question the wisdom of keeping him on in the
drivers' cab. Even then, they would have been pushed to find plausible
alternatives among Mr Delors' 16 fellow commissioners.
The Irish vote bodes well, but not decisively, for a 'yes' to Maastricht in
France's autumn referendum. France will be the last of the three countries
seeking direct democratic approval of the European Union treaty. For
Maastricht's sake, this is probably just as well. An opinion poll yesterday
showed 52 per cent of Germans would vote against the treaty, if given the
chance.
The evidence, from the national parliamentary debates and from the two
referenda that have now taken place, is still that what most people think is
right or wrong with the future Maastricht Treaty is largely derived from
what they already believe to be right or wrong with the existing Community.
Many Irish said 'yes' to Maastricht, simply because in 19 years of EC
membership they have always got more money out of the EC than they paid in.
Likewise, pollsters' subsequent questioning of Danes who voted 'no' on June
2 shows that many were preoccupied by such irritants as EC prescriptions
against 'curved cucumbers' (straight ones are easier to pack, deemed the
EC).
Logically, therefore, the Irish 'yes' does not cancel out the Danish 'no'.
These different verdicts largely reflect the Community's differing impact on
these two countries. Politically, too, the Irish vote does not mean a return
to the status quo ante June 2. Federalists now realise they may have been
lucky to get a Maastricht Treaty signed at all. Until June 2, the European
Parliament, and to some extent the Commission, carped endlessly about
Maastricht's failure to give them more power. No longer. They now praise,
and pray for, it.
Another consequence is that, in the backwash of the Danish vote, 'the
Commission is beginning to see itself as others do', said a senior EC
official yesterday. 'That is no bad thing. Mr Delors has taken on the chin
the criticism that he has been a grabber of power. In an interview this
week, he pledged Brussels would not tread on member states' toes in matters
of internal security, justice, local planning, health, culture and
education, and said his Eurocrats had started work to return some
implementation and supervision of EC environmental rules to governments.
The Danish reverse has also killed the notion that there must be further
institutional reforms agreed before European Free Trade Association (Efta)
countries join the EC during the 1990s. The dominant Brussels' view had been
that the Lisbon summit should consider more majority voting, even beyond
that contained in Maastricht, as the only way to stop decision-making in a
more numerous Community seizing up. Apart from commissioners and ministers
from Spain, which is allergic to Eftans joining on almost any terms, this
view is espoused only by by Mr Frans Andriessen, the Dutchman who is
external affairs commissioner, and by the Belgian government.
These developments are welcome to the UK government, which now has 10 days
to the start of its EC presidency. 'We want to turn these (Danish-caused)
difficulties to good effect,' said a British minister this week, 'to get
more progress on subsidiarity and enlargement than we otherwise could have.'
How to nail down Mr Delors' pledges, in particular on subsidiarity, in a way
that could bring Denmark back into the fold at the year's end, while at the
same time avoiding renegotiation of Maastricht, will be a test of British
diplomacy.
But the glimpse of the abyss provided by Denmark may have a salutary effect.
'There is a 50 per cent chance,' says an EC official, 'that we may come very
close at Lisbon to agreeing on sites for our various new institutions',
including the European Monetary Institute, planned forerunner of the
European Central Bank. Equally, there is the outline of an agreement on
future EC financing. These tricky issues have been put into proper
perspective by the potential failure of Maastricht - provided the Irish
'yes' does not restore the sense of complacency shattered by the Danish
'no'.

FT  20 JUN 92 / O&amp;Y faces threat to scrap Canary lease
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN EXPRESS, the financial services group, said yesterday it would
abandon plans to move 1,500 staff to Canary Wharf, the Pounds 1.5bn project
in London Docklands that is in administration, unless contractual
obligations were met.
The group has filed in US and Canadian courts to notify Olympia &amp; York,
owner of Canary Wharf, that payments totalling Pounds 22m due to American
Express under a lease agreement have not been made.
Under the 30-year lease signed by American Express in June 1990, O&amp;Y agreed
to provide a fitting-out fund and to assume certain obligations for premises
now occupied by American Express in London.
On April 1 this year, O&amp;Y was due to pay Amex Pounds 31m, which was the
unspent balance of its fitting-out fund and Pounds 8.5m in respect of
takeover leases. By May 28, the date Canary Wharf went into administration,
O&amp;Y still owed American Express Pounds 22m.
'We would reiterate that American Express has no intention of completing the
lease provided for in the agreement or of moving to the premises unless they
are satisfied that (the developers) intend, and are in a position, to honour
all of their obligations,' lawyers for American Express said a letter to O&amp;Y
on Thursday. The payments concern fitting out the Canary Wharf building and
indemnity against continuing liability on existing premises. Olympia &amp; York
agreed to take on 240,000 sq ft of space occupied by Shearson Lehman, the
investment banking subsidiary of American Express, at Broadgate in the City
of London.
A decision by American Express to pull out of Canary Wharf would be a
serious blow for the project. As one of Canary Wharf's most prominent
tenants, its withdrawal would further undermine the possibility of creating
a prestigious business centre in Docklands.
Other tenants are reviewing plans to move to Canary Wharf, which could leave
the project substantially unlet. Leases have been signed on 60 per cent of
the first phases, but only 14 per cent of the tenants are installed.
The administrators' dilemma is that incentives offered by Olympia &amp; York to
tenants were so generous that it could be cheaper to persuade them not to
move.
Olympia &amp; York's policy was to ask high rents for space at Canary Wharf,
while offering large incentives to sweeten the deals for tenants in the
early phases of the project. Bankers believe that many of these deals do not
make sense now the project is in administration.
Canary Wharf's administrators, Stephen Adamson, Nigel Hamilton and Alan
Bloom of Ernst &amp; Young, are due to present their initial proposals for the
future of the project next Wednesday.

FT  20 JUN 92 / FoE plan to block bypass 'frivolous'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A DEVICE to block construction of a road by selling small plots of land to
protesters was dismissed as frivolous and vexatious by the High Court
yesterday.
The Norfolk branch of Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure
group, had paid about Pounds 2,000 for a  3/4 -mile stretch of disused
railway line lying across the proposed route of the Wymondham bypass. It
then sold off plots at Pounds 8.50 each to 1,700 supporters. FoE then
claimed that the Department of Transport had failed in its legal duty to
notify each individual plot owner of its plan to acquire their land through
compulsory purchase orders.
Mr Justice McCullough ruled that the scheme was a device to frustrate the
department. He struck out part of a court challenge to the orders, ruling
that the plot owners' argument based on ownership of the square-metre plots
was 'frivolous, vexatious and an abuse of the court process'.
Miss Denise Carlo, for Norfolk FoE and four individual plot owners, had been
given leave to seek judicial review on the grounds that, as landowners, they
had suffered a sense of grievance and substantial prejudice because they had
not been notified.
The judge said the plot owners had known that the purchase orders would be
made. The whole point of buying the plots was to frustrate the road scheme.
However, the judge said they could challenge the road plan on the limited
ground that the government disregarded evidence that, at a public inquiry in
May 1990, Mr Philip Richardson, the mayor of Wymondham, misrepresented the
views of the town council by saying that its members supported the
department's preferred route for the bypass.

LORD Wilson, the governor of Hong Kong, yesterday, hit out at China's
attempt to influence the composition of the colony's cabinet, saying
appointments were the prerogative of the governor.
Lord Wilson said that between now and 1997, when the colony reverts to
Chinese sovereignty, appointments would be made in Hong Kong by the governor
after consultation with the foreign secretary in London.
On Thursday a senior Chinese official said in Beijing that it would be
unacceptable to China if members of the United Democrats, a key political
party in the colony, were appointed to the cabinet, or executive council.
The Democrats won most of the popularly contested seats in last September's
elections. If the colony's incoming governor, Mr Chris Patten, decides to
reshape the membership of the cabinet some members of the Democrats are
likely to be offered seats.
The Chinese intervention was seen in Hong Kong as an attempt to set the
agenda for Mr Patten before he arrives on July 9.
Mr Yeung Sum, deputy leader of the Democrats, said yesterday China's
intervention in domestic Hong Kong politics was unwarranted. China could not
lay down preconditions for membership of the council, he said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RABBI Menachem Porush, a leading figure among Israel's ultra-orthodox
religious parties, broke off campaigning for next Tuesday's general election
to travel to Cairo this week at the invitation of Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak.
Speculation flashed around Israel that Mr Mubarak was seeking to persuade
the venerable rabbi that, after the election, his United Torah Judaism party
should side with Mr Yitzhak Rabin's Labour party - and its commitment to
accelerate Middle East peace talks - in coalition bargaining.
If so, he did not appear to be very successful. Rabbi Porush declared that
the religious parties tended to favour the hardline Likud party.
But Mr Mubarak may well be correct in assuming that the black-hatted
religious parties will play a power-broking role in the formation of the
next government. He may also be right if he reckons Mr Porush's statement
may not be the last word from the mysterious and intrigue-riddled
ultra-orthodox.
First, the parties have to secure their seats in the Knesset. The influx of
overwhelmingly secular Russian immigrants has diluted their strength in the
electorate. This, plus a welter of corruption allegations surrounding
orthodox party, has led to predictions that the four religious parties will
fail to hold the 18 seats they won in the 120-seat Knesset in the 1988
election.
What's more, the ultra-orthodox parties are concerned that Labour and Likud
are plotting to unite against them, to cut down their power-broking
influence and conscript into the army their hitherto exempt young men.
There has been a significant re-alignment in their ranks. The National
Religious party, whose members do not wear the black garb of the
ultra-orthodox, is unchanged, broadly aligned with Likud. But two of the
other three, Agudat Yisrael and Degel HaTorah, have combined to form the
United Torah Judaism party, attracting to their ranks a former leading
member of the Shas party.
A fierce battle lies behind this change. Degel, a party of Lithuanian
'Ashkenazi' Jews, used to be close to Shas, the party of 'Sephardi', or
Oriental religious Jews. But Rabbi Eliezer Schach, the 96-year-old spiritual
leader of Degel, shifted amid much bad blood to an alliance with his fellow
Ashkenazim of Agudat Yisrael.
This seemed odd, as Rabbi Schach has long been at odds with fellow
nonagenarian Rabbi Menachem Schneerson of Brooklyn. The ailing Rabbi
Schneerson is a leading influence in Agudat despite never having set foot in
Israel.
Secular Jews, never mind gentiles like Mr Mubarak, find all this hard to
penetrate. However, there are other pointers to how the parties may act
apart from Rabbi Porush's statements.
Both Rabbis Schach and Schneerson opposed Labour in its previous attempt, in
1990, to set up a pro-peace government. They are also united by their hatred
of what they see as the anti-religious stance of Labour.
The religious parties always require large dollops of public money to cement
their support for any government. Labour would be no less willing than the
Likud to stump up. But over the last 15 years, the religious have appeared
more comfortable in harness with Likud.

THE African National Congress yesterday stepped up its criticism of the
government after the massacre of nearly 40 people in Boipatong in the Vaal
triangle, but stopped short of saying it would pull out of negotiations.
The ANC made clear, however, that with discussion at the Codesa
constitutional forum deadlocked, the focus of its energies in coming weeks
would be devoted to taking the political struggle to the streets.
At a briefing for journalists and diplomats, Mr Ronnie Kasrils, ANC
campaigns co-ordinator, said it was hoping to have millions of people on the
streets by August, raising the possibility of a 'Leipzig option'. This
included a general strike, probably in mid-August.
In the course of a scathing attack on the government, Mr Cyril Ramaphosa,
ANC secretary-general, said earlier that more black people had died during
the three years of President F W de Klerk's administration than in the
previous 40 years of National party rule. Mr Ramaphosa said Mr de Klerk had
facilitated such slaughter by legalising the carrying of dangerous weapons
in 1990.
Another senior ANC official, Mr Joe Slovo, said the Boipatong massacre had
no link with the Soweto Day stayaway on June 16.
Referring to government warnings before June 16 that mass action would lead
to violence, Mr Slovo added: 'Every statement by the representatives of the
government, both before and after June 16, was an act of intimidation and an
act of incitement to violence. And it has come to pass that the prophecy has
been fulfilled by the prophets themselves.'

FT  20 JUN 92 / EC seeks oilseed subsidy compensation talks
</HEADLINE>

THE transatlantic wrangle over the European Community's oilseeds subsidies
took a new twist yesterday when the EC said it wanted to negotiate
compensation terms with the US under rules of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) that cover tariff increases.
The request, reluctantly accepted by Washington and approved by Gatt's
governing council, immediately prompted speculation that Brussels intended
to try to negotiate away its commitment under Gatt to duty-free access for
imports of oilseeds such as soyabeans, rapeseed and sunflower seeds.
The US, which claims its soyabean producers have lost Dollars 1bn (Pounds
540m) in sales to the Community because of EC subsidies, has already
threatened to slap punitive duties on Dollars 1bn of European exports if the
issue is not resolved.
The EC has threatened to retaliate if the US goes ahead with trade reprisals
outside Gatt procedures. However, yesterday's decision buys both sides more
time. Under Gatt's Article 28 (4) they now have 60 days to arrive at a
settlement.
US officials remain pessimistic about the chances of success. Mr Rufus
Yerxa, US ambassador to Gatt, told the Gatt council yesterday that, while
the US wanted a negotiated solution, it could not accept a deal that did not
directly address the problems faced by US soyabean producers. The EC has not
revealed what type of compensation - via lower tariffs on other goods - it
has in mind.
He said the compensation negotiations would be expensive for the EC, which
would have to cover not only the Dollars 1bn loss to US oilseed producers
from the subsidy regime but also a further Dollars 1bn of trade lost by
suppliers such as Argentina and Brazil.

FT  20 JUN 92 / World Bank admits Indian dam flawed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LONDON, NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE World Bank is to make substantial modifications in plans for one of the
world's biggest dam projects, after accepting criticism of the project in an
independent report as justified.
Mr Lewis Preston, the World Bank president, said the report on the
controversial Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.6bn) Narmada dam system in central India
had identified a 'number of deficiencies in the bank's appraisal of the
project, the borrower's implementation and the bank's supervision work'.
The independent inquiry, the first of its kind in the World Bank's history,
was set up after vociferous protests in India over the resettlement and
environmental aspects of the project.
In a rare and candid admission that the Bank had been wrong, Mr Preston
said: 'It is clear that performance under these projects has fallen short of
what is called for under Bank policies and guidelines and the policies of
the government of India.'
He said continued bank support for Narmada was justified but 'we should
proceed only if practical ways can be agreed to ensure that the pace of
further construction of the dam is adjusted to whatever extent is required
to permit a fully responsible approach to the resettlement and environmental
concerns'.
Mr Preston said analysis of the report and 'a set of specific remedial
actions' would be presented to the World Bank's board in the next few days.
The bank has promised to put Dollars 450m into the irrigation scheme along
the Narmada river, which flows through the north-eastern states of Madhya
Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra.
Opponents of the project say such huge dams are environmentally unsound and
accuse the state governments of resettling people, many of them tribal
people not integrated into India, on inferior land with inadequate
compensation.
The government says about 100,000 people will be displaced in the project.
Opponents put the figure at 250,000.

<TEXT>
MEMBERS of the Commonwealth of Independent States are counting on the
European energy charter to sort out the growing number of energy-related
disputes in the former Soviet Union, a senior EC official said yesterday.
But Mr Clive Jones, secretary general of the Energy Charter Conference,
warned that it would take time to reach agreement on the legally binding
treaty which will lay out legal safeguards for energy investment across
central and eastern Europe.
Mr Jones, who met CIS electricity ministers last month, said they were
strongly behind the energy charter. Many are likely to be given extra time
to implement the charter's disciplines. Meanwhile, it was 'essential for the
implementation of the market regime that (CIS members) bring their prices up
to world levels'.
The charter itself was signed in December, but its implementation depends on
the 47 signatories producing a binding 'basic agreement' which will put its
principles into practice.

FT  20 JUN 92 / US opposes Serb move to divide Sarajevo
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US OFFICIALS were yesterday trying to apply pressure on the United Nations
to oppose attempts by Serb irregulars to divide the Bosnian capital,
Sarajevo, along ethnic lines.
Concerns are growing that the Serbs are seeking to link this move with
negotiations with UN representatives on re-opening the capital's airport.
Officials said heavily armed Serb irregulars were consolidating their
positions in the north and west of the city, and near the airport, by the
day.
Serb units have blockaded Sarajevo for the past 77 days to prevent any food
and humanitarian supplies from reaching its 300,000 inhabitants.
'You can see exactly what is happening,' a western diplomat said. 'The Serbs
are taking advantage of any ceasefire to re-group, and also give the
impression they are acting in good faith. This is nonsense. It must be
stopped,' he added.
Bosnian officials yesterday said 7,000 people had died in the fighting in
Sarajevo and other parts of the former Yugoslav republic since early April.
A UN official said the world body had neither the mandate nor the means to
stop Sarajevo from being divided. 'Our mandate is to negotiate an agreement
which will allow us to re-open the airport and start the airlift of food
into the city,' he explained.
Another UN official said the Serb irregulars and Serbia's proxy Bosnian
army, led by Mr Radovan Karadzic and General Ratko Mladic, promised to start
withdrawing from Sarajevo airport today to allow relief flights into the
city.
The agreement was made as the city came under renewed shelling and heavy
bombardment from the surrounding hills held by Serb irregulars.
The Serb forces have agreed to withdraw their heavy artillery batteries 6km
from the airport, while an earlier arrangement, backed by the Bosnian
presidency, wanted a 20km demilitarised zone.
Western diplomats said this would still allow the Serb forces to keep large
supplies of weapons close to Sarajevo. 'This means they can bombard the
city, and consolidate their green line any time,' a diplomat said. 'No
wonder the Territorial Defence (consisting of Sarajevo's Moslem, Serb, and
Croat communities) are angry with this agreement.'
The Bosnian presidency, led by Mr Alija Izetbegovic, has repeatedly called
for international military intervention to prevent the city from being
divided.
Meanwhile Lord Carrington, chairman of the European Community peace
conference on Yugoslavia, said he was 'concerned that all-out war would
spread to Bosnia.' A Bosnian official asked yesterday: 'What does he think
has been taking place here for the past three months?'

FT  20 JUN 92 / The Irish Referendum: Major's plan is to seek new view of
accord - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE decisive Yes vote in yesterday's Irish referendum brought the expected
relief in Whitehall - alongside an acknowledgment that for Mr John Major a
second chance for the Maastricht accords carries risks as well as
opportunities.
British ministers believe the deal on economic and political union has been
reprieved rather than rescued. A mechanism has still to be found to persuade
the Danes to reverse their vote. The accord must also survive the
unpopularity of President Francois Mitterrand in the French referendum.
But the confident tone of Mr Major's dismissal yesterday of the calls from
Euro-sceptics in his own party for a renegotiation of Maastricht suggested
that, for now at least, he is focusing on the opportunities.
Mr Major, whose government takes over the EC presidency on July 1, has the
task of securing a settlement which meets the fears of the Danes without
unravelling the Maastricht treaties.
He hopes the British presidency will secure a re-interpretation of the
direction in which Maastricht will take the Community. In satisfying
Denmark, Mr Major believes he can marginalise the Euro-sceptics in his party
and secure enough support for ratification in parliament.
The basic strategy is to give substance to the once dubious British
contention that Maastricht could represent a break with the 'centralising
process' in the Community created by the Single European Act.
Mr Major will seek ways to reinforce an interpretation of the treaty in
which closer European co-operation is set firmly on intergovernmental rather
than federalist pillars.
One possibility is the much tighter definition of subsidiarity already
floated by London. But it sees an unequivocal commitment to rapid
enlargement as equally important in persuading doubters in Denmark and at
home that Maastricht is not the precursor to a United States of Europe.
No one in London is certain how such formulae could be attached to the
Maastricht accord - nor what if anything might be enough to persuade the
Danish people to change their vote.
There are also too many other battles waiting to be fought - among them the
level of Community resources, the size of cohesion funds and the Gatt trade
talks - to allow for confident predictions that the route will be smooth.
But the task suits Mr Major's temperament. He is a politician adept at
building compromises, setting a painstaking approach to detail alongside an
ability to defuse confrontations.
The judgment in London is that Danes have clipped the wings of the
federalists and in the process greatly strengthened Mr Major's case as EC
president for the Community to put pragmatism first.
His colleagues believe there is a chance that by the time of the Edinburgh
summit, there will be a deal on the table that will stitch together again
the patchwork of compromises agreed at Maastricht.
At home the Conservative Euro-sceptics will not give up. Next week the
European Reform Group of Conservative backbenchers - which claims around 80
members - will attempt to broaden its attack on European integration by
blaming the depth of the country's recession on sterling's participation in
the exchange rate mechanism.
But along with the Community, Mr Major has recovered his balance. For the
moment he rather than his party's rebels holds the initiative.

FT  20 JUN 92 / The Irish Referendum: Decisive pro-treaty vote by assembly -
Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE yesterday took a critical step towards ratification of the Maastricht
treaty by completing the first phase in the necessary revision of the French
constitution.
At the end of an all-night sitting, the National Assembly endorsed by 388 to
43 the text of the constitutional revision passed earlier in the week by the
Senate.
The change will now be finalised in a joint sitting of the two houses, known
as a Congress, which will take place in the Palace of Versailles. The size
of yesterday's majority together with the Senate vote suggest the government
should secure the necessary three-fifths majority in this Congress.
Originally scheduled for Monday June 29, the Congress may be brought forward
to next week, before the European summit in Lisbon. If so, the French and
the Irish would both be able to take encouragement to a summit which is
bound to be dominated by the problems of ratifying the Maastricht treaty.
Yesterday's vote again underscored the deep divisions over Maastricht in the
conservative opposition parties, between the RPR Gaullists and their allies
in the centrist and centre-right UDF parties.
The Gaullists made another abortive attempt to prevent the debate with a
procedural blocking motion; when that failed they refused to take any
further part in the debate. After the vote, the Gaullist leadership accused
the UDF and Centrists of seeking to form an alliance with the Socialists.
But the government paid a price for its large majority, since it was forced
to concede an increase in the constitutional powers of the Senate (which is
dominated by the conservative parties).

FT  20 JUN 92 / The Irish Referendum: Result lifts gloom in bond markets -
Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE gloomy mood of European bond markets was partially lifted by the Irish
referendum result. However, late selling pushed bond prices lower and
traders predicted months of uncertainty until the future of monetary union
is determined.
Yesterday, the biggest gains were posted by high-yielding government bond
markets such as Spain and Italy. These have most to gain from monetary union
but have fallen sharply since Denmark rejected the Maastricht treaty.
Other bond markets showed strong price rises during the morning session as
the result of the referendum became clear, but fell back through the
afternoon. UK gilts closed almost unchanged on the day, with French and
German government bonds finishing slightly lower.
'The pattern is the same in most European markets. There is selling into any
rally,' commented Mr George Magnus, international bond analyst at Warburg
Securities. Analysts noted the Irish vote did nothing to remove uncertainty
over whether Maastricht will be ratified and on what terms monetary union
might take place.
'It is going to be a long, tense summer in the run-up to the French
referendum,' commented an Italian government bond trader.
Spanish government bonds rose around half a point at the benchmark 10-year
maturity, adding to gains made on Wednesday and Thursday. However, even
after posting a 1 1/2 -point rise on the week, Spanish bonds remain well
below the levels before the Danish referendum.
At the close yesterday, the benchmark 10-year Spanish government bond stood
at around 93.50, still 3 1/2 points below its level on June 2, before the
result of the Danish vote was known.
The pattern was similar in Italy, with prices rising by up to three quarters
of a point in early trading but late selling eroded some gains. Italian bond
trading was volatile last week, with sentiment undermined by the weakness of
the lira in the European exchange rate mechanism. Traders said the rally was
driven by domestic Italian investors.

THE Irish vote confirmed Denmark's isolation from its EC partners following
the rejection of the Maastricht Treaty by Danish voters this month.
Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the foreign minister, said the Irish result made it
more likely than ever that the other 11 member states would complete their
ratification of the treaty.
This would force Denmark to work out the best way of co-operating with the
other 11.
He said Denmark had no interest in a divided Europe or that the process of
European co-operation should be halted.
The government's strategy is to await completion of the ratification
process.
Only then will Denmark, which assumes the EC presidency on January 1, take
any initiative.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AN incorrect reply was given in the item last week headed 'Death duty
again'. It ignored paragraph 2 of schedule 6 to the Inheritance Tax Act
1984.
The correct position as stated in Chapter 7.17 of the Inland Revenue IHT 1
booklet is: 'Where estate duty was paid on the death of one spouse on
property in which the other was given a limited interest, for example, for
life or widowhood or widowerhood, the property was usually exempt from
estate duty on the death of the survivor. In such a case when the survivor
dies, or the interest comes to an end or is disposed of, there will be no
charge to IHT on the settled property if it would have been exempt from
estate duty on the survivor's death.'
IHT would not be payable on the death of the life tenant on the value of the
settled fund as described by our reader.

</HEADLINE>

   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and COLIN MILLHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHOCK caused by the withdrawal of GPA's global share offer sent tremors
through the aerospace sector, leading to falls in British Aerospace and
Rolls-Royce.
At the day's worst, BAe was down 28 as confidence in the aviation industry
received a sharp knock. Some dealers also talked of the possible effects of
the GPA move on its orders for Airbus aircraft. GPA is one of Airbus's
biggest customers and BAe holds 20 per cent of the Airbus equity.
Sentiment was further weakened by fears of bad news when the BAe chairman
met UK analysts yesterday evening in Berlin. Bargain hunters helped the
shares come off the bottom and they ended 16 down at 277p on 3.6m turnover.
Rolls-Royce was also affected by the news from GPA but it was speculation,
later proved unfounded, regarding problems at an important customer of
Rolls-Royce which caused the increased turnover and fall in share price.
Volume rose to 13m as the shares retreated 8 to 161p. Profit-taking after
the recent rise in the shares was also said to have been a factor.
Gloom at ICI
A gloomy progress meeting at ICI prompted a number of securities houses to
cut their forecasts for the group and led to a sharp fall in the share
price. The stock was further affected by the continuing overhang of the
stake sold by Hanson. The shares closed a net 36 lower at 1235p.
Mr Charles Lambert of Smith New Court said the previous consensus forecast
for 1992 profits had been Pounds 955m, and he was cutting back to Pounds
875m from around the Pounds 900m mark. One ICI broker was widely believed to
have cut his estimate to Pounds 830m from Pounds 900m.
Analysts said ICI highlighted the disappointing performance of Agrichemicals
and the flat progress of the industrial chemicals arm. Mr Lambert added:
'They are saying nothing particularly different from anyone else in the
industry, but they had shown a glimmer of hope at the end of the first
quarter and, formally, they have gone more cautious than they were.'
The shares were also overshadowed by the 2.8 per cent stake that Goldman
Sachs bought from Hanson for 1400p a share in early May. The US investment
bank is still thought to have at least 10m of the shares on its book.
Ladbroke supported
Best performer in the leisure sector yesterday was Ladbroke, which put on 2
to 208p as Hoare Govett and County NatWest both turned buyers. The shares
had been under pressure for several weeks following a series of downgrades,
with analysts focusing on the group's property portfolio, particularly in
the US.
According to Ms Lisa Gordon at County, Ladbroke is now trading at close to a
10-year relative low, and 'in a market looking for decent yields the company
promises a safe 7.6 per cent based on a 6 per cent increase in dividend this
year'. Mr Hamish Dickson at Hoare agrees and, while retaining reservations
about the property exposure, believes Ladbroke will generate sufficient
revenue to raise its dividend.
Rumours of a downgrade in Forte by its broker, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew,
persisted in spite of the house's firm denial. It was said that UBS was now
at the bottom of the market range. The shares receded 5 to 209p.
A number of big Footsie stocks saw heavy trading yesterday as a rumour went
round the market that the Kuwait Investment Office was lightening its
portfolio. There was also talk that depressed marketmakers were cutting both
their losses and books after a grim week.
A block of 9m British Gas shares traded at 184 1/2 p was behind a heavy
overall turnover of 23m for the stock, which fell 5 1/2 to 247p. Royal Bank
of Scotland saw a line of 9m shares dealt each way at 185p and closed 9 off
at 186p. Hanson, enlivened by a block of 6m shares sold into the market,
slipped 5 1/2 to 209 1/2 p with 21m traded.
Flotation worries and a profits forecast cut hit Lasmo, which fell 10 to
199p. Analysts had generally expected the oil exploration company to
announce the pricing for the flotation of its North American assets acquired
when it bought Ultramar. The announcement was expected on Wednesday, but its
non-appearance combined with the withdrawal of the GPA float created market
concern. Also, Strauss Turnbull revised its 1992 forecast to a loss of
Pounds 27m from a previously estimated deficit of Pounds 4m.
Wellcome, expected to raise about Pounds 4bn through a heavy share flotation
this summer, was also hurt by the GPA news. The shares fell 25 to 919p.
However, analysts remained convinced that the flotation was secure.
A 10 per cent dividend rise and profits towards the top of market
expectations failed to prevent water company Severn Trent declining 7 to
375p. Regional electricity supplier Manweb eased 2 to 342p after announcing
a 61 per cent increase in profits, in line with forecasts.
A block of around 9m shares in United Biscuits was reported to have stuck in
the market. United, hit by a profits downgrading earlier this week, lost 5
1/2 to 362p as 2.1m shares were traded. Hillsdown was off 5 at 159p after a
substantial placing resulted in turnover of 28m shares.
Bass managed to gain a penny to 604p as shares in the leading brewing and
drinks groups generally weakened. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew refused to comment on
suggestions that the securities house had recommended a switch into Bass and
out of Whitbread 'A', down 10 at 434p.
Mr Andrew Thompson, analyst at Kleinwort Benson, advised investors
overweight in Allied-Lyons to switch into Grand Metropolitan, but added that
he is only making such a recommendation after Allied's recent rise and has
not changed his advice on the stock from a hold. Allied slipped 18 to 644p,
while GrandMet lost 6 to 475p but performed better than most leading shares
in the sector.
Guinness, 10 cheaper at 573p, was depressed by a profits downgrading from
Kleinwort.
Tyne Tees Television jumped 34 to 263p following a Pounds 30m agreed bid
from Yorkshire TV, which fell 7 to 169p.
Speculation in the French media that a takeover for Eurotunnel was in the
pipeline helped lift the shares 8 to 345p.
Shares in TI, which recently took over aerospace and information technology
company Dowty Group, were affected by the GPA announcement and fell 14 to
353p. Also affected by the same sentiment was British Airways, 7 lighter at
263p.

FT  19 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Bearish factors overwhelm equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONFIDENCE cracked on the London stock market yesterday in the face of a
wave of alarming developments at home and abroad. Equities suffered their
worst trading session of the year as the FT-SE Index fell nearly 40 points
by mid-afternoon and large lines of blue chip stocks came on to the market.
Most of the damage to share prices came early. London had already reacted
strongly to the falls overnight of 400.24 on the Nikkei Index and 41.73 on
the Dow Average when it was dealt a further and, in immediate terms, more
serious blow. GPA, the world's largest aircraft leasing group, withdrew its
planned Dollars 1bn global share offering, barely four hours before it was
due to announce the pricing details.
Not even this unprecedented development, however, proved to be the end of
the day's woes. ICI's share price began to crumble as the first reports
trickled back to the City from the company's meeting with analysts, who then
began to cut profits forecasts for Britain's blue chip chemical group. The
ICI meeting caused fresh doubts over the progress of UK companies.
The Footsie dropped to a day's low of 2,558.6, abandoning an important
support level as large blocks of stock in such well-known names as British
Gas, Midland Bank and Hanson came on to the market.
An attempted rally was unsuccessful and, although Wall Street was only 5 Dow
points off in London trading hours, the UK market closed in a mood of gloom.
The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,562.7 for a day's loss of 35.7.
The GPA decision, prompted by a lack of institutional support in London and
the US, cast a chill over the rest of the aerospace sector and also
discouraged stocks such as Wellcome and Lasmo where prospective share
placings were threatened.
The depressed state of the market yesterday masked a relatively favourable
reception for the day's statistics on UK employment, unit costs and money
supply. The increase in May's unemployment total was smaller than expected,
and buttressed the view that 'economic recovery is in place rather than in
doubt', according to Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull.
Some of the pressures came from basket trading between stock and stock index
futures. Today brings Triple Witching Hour on Wall Street and also expiry in
London of the June contract on the Footsie. A very large seller of the
September Footsie future appeared in London yesterday afternoon, and several
leading trading houses were struggling to square up open positions between
futures and the underlying blue chip stocks.
Seaq-reported volume increased sharply to 517.9m shares from the 423.7m of
the previous session. But these figures include both customer and
intra-market business. Customer, or retail, activity in UK equities has
remained light this week, and was worth only Pounds 868.7m on Wednesday. The
low level of genuine customer investment business has left some traders with
exposed positions in both the June contract on the Footsie and also in the
blue chip stocks.

FT  19 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow follows overseas shares
lower
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street
FRESH weakness on overseas markets brought further pressure to bear on US
share prices yesterday, which extended their recent sharp fall as investors
worried about the effect on equities of today's expiration of derivatives
contracts, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 13.64 lower at 3,274.12.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 slipped 1.30 to 400.96, while
the American SE composite finished 2.25 down at 377.49 and the Nasdaq
composite 4.07 off at 549.17. Turnover on the New York SE came to 225.6m
shares.
After opening lower following the big declines in Tokyo and London, the
market found little comfort in the day's economic news. The April US trade
deficit of Dollars 7bn was wider than expected, while the decline in weekly
jobless claims was smaller than forecast and indicative of a weak labour
market.
One feature was investor wariness about buying ahead of today's expiration
of futures and options contracts. With the market in its current vulnerable
state, there was concern that the expirations, always a potentially
disruptive force on underlying equity prices, could send shares into a
prolonged tail-spin.
Among individual stocks, Advanced Micro Devices plunged Dollars 5 1/2 to
Dollars 9 in turnover of 8.3m shares after a federal jury ruled that the
company cannot use a piece of Intel software in its clones of Intel
microprocessors. The news lifted Intel Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 51 in
turnover of 8m shares.
IBM rose Dollars 2 to Dollars 94 5/8 after an earnings upgrade from broking
house Merrill Lynch, which raised its 1992 and 1993 profits estimates for
the computer group to Dollars 7.25 and Dollars 9 a share respectively. IBM's
rise gave an initial lift to other big computer stocks, but afternoon
selling erased the gains. Hewlett-Packard finished unchanged at Dollars 65
1/4 , Digital Equipment was off Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 36 1/8 and Compaq
lost a net Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 23 5/8 . Apple, which similar to Intel
is quoted on the Nasdaq market, fell Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 45 1/4 .
Ashland Oil declined Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 27 3/8 after the company said
it expected third-quarter net income to be well below the Dollars 1.19 a
share earned a year ago. On the Nasdaq market, J &amp; J Snack Foods plummeted
Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 9 after warning that third-quarter earnings will be
below the 20 cents a share produced a year earlier.
Canada
TORONTO posted a modest decline in moderate trading after Wednesday's sharp
fall. The composite index ended 11 points weaker at 3,357.2, while losing
issues outnumbered advances by 288 to 235 after volume of 26.5m shares
valued at CDollars 308.4m.
Air Canada, up 25 cents at CDollars 4.95, said passenger traffic increased
by 15.9 per cent in May from a year earlier. The company also announced that
it intends to sell five freighter aircraft.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar slips on trade figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR lost more than a pfennig against the D-Mark on the foreign
exchange markets yesterday following news of a larger than expected US
merchandise trade deficit, writes James Blitz.
The deficit widened to Dollars 6.97bn in April from a revised Dollars 5.58bn
for March, sending the dollar downwards as the American markets opened.
Earlier, in late Asian trading, the US currency had appreciated to above
DM1.58 following short-term positioning by dollar investors.
Yesterday's trade figures, however, quickly pushed it down to a low of
DM1.5630, before ending in London at DM1.5650 against a previous close of
DM1.5780. In New York the dollar improved to a DM1.5673 finish.
Underlying the dollar's drop is uncertainty about the US economy. A London
analyst said he had revised downwards his view that the dollar could bottom
out at DM1.56. The economic recovery remains weak and speculation about
another easing of interest rates by the Federal Reserve hangs over traders.
Also playing on nerves is the strong candidacy of Mr Ross Perot for the US
Presidency. A serious three-way contest for the American leadership makes it
uncertain whether there will be a clear result. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief
economist at Yamaichi International in London, said: 'Investors will have
little appetite for acquiring dollars before the US election is out of the
way.'
The dollar's weakness was again a by-product of D-Mark strength. The Irish
referendum on European union, the result of which will be known today,
continued to worry traders.
The Italian lira had a bad afternoon, dipping below L758 to the D-Mark and
threatening to test its lower limit in the European Monetary System against
the strongest currency, the Portuguese escudo. In response, the Bank of
Italy moved up its short-term money market intervention rate by  1/2
percentage point to 14.8 per cent.
The D-Mark was stronger against sterling, which closed  1/2 pfennig down at
DM2.9200. The French franc was also softer against the German currency, at
FFr3.3703 against FFr3.3690.
The yen, although finishing firmer against the dollar, was weaker against
the D-Mark, prompted by the overnight fall in the Japanese stock market.
Stocks ended at a 68-month low, with the Nikkei average barely above 16,000.
Suggestions that the leaders of the Group of Seven leading industrial
nations will call for a higher yen at their summit next month are keeping
the currency strong. But that strength may disappear if the Japanese economy
weakens further. The yen ended down against the D-Mark at Y80.99, compared
to a previous Y80.51.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Money Markets: Bullish undertone
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BULLISH undertone to trading in the sterling cash market continued
yesterday, even though the Bank of England forecast a large shortage which
dealers took most of the day to remove.
Period rates were a touch softer at the close of trading, perhaps because
the market was still swayed by the UK chancellor of the exchequer's comments
the previous day. Mr Norman Lamont had suggested that sterling could enter
the narrow bands of the European Monetary System, with the implication that
a stronger currency would make a base rate cut more likely.
One trader felt that the expectation of a base rate reduction may also have
been strengthened by stock market difficulties in Japan, where the Nikkei
average ended down 400.24 at a 68-month low. The possibility of a drop in
world stock markets encouraged some traders to think that central banks
could ease interest rates to reverse the trend.
Whatever the reason, the markets had a bullish undertone. 1-month money in
the sterling interbank market ended at 9 15/16 per cent from a previous 10
1/16 per cent. 3-month money closed at 9 31/32 per cent, down from 10 per
cent.
In the futures market, however, the September short sterling contract lost
two ticks to 90.24 and December was down one tick at 90.54.
This was a less bearish performance than it might have been, considering
that the market took the entire day to remove a shortage forecast at Pounds
1.2bn in the morning. Traders appeared to be unwilling to offer bills,
perhaps holding their fire before the even larger shortage expected today.
The overnight rate spent much of the day around 12 1/2 per cent.
Again, the Bank dealt at the established rates of 9 7/8 per cent for Bands 1
and 2, 9 21/32 per cent for Band 3, 9 19/32 per cent for Band 4 and 9 15/16
per cent for the repurchase agreements (repos).
In early operations, the Bank purchased Pounds 7m of Band 3 bank bills, and
Pounds 80m for resale to the market in equal amounts on July 8 and 9. The
Bank then bought Pounds 68m in Band 1, Pounds 15m in Band 3, Pounds 7m in
Band 4 and Pounds 30m in repos.
In the afternoon, the Bank purchased Pounds 692m in Band 1, Pounds 5m in
Band 2, Pounds 56m in Band 3, Pounds 5m in Band 4 and Pounds 20m in repos.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Government Bonds: Italian seesaw continues as fears of
devaluation persist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALIAN government bond prices leapt and then plummetted yesterday in a
second day of highly-volatile trading as the Bank of Italy failed to lift
the spectre of devaluation from the market.
Bond prices opened lower on continuing fears about the outcome of the Irish
referendum on the Maastricht agreement, but jumped later in the morning as
Mr Giuliano Amato was asked to form a government, raising some hopes that
Italy will finally tackle its constitutional crisis.
The market took further heart from reports that the Finance Ministry is
considering abolishing the 12.5 per cent withholding tax paid by foreigners
on government bonds. 'We've heard before that they're thinking about this,'
said one sceptical observer. 'They don't yet have a treasury minister, and
when they do, he will have more urgent things to think about than
withholding tax.'
The market's confident mood did not last. A sharp rise in the rate paid at
the morning repurchase auction (the minimum rate was 14.8 per cent, up from
14.3 per cent yesterday) sent a strong signal of the Bank of Italy's
intention of protecting the lira. But that didn't stop the currency falling
back later, raising fears that the authorities will be forced over the
weekend to raise the discount rate.
The sharp price movements were reflected in the futures contract on Liffe.
Having opened at 95.46, the contract leapt to 95.71 before sliding down to
94.98. It ended the day back at around 95.28.
LONGER-dated UK government bonds fell slightly as the market trod water,
waiting for the result today of the Irish vote on the Maastricht agreement.
Early rumours that the Irish had followed the Danes in voting 'no' were
largely disregarded, but did not help the mood - particularly as the gilt
market is already waiting nervously on next week's Pounds 2.75bn gilts
auction.
Against that background, mildly encouraging earnings data (average earnings
rose by 7 per cent in the year to April, down from 7.5 per cent in March)
failed to lift the market's spirits.
The 9 per cent bonds due 2011 lost  1/8 of a point to 99 21/32 , a yield of
9.03 per cent, although shorter-dated gilts held steady.
MONTHLY US trade deficit and weekly jobless claims data that was mildly
bullish for Treasury markets gave a modest boost to bond prices yesterday.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/4 at 102
3/16 , yielding 7.797 per cent. The two-year note was also firmer, up  1/16
at 100 13/32 , to carry a yield of 4.885 per cent.
Investors reacted positively to the news that the trade gap widened to
Dollars 6.97bn in April, with exports falling and imports rising only
slightly, due primarily to higher oil prices. The figures, along with the
much smaller-than-expected 2,000 decline in jobless claims for the first
week of June, confirmed that the economy is recovering only slowly.
Treasury prices were also said to have been supported by expectations of a
'flight to quality' by equity investors scared away from stocks by the
steady recent decline in share prices.
THE continuing collapse in Tokyo share prices helped to fuel expectations of
a more relaxed monetary stance from the Bank of Japan, prompting buying of
short-dated paper in particular.
Mr Yasuchi Mieno, Bank of Japan governor, had continued to stress on
Wednesday that there would be no change in the authorities' stance: but the
damage done by falling share prices on the banking system and hence the
supply of credit left many convinced Mr Mieno would have no choice but to
change his official position soon.
The yield on the benchmark bond No 129, which closed on Wednesday with a
yield of 5.405 per cent, fell further to 5.385 per cent.

FT  19 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Japanese brokers see return
to profits
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S leading four brokers reported generally lower profits from their
overseas operations last year, adding to the bruises they suffered on the
Tokyo stock market.
While Nomura Securities was the only one of the quartet to report a
consolidated after-tax profit last year, all four brokers expect a return to
profits this year.
Daiwa Securities, which reported stronger overseas earnings, and Nikko
Securities both managed to report consolidated pre-tax profits. Yamaichi
Securities reported both before and after-tax losses for the year to the end
of March.
Nomura, the largest Japanese broker, said the combined pre-tax profit of its
overseas subsidiaries fell 59.1 per cent to Y8.8bn (Dollars 69.29m), leaving
a group profit of Y46.2bn, down 81.2 per cent. But the company, as it did
for parent profits, predicted a turnround for the coming year, forecasting a
41 per cent increase in consolidated profit to Y65bn.
In explaining its 58.4 per cent increase in the earnings at overseas
subsidiaries, Daiwa said it had done well in US Treasury bonds and in
mortgage-backed securities. But the group was still dominated by the
parent's problems at home and reported an 84 per cent plunge in pre-tax
profit to Y20.3bn.
Nikko reported a 20.5 per cent fall in the earnings of its overseas
subsidiaries and an 89.3 per cent fall in group pre-tax profit to Y8.6bn,
while Yamaichi announced a 4.6 per cent fall in overseas subsidiaries'
profit and a loss of Y30.5bn, against a pre-tax profit of Y71.6bn the
previous year.
Each of the brokers hoped for a revival of the Tokyo market to produce an
upturn in profits this year, but the continuing weakness of the Nikkei
average and low turnover is likely to have left them with worse than
expected results for the first quarter, ending this month.

NZDollars 407m

<TEXT>
ELECTRICORP, the New Zealand state-owned enterprise embroiled in controversy
over a crisis in national electricity supplies, yesterday announced net
profits of NZDollars 407m (USDollars 226.1m) for the year to March 31
compared with NZDollars 404m a year earlier.
It warned that profits could drop to Dollars 250m in the current year as it
is being forced to maximise the use of expensive coal and oil-powered
thermal stations due to near-drought conditions in the South Island's lakes
used to supply 60 per cent of the country's electricity.
Critics say Electricorp failed to conserve lake levels in the hope that
rains would come, a point the corporation disputes strongly.
Electricorp yesterday signed an agreement under which it will pay Comalco,
the Australian aluminium producer, NZDollars 10m to close one-third of the
capacity at its Bluff aluminium smelter. The deal will allow 170MW of power
to be diverted for use elsewhere in New Zealand. Comalco and its Sumitomo
owners say the partial closure will cost it more than NZDollars 20m.
There is widespread concern in New Zealand at the effect of the electricity
shortage on industry which is working hard to conserve power. However, Mr
Jim Bolger, prime minister, has ruled out accepting an official's
recommendation that industry go on a four-day working week.
Announcing the latest result, Mr John Fernyhough, Electricorp chairman, said
the rate of return on shareholders' funds of 12 per cent was lower than the
12.2 per cent of 1990-91 and was due to delaying power increases and the
higher than anticipated fuel costs from December to March due to low
hydro-storage levels.
He said extra costs faced by Electricorp this year would be at least Dollars
150m because of the crisis. But he said forecasting profits was difficult
due to the hydroelectricity problem.

FT  19 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Siemens withdraws from chip
plant deal with IBM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Financial Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIEMENS, the German elect-ronics group, is reducing its participation in the
semiconductor memory market in a move that could mean the end of European
memory production.
Siemens has decided not to build a manufacturing plant for advanced
semiconductor memory chips which it has been developing with IBM, the US
computer group, in an agreement made a year ago.
'We are not going to build a 64-megabit D-Ram facility with IBM,' a Siemens
representative said. 'The intention is that we will not be a major player in
the D-Ram market after the 16-megabit.'
Meanwhile, IBM said yesterday it was looking for a partner to collaborate in
the manufacture of 64-megabit D-Rams in Europe.
'At present we continue to plan for 64-megabit manufacture in Germany. We
are looking for new partners within the timeframe of roughly one year,' IBM
said.
The decision by Siemens does not mean it will pull out of the memory market
immediately.
It still manufactures 1-megabit, 4-megabit D-Rams and is collaborating with
IBM in 16-megabit production.
However, it does mean when those products are replaced in the latter half of
the decade by future generation products, Siemens is not likely to be a
participant in the D-Ram market.
Its decision stems from its view that longer-term demand for D-Rams will
decline, and since intense competition has led to sharp price falls and many
manufacturers of D-Rams are losing money, it does not make sense to continue
to invest in that product.
The worldwide market for D-Rams has been depressed over the past few years,
particularly in Europe, where manufacturers are willing to keep prices low
to increase market share, according to Mr Harding.
'There are too many D-Ram suppliers and companies who stay in D-Rams may
kill themselves,' said Mr Byron Harding at Dataquest, the high technology
consultancy.
Siemens had continued to manufacture memories, which were considered
technology drivers because it wanted to master the D-Ram manufacturing
process in order to move into more advanced technologies.
However, it no longer believes this is true. Instead it hopes to use skills
learned in the development of memories to manufacture more profitable
products, such as application-specific integrated circuits.
Siemens's decision to move away from memories raises questions over Europe's
ability to manufacture semiconductor memory chips, a market dominated by
manufacturers in Asia. The biggest memory manufacturers are Japanese.
Philips, Europe's largest semiconductor supplier, has already pulled out of
slow read-only memory chips (S-Rams) and has stopped selling erasable
programmable read-only memory (Eprom) chips while SGS-Thomson is not
participating in slow S-Rams and its profitability from Eprom sales has been
dwindling, according to Mr Harding.
Dell Computer saw its shares slump Dollars 5 3/8 to Dollars 15 3/4 at close
of trade in New York yesterday, after Dell's indication that it would match
price cuts by other computer-makers raised concerns among traders about
profits, writes Our Financial Staff.
The company held its annual meeting and an analysts' meeting yesterday.
Traders said some analysts may subsequently lower their earnings estimates.
More than 3m Dell shares were traded in New York yesterday.

loss
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NIPPON Mining, the Japanese petroleum refiner and copper company, reported a
consolidated pre-tax loss of Y3.34bn (Dollars 26.29m). It indicated that its
acquisition of Gould, a US computer and copper company, had been an
unexpected burden.
The loss for the year to end-March followed a profit of Y14.9bn in the
previous period, while the after-tax loss swelled to Y16.3bn, compared with
a profit of Y5.3bn. Group sales fell 12.7 per cent to Y1,052.9bn.
Sales have been falling in Japan, but the biggest problem for the company
has been the Illinois-based Gould, which it said had a Y24.6bn loss because
of costs associated with restructuring.
Gould, purchased in 1988, was meant to be the centrepiece of Nippon Mining's
expansion of its overseas operations and its diversification into
electronics. Those plans, however, have been compromised by the prolonged
slump in the computer and semiconductor markets.
The company admitted that its electronics-related business has been weak and
that demand for Gould's copper products has also been less than expected. It
is confident, however, that the liquidation of unprofitable businesses will
produce profits this year.
While Nippon Mining's sales were likely to have continued to fall, forecasts
for the current year are distorted by a merger with Kyodo Oil, scheduled for
December 1.

ASHLAND Oil, the Kentucky-based diversified energy company, yesterday

It added that it would sell assets valued between Dollars 200m to Dollars
250m to compensate for the shortfall in net income, given its large capital
spending requirements for petroleum refineries.
Ashland, which had net income of Dollars 76m, or Dollars 1.19 a share, in
the 1991 third quarter, blamed declining refinery margins and the cost of
meeting increased environmental regulations for the disappointing outlook.
Mr John Hall, chairman and chief executive, said: 'Without a marked
improvement in refinery margins over the balance of our fiscal year, we will
be unable to achieve last year's results for either our fiscal fourth
quarter or the year.
'We believe it is prudent to sell some assets in order to maintain our
financial flexibility during this difficult period in the industry,' he
added.
'We have attempted to select assets that are currently providing us with a
relatively low rate of return.'
Ashland is considering selling its SuperAmerica petrol and convenience
stores in Florida and its Arizona highway construction subsidiary. Some
smaller assets and parts of other businesses may also be put on the block.
The proceeds will be used to cut debt.
Ashland has retained First Boston to advise it on the dispositions.
On Wall Street yesterday, shares in Ashland closed Dollars 1 1/4 lower at
Dollars 27 7/8.

CONOCO, the energy subsidiary of the Du Pont chemicals group, has agreed to
a joint venture with the Russian government that could involve total
investment of as much as Dollars 3bn.
Conoco claimed last night the deal would mark the first time a US company
had become involved in the development from scratch of a Russian oil field.
First production is not planned until late in 1994.
Conoco said the 50-50 venture, between Arkhangelskgeologia of Russia and
Conoco Timan-Pechora Limited, would be named Polar Lights.
The area to be developed is in the northern Timan-Pechora basin, west of the
Ural mountains and near the Arctic Circle. Recoverable reserves in the first
field set for development are estimated to amount to about 110m barrels.
Conoco claimed the Polar Lights project differed from previous US-Russian
oil projects in that there was no current production in the area and the
entire infrastructure needed to be designed and built from scratch.

FT  19 JUN 92 / International Company News: Plans for Canary Wharf to be
revealed next week

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE administrators of Canary Wharf are expected to present their initial
proposals next Wednesday on the future of the Pounds 1.5bn (USDollars
2.77bn) project in London's Docklands.
According to papers filed by Olympia &amp; York with an Ontario court yesterday,
the Ernst &amp; Young partners who were appointed administrators in late May,
are to submit 'their initial findings and suggested strategy' at a meeting
with Canary Wharf's construction lenders in Toronto.
O&amp;Y also outlined a new debt-restructuring proposal which would include
extending repayments on most of its debt for five years, and the disposal of
some Canadian properties and other investments.
The company reaffirmed an earlier plan to convert some of its CDollars
13.5bn (USDollars 11.2bn) debt into equity, but it continues to insist that
control remain with its existing owners, Toronto's Reichmann family.
The court separately approved an application by a group of Canadian banks to
terminate 13 interest-rate swaps with O&amp;Y. The banks argued that the value
of the swaps, considered an asset, was declining as interest rates fell. The
move freezes the amount of the banks' claim against O&amp;Y in respect of the
swaps.
In its submission, O&amp;Y reiterated the importance of remaining a going
concern. It warned that immediate liquidation would result in 'significant
losses to virtually all groups of creditors'. It also said common management
of its properties 'serves to increase asset values in the aggregate'.
The latest restructuring proposals call for loans to be categorised as
convertible or non-convertible debt. At the end of the five-year standstill
period, convertible debtholders would have the option of exchanging their
claims into common shares,
The company also promised to draw up annual 12-month and 24-month business
plans to be approved by an operating committee representing the creditors.
It proposed liquidating marketable securities on an orderly basis, except
for certain core holdings, including its stakes in Gulf Canada Resources,
newsprint maker Abitibi-Price, and property developer Trizec.
O&amp;Y said yesterday it was selling its 50 per cent stake in a 12-storey
office building under construction in Budapest as the head office of
Hungarian Credit Bank. O&amp;Y expects to remain as manager of the project, but
the buyer, Budapest Financial Centre, will take over its obligation to
invest CDollars 12.5m in the project.
Meanwhile, O&amp;Y's information officer filed his first monthly report on the
ailing developer's financial condition yesterday and promised monthly
briefings to the company's far-flung creditors.
The reports stem from creditors' efforts to obtain more detailed information
since O&amp;Y filed for bankruptcy protection for its Canadian assets on May 14.
O&amp;Y handed control of the Canary Wharf project in London's Docklands to
administrators two weeks later, but its US buildings remain outside the
court orders.
The court order covers about two-thirds of O&amp;Y's CDollars 13.5bn debt.

<TEXT>
WOOLWORTH, the large US retail group, said yesterday it would accelerate its
plans to expand in Europe by opening at least 890 Foot Locker athletic
footwear and apparel stores in the next eight years.
The company, whose businesses range from general merchandise stores to
specialty chains, has 110 Foot Locker stores in seven European countries,
including Belgium, England and Germany. It expected to open 60 new stores by
the end of this year.
Woolworth had planned for about 1,000 Foot Locker stores in Europe in the
next 10 to 15 years. It estimated these could pull in Dollars 2bn in annual
sales.
At a shareholders' meeting in North Carolina Mr Harold Sells, chairman and
chief executive, said conditions in the athletic footwear market in Europe
were similar to the North American market about 15 years ago. Between 1983
and 1990, Foot Locker sales quadrupled to Dollars 1.5bn, but the rate of
growth has since slowed.
As the US athletic shoe market nears saturation, expansion into untapped
markets overseas has long seemed the logical next step.
Earlier this year, Woolworth said it would overhaul its operations by
selling or re-deploying 900 poorly-performing stores and eliminating 10,000
jobs.
Universal Matchbox Group, the Hong Kong-based maker of Matchbox die-cast
miniature cars and trucks, has received a reduced takeover offer from US toy
maker Tyco Toys. Tyco, which has offered Dollars 10.75 in cash and stock for
each Matchbox share in a deal worth Dollars 135m, did not release details of
the revised offer.

DOW CORNING, the 50-50 joint venture between Dow Chemical and Corning,
yesterday said it would take a Dollars 45m second quarter pre-tax charge for
costs related to its discontinued silicone breast implants.
In the same period last year, Dow Corning had net earnings of Dollars 40.5m
on sales of Dollars 462.1m.
The charge comes on the heels of Dollars 24m in implant-related expenses in
the first quarter and a Dollars 25m pre-tax charge in the fourth quarter.
Mr Keith McKennon, chairman and chief executive, said: 'We believe this
second quarter pre-tax charge, combined with previous charges, is sufficient
to cover reasonably anticipated costs associated with breast implants.'

<TEXT>
THE Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) has told the Spanish government that it
has no plans to withdraw its large industrial investment from the country in
spite of the costs of rebuilding Kuwait after the Gulf war and the
resignation this month of its long-time partner in Spain, Mr Javier de la
Rosa.
KIO's new management offered the reassurances to Mr Carlos Solchaga, the
Spanish finance minister, in Madrid on Wednesday.
Valuations of KIO's assets in Spain vary between Dollars 2bn and Dollars
7bn, but it is easily the country's biggest private investor, with 25,000
employees. The government has been worried by reports that KIO was
considering withdrawing.
In particular, the KIO's chemicals group, Ercros, is the mainstay of the
domestic chemicals and fertiliser industry and has suffered severe losses in
spite of heavy injections of government funds into its fertiliser
operations. Ercros lost nearly Pta16bn (Dollars 161.9m) last year, while
Grupo Torras, the main KIO holding company, saw profits fall 25 per cent to
Pta3bn, according to company filings.
It was being suggested in Madrid before the Wednesday meeting that the
government planned to insist that KIO reduce the debt - believed to total up
to Dollars 1.2bn - of its businesses, or at least provide new funds to
stabilise some of the companies. Reports that KIO planned to inject a
further Dollars 1bn into its operations in Spain could not be confirmed.
Mr de la Rosa, who acted as KIO's point man in Spain for nearly 10 years and
created the Torras group largely on his own, resigned as vice-president of
Grupo Torras to pursue his own business interests.
KIO is currently seeking an investment bank to monitor its investments in
Spain, but is also likely to post a Kuwaiti official to Spain for the first
time since it began investing here in 1984.

FT  19 JUN 92 / International Company News: Stainless steel makers set to
forge alliances - The renewed interest in partnerships between European
producers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW phase of restructuring is under way in the world stainless steel
industry. The spotlight has shifted away from foreign takeovers in the US
and has refocused on the forging of alliances in Europe.
Last month's announcement that British Steel and Avesta, the Swedish
stainless steel producer, were discussing potential collaboration raises the
prospect of a new force in the stainless industry to challenge France's
Usinor-Sacilor, which is the world's biggest producer.
Industry observers, and rivals of the UK and Swedish companies, are
convinced that a deal will soon be announced to unite what one analyst calls
'two second-division players'. This will not be the end of the
restructuring, they say, in an industry which remains plagued by
overcapacity - in spite of better growth prospects than in the
recession-torn carbon steel industry.
The restructuring in stainless began in the US before the current recession.
In the late 1980s, the US producers' relative inefficiency, poor investment
record and structural undercapacity in some product sectors turned them into
attractive acquisition prospects for efficient outsiders. Ugine, the Usinor
subsidiary, led the influx of foreign buyers and joint venturers.
The characteristics of the stainless industry make it particularly suited to
a global approach, according to Beddows, the strategy consultancy
specialising in the steel industry. This suggests that alliances will not
end with transatlantic deals:
All manufacturers share common internationally denominated raw material
costs and want to increase their purchasing power;
Grade specifications are becoming increasingly homogeneous worldwide, making
it easier to centralise research and engineering functions and then apply
the results to manufacturing facilities worldwide;
Globalisation makes the slow and expensive process of finding new
applications for stainless faster and cheaper by spreading the costs and the
benefits worldwide.
All these trends are now making their mark on European producers, which at
the same time have yet to tackle the problems of overcapacity in
manufacturing. In stainless flat products, says Mr Philippe Choppin de
Janvry, chairman and chief executive of Ugine, there is overcapacity of 20
per cent to 25 per cent, and much more in the smaller long-products sector.
Some overcapacity is necessary if producers are to respond to demand
increases, but the industry suffers from a chronic problem common to the
European steel sector generally: 'When things are going well, nobody wants
to restructure, but in bad times, no one is willing to take the pain,' says
Mr Rod Beddows, founder of the Beddows consultancy.
Short-term factors are encouraging partnerships, too. As the world stainless
industry begins to emerge from recession, European producers want to
position themselves to take advantage of the upturn. After a very poor
second half of last year, the European market for flat stainless products is
slowly improving and the US market is definitely picking up, says Mr Choppin
de Janvry.
For the medium-sized European producers, the recovery prospects, however
faltering, are a spur to salvage some of the financial strength which they
lost through the past two years of bleeding balance sheets.
Growth forecasts of 3 to 5 per cent for the stainless steel industry may
look unexciting, but dwarf the puny 0.5 per cent growth predicted for the
European carbon steel market.
Hence the needs for partnerships to produce benefits of scale that will
finance the long-term investments needed to exploit this growth, and keep up
with changing production technology trends.
There is a further reason for the renewed interest in partnerships and joint
ventures which the industry prefers to downplay.
In the summer of 1990, seven large European stainless producers shared a
token Ecu425,000 (Dollars 327,000) fine levied by the European Commission
for operating a price and production cartel.
British Steel was one of the seven, and Avesta was in the cartel but not
fined because it is based in Sweden, outside the EC. The ending of the
cartel, known as the Sendzimir Club after a stainless production process,
has increased competition in the European market.
British Steel and Avesta are staying silent about what kind of deal may
emerge from their talks, but are keenly aware of all the short and long-term
pressures on them.
A merger or joint venture between British Steel Stainless and Avesta, which
produces only stainless steel, would unite two similarly-sized, but
financially weak manufacturers to create one of the world's largest
producers with annual output of around 700,000 tonnes, eclipsed only by
Ugine, which claims output of about 860,000 tonnes.
Significantly, a link would produce a dominant player in the European
stainless sheet business, with a share of as much as 40 per cent of a market
supplying investment-intensive process-plant industries such as chemicals.
One analyst suggested this might attract the attention of the EC's
competition authorities.
For Avesta, a deal could make a big difference to the return on its new
'Steckel' mill for hot-rolling slab into coil - the first stage in the
production process for cold-rolled sheet. British Steel does not have a
dedicated stainless hot mill and is unlikely to buy one with its current
clampdown on capital spending.
For British Steel, the main benefit of a deal would be access to Avesta's
extensive overseas distribution network. Both companies, says Mr Beddows,
will gain more critical mass in the US.
The question remains whether any deal will lead to any significant reduction
in European stainless production capacity. Observers do not foresee
wholesale jobs cuts, either at Avesta or at British Steel, where more than
2,500 are employed in stainless, but some rationalisation looks likely. 'If
I were the boss, I would be rationalising,' says Mr Choppin de Janvry. 'I
know their management, it's very capable, and it will do the same.'
If a link-up between the two companies prompts further restructuring in the
industry, it could be the first step to a healthier sector. But closures,
particularly in long products, may still be unavoidable to achieve that.

FT  19 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Dawson surprises with 15% rise but cautious
on upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAWSON INTERNATIONAL, the Edinburgh-based textile and clothing group,
yesterday announced results which were slightly better than expected and
said order books were higher than a year ago.
But the company, which had seen profits decline every year since 1988,
remained cautious about an economic upturn in its main UK and US markets.
Dawson reported a 15 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 26.1m
to Pounds 30.1m in the year to March 28.
The increase was helped by Pounds 1.1m of currency gains on the dollar, a
Pounds 700,000 exceptional profit on an insurance claim and a lower interest
charge.
Turnover increased 6.6 per cent to Pounds 415m (Pounds 389.3m), helped by
Pounds 12.7m of currency gains.
At the interim stage Dawson reported a 6 per cent fall in profits to Pounds
16.2m on turnover of Pounds 217m (Pounds 214m). Mr Miller said the second
half improvement was helped by a recovery in cashmere fibre and yarn sales
and stabilised cashmere prices.
In the US, a mild winter affected sales of JE Morgan's thermal underwear and
volumes declined 6 per cent although the company said market share improved.
Interest charges fell to Pounds 5.54m (Pounds 6.85m) due to reduced working
capital, cash generation of Pounds 27.9m and falling US interest rates.
Capital expenditure fell from Pounds 15.2m to Pounds 9.43m while
depreciation increased to Pounds 12.4m (Pounds 11.2m).
Net borrowings at the end of the period were halved at Pounds 23.9m, against
Pounds 51.7m, giving gearing of 13.4 per cent, compared with 29.6 per cent.
Earnings per share advanced 7.5 per cent to 11.4p (10.6p). The company is
recommending an unchanged final dividend of 7.1p to make a maintained total
of 9p.
COMMENT
After three years of decline, can Dawson's long-suffering shareholders
finally look forward to some growth? Judging by yesterday's 5p rise in the
share price to 219p, against a falling market, the answer is yes. Analysts
were not only surprised by the profits, admittedly against last year's
depressed results, but also by the sharp fall in gearing, suggesting costs
and working capital are well set for recovery. But profit forecasts for this
year of Pounds 33m put the shares on more than 17 times. Although
acceptable, the rating suggests the market is already factoring in rises in
consumer confidence and confirmed autumn orders which, as the company
warned, are by no means in the bag.

FT  19 JUN 92 / UK Company News: SFO talks to Jersey police over Richmond
share deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SERIOUS Fraud Office, the London Stock Exchange and Jersey police met
last week to discuss possible irregularities in share dealings of Richmond
Oil and Gas, the beleaguered natural resource company which recently
announced that creditors had foreclosed on its main remaining asset.
Officials of the two UK regulatory organisations were briefed in Jersey by
local authorities, who raided a local accountancy firm under the island's
'investigation of fraud Jersey law 1991'.
The SFO is conducting a preliminary investigation into whether a full-scale
inquiry will be necessary.
The discovery was made when the Jersey fraud office raided the premises of
Bryant and Co in April, following a complaint by one of its clients that he
could not recover Pounds 150,000 given to the company for investment
purposes.
The office appeared to be deserted, with dead cigarettes lying in ash trays
and jumpers flung across the backs of chairs. However, police collected
thousands of files from the premises which have been passed to UK
accountants, Price Waterhouse, for analysis.
The exact current trading status of Bryant and Co is uncertain, local
officials said.
Detective Inspector Peter Hopper of the Jersey police declined to comment in
general terms, but stated that if irregularities were found they would be
referred to the regulatory bodies.
Also present in Jersey last week on a separate matter was Mr Herb Deutsch of
the New York law firm, Deutsch and Frey. The firm is representing Butte
Mining - under new management since last year - in litigation against more
than 70 defendants, including Bryant and Co. The case alleges fraud and
misrepresentation by former directors, executives and advisers.
Mr David Wilkinson, joint managing director of Richmond, said he had no
knowledge of any irregular share dealing in Richmond Oil's flotation. The
company's Pounds 21m flotation at 105p in July 1989 flopped amid concerns
over the valuation of assets against original purchase price. However, in
October the share price had begun a steady climb from 63p to 163p by
February 1990. The shares, which were 7p last night, hit a high of 173p in
the summer of 1990.

<TEXT>
GREENE King, the south of England's largest regional brewer, yesterday
extended its contested bid for its Oxfordshire-based rival, Morland, after
receiving acceptances from shareholders holding 46.22 per cent.
Greene King said its offer and cash alternative, which value Morland at just
over Pounds 100m, have been extended until July 2.
The acceptances included a 28.5 per cent stake Greene King acquired from
Whitbread Investment Company last month and a further 14.9 per cent stake
which Whitbread Investment has agreed to sell to Greene King if there is no
higher bidder.
Whitbread Investment had to reduce its stake in Morland by November to
ensure that its associate brewer, Whitbread, did not have to free more of
its pubs from tied beer supplies. Morland described independent
shareholders' response to the bid as 'paltry'.
Greene King is offering nine new convertible preference shares for every two
Morland shares, equivalent to 486p a share at yesterday's closing prices.
There is a cash alternative of 450p. Morland's shares were unchanged at 465p
while Greene King's shares held also steady at 523p.

FT  19 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Meat-eaters chew over changes in vegetarian
menu - A buy-out team hopes the Cranks chain has produced its last small
brown rock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERYONE LOVES a bargain and at the moment receivers across the land have
plenty. Does Cranks, the vegetarian restaurant chain recently purchased by a
management buy-out, come into that category?
The MBO, put together by Piper Trust, the retail consultancy, has bought
eight restaurant/takeaway outlets and the Cranks name - a brand that some
would say had passed its sell-by date, even though the healthy eating market
is growing.
In many minds Cranks will forever be tarred with a hippy brush or stuck with
an image of sandaled, CND-campaigning liberals, proselytising about the
virtues of bowls of bran and the evils of meat-eating.
Mr Ian Cheshire and Mr Christopher Curry, the non-vegetarian forces behind
the buy-out, hope to nail those prejudices, saying that vegetarians now come
from all walks of life and that at some time or other everyone chooses
non-meat, unprocessed dishes.
While anxious to preserve the 'integrity' of Cranks, they are keen to move
away from 'the small, brown rock school of wholefood cooking' - stodgy
grains and wheat - to lighter meals using more vegetables.
Overall, they are keen to tap into the consumer's general trend of eating
out more, but going for quality. Initially, the main changes will be in the
menu. For example the dough will be reformulated so that instead of being
available only in bap form, it can be baked in loaves, and can therefore be
sliced.
Piper has been sworn to silence by Stoy Hayward, the receiver, not to reveal
the financial size of the package it put together for Cranks.
However, Mr Curry, who runs Piper Retail Fund, the venture side of the MBO,
did admit that it was 'quite a lot less' than the Pounds 1.5m Piper bid in
1988 when Guinness, the then owner, sold it to Bewley's Cafes and Badger
Hale, the Irish catering chain and property developer. 'We're much happier
to have bought it now than then,' he says.
Stoy could have got more for the business, he adds, but receivers are
obliged to dispose of loss-makers as quickly as possible. In fact, there
were other contenders, one of which placed a higher bid, though with
'theoretical' money. Thanks to its previous bid and to its close knowledge
of the business, Piper already had its package sewn up and pipped the
others.
The close knowledge comes from Mr Curry and Mr Cheshire, his partner from
Piper Trust. While Mr Curry learned about Cranks when preparing the 1988
bid, Mr Cheshire's familiarity is more direct, stemming from his time at
Guinness, when Cranks was part of the drinks group's portfolio before it
reverted to its core businesses in the wake of the Distillers episode.
A child of its time and endorsed in the late 1960s by The Beatles and other
Swinging London luminaries, the health food company rode the crest of its
trendiness in the 1970s, but began to fall out of fashion in the 1980s.
Financially it was hit by the now familiar litany of 1980s scourges - too
much debt, over-rapid expansion, demand reduced by recession and spiralling
rent and rates.
In its most recent year, Cranks' pre-tax losses were Pounds 1.4m on sales of
about Pounds 4.5m. The restaurants broke even but the company was tipped
into receivership, on February 19, by interest costs and losses on the
wholesale side - which serviced such companies as P&amp;O, Safeway, Forte (its
Welcome Break motorway service stations), and Loseley.
You can cherry pick when buying from the receiver and so the factory in
Islington, London, which supplied food to all the outlets was not bought,
though Mr Curry and Mr Cheshire are keen to continue and expand the
wholesale side. They point to a 1991 survey which revealed that 12 per cent
of the UK population knew the Cranks name for its healthy eating reputation;
in the south-east the figure jumped to 25 per cent.
The duo will be forming a joint venture with a third party to license or
sub-contract out the food making process and harbour longer-term ambitions
to roll out frozen branded food products - 'like Bird's Eye's vegetable
meals', says Mr Cheshire - across the grocery multiples. In the first year
the emphasis will be on gaining wide distribution for a small range;
thereafter the variety of dishes will be expanded.
Another big change will be in the way Cranks is managed. Mr Cheshire
stresses that there will be a 'change of style - it won't be run from the
top down'.
The Piper Retail venture capital fund, backed by Standard Life and Royal
Life, has a stake of a little over 50 per cent and the balance is split
equally between Piper Trust and the middle managers, who previously worked
under Cranks' various owners.
These managers will be the operational team and, apart from the incentive of
growing the company to increase the value of their investment, they also
have the opportunity, in a complex arrangement dependent on profits, to
raise their stake from the low 20s to 30 per cent over the next five years.
The whole project is 'mostly equity financed with just a bit of debt'.
Mr Curry says that only half of Piper's package of 'substantially less than
Pounds 3m' went to acquire Cranks: the other half is to move the unwanted
kitchens in the restaurants, for development and expansion of the business.
Franchised restaurants outside the south-east - Mr Cheshire and Mr Curry
envisage expanding the chain - will be satellites to a Cranks-owned outlet.
Food would be supplied at cost to each franchise and Cranks would take 5 per
cent of sales.
As Body Shop prefers, Cranks' name would be on the lease, not the
franchisee's.
Other changes will be evolutionary. The woven basket lampshades - a
particular hate of Mr Cheshire - will go, but the pine-dominated decor will
only be changed when the money becomes available.

Bradstock Group, the insurance broker, improved pre-tax profits by 14 per
cent in the half year to March 31.
On turnover up 17 per cent to Pounds 12.3m (Pounds 10.5m) the pre-tax result
was Pounds 4.23m against Pounds 3.73m. Mr Oliver Plunkett, chairman, said
the direct retail broking businesses had shown remarkable progress with a 23

Earnings per share worked through at 4.65p (4.31p) and the interim dividend
is lifted to 1.45p (1.35p).
Mr Plunkett said prospects for the second half remained enigmatic and the
uncertainty surrounding the Lloyd's market made 'clairvoyance difficult on
the reinsurance side.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
J BIBBY &amp; Sons, the UK industrial and agricultural conglomerate owned by
Barlow Rand of South Africa, has raised its bid for Finanzauto, the Spanish
Caterpillar distributor, to Pta 1,500-a-share in the face of growing doubts
that its original Pta 1,300 offer would succeed.
The new price values the Spanish company at Pta 15.9bn (Pounds 86.2m), but
Bibby failed to secure Finanzauto's backing in talks with management on
Wednesday.
Finanzauto said yesterday that the offer was a clear improvement and that it
would pronounce on it early next week.
It is expected that it will drop its opposition - the company has valued its
stock at about Pta 1,700 - and adopt a neutral position.
Mr Richard Mansell-Jones, Bibby's chairman, said in Madrid yesterday he
would not increase the offer again. For technical reasons, he said citing
Spanish takeover regulations, 'it would be impossible to increase that
price'.
He was 'very confident' that the raised bid would be sufficient. 'We thought
we had an odds-on chance at Pta 1,300 and we feel it is a certainty at Pta
1,500.'
The new price would represent a price earnings ratio of 22 on Finanzauto's
1991 consolidated profits.
Heavy buying of Finanzauto stock hours before Bibby announced its new offer,
pushed the price beyond Pta 1,300 for the first time since the takeover was
launched. Bibby has requested an inquiry by the stock market commission into
the buying.

FT  19 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Chloride loses power and falls sharply to
Pounds 588,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RAY HORROCKS, chairman of Chloride, said yesterday that the batteries and
electronics company was now 'off the defensive', as it reported a sharp fall
in pre-tax profits from Pounds 5.05m to Pounds 588,000 for the year to March
31.
The world recession hit all the group's main markets, particularly in
uninterruptible power supplies and emergency lighting, which depend on the
computer and construction industries respectively.
He added that exchange rates hit the results hard, because of currency
depreciations in Zambia, Zimbabwe and Kenya. At last year's rates pre-tax
profits would have been Pounds 2.49m.
On the slimmed down group, he said: 'Chloride can now stop playing like the
English football team and can try to play like Sweden in the second half.'
In March 1991, Chloride sold most of its former core batteries business to
Hawker Siddeley, the engineering group, for Pounds 43.5m, because it was
'heading for the fourth division - not in performance, but in size'. The
rump of the batteries side - in Africa - was retained.
Mr Horrocks said that although margin had been sacrificed, the group was now
cash-generative from trading, though 'the joker is demand'.
Turnover on continuing operations fell to Pounds 110.1m (Pounds 115.9m). On
a like-for-like basis, turnover in electronics was Pounds 79.7m (Pounds
82.6m) and losses grew to Pounds 2.22m (Pounds 1.34m); batteries were
brighter - turnover was Pounds 30.4m (Pounds 33.3m) and profits Pounds 4.25m
(Pounds 2.46m). Therefore before interest continuing operations saw a growth
in profits to Pounds 2.04m (Pounds 1.12m).
After a 400 per cent tax charge (because Chloride earned most of its profits
in countries where tax loss benefits are not available) and extraordinary
charges of Pounds 4.4m, relating to disposals and closures, the retained
losses totalled Pounds 4.4m (profits Pounds 7.38m).

Forte, the UK hotels group, has reached agreement with ENI, the Italian
state owned energy and chemicals concern, on a joint venture to take
management control of ENI's motorway hotels in Italy.
No value has been placed on the deal, which involves 18 hotels and motels
owned by ENI's Agip and Snam subsidiaries. All the hotels are located near
motorways and main roads where Agip Petroli, ENI's petroleum distribution
arm, has filling stations and service areas.
Mr Gaetano Cecchetti, a director of ENI, said the deal would raise some
L200bn for the group, which is under pressure from the government to
privatise some of its activities and improve its financial performance. Mr
Cecchetti gave no indication of how the figure was derived. However, he said
the joint venture with Forte could also entail new hotel projects outside
Italy.

FT  19 JUN 92 / GPA Group's Aborted Global Issue: Airline executives fear
blight on orders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FAILURE of the flotation will further disrupt the order books of world
aircraft manufacturers, said airline executives yesterday. They also feel
that it will raise the cost of financing aircraft and so help push some of
the weakest airlines into bankruptcy.
GPA stood to raise at least Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.6bn) from the flotation.
The first Dollars 800m was to be directly from the issue of new shares and
the rest through increased borrowing.
GPA said yesterday it was confident that it could tap other sources, but
others in the aviation sector believe GPA and other purchasers will have far
less money than planned - and at a higher cost - to spend on new aircraft.
This is the latest blow for recession-hit manufacturers. In the last few
months the big three US airlines - American, United and Delta - cut their
capital spending programmes. Other airlines have deferred delivery dates.
And only last week, McDonnell-Douglas said it was all but abandoning
development of the MD-12 600-seat aircraft.
As the largest leasing company in the world, GPA is also one of the biggest
buyers of new aircraft. Its firm order book, worth Dollars 11.9bn, accounts
for more than 10 per cent of the outstanding orders of Boeing and Airbus,
the world's biggest civil aircraft makers.
Without new equity, it will not have the cash to pay for all of these
aircraft. Unless GPA can issue more equity - through a flotation or private
placements - it might be forced to cancel some of the 308 aircraft on order
for delivery between 1993 and 2000, said City analysts.
Aircraft manufacturers were tight-lipped yesterday, insisting that GPA
finances were not their affair. Investors took a different view however. The
share prices of Boeing and McDonnell-Douglas of the US, Fokker of Holland
and stakeholders in the Airbus consortium, such as British Aerospace, all
fell.
Smaller airlines also felt the pressure. GPA often leases to smaller or
poorly capitalised airlines which struggle to obtain attractive terms for
financing to back expansion.
Part of the reason for the share price weakness was fear that aircraft
buyers would delay purchases further, increasing the pressure on prices.
'Aircraft values could be sent spiralling downwards,' said Mr Keith
McMullan, managing director of Avmark, aviation consultancy, yesterday.
There was also recognition that GPA, a financial company expected to have
good contacts in the investment community, had failed to persuade investors
that the airline industry was a good bet.
'It cannot be good news that GPA cannot attract funds in the present
business climate,' said Mr Alan Hodder of the International Bureau of
Aviation, a US-UK consultancy.
Airlines have been unable to recover strongly from the collapse in demand
caused by the Gulf war. US carriers have fought a series of price wars that
have destroyed hopes of short-term profitability
Another price war has just begun, and this week American Airlines, the only
large US carrier to make a profit in 1991, said it would lose money in the
second quarter of this year.
Such is the desperation of the airline industry to see a fall in the number
of competitors, that executives were yesterday prepared to argue privately
that the failure of GPA's flotation was a good thing.
'It will make it more difficult for weak or small airlines and will help
consolidation in the industry,' said one executive. The corollary, was that
fares would eventually increase and allow airlines, to repair their damaged
finances.

FT  19 JUN 92 / GPA Group's Aborted Global Issue: Japanese brokers blame
flop on Nomura
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE unwillingness of Japanese institutions to bid for stock in GPA Group's
flotation was a significant factor in the issue's failure, according to
Tokyo investment bankers.
Despite intense efforts by Nomura Securities, the international co-ordinator
for the offer and the lead adviser for Japan, almost all the demand came
from retail investors.
Underwriting managers at rival securities companies said Nomura's own
clients had accounted for about 70 per cent of the total.
'The rest of us sold very, very little. Nothing like as much as Nomura,'
said one underwriting manager.
Underwriting managers said institutions - like their counterparts in the US
and UK - had declined the offer because of the general uncertainty about
world financial markets, including the market for aircraft leasing in light
of the continuing financial strains on airlines.
They also had not fully grasped the nature of GPA's complex business.
Moreover, institutions were influenced by the experience of Mitsubishi Trust
&amp; Banking, the leading trust bank, and other Japanese investing companies
which bought shares in a private deal at Dollars 32 and would have realised
a large loss if the offer had proceeded.
Mitsubishi trust bank has a close relationship with GPA and has a holding of
13.4 per cent. Some fund managers judged that if Mitsubishi trust bank had
lost money then less well-connected and less well-informed investors should
stay away.
Underwriting managers said that the main interest in the offer came from
private individuals who had despaired of finding a good investment in the
depressed Japanese market.
But, as one underwriting manager said, salesmen were cautious about
promoting such stock to individuals since they had even less idea about the
nature of GPA than the institutions.
There was plenty of recrimination in Tokyo last night with rival brokers
heaping the blame for the flop on Nomura. They said Nomura had been
over-ambitious. They also said Nomura mishandled the cancellation with some
investors receiving the news before others.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Intel wins round in battle with AMD
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEL, the leading US manufacturer of microprocessor chips for personal
computers, has won a critical lawsuit in its battle to prevent Advanced
Micro Devices from cloning its products. A Californian jury has returned a
verdict that AMD does not, as it has claimed, have the right to use Intel's
microcode, the internal instructions that control a microprocessor.
AMD has won an estimated 30 per cent share of the market for 386
microprocessors, since the company launched its own version of the Intel
device last year.
AMD's stock price fell Dollars 5 1/2 yesterday to close at Dollars 9 while
Intel finished up Dollars 3 1/4 at Dollars 51.
The lawsuit is one of several between the two companies involving AMD's
rights to Intel technology.
The latest decision is a setback to AMD's efforts to become a major
competitor in the microprocessor market.
The latest case involved Intel's 287 math co-processor, a device that works
alongside a microprocessor to boost its calculating speed. Intel had filed
suit against AMD in 1990, charging the company with copyright infringement.
AMD claimed to have a licence to use Intel's microcode under a 1976 pact
between the companies and arguments in the case revolved around
interpretation of the agreement.
Intel said the microcode licence was limited to its use in computer systems
designed for software development, and AMD failed to convince the jury that
its licensing rights were broader.
Intel hailed the decision as a victory in its legal battles with AMD. 'We
are extremely pleased with today's verdict,' said Mr Thomas Dunlap, Intel
general counsel. Mr WJ Sanders, AMD chairman, told employees: 'We have
suffered a setback - not a defeat.'
For 1991, AMD reported revenues of Dollars 1.2bn and profits of Dollars
145.3m. Intel reported record revenues last year of Dollars 4.78bn and
Dollars 819m in profits.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Brent Walker hit by sharp rise in interest costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRENT WALKER, the leisure and property group which completed a Pounds 1.65bn
refinancing in March, incurred a retained loss of Pounds 411.4m in 1991.
The loss compares with a loss of Pounds 367.7m in 1990. It was mainly caused
by a sharp rise in interest costs from Pounds 116.2m to Pounds 235.8m, and
exceptional costs of Pounds 201.3m compared with Pounds 116.9m a year
earlier.
Provisions for falls in property values accounted for Pounds 142.5m against
Pounds 97.7m of the exceptionals. Fees and costs involved in the refinancing
were Pounds 39.8m, up from Pounds 14m. There were reorganisation costs of
Pounds 19.1m compared with Pounds 1.5m.
Lord Kindersley, chairman, said: '1991 was by any standard a most trying
year for the group.'
As well as the financial restructuring and the losses, Mr George Walker, the
group's former chairman and chief executive, is claiming compensation for
loss of office, and a Serious Fraud Office investigation into the company's
affairs was launched.
Lord Kindersley said Mr Walker had 'gone quiet' and he could not comment on
the SFO investigation.
There was a loss per share of 763.09p compared with 299.77p and no dividend
on the ordinary or preference shares will be paid. Brent Walker's share
price fell  1/4 p to 6 1/2 p.
The group published a pro-forma post-restructuring balance sheet, prepared
on a going concern basis, which showed negative net worth of Pounds 177.1m.
Before the refinancing, which involved swapping Pounds 250m of debt into
equity, net assets were negative at Pounds 455.8m at the end of 1991.
He said a slight improvement in trading conditions after the election had
now faded. However, following the restructuring the group was seeing
interest from potential buyers of assets up for sale.
Lord Kindersley and Mr Alan Clements, a non-executive director, are to
retire at the group's annual meeting next month. Both were appointed to
assist the refinancing process.
The company did trade profitably in 1991 with operating profits of Pounds
48.4m down from Pounds 107.2m.
The William Hill betting shop business suffered as gamblers cut back in the
recession, but had had a better start to 1992.
The Pubmaster division, which is being expanded through deals to lease
brewers' pubs, held profits in 1991. Lord Kindersley said the expansion
would begin to benefit profits in the second half.

Yesterday's agreed offer by Yorkshire for Tyne Tees comes as little

shareholder returns. The comparison with Granada, with an annual payment

FT  19 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Severn Trent
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's annual results leave no doubt Severn Trent paid too much for
Biffa, the waste management company it bought from BET after the start of
the last financial year. Thanks to the recession, Biffa contributed a
disappointing Pounds 11m, against financing costs of more than Pounds 20m.
Barring a vigorous economic recovery, it will make only around Pounds 15m
this year. So it is still a long way from covering its costs.
Granted, Severn Trent has been sensibly cautious in accounting for the
acquisition. Biffa's landfill business in particular looks to have fine
scope for growth. By mid-decade, the division should be making the steady
unregulated earnings for which it was purchased. The question is whether it
will be worth the wait. Severn's annual dividend was increased by 10 per
cent, thanks in part to Pounds 4.5m of efficiency gains, but the company's
earnings will be under pressure this year as a combination of interest and
depreciation charges begins to bite.
Small wonder, then, that the company is stressing its record in the
regulated water business. The group invested nearly Pounds 600m last year,
and claims the lowest average water charges in the country, even though its
franchise covers a relatively dry region. Its capital spending programme has
already peaked. Severn Trent can keep its dividend running ahead by
sacrificing high cover, but that is hardly an inspiring outlook.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest slump in the Tokyo equity market is viewed locally with a kind of
gloomy fatalism. Traditionally, the story goes, it has been the job of
foreign investors, with their more rational valuation methods, to call the
bottom of the market. Last year they did just that. But domestic investors
failed to follow the lead, so the foreigners have lost heart and there are
thus no buyers left at all.
The more apocalyptic talk about collapsing bank capital ratios leading to a
credit crunch has largely died down. However far the Nikkei falls, the
system will doubtless limp along. But there is still profound gloom about
corporate earnings. It is in the nature of the Japanese economy that
recovery should be led by producers - or government - rather than consumers.
When it comes to investing out of recession, Japanese companies are hampered
not only by the higher cost of capital but by their prodigal over-investment
in the bubble years of the late 1980s. At that time, companies bought market
share regardless of profit and investors bought stock for capital gain
regardless of income. Now, corporate executives talk earnestly of the need
for adequate return on capital and institutions are restive for higher
payouts. But, as one of Japan's biggest fund managers remarked yesterday, if
the corporate sector's return on equity is only 5-6 per cent and the
medium-term outlook for dividend growth is 5-6 per cent as well, who would
want to buy the market on nearly 40 times earnings?

FT  19 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Grounded at GPA
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's spectacular GPA flop should not necessarily add to the London
market's current woes. It is naturally unsettling when a much-hyped Dollars
1bn share offer - recently increased to accommodate supposed extra
international demand - is unexpectedly pulled at the eleventh hour. Yet
there is good reason to believe that the ultimate lack of investor interest
was due to specific handicaps of the company, rather than to deeper
disenchantment with flotations at this stage in the cycle. Wellcome for one
will certainly hope so.
GPA always faced an uphill struggle given the dire state of the airline
industry, intense price competition in the US and persistent rumours of more
airline bankruptcies. The combination of its indebtedness and huge aircraft
purchase commitments led many to suspect they were being asked to contribute
to a rescue issue, while even sophisticated institutions had trouble
grasping the intricacies of the airline leasing business. With GPA lacking a
clear home market, there were no compelling reasons to subscribe, given the
risks.
One inevitable question for GPA's galaxy of advisers is whether it was a
mistake to use the book building system much favoured in the US, rather than
to have the issue properly underwritten (in which case at least the company
would have got its money). The reality is that there was probably no
alternative - all indications are that the institutions would have been
reluctant to sub-underwrite, and that the costs of using other
intermediaries would have been unacceptably high. The real culprit seems to
have been the inflexible structure of the global offering. Far from
inspiring creative tension between the three main markets, it allowed lack
of interest in one to spread to the others. No single financial centre was
able to anchor the issue.
Egg has been liberally splattered across City faces: Nomura's international
ambitions have been dented; Schroders can hardly be proud of belatedly
wooing the retail investor; and Goldmans will have some explaining to do
about the disastrous response in the US, where expectations look to have
been far too high. For GPA, however, the problem is more than just a
tarnished reputation. The company has not only been denied the proceeds of
the float, but perhaps another Dollars 2bn-Dollars 3bn of bank borrowings to
which it would have had access with an enlarged capital base. With net debt
likely on current cash flow forecasts to exceed committed facilities by the
end of the year, fervent efforts will presumably be made to securitise more
of its assets. Ultimately, though, GPA may hope to find a partner with deep
pockets, as ILFC did when it was taken over in 1990 by the American insurer
AIG. The question is whether there are any takers these days.

FT  19 JUN 92 / BR's annual losses set for sharp rise to Pounds 150m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH RAIL will announce next month that its losses for the year to March
have increased to Pounds 150m compared with Pounds 10.9m in the previous
year.
The latest losses, which are worse than expected, will make it much more
difficult for the government to stimulate private sector interest in its
plans for BR's denationalisation.
Recession is largely to blame for the poor results. Revenues in all
passenger sectors have fallen, partly because commuting has declined with
the growth of unemployment and partly because fewer people are travelling
for leisure or shopping.
InterCity, which has been profitable for the last five years and is
unsubsidised, is believed to have made an operating profit of barely Pounds
5m compared with Pounds 49.7m in the previous year.
The two subsidised sectors - Network SouthEast, which lost Pounds 154.9m
last year, and Regional Railways, which lost Pounds 503.4m - will report
heavy increases in their losses, although these will be mostly offset by
bigger government grants.
The freight side has also performed badly. Although Trainload Freight, the
bulk freight business, is expected to turn in a profit, losses at
Railfreight Distribution are thought to have risen above 1990-91's Pounds
152.3m.
Overall, operating losses after government subsidies are believed to have
increased from the previous year's Pounds 26.4m to more than Pounds 100m.
The bottom-line loss of Pounds 150m results from a heavy increase in the
interest charge and a halving of the contribution from property profits.
The figures have important consequences for the government's privatisation
plans because they remind potential buyers of the acute vulnerability of the
railways to swings in the economic cycle.
The government plans legislation this autumn paving the way for passenger
train operations to be franchised out to the private sector and for the
freight operations to be sold outright.
In the wake of the latest figures, however, the private sector could prove
reluctant to take an interest in BR passenger service franchises unless
profits are assured by generous subsidies - an arrangement the Treasury is
unlikely to favour.
The freight losses, meanwhile, make it highly improbable that an outright
buyer will be found for Railfreight Distribution. It is more likely that the
private sector will 'cherry pick' the few profitable freight services,
leaving the remainder to close down.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Jobless total climbs to its highest level for five years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of people out of work in the UK climbed to more than 2.7m last
month, the highest level for nearly five years.
The 21,300 rise in the jobless total in May, which was smaller than most
economists had forecast, pushed the unemployment rate to 9.6 per cent. It
followed a rise of 42,600 in April.
With convincing signs of economic recovery still absent at the end of a week
in which a string of economic statistics has been released, the government
yesterday pointed to a slowdown in the average rate of increase in
unemployment and a drop in the rate of growth of average earnings.
There were also some mildly encouraging signs in May's money supply figures,
which showed a second successive monthly rise in lending by banks and
building societies.
Lending by these groups to companies and individuals rose by a seasonally
adjusted Pounds 3bn last month, after a Pounds 5.1bn increase in April,
according to the Bank of England.
Commenting on the unemployment figures Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment
secretary, said: 'The average rate of increase in unemployment in the latest
three months is the smallest recorded for any three-month period since the
three months to September 1990.'
In the three months to May unemployment grew by an average of 23,900 a month
compared with 29,400 in the three months to April. The number of people out
of work has risen by 70 per cent since unemployment levels started to go up
25 months ago.
The Department of Employment's estimate of the trend is for it to continue
to grow by between 25,000 and 30,000 a month for the rest of the year.
Other Department of Employment figures showed that average earnings growth
eased to 7 per cent in the year to April. In spite of falling inflation and
rising unemployment throughout the recession, this was the lowest rate of
earnings growth for 25 years. It is expected to carry on falling as lower
pay settlements in the second half of last year feed through to the index.
The slowdown in average earnings growth contributed to a sharp drop in unit
wage costs and a rise in productivity in April. Mrs Shephard said the
containment of wage costs would help to protect and create jobs.
Mr Tony Blair, Labour's emp-loyment spokesman, described the rise in the
jobless total as dire. 'It is now clear that the government's pre-election
promises of a quick economic recovery have evaporated in the post-election
light of day,' he said.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Lloyd's warned of further legal action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS OF Lloyd's Names yes-terday warned of escalating legal action after
its governing council rejected a bail-out scheme to help Names hardest hit
by recent losses.
A minority of Lloyd's Names - individuals whose assets back the insurance
market - will bear the brunt of Lloyd's estimated Pounds 2bn 1989 losses to
be announced next week.
The bail-out scheme was rejected because of commercial and legal problems.
Instead, help will be limited to a possible improvement of the 'hardship'
relief offered to Names faced with bankruptcy.
Mr Tom Benyon, chairman of the Society of Names, a group representing
members in difficulty, said Lloyd's 'faced death by a thousand writs'.
Mr Christopher Stockwell, chairman of the Lloyd's Names Associations working
party, which represents a number of Names' action groups, said: 'It's a
tragedy. They have missed a major opportunity and face mounting chaos.'
Many Names allege that negligence by professionals in the market is
responsible for their losses. More than 2,000 have taken action.
Mr Mark Farrer, chairman of the Association of Lloyd's Members, which
represents more than 9,000 Names, said he was 'disappointed' but accepted
that there was a 'significant lack of support' among more successful Names
for a bail-out.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Winds of reform blow in from a prosperous coast: Chinese
provinces are hungry for a market economy, but there is a risk of
overheating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last month Mr Yu Zhaoyong took a group of factory managers and businessmen
from Changsha, capital of Hunan province, to Shenzhen special economic zone
in the south of China. Their purpose was to study the zone's stock exchange,
where rocketing prices are attracting money and attention from all over the
country. Changsha wants one too.
Mr Yu views the pronouncements of Mr Deng Xiaoping, the country's paramount
lea-der and champion of economic reform, as 'like a spring wind blowing all
over China'. As director of Hunan's commission for economic structural
reform, Mr Yu is a chief architect of the development of the primarily
agricultural inland province. He plans to attack its inefficient state-owned
industries and, like his counterparts in other provinces, sees share
ownership as a central element of his strategy.
Structural problems - including unproductive state industries and controlled
prices - still dog China's economy, even though Mr Deng's 'open door'
reforms have been under way since 1978. But the extraordinary growth of the
coastal southern provinces is well-known to all Chinese.
Mr Deng's new drive has unleashed a competitive frenzy among provinces and
cities which want to match the prosperity of the south. They are pushing
ahead with ambitious plans to boost industry, introduce market reforms and
attract investment. 'If you cannot make big strides, you will be left behind
by the others,' says Mr Chen Binfan, vice-governor of Hunan province.
Beijing is being deluged with applications for exemptions similar to those
of the special economic zones, which have the fastest growth, and for
approval of plans to set up stock exchanges and other markets. It is viewing
them with caution. While the provinces' desire to slough off the restraints
of the centrally planned economy is understandable, it risks quickly
creating the same inflationary pressures that occurred twice in the 1980s.
Consumer prices were rising at nearly 20 per cent a year by 1988, when the
government put the brakes on the economy. The increase in 1990 was 2 per
cent. This year's is expected to be 7 per cent.
Professor He Jianzhang, director of the institute of economics at the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, agrees. 'It is difficult to solve the
issue of overheating now that the emphasis is on provinces formulating their
own policies.'
The authorities have recognised the tendency to overheat. Mr Li Guixian,
governor of the People's Bank of China, the central bank, said in London
yesterday that he tightened credit after the economy grew at an 11 per cent
annual rate in the first quarter. Industrial production grew at 18 per cent.
He said this would not halt the economy's advance, but he would fine-tune
monetary policy to maintain economic growth of 8 to 9 per cent.
The view in Beijing is that some provinces will have to scale down their
expectations. While coastal provinces such as Guangdong can raise their
already rapid growth rates, Prof He warns: 'Some inland provinces and remote
areas, because they lack infrastructure and transport and energy resources,
cannot indiscriminately speed up their economic development.'
It is easy to see why the south's rapid growth inspires emulation. During
the 1980s, the value of industrial production in Guangdong, the most
prosperous province, grew by an average 20 per cent a year at constant
prices. Last year, it grew by 27 per cent, with per capita income rising by
25 per cent. Growth this year could be even higher, and provincial
authorities are rewriting the 1991-95 five-year plan to accommodate higher
growth targets.
Most of the growth stems from foreign investment in joint manufacturing
ventures and is concentrated in the Pearl River Delta, where the economy is
rapidly integrating with that of Hong Kong.
But even in Guangdong, chronic problems remain. In spite of the growth of
the private sector, state-owned enterprises still account for 44 per cent of
industrial output in Guangdong, and 30 per cent of these are loss-making.
The figures for other provinces are higher. The difficulties span the
spectrum of industry, from coal, power and machinery to consumer durables.
Factories still churn out unmarketable products.
Central and provincial governments have tried various means to turn them
around, chiefly 'contract responsibility', designed to separate ownership
from management. Enterprises take responsibility for their finances and may
plough above-target profits back into their businesses.
But who takes responsibility for losses? China's bankruptcy law has been
little used. For many state enterprises, however well run, it is impossible
to make a profit without the freeing of officially fixed prices, a process
which even optimists in the government admit will take many years.
Each reform triggers the need for a series of further steps. Making
industries more efficient, for example, involves making new arrangements for
surplus workers, who are housed, fed and cared for by their employers.
Efforts to create an alternative social security system are still nascent.
Facing these huge obstacles, officials all over China have lighted upon
employee share ownership schemes as one way to revitalise state industries.
In Guangdong, eight profitable state-owned companies, ranging from a huge
electronic fan maker to a manufacturer of monosodium glutamate, have been
chosen for an experiment. Thirty per cent of each is being sold to employees
for a nominal price. In theory the shares cannot be sold for a year, but
officials seem undisturbed that employees might sell after only a month or
two and that unofficial prices are developing.
Officials are attracted by the Chinese propensity to save. They reason that
if savings could be mobilised, they would provide investment funds and help
to revitalise industries. Share-owning employees would also have a greater
incentive to perform, they believe.
However, Beijing is cautious about allowing more stock exchanges. The
fledgling markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen have seen soaring prices,
volatility, overstrained systems and violence. Investors poured money in
because few other worthwhile investments were available. But Mr Fan
Hengshan, senior economist in the government's economic re-structuring
commission, says: 'We think that most state enterprises can be transferred
to the shareholding system.'
The 300 staff of Changsha Municipal Musical Instrument Factory would no
doubt agree. Profits have risen 20 per cent a year since they were allotted
shares three years ago, and they have earned dividends. The company has
expanded from violins, gongs and drums into cooking utensils.
The enthusiasm for shares is, however, symbolic of the erratic pace of
China's development. The planners risk treating share ownership as a
panacea, while continuing to put off more fundamental reform.

FT  19 JUN 92 / The deal that did not fly: Bad timing and nervousness about
the airline industry scuppered GPA's flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite the decision in the early hours of Thursday morning to abort the
international public offering of shares in GPA Group, Mr Maurice Foley,
deputy chairman and group chief executive of the air leasing concern,
yesterday put a brave face on it all. The company, he says, has sold Dollars
1bn of equity privately over the past five years and does not intend to give
up its quest for more. It will simply change its strategy and opt for
something less complex than a global issue at the earliest possible
opportunity.
Whether it can do so after such a resounding flop seems questionble. This
was not, after all, a large offer for any of the individual country markets
that GPA had been hoping to tap with the help of some of the world's most
impressive investment banks and securities houses. Yet it was dogged, from
the outset, by noisy disagreements between GPA and its advisers over timing
and pricing.
The first setback came in a private telephone conversation between GPA's
founder and chairman, Mr Tony Ryan, and Sir David Scholey, chairman of
merchant banker S G Warburg when Mr Ryan was looking for a global
co-ordinator. Yet Sir David, while happy to form a relationship with GPA,
would not commit himself to a flotation until Warburg knew the company
better.
Mr Ryan was disappointed. GPA's financial adviser, Hambro Magan, the
specialist merchant bank, had already decided that a flotation was in its
best interest. But since Warburg was reluctant to accept that without
looking at GPA for themselves, the two went their separate ways.
Mr Ryan was even more upset when Cazenove, Britain's pre-eminent stockbroker
in corporate finance, decided against a relationship with GPA. But despite
these merchant bankers and brokers competed fiercely to act for the company
when it invited firms to tender for the key jobs in the offer. Those chosen
ultimately included Nomura of Japan as global co-ordinator, Goldman Sachs,
Merrill Lynch and Salomon Brothers in the US, Schroders and BZW in the UK,
and Nomura and Yamaichi in Japan.
By the end of last year these and other advisers were gearing themselves up
for a flotation in the middle of 1992. Yet Maurice Foley yesterday confirmed
that the buoyancy of the US stock market earlier this year prompted one its
advisers to suggest bringing the issue forwards.
Asked whether GPA should have taken this advice, instead of waiting, by
which time the US equity market began to dry up, Mr Foley said: 'This is a
fair point. You can never be sure of hypothetical circumstances. But in the
end we decided to go for a global offering and not one basically limited to
the US.' This meant going later.
Nor was it the only missed opportunity. On the basis of political
intelligence from Nigel (now Lord) Lawson, a non-executive director, who
correctly predicted a mid-April UK election, GPA flirted with the idea of a
flotation in late March or early April to take advantage of a still buoyant
US market. But in the end it decided it was best to wait until the UK
election was out of the way. As one of its advisers yesterday suggested,
this was the wrong judgment and turned out to compound the original error of
not going in January. In the meantime there were acrimonious arguments about
pricing. When the group's advisers decided in February that the new ordinary
shares should be priced at around Dollars 20 to Dollars 25, with the
emphasis on the lower price, GPA executives immediately insisted on flying
the bankers to the group's headquarters in Shannon, Ireland.
Already irritated, Mr Ryan was reported to be even more angry when he
learned that Goldman Sachs was proposing to sell the shares for as little as
Dollars 17 in order to be sure of placing Dollars 500m (Pounds 276m) of the
stock in the US. One adviser to the group said: 'Mr Ryan hit the roof when
he heard that. In retrospect I think we should have realised at that time
that the group's way of dealing with problems is best suited to a private
company.'
There were to be further rows, of which the most dramatic took place in the
early hours of yesterday. A meeting of GPA's most senior executives and
advisers at Nomura's London offices ended in heated argument when Mr John
Howland Jackson, Nomura's director co-ordinating the flotation, told Mr Ryan
it would have to be pulled.
Mr Ryan asked him to reconsider and look at other possible options, such as
lowering the price and the size of the offer. But when the answer came back
as a firm no, there was an angry exchange between Mr Ryan and the advisers.
One of GPA's investment bankers present said: 'The exchange looked as if it
was going to develop into physical confrontation. It was a terrible,
exhausting end to the whole process.' Few of the advisers present had slept
much over the previous four days and nights.
The ostensible reason for pulling the flotation was not that the investment
demand was inadequate. About Dollars 500m-worth of shares were bid for. The
problem was that the bids were hopelessly unbalanced in terms of geography
and type of investor. Out of 50m shares for which bids were received, 23m
were in Japan alone. Of these, nearly all were from retail investors;
institutional interest was minimal. The equivalent number in the UK was
7.5m, while in the US only 6.5m shares were bid for. The rest of the world
put in for 13.3m. The advisers concluded that to float on the basis of such
an unbalanced market would not be in GPA's interest.
The rot had set in on Monday, the day before the deadline for share
applications, when the US equity When it became clear that US investors were
showing little enthusiasm, interest around the world started to evaporate.
This was just 10 days after GPA had been told by its advisers that the
number of shares on offer could be increased.
Part of the problem was that US investors were worried about depressed
conditions in the airline industry. Despite the fact that GPA derives only
10 per cent of its business from the US, 'we didn't', as Maurice Foley put
it, 'uncouple ourselves from that'.
But rumours about the impending collapse of another US airline did nothing
to help. There was talk in the markets about GPA's relationship with America
West, which is under the protection of Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Yet Foley
points out that America West is up to date with all payments due to GPA.
The blow to the morale of GPA and its management is palpable and may bear
particularly heavily on Mr Ryan himself, who has a Dollars 35m loan from a
banking associate of Merrill Lynch secured on shares in GPA. Nobody can now
be sure what those shares are worth. And while Maurice Foley pointed out
yesterday that the company still has a surplus of Dollars 800m over the book
value of its aircraft which has not been written into the balance sheet,
that value is for the moment intangible. The failure of the flotation
deprives GPA of hard cash in the shape of potential offer proceeds of about
Dollars 800m.
The significance is not so much the risk that borrowing covenants will now
be breached - there is still a wide margin in hand - as that GPA will not
have the increased borrowing capacity that it would have enjoyed as the
result of enlarging its equity base. This is overwhelmingly important since
one of the biggest question marks about the company concerns its ability to
finance future purchases of aircraft. Some Dollars 12bn of firm orders have
to be paid for by the end of the present decade.
The company is now busy emphasising that its future financing was never
dependent on any single option. It will still aim to raise money in debt
markets; and if its credit rating is downgraded, the result, says Foley,
will be to raise the cost of finance, but not to limit its volume. Moreover,
GPA has shown considerable skill in packaging its aircraft into the form of
securities which it then sells to investment institutions. A deal of this
kind completed just before the flotation will bring in cash proceeds of
between Dollars 400m and Dollars 450m. Others are being contemplated.
GPA, according to one of the advisers to the issue, is still a good company.
There is no reason, he adds, to deduce anything about its value on the basis
of a poor market response at a single point in time. While few question the
impressiveness of its performance in a dismal period for the air leasing
business, it is nonetheless hard to believe that the pulling of the public
offer will not be bruising. Or that GPA will not be asking questions about
the quality of the advice it received.
Having grown on the back of the great credit boom of the 1980s GPA now
accounts for 10 per cent of all new orders from the world's aircraft
manufacturers. It shoulders a disproportionate amount of the risk in the
industry on a very slender equity base. Against that background it has
worried some institutional investors that its accounting policies are not
uniformly conservative, notably in relation to depreciation. And after it
sells aircraft to investors it is often still at risk because it guarantees
to underwrite a minimum level of proceeds on any future sale.
That means that GPA can ill afford to slow down. If it does, it will be
obliged to renegotiate orders for new aircraft. The company is confident
that it can handle the strain if it comes to that, because the manufacturers
have no more desire to deliver planes which do not go into service than GPA
has to take delivery on an unprof-itable basis. But nor are the
manufacturers charitable institutions. They are entitled to take back part
of the discount granted on GPA's bulk purchases in the event of
cancellation.
GPA has demonstrated its resilience in the past. The question now is whether
it can persuade investors that such a complex, highly individual business is
really suitable for public flotation at any point in the future.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Arts: As You Like It - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Open Air Theatre at Regent's Park ought to be the ideal setting for As
You Like It, just as it is for A Midsummer Night's Dream. The Forest of
Arden corresponds more closely to Regent's Park than most of the rest of
London. Never underestimate, however, the chances of a director getting it
wrong by trying to be clever. Maria Aitken's production is perverse.
To be fair to Ms Aitken, her As You Like It is not nearly as dreadful as her
programme note would lead you to think. Aitken claims that Jaques, the
melancholy outsider, is the equivalent of a 20th century movie director: he
has spotted that all the world's a stage and Arden is the place where you go
to shoot on location.
The idea produces one good joke. In the wrestling match Orlando gets
hammered in the first round. Jaques, the movie director, calls a halt and
substitutes the stand-in who pummels the court wrestler close to death. This
is Hollywood triumphant, but merely a gloss on As You Like It. Gradually
Hollywood recedes and the play takes over although the production remains
perverse.
Ms Aitken appears to think that all the men in the play are drips and all
the women players. There is some evidence in the text for her point of view
 -Orlando is not a ball of fire and you could say that Rosalind is lowering
her standards by chasing him. On the other hand, if you take the female
superiority too far, you begin to distort the play. As You Like It is about
boy meets girl, mutual attraction. There has to be something to be said for
the men.
Aitken's preference for putting the women first has strange effects. Corin,
the shepherd, has some wonderful lines in defence of the pastoral society:
'The greatest of my pride is to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck.' He is
not allowed to speak them as if they are at the heart of the play or as if
anyone might wish to take him seriously.
The minor part of Phebe, the shepherdess, comes out as one of the most
striking characters. This is partly because she is played by Anna Patrick,
whose performance as Helena in the Regent's Park production of the Dream has
already shown her to be an actress at the top of the class. It is also
because the production suggests that she is a woman striking out on her own.
The text shows plainly that she is only having a minor fling.
Aitken's perversity runs into problems with Jaques, played by Bette Bourne.
He is over-coiffeured and noticeably overweight. He speaks his lines very
well, but the underlying suggestion is that he is suffering from some fatal
disease, quite probably Aids, not an improvement on the original unexplained
melancholy.
Rosalind is played with some distinction by Cathryn Harrison. The question
remains of what a clever girl like this is doing chasing a duffer like
Orlando. The logical conclusion of Aitken's interpretation is that Rosalind
should go off with Phebe.  Still, you can't keep a good play down; nor the
pleasures of Regent's Park either.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Arts: Moll Cutpurse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In 1610, the famous rogue Moll Cutpurse saw her own life dramatised as The
Roaring Girl by Thomas Dekker and Thomas Middleton. If real characters could
wander on stage, why could not Middleton mix it with Moll offstage? That
situation provides the comedy in Moll Cutpurse, an entertaining play about
Middleton at the Drill Hall Arts Centre.
Nick Stafford's fantasy works on situation rather than plot. Middleton
appears as a blocked writer who cannot bring himself to say 'Shakespeare' or
to quote from any of the plays. He decides to garner material for a new
play, and lights on Moll. She and her confederates, Maria and John, welcome
him as only those hungry for publicity welcome a TV documentary crew.
An intrigue of deception ensues, driven by greed and lubricity. The action
turns on a flimsy revenge plot, a bag of counterfeit coin and the writing of
Middleton's play. The labyrinthine business strikes a parody of Middleton's
own plots; and the language is a riot of plackets and peccadillos,
consistently bawdy and suggestive. Middleton attempts to shepherd all this
chaos into the pages of his own play.
Simon Deacon's ambient music lifts the action and helps focus Helen White's
clever direction. She gets fine performances from the cast of four. Peter
Shorey as Middleton and Janice McKenzie as Moll establish a bruising
rapport; Shorey in particular shows control and range. The play's funniest
scene, between Middleton and Moll's confederates (Beaux Bryant and Jim
Findley) finds him physically sick in being forced to hear Shakespeare's
130th sonnet.
But the New Perspectives Theatre Company has shackled itself in this
production to the ideal of 'political correctness': fine in principle but
clumsy in practice here. Old norms are assiduously avoided: so the women are
lesbian, the men gay, and relations between the sexes financial. The choices
for women look stark: servant, whore or wife; unless like Moll they 'live by
their wits against all costs.'
Beyond the bustle and energetic acting, Moll Cutpurse needs a wider scope,
grander design. As a play about Middleton, it offers little. Its seriousness
focuses on the position of women, then and now. Fifty years after
Middleton's death, one playwright was writing more and better on the same.
Her name was Aphra Behn.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Management: Bringing equality into the open - Lucy Kellaway
shares a sandwich from the canteen with Ian Gibson, the man in the driving
seat at Nissan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ian Gibson does not have an office. The man who manages 4,000 people at
Nissan in Sunderland sits at a small desk in a big open-plan space. He wears
a mid-blue uniform with the Nissan logo on one lapel and a Queen's Award for
Exports badge on the other. From where he works he can see scores of
identical desks and chairs occupied by identically-clad people.
The only sign that Gibson is the boss is the couple of extra feet of space
that surround his desk. Everything else about him - appearance,
conversation, what he eats and where he parks his car - shouts the same
message. At Nissan privilege is out; equality and accessibility are in.
Gibson reckons that Nissan has outdone the Japanese at their own game. With
relish he explains how the first MD - a Japanese - had his own office. But
once he left, the British directors decided to move out with everyone else.
'In Japan there is a more layered culture,' he says. 'We get a lot of
resistance from our Japanese visitors - they feel more comfortable in a
private room.' For them and for the more sensitive of the politicians,
suppliers and customers who make the journey to the Sunderland car plant,
there is a private meeting room. This contains a plain table and a sofa and
chairs, arranged in formal Japanese fashion.
Gibson views such private sessions as a dieter would regard a cream cake. 'I
don't like to give in to the visitor syndrome,' he says. 'It is very easy to
lay on lunch in the visitors' dining room, but I prefer to talk to them out
here, and take them to lunch in the canteen.'
The British subsidiary has also taken a stand against the cult of the
personality. Two small photographs of the chairman and managing director of
the Japanese parent company are barely tolerated in the otherwise unadorned
visitors' room. 'We may be able to get rid of them soon,' Gibson says. In
the annual report there is no picture of the managing director; his
statement does not even bear his name. 'I do not like glory hunters and do
not want to be one,' he says.
Indeed, Gibson is so self-effacing and so intent on promoting the team that
he tends to reply in the plural, whatever the question. What does he think
of the uniforms and the open plan space? 'For the first six months, most
people said it was difficult to adjust to the open plan office,' he replies.
'But we all liked the idea of the uniform as it shows we are trying to be
more equal.'
He - or rather they - did draw the line at the company song and company
exercise sessions: 'We did not feel comfortable with that'.
What about personal effects? Wouldn't he like to have a few of his own
things on his desk, which by company rules has to be cleared every night?
No, he says, he has just what he needs.
He moves over to the desk, (which he makes a point of never sitting behind
when he has visitors, using instead a plain table surrounded by four
chairs), and indicates a modest collection of belongings. 'There's a picture
of me missus, a clock given out when I was at Ford, my pipes, ashtray -
that's about it.'
To anyone used to working in complicated hierachies with colourful
characters and pushy egos, there could seem something a little bland,
depressing even, about Nissan's well-regulated atmosphere.
In the entrance lobby area are notices declaring the group's determination
to cherish its people and certificates extolling its training policies. The
reception area doubles as a communal meeting room with little tables and
chairs. At one, the lady in charge of the lavatories is talking
disinfectants with a supplier. Upstairs everyone is quietly getting on with
their work. At lunchtime, many of the workers do what the boss himself does,
and pick up a couple of canteen sandwiches to eat at their desks.
Gibson works hard, and expects others to do likewise. His office day starts
soon after 7am, and would continue until after 6pm, were it not for his
charitable work. This means about two meetings a week for Business in the
Community, universities and local charities.
To help him, he has one secretary, who spends much of her time heading a
'kaizen' group on continuous improvement in Nissan's administration. The
phone rings and as the secretary is not there, he answers it himself. With
no unnecessary preliminaries, he asks what it costs to sponsor a race.
Those who think that the efficient, caring set-up at Nissan sounds too good
to be true would be heartened by a book* published this week arguing that it
is a sham: the company is taking advantage of high unemployment to extract
more than its pound of flesh from its workers.
Gibson shows no defensiveness at the mention of the book. 'I don't know how
to put it . . .' Always understated, he is being particularly careful. 'They
wrote the book without ever coming here. If you read it, it is about
political class struggle . . . I believed that was something that had died
out in British industry.' Maybe it has at Nissan, but then Nissan will waste
no time in telling you that it is ahead of the game.

FT  19 JUN 92 / The Big Lie - Inside the Maxwell's Empire: Questions raised
by Maxwell's last hours - Jimmy Burns has retraced Maxwell's final days,
seen the autopsy report and the autopsy video, interviewed key witnesses and
gained access to hitherto unpublished documents. Here he sets out his
conclusions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
IN THE larger-than-life story of Robert Maxwell, the manner of his death
remains the greatest mystery.
Did he fall overboard accidentally or did he commit suicide? Could he
conceivably have been murdered?
The lack of witnesses between the time of his last phone call to the crew on
board his yacht, the Lady Ghislaine, and the discovery that he was missing
has proved a major problem for investigators trying to get at the truth.
Another obstacle has been the inconclusive nature of forensic evidence. Two
autopsies were conducted on Maxwell's remains. One suggests death by
accident or natural causes. The other leaves open the possibility of suicide
or murder.
The evidence of the last 12 hours of Maxwell's life as he cruised,
apparently without purpose, around the Canaries, is often confused and
contradictory. The official investigations by the Spanish authorities was
less than rigorous.
At stake is a Pounds 20m insurance claim. For Maxwell's family and his
companies to receive that money they have to prove that he died as a result
of an accident or he had been murdered.
The Financial Times has retraced Maxwell's last hours. We have interviewed
key witnesses, including the Lady Ghislaine's crew. We have had access to
hitherto unpublished documentation including the Spanish police
investigation. We have conducted a careful examination of the yacht. The two
autopsy reports conducted in Spain and Israel have been made available to
the FT. What happened?
Why did Maxwell leave for the Canaries alone on October 31?
Maxwell flew to Gibraltar that morning as his empire was collapsing to meet
the Lady Ghislaine. He went without his butler and ****his personal
secretary. He had never done this before. He did not even take a tin of
caviar which always accompanied him on his cruises. Before leaving London he
made the unusual step of thanking Bob Cole, his press officer and confident
31 years, for his services.
He had been told by the Lady Ghislaine's captain, Gus Rankin that the boat
was not ready for the kind of cruise Maxwell was accustomed to. Two of its
crew members - a housekeeper and a steward - were on leave, the storm covers
were up, and there were no provisions on board.
Maxwell told Rankin not to worry. He would bring the provisions with him or
else 'rough it'.
Maxwell left his London staff in the dark as to where he was going and why.
He told Rankin he planned to take a few days off to recover from a cold. He
wanted to be dropped off in Madeira where his private plane would be waiting
to take him to New York or London. He arrived in Gibraltar carrying some
files and a limited supply of provisions.
Rankin, in his first interview, told the FT that he was sceptical about
Maxwell's motives. It did not strike him that his employer had a
particularly bad cold. 'He seemed healthy. He ate well throughout the
crossing.' He did no work on this trip, which was almost unheard of.
What was Maxwell's state of mind on the crossing?
Untroubled, according to those who talked to him during the crossing.
The Lady Ghislaine had the technical capacity to control his empire with a
push of a button. He almost invariably made use of it. In addition to a
fully equipped office - it included computers, copiers, shredder, crytophone
and fax machines - a satellite phone by his bedside identified his
priorities.
The organisations and buildings featured on the short-code dial of his
telephone included Headington Hall, Maxwell House, the Daily Mirror's
newsdesk, the New York Daily News, Macmillan, Rothschilds in New York, his
family, including Kevin and Ian Maxwell, and Eric Sheinberg, one of the
senior traders at Goldman Sachs, who carried out some of Robert Maxwell's
stock market deals.
Rankin said: 'I now feel we were being drawn into a game in which we had no
control.'
On November 2 he called his two sons Ian and Kevin to a meeting in Madeira,
then rescinded the order 10 minutes later. He then changed his earlier plan
to fly out from Madeira and chose to cruise towards the Canaries instead.
Maxwell rang his son on November 3 to cancel a speech he was meant to have
made to an Anglo-Israeli dinner in London.
One female crew member recalls that at one point she entered Maxwell's
office and found the floor covered in documents. She asked him if he wanted
them tidied up. He just kicked them under the table - as if he was no longer
interested in them. Maxwell may no longer have been interested in his
documents. But his family was. One day after his death, according to
Maxwell's chief pilot Brian Hull, his daughter, Ghislaine, and Betty
Maxwell, asked him to pick up some cases from the boat. Hull says he was
handed six hard-backed leather cases by Betty Maxwell who told him that the
documents had to be in London by noon.
Hull flew out at 7.15 next morning reaching the Mirror building in London
just before twelve.
Why would anyone want to kill him?
Maxwell made many enemies in his business career. In the last month of his
life he was accused of arms dealing and having close links with Mossad, the
Israeli Secret Service. His son Philip told Spanish officials on hearing of
his father's disappearance that he thought Maxwell had been kidnapped but
subsequently changed his mind. One Israeli minister still thinks, on the
basis of the second autopsy, that Maxwell may have been murdered.
Could anyone have boarded the ship that night?
All boats in the area on the night of his death have now been accounted for
by the Spanish authorities. Throughout the night of Maxwell's disappearance
the Lady Ghislaine had its radar and other equipment on. It picked up no
suspicious vessels. Rankin says: 'I was on the bridge most of the night. We
were doing 14 knots. It was impossible.'
Where were the crew?
At the time Maxwell died, Captain Rankin and two other crew members were on
the bridge. An engineer was in the engine room. The bridge is sound-proof
and the deck is out of ear-shot of the engine room. All other members of the
crew were sleeping and heard nothing that drew their attention to Mr
Maxwell's movements that night.
Along with other witnesses, the 11 crew members were extensively interviewed
by the police, by insurance investigators and Interpol.
Why did the Lady Ghislaine take such a circuitous route on Maxwell's final
overnight voyage?
Rankin was first told by Maxwell that he wanted to be taken to Los
Cristianos, the southern port of Tenerife, where he would fly out on his
private jet. Maxwell changed his mind. Rankin came under orders from his
employer to 'cruise all night' because it would help him sleep. The log of
the Lady Ghislaine shows that after leaving Santa Cruz it set a course for
the coast of Gran Canaria.
Rankin discovered that Maxwell was missing around 11.00am - an hour and a
half after the boat had docked at Los Cristianos. He did not alert the
international Rescue Co-ordination centre, in Stavanger, Norway, until
12.15pm. The Spanish authorities did not learn of Maxwell's disappearance
until 12.20pm. Why did Rankin take such a long time to contact the Spanish
authorities?
'We had to carry out extensive searches of the boat and the immediate area
around the port.' He also claims that the Spanish authorities failed to
record that he sent a crew member ashore at Los Cristianos soon after the
ship-board search had been completed to alert the local maritime police. 'I
can't remember exactly when that was - around 11.45.'
At one point they spotted a swimmer they thought might have been Maxwell.
Rankin also says he had difficulty in making radio contact with the local
authorities.
Why were the inner, sliding doors to Maxwell's state room locked after he
went missing?
On the evening of November 4, Maxwell ordered a stewardess to lock the main
sliding doors to his quarters from within, leave the key with him and make
her exit through the outer bathroom door, leaving it unlocked behind her.
On the morning Maxwell died, the main sliding doors were found locked from
without, the bathroom door was locked from within, and the heavy steel
framed doors leading to the deck were closed. Maxwell's key was missing.
Rankin had to use a master key to get in.
Maxwell could not have left through the bathroom which had access to the
outer deck. It could not be opened from the outside. While it was not
unusual for Maxwell to go out on deck in the middle of the night, to take
fresh air or relieve himself, the crew cannot remember an occasion when he
closed let alone locked the doors behind him.
The locking of the doors was a preconceived act and yet it has emerged that
the Spanish police chose not to consider in their inquiry.
Could he have fallen overboard?
Conditions were good and the sea was calm on the night of November 4/5. The
Lady Ghislaine made no sudden movements throughout the night, according to
Rankin, cruising at a constant speed of between 14 and 15 knots. The Spanish
police concluded that he lent against a wire on the main deck. The wire is
3ft 6ins, reaching Maxwell's waist. They suggest this had a 'trampoline'
effect throwing him into the sea. No evidence was found of the wire being
disturbed or even dislodged from its hinges as it might well have been by a
man of Maxwell's weight and size. Maxwell was 6ft 2in tall and weighed more
than 20 stone.
It would have been possible for him to fall over the guard rail on the main
deck, which is three inches lower than the wire, although he would have had
to lean well over it to lose his balance.
Had he been drinking excessively or taking sleeping pills?
No evidence was found of significant quantities of alcohol or drugs in his
body. His widow said his sleeping pills had remained untouched.
Why were there two autopsies?
The insurers were dissatisfied with the autopsy carried out in in Spain.
Did the second autopsy find anything new?
Yes. The post mortem carried out in Israel by Dr Iain West, head of forensic
medicine at Guy's hospital, and two Israeli pathologists with the family's
approval, found serious muscle tear and injuries to the left hand and left
shoulder. The pathologists believe this suggests that Maxwell hung on to
something before falling into the water. These crucial findings were not
discovered by the earlier Spanish autopsy.
Maxwell could have sustained such an injury by holding on to prevent himself
from falling by accident or by trying to hoist himself back again.
But West suggests that Maxwell could have also sustained such an injury as
he deliberately took his own life.
West believes such an injury could have been incurred by climbing over the
rail and slipping while still holding the rail. But it could also be a
crucial clue pointing to suicide. 'One sees this pattern of injury on
occasions in individuals who kill themselves as a result of falling from
high buildings. While some will jump or let themselves topple over a baclony
or out of a window others will actually will ease themselves over the edge
and hold on for a time with one or both hands before letting go.'
Could he have died of a heart attack?
Maxwell had been suffering for years from fluid and respiratory problems. He
was overweight and had been under some pressure. However, one of his leading
doctors maintains that he was 'healthy' before leaving on his final cruise.
Tests carried out by Spanish pathologists showed some evidence of ischemic
myocardial damage - in layman's terms, his heart muscles were damaged due to
lack of blood.
The Spanish doctors therefore reached the conclusion that he could have died
of a heart attack in the water having fallen following an accident possibly
provoked by breathing difficulties.
Dr West found difficulty in performing his examination because of the poor
state in which the body reached him. It had been poorly embalmed. Some parts
of the body were in an advanced state of decomposition. Others were missing
having been sent to Madrid for separate analysis by the Spanish pathologist.
But Dr West was unconvinced of the theory that Maxwell had suffered a big
enough heart attack while on board to send him toppling overboard.
He concluded that, while Maxwell had undoubtedly suffered' a degree of heart
damage' there was no evidence of a massive coronary.
Dr West, on the other hand, concedes that Maxwell could have suffered a
heart attack while in the water. In this, at least, the pathologists concur.
The other crucial finding by both autopsies was that there was no conclusive
evidence that the sole cause of death was by drowning, following tests on
Maxwel's lungs and samples taken from the sea water.
Dr West concludes that Maxwell's injuries do not point to a clearly defined
cause of death. The most likely conclusion that can be drawn from both
autopsies is that the physical cause of death was, most probably, a
combination of a heart attack and drowning while struggling in the water.
So how did Maxwell die? On the evidence available both murder - for which
there is no physical evidence - and a heart attack as a single cause of
death can probably be ruled out.
This leaves one of two possibilities. Maxwell either fell into the water by
accident or he committed suicide. Neither can be ruled out on the basis of
the forensic evidence.
Rankin told Maxwell's widow, Betty, on her arrival in the Canaries, that he
thought her husband had killed himself.
The verdict probably rests on Maxwell's behaviour, his state of mind, and
the looming catastrophe he would have to face if he returned.

FT  19 JUN 92 / The Big Lie - Inside the Maxwell Empire: Nowhere to run - A
few days before his death Maxwell faced threats from US banks to sell assets
and repay loans. He was also 'knocked sideways' by allegations that he was a
Mossad agent. These were just some of the pressures that lead inescapably to
the conclusion that he killed himself

THE 10-YEAR-OLD Canadair Challenger 600 aircraft signalled its call sign
HB-VGA, and the control tower gave it permission to land in Israel.
A chilly wind was blowing off the Judean hills as the aircraft carrying
Robert Maxwell's body touched down at the near-deserted Atarot airstrip
north of Jerusalem at 9.50am on the morning of Friday November 8 1991.
Strands of barbed wire divided the runway from the nearby Palestinian camp.
A young, dark-skinned soldier with a sniper rifle patrolled the low, white
terminal.
It had been essential to get the body to Jerusalem before the start of the
Jewish Sabbath on Friday evening. The aircraft had been chartered for Pounds
40,500 the day before by Maxwell's son Ian. With eight of its 19 seats
stripped out it was big enough to handle the coffin in a 'decent and
dignified way', unlike Maxwell's own Gulfstream jet.
Dani Kosovitski, the airport manager, telephoned by Maxwell's Tel Aviv
lawyer Yaacov Ne'eman, had given security clearance for the aircraft to land
quickly. The airport staff knew Maxwell well from his frequent visits.
Maxwell's French wife Betty, his eldest son Philip, and his youngest child
Ghislaine stepped on to the tarmac. They were embraced warmly and
emotionally by Ne'eman and Aliza Eshed, the woman who had organised
Maxwell's diary in Israel for three years.
The small group waited for the heavy coffin to be taken from the hold. It
was carried to a van by 10 black-coated, black-hatted rabbis, arranged by
the Hevra Kadisha, the burial society. The body was taken to Tel Aviv for a
second autopsy. Two days later it would be carried back to Jerusalem for
burial on the Mount of Olives.
The autopsy failed to prove conclusively how Maxwell died. However, the last
two weeks of his life point to the conclusion that he took his own life.
On Sunday October 27, nine days before his death, Robert Maxwell flew to
London in his Gulfstream after a week at the New York Daily News - the
loss-making newspaper which he had set his heart on resurrecting, as he had
done with the Daily Mirror seven years earlier.
Unknown to Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN), as Maxwell flew to New York, he
had taken out a loan of Pounds 50m from Bankers Trust in the name of the
London newspaper. On Monday October 21, he had redirected MGN's money to the
struggling New York newspaper. Maxwell once told his London editors that he
wanted to be remembered as the man who saved the Mirror. But the Pounds 50m
loan stripped that newspaper of some of its hard-won financial health.
Maxwell's ability to create and transform businesses had turned to
destructiveness.
Saturday October 26, 10 days before his death, was, according to Carolyn
Hinsley, Maxwell's assistant in New York, 'the worst day of my life working
for him'. Maxwell had been drinking heavily - vintage champagne during the
day and Chivas Regal in the evening.
Maxwell was enraged about allegations in a book that he was an agent for
Mossad, the Israeli intelligence services. He spent the day in furious
transatlantic calls, instructing staff on how to 'limit the damage'.
His London aides say the allegations 'knocked him sideways' - whereas he had
shrugged off the regular sceptical attacks on the solvency of his empire.
The discussion of his alleged intelligence links in the House of Commons,
safe from legal action under parliamentary privilege, seemed to him an echo
of the judgment of the Department of Trade and Industry 20 years before that
he was 'unfit to run a public company'. It reminded him of how he felt
cold-shouldered by the British establishment.
The last loan ever made to Maxwell's companies was announced by Lloyds Bank
and Barclays Bank on Monday October 28, a week before Maxwell's death. An
extension of a long-standing loan, the Pounds 80m advanced to Maxwell's
private companies, was backed by a charge against Maxwell House, the
empire's headquarters at Holborn Circus in London - one of the last assets
to remain unmortgaged.
The next morning, Tuesday October 29, a single sheet of paper arrived at
Maxwell House from the US bank Shearson Lehman which showed that the Lloyds
money would not be enough. Lehman declared that because of failure to repay
its loans it was going to seize the collateral: shares in the language
company Berlitz, a subsidiary of Maxwell Communication Corporation (MCC),
Maxwell's largest public company. If the bank carried out its threat it
would block the imminent sale of Berlitz, needed to pay down MCC's debt.
On Wednesday morning, October 30, another fire broke out. Goldman Sachs, the
blue chip US investment bank, delivered a formal warning that unless it was
paid more than Pounds 10m owed for foreign currency by Friday it would sell
the collateral it had been given: a block of shares in MCC. If Goldman Sachs
 -the biggest buyers of MCC shares in the company's history - turned
sellers, the stock market would read it as an irreversible signal to sell,
and to keep on selling. That could trigger the meltdown that Maxwell House
had always feared: bank loans throughout the empire were backed by the value
of MCC shares, and if the price fell, the empire would crash.
The same day Kevin Maxwell wrote to Swiss Bank Corporation to say that
Maxwell House would repay their Pounds 55m loan early on Tuesday November 5
instead of giving it some collateral.
John Featley, Maxwell's chauffeur, who spent the week driving Maxwell and
Kevin to bank offices, says: 'It seemed his (Robert Maxwell's) attitude had
changed. From walking past you as if you didn't exist, he actually stopped
and talked to you.'
'By that time the rows had stopped,' says Basil Brookes, MCC finance
director, remembering Maxwell's detachment. 'Maybe it was because we didn't
speak any more by then - at least we didn't speak about business.'
Brookes had braced himself for an explosion that afternoon: he was going to
tell Maxwell that finally he was leaving. Instead he found Maxwell
sentimental and unable to grasp the problem in front of him.
Although he had told the Maxwells three months earlier that he wanted to
quit, he had stayed because his lawyers told him he had a duty to resolve
the MCC boardroom row over Maxwell's siphoning off of money from MCC to his
own private companies. That Wednesday afternoon Brookes finally felt
entitled to go. He and Peter Laister, a non-executive director, had agreed
with Kevin a formal list of procedures for deals between MCC and the private
Maxwell companies. Brookes and Laister thought it marked a huge step
forward. Brookes, deeply relieved, went to tell Robert Maxwell that he was
going.
Brookes insisted that the press release announcing his resignation must go
out by Monday November 4. He had warned Maxwell repeatedly that he would not
put his name to another set of MCC's financial results - and MCC's half-year
figures were due in three weeks.
He knew the figures would show a collapse in profits. The shares,
undoubtedly, would slump.
Maxwell summoned Neil Taberner from the auditors Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte.
He telephoned Laister in his car. Laister was racing home, ready to leave
for a week's holiday - but he turned back for the office.
Taberner was told that Brookes was leaving and that MCC had no replacement.
Maxwell made several suggestions for replacements - but Brookes and Laister
told him they were ridiculous; the City would just laugh, and mark the
shares down. Laister said the company desperately needed a deputy chairman,
and was taken aback when Maxwell offered him the job. Brookes says that at
the end of the meeting Maxwell took him aside: 'He was suddenly very nice.
He said: 'You know it's disastrous for me that you're going.''
Just before 8pm that night, Maxwell saw Bob Cole - his spokesman in London
who had worked for him for 31 years. Cole says: 'He put his arms on my
shoulders and kissed me. He had only done that twice before. My father, who
was also Jewish, used to hug me like that.
'But the problem with Maxwell was that he couldn't give a compliment without
taking it away too. So he said: 'The thing about you, Bob, in all the years
you've been working for me is that you always thought your job was to aid
the press. You didn't realise that working for me your job was to hinder the
press.'' They both laughed, but the criticism left a sour taste in Cole's
mouth.
Maxwell walked up the flight of stairs from his office to the penthouse to
catch a few hours sleep. His four-seater Aerospatiale helicopter - with the
insignia of the MGN lion growling on the side - took off from the roof early
the next morning. It took him to Luton airport where his Gulfstream was
waiting to take him to Gibraltar where his yacht, the Lady Ghislaine, was
waiting.
The next morning, Thursday October 31, Charlotte Thornton, Maxwell's
secretary, told all callers: 'RM will be away about a week. No faxes, no
phones. He's tired and he's not been feeling so good.'
Maxwell left behind a empire which was within weeks of collapse, and queues
of executives waiting to present their petitions for money.
Ernie Burrington, MGN managing director, and Lawrence Guest, its finance
director, had decided that they would have a showdown with Maxwell that
morning. They had worried for two months about Pounds 47m diverted from the
MGN bank account to Maxwell's private companies - and were unaware of the
Pounds 50m diverted to New York.
Burrington says: 'Lawrence was prepared to take on Maxwell and this time I
was going to ask the other directors to do it as well.' The two agreed they
would 'hit Maxwell when he came back from his trip'.
That day Bacon &amp; Woodrow, the firm of actuaries, signed a formal report on
the value of the Maxwell companies' pension funds. They pointed out,
however, that it was provisional. 'We have not yet received an audited
statement of the assets at the valuation date from the auditors Coopers &amp;
Lybrand Deloitte,' they said. The next audit was not due until December 31 -
so neither the actuaries nor auditors knew that more than Pounds 400m of the
pension assets had been siphoned off.
That Thursday was the day of the Goldman Sachs ultimatum. The firm - famous
on Wall Street for its aggression - had begun to carry out its threat to
sell MCC shares.
Late that afternoon Citibank, the US bank, announced to the London Stock
Exchange that it had 'acquired an interest' in 5 per cent of MCC. Kevin told
Cole to give no official comment, as press calls about the announcement were
'after business hours'. Only those in Maxwell House knew that another bank
had begun to repossess the security for its loans.
Early that evening the Financial Times called Kevin Maxwell's office to say
that it had completed a month-long investigation into the Maxwell empire and
was about to publish a report that said hidden debt in the private companies
was much higher than the outside world realised.
The next afternoon, Friday November 1, Kevin Maxwell called the FT and said:
'I'm happy to talk, but the points you've raised will take some time to go
through. Let's meet on Monday at 6pm.'
By the end of that day, Swiss Bank had been told by Kevin Maxwell's office
that the Pounds 55m loan could not after all be repaid by Tuesday. The bank
told Maxwell House this was unacceptable: if the money was not in the office
by Tuesday they were going to their lawyers.
On Saturday November 2, 1,800 miles away, the Lady Ghislaine reached
Madeira. During the passage from Gibraltar Maxwell had told the ship's
captain, Gus Rankin, to contact the Gulfstream in Madeira and order it to go
back to Luton to pick up Kevin and Ian for a meeting. He cancelled the order
10 minutes later.
Arriving in Funchal, the capital, Maxwell found himself besieged by
journalists. Furious, he cut short a tour of the city and asked Rankin to
take him to the remote island of Desertas so he could swim. But he swam for
only three minutes because he said the water was far too cold and told
Rankin to take him back to Funchal.
Rankin, used to the impulses of his employer, was nonetheless puzzled at the
sudden changes.
That Saturday evening Brookes was at home in Hertfordshire at a bonfire
party with his family. He says: 'In the middle the phone rang - it was the
old man from the boat. I'd had quite a lot to drink. He said he'd be back on
Monday and: 'We'll deal with the press release about your resignation then.'
He was unbelievably charming and nice. I was in the kitchen with my wife -
the others were outside and couldn't hear - and I said to her: 'I guarantee
you he won't be back on Monday.' I called Ron Woods (another MCC director)
on Sunday and I told him the same thing - I guarantee you he won't be back.'
After calling Brookes Maxwell asked Rankin to sign out Dollars 3,000 from
the ship's funds so that he could go to the local casino. Rankin never saw
the money again.
The next morning, Sunday November 3, Maxwell asked the bemused Rankin to
drop him off at an airport in the Atlantic between Madeira and Bermuda.
Rankin told him there was nothing but open sea between the islands. Maxwell
picked the Canaries instead and asked for the Gulfstream to meet him there.
In the middle of the greatest financial crisis of his life Maxwell was
directing his yacht on an aimless cruise.
Maxwell did not seem to his crew like a man under pressure. He seemed
instead to be a man who had decided to drift. 'It was as if he'd decided to
just let everybody else get on with it,' says Rankin.
On Sunday night at 10.30pm he spoke to his son Ian and said he Maxwell did
not seem to his crew like a man under pressure. He seemed instead to be a
man who had decided to drift was not sure he would make it back by Monday
evening because he was feeling unwell.
In the Canaries that morning, Monday November 4, the Lady Ghislaine sailed
to a small bay called Polis de Abono. Maxwell asked to be taken for a ride
in a speed boat, but was brought back as the sea was rough, and asked to be
taken to Santa Cruz on Tenerife.
In telephone calls that day he was unusually considerate, apologising for
disturbing Burrington during his lunch. Burrington says: 'I thought,
blimey.' He says Maxwell said: 'I'm coming back tomorrow night, and I'll see
you Thursday morning.'
Over the phone Maxwell to his Paris lawyer Sam Pisar and his son Ian,
Maxwell drafted the speech Ian was due to give at an Anglo-Israeli dinner
that night. He gave out a 'great belly laugh' at a joke about Yasser Arafat
jumping out of a aircraft, mistaking a Jewish prayer shawl for a parachute.
Maxwell showed no recognition of the financial crisis.
That morning, back in London, Brookes signed his formal resignation. He
spoke to Maxwell three times to agree the wording of the press release.
Brookes says: 'We agreed it would go out Monday night or Tuesday morning.
But somehow it didn't'
At 4pm Goldman Sachs's formal notification to MCC that it had sold part of
its shareholding on Thursday arrived at Maxwell House. Cole asked Kevin's
office for permission to release the statement but Cole says he was told:
'No - tomorrow.'
A copy of the log of phone calls from the boat shows that Maxwell spoke to
Kevin several times. Cole says: 'It would be nearly unbelievable for Kevin
not to have told his father on the boat that the Goldmans' notice had come
through.'
At 5pm Kevin Maxwell's secretary called the FT to postpone the meeting at
6pm until the next morning.
That evening Maxwell - appearing to forget which country he was in - asked
Rankin to lend him some Portuguese escudoes to go ashore. He asked a taxi to
take him to 'the best restaurant in town'.
They drove to the Hotel Mencey, a restored colonial palace with marble
floors. The head waiter, Sergio Rodriguez, led Maxwell to table number one
where he sat on a green velvet chair with a view of the tropical gardens,
and in front of him, a statue of a Roman emperor.
Rodriguez recalls: 'He came in dressed in a summer jacket and open shirt. It
was only the next day that I realised who he was from the photographs in the
newspapers. But that night I mistook him for a cook from the Blue Star line
I had met once.' Maxwell ordered three beers, two of which he drank quickly.
He ordered spinach and asparagus mousse, cod in mushroom and parsely sauce
and a pear. Rodriguez says that throughout the meal he was sweating
slightly, but adds: 'He didn't strike me as particularly ill or agitated.'
Only later did he seem distracted, leaving his jacket at the table as he
left at 9.45pm. He had a coffee and brandy at the Cafeteria Olympus and was
taken back to the boat.
During his meal the Gulfstream had arrived at Tenerife's southern airport.
Maxwell took Rankin's suggestion that they should sail around the island to
Los Cristianos to approach the aircraft - sparing him a drive along the
winding coastal road. But Maxwell told Rankin not to take the direct route,
and instead to cruise through the night to Gran Canaria and back. He said he
would sleep better if the boat was at sea.
Maxwell said he planned to fly to London the next day, Tuesday November 5,
and that the crew would then be free to sail to New York as originally
planned.
Later that evening, around 11pm Spanish time, Rabbi Vogel, a representative
of the orthodox Jewish Lubavitch sect, called Maxwell from New York about
his project to prise religious books from Russian archives. Maxwell said he
would try to get some response from Gorbachev. That was the last phone
conversation he held.
The next day, at 9.30am, Kevin Maxwell met the FT. He agreed with the FT's
estimated Pounds 3.3bn debt for the Maxwell empire that year, but said all
was well with the private companies. He seemed cool and relaxed.
At 11am Cole released to the Stock Exchange the bald statement that Goldman
Sachs had turned seller of MCC shares. The shares began to slide. Ten per
cent of MCC's value was wiped off by by 2.58pm when all dealings in MCC and
MGN shares were frozen. Ten minutes later a second announcement told the
world that Robert Maxwell was missing at sea, feared lost.
Did Robert Maxwell kill himself? By the day he died his empire had run out
of every drop of money and would have collapsed within weeks, exposing the
raided pension funds.
To Maxwell that would, surely, have been more than just shame or
humiliation. He identified completely with his creations, the power they
gave him, the Gulfstream, the yacht. The helicopter, with the huge shaggy
lion's head on the side, disturbing the peace as it clattered on to the roof
of Maxwell House - that was Robert Maxwell. The collapse of his empire would
have been equivalent to his annihilation.
Would Robert Maxwell, who had pursued publicity for every smallest event,
choose to die alone, without telling anyone or leaving any sign? He gave no
sign to Kevin, judging by Kevin's composure that morning.
But part of the obsessive emotions that drove his constant activity was
enormous anger. He had a violent past: his family had been killed in the
Second World War, and his part of Czechoslovakia annexed by the Soviet
Union. In the last three years of his life he turned his destructiveness
against his businesses - which he neglected, abused, and in the end
destroyed.
The signs suggest that in the end Robert Maxwell destroyed himself. On the
deck of his boat, circling islands in the Atlantic in the hours before it
became light, he was alone with those emotions and had nowhere to run.

       THE FINAL HOURS: RETRACING MAXWELL'S LAST STEPS ABOARD THE
                             LADY GHISLAINE
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  10.15pm on November 4, Maxwell asks stewardess to lock sliding
    doors to his stateroom.  She does this from the inside, leaves the
    key with him and goes out through the bathroom door.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  He is telephoned by son Ian at 11.15pm and Rabbi Feivish Vogei at
    11.20pm.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  4.10am on November 5, a crew member sees Maxwell looking over the
    stern rail.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  4.45am, Maxwell telephones from his stateroom and asks for air
    conditioning to be turned off.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  6.00am, approximate time of death given by Spanish pathologists'
    report.  Police believe this is the point from which he went into
    the sea.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
6.  This is where he probably went over the side instead.  The position
    given by the police (between pillar and tender) would have been a
    tight squeeze for a man of his size (6ft 2in and 21 stone).  His
    weight would probably have pulled out the tender retaining wire
    which blocked his way: this was still in place and undamaged.  He
    could not have gone through to the back of the boat because on the
    night that route was blocked by a motorcycle
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
7.  In the morning the bathroom door is locked from the inside.  The
    sliding doors to the stateroom are locked from the outside and the
    glass doors to the stern are closed.  Maxwell was no in the habit
    of locking the doors and the key has not been found.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    WHERE WAS THE CREW? Captain Rankin and two members were in the
    soundproof wheelhouse.  One member was in the engine room.  The
    seven remaining members were in the crew's quarters.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The FT's team of journalists has interviewed more than 150 people in 13
countries. The team led by Bronwen Maddox included: In London Jimmy Burns,
Raymond Snoddy, Robert Peston, Andrew Jack, Norma Cohen, Richard Gourlay,
Daniel Green. In Jerusalem: Hugh Carnegy. In Liechtenstein: Ian Rodger. In
Moscow: Leyla Boulton. In New York: Alan Freidman

FT  19 JUN 92 / The Maxwells: Lecturer rues his expensive mistake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST HOURS before his arrest yesterday Larry Trachtenberg was musing on the
events over the past decade which carried the 38-year-old American from a
lecture hall at the London School of Economics to the dock at Bow Street
magistrate's court, alongside Kevin and Ian Maxwell.
'It was an expensive mistake,' he said, referring to the last in a series of
career changes which saw the former lecturer in international relations at
LSE rise to a sensitive financial position at the heart of Robert Maxwell's
empire.
Just how expensive will depend on the outcome of the conspiracy to defraud
and theft charges which he now faces. But it was already clear before his
arrest that the scandal was taking its toll.
The enforced idleness at home while waiting for the police and SFO
investigation to unfold grated on a man who had spent much of the past seven
years involved in the heady atmosphere of City deal-making.
The speed with which some former close friends and business associates
distanced themselves has also taken its toll. 'It's as if you're carrying
around the stench of a dead cat,' he said.
Mr Trachtenberg's rise and fall is a classic story of the City in the 1980s.
In 1985, Mr Trachtenberg, a computer buff, founded Global Analysis Systems
(GAS) with fellow American and Oxford academic, Mr Andrew Smith, and a
British partner who eventually dropped out.
The original intention of providing high quality on-line analysis of
international economic and political developments never really caught on.
But it was exactly the type of new media venture which caught the eye of
Robert Maxwell, who bought the company in 1987
He was also intrigued by a bevy of new financial products, such as an early
global tracker fund, which Mr Smith was keen to develop.
The spin-off of the financial products of GAS into London &amp; Bishopsgate
International (LBI), a fund management company and financial tool of the
Maxwells, was not altogether welcome, at least from Mr Trachtenberg's
present perspective.
'I was dragged into the City', he says. But his own transformation from an
essentially administrative role to that of a financial operative was quick,
though press reports suggesting he was a driving force in the Maxwells'
labyrinthine financial dealings are discounted by former colleagues and
employees.

FT  19 JUN 92 / The Maxwells: Police helped by accountants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ARRESTS of Mr Kevin Maxwell, Mr Ian Maxwell and Mr Larry Trachtenberg
yesterday by the Serious Fraud Office follow several months of inquiries by
a team of more than 50 police officers and other staff, given considerable
support by accountants acting as administrators to the Maxwell companies.
The SFO staff is still working on further investigations which may lead to
additional charges in the coming months.
Mr John Tate is controller of the SFO Maxwell team, which includes several
lawyers and up to 30 accountants seconded from the forensic division of KPMG
Peat Marwick.
But besides its own inquiries, the SFO has also been able to draw on
information from the substantial investigations work conducted by
accountants who were administrators acting on behalf of creditors to the
Maxwell public and private companies.
Mr John Talbot, a partner with Arthur Andersen, has co-ordinated the
administration of the private Maxwell business empire of more than 400
companies.
The firm passed information on alleged MCC share support operations to the
SFO.
Mr David Lee, head of the litigation and special investigation services unit
at Price Waterhouse, administrators to Maxwell Communications Corporation,
has been equally important.
Mr Neil Cooper, the partner at Robson Rhodes, liquidator to Bishopsgate
Investment Management, manager and trustee of the pension funds, has also
been investigating movements of money.
The accountants have had access to information not available to the police
under special powers given to them by the 1986 insolvency act.
So-called 'section 236' interviews allow them to ask questions of
individuals, who have no right to silence. This information cannot be passed
on to police.
There have been regular meetings to share other information by the different
accountants and the SFO. Private investigators have also been employed to
help trace assets and identify movements of money.
The SFO has publicly announced five separate inquiries between November 1991
and January this year in conjunction with the City of London police, to
which some of yesterday's charges relate:
November 18, 1991: a Pounds 55m loan from Swiss Bank Corporation to Adviser
(188), a company owned by Headington Investments, after a complaint from
Swiss Bank Corporation
December 4: allegations concerning the management of assets of the Mirror
Group Newspapers Pension Fund
December: further allegations concerning money missing from MGN, following a
complaint from Mirror Group
December 18: arrangements made to support the price of MCC shares, following
receipt of information from Arthur Andersen, administrators of the private
Maxwell interests passed to the Department of Trade and Industry
January 3 1992: assets including cash and investments removed from MCC,
launched following investigations by Price Waterhouse, administrators to MCC
The charges against Mr Kevin and Mr Ian Maxwell and Mr Larry Trachtenberg
appear to relate principally to the Swiss Bank Corporation loan and alleged
thefts of pension fund money. There is no mention of share support
allegations, by which directors buy shares in their own companies but do not
disclose the purchases as required by UK company legislation.

FT  19 JUN 92 / The Maxwells: Last will and testament of Robert Maxwell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I, IAN ROBERT MAXWELL of Headington Hill Hall, Oxford, England, publisher,
hereby revoke all Wills and Testamentary Dispositions heretofore made by me
and declare this to be my last Will.
I appoint my wife, Elisabeth Jeanne Maxwell; Ellis Freedman, attorney-at-law
of the State of New York; my sons, Ian and Kevin Maxwell; my daughter,
Christine Malina; and each of my other children who shall be actively
engaged in the executive senior management (ie being a Director) of any of
the group of companies owned or controlled by the Pergamon Holding
Foundation (PHF), or any other companies in publishing, printing,
communications or related fields that are associated with any of the said
companies (collectively hereinafter referred to as the Pergamon Group (PG))
at the time of my death, to be the Executors of this my Will; provided,
however, that upon Mr Freedman's attaining the age of 70 or ceasing to be
actively engaged in the practice of law, whichever shall first occur, he may
be removed by a written instrument signed by a majority of the other
Executors then serving. The term 'actively engaged' as used in the preceding
sentence shall be construed to mean full time employment and hold the
position of Director in at least one of the operating companies in the
Pergamon Group. If at any time neither my said wife nor Mr Freedman are
serving as Executors, a majority of the remaining Executors may appoint one
or more persons to serve as successor Executors in their place.
If at any time there shall be less than four Executors serving, they or a
majority of them shall have the right to appoint one or more successor
Executors.
I direct my Executors to arrange for my burial in an orthodox Jewish
cemetery in accordance with orthodox Jewish rites in Jerusalem.
I direct that the cash legacies to individuals hereinbelow provided shall be
paid as soon after my death as may be practicable and free of all duties and
taxes payable on my death.
I give to my dear wife, Elisabeth Jeanne Maxwell, all my personal chattels
as defined in form two of the Statutory Will Forms 1925, not otherwise
hereby or by any Codicil hereto specifically disposed of, and the sum of
Pounds 500,000, if she shall survive me.
I give to each of my children who shall survive me the sum of Pounds
200,000. In the event that any of my children shall not survive me the
legacy given to that child shall be paid in equal shares to his or her issue
surviving me, per stirpes.
I give the sum of Pounds 150,000 to my sister, Sylvia Rosen. In the
'Fund C to encourage and assist capable young people in the setting up of
their own businesses in the fields of media, communications and information'
event that my sister, Sylvia Rosen, shall not survive me, the legacy of
Pounds 150,000 given to her shall be paid in equal shares to her issue
surviving me, per stirpes.
I give the sum of USDollars 100,000 each to my niece, Helene Atkin, and my
nephew, Michael Atkin, if they shall survive me.
I give to Jean Baddeley, in recognition of her many years of loyal service
and hard work, the sum of Pounds 100,000 if she shall survive me.
If any beneficiary under my Will shall be bankrupt at the date of my death
any amount that he or she would otherwise have received under my Will shall
be held on protective trusts for such beneficiary under Section 33 of the
Trustee Act 1925 instead of absolutely for such beneficiary.
If any beneficiary under my Will shall contest its validity or the validity
of any of its provisions such beneficiary shall if the Will or such
provisions are upheld be entitled to one thousand pounds only instead of the
gift the beneficiary would otherwise have had.
All gifts to any beneficiary who is an individual are conditional upon a
majority (including my wife if then living) of the Executors of this my Will
stating in writing not later than two years after my death that in their
opinion the beneficiary in question has not been guilty of conduct tending
to bring my family or the Pergamon Group into disrepute or otherwise harmful
to my family and failing such instrument such gift shall fall into my
residuary estate.
I give to an orthodox synagogue or Beth Midrash in Israel to be selected by
the Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of Israel, as an endowment to ensure that prayers
be said in perpetuity for my parents, my sisters and brother and myself on
the anniversaries of our deaths, or any other date chosen by the said Chief
Rabbi such amount as may be needed for that purpose.
In the case of a gift to a person under the age of 18 years the receipt of
their parent or guardian shall be a good discharge.
I give, devise and bequeath all the rest, residue and remainder of my estate
after payment of all liabilities of my estate and any duties or taxes
payable on my death to the trustees of a new trust to be called 'The Maxwell
Family Charitable Trust' intended at the date of this my Will to be set up
in the near future if the same shall be constituted at the date of my death
(failing which I give devise and bequeath the same to my Executors) in each
case upon trust to divide the same in four equal parts (funds A, B, C and D
respectively) and to hold such funds and to apply the income of each of such
Funds to the following uses and purposes:
1 Fund A to provide financial assistance to the people of Israel in the
defence to the State of Israel.
2 Fund B in support of primary scientific and medical research in the
following areas:
(a) Assisting in the eradication of cancer, especially to favour those
researchers who are attempting to alter the behaviour of cancer cells to
become benign or to convert themselves into the defenders, rather than the
attackers, of the biological system;
(b) The eradication of heart disease;
(c) Research on the human brain, looking to a better understanding of the
brain as a way of curing and controlling dementia and Alzheimer's disease
and the restoration of brain functions to persons suffering severe head
injuries.
3 Fund C to encourage and assist capable young people in the setting up of
their own businesses in the fields of media, communications and information,
on the understanding that they will contribute 10 per cent of the equity of
their businesses to Fund C on receipt of the grant and will ultimately
refund to Fund C the monies advanced if they are successful. The Trust shall
be required to use the income received from such equity participation or the
sale thereof for the further expansion of this programme. The Trust shall
hold an annual prize-giving symposium at a place to be designated by the
Trust and to be organised in connection with a world young entrepreneurs'
forum which will be held under the auspices of 12 to 20 of the world's
leading businessmen invited to serve by the Chairman of the Pergamon Group
(or if there is no such Chairman, the Chairman of the principal operating
company in the Group).
4 Fund D to fund the efforts of such individuals in the social and
behavioural sciences, including politics, whose ideas in the opinion of a
panel of distinguished advisers in those fields to be selected by the
Chairman of the Pergamon Group (or if there is no such Chairman, the
Chairman of the principal operating company in the Group), would contribute
to the avoidance of war and conflicts between nations, the elimination of
racial hatred, and making the primary, secondary and tertiary educational
systems more practical in the preparation of children and students for a
life of change that will better enable them to contribute both to the
creation of wealth and the enjoyment of leisure. The Trust shall use its
best endeavours to link together the two groups of young people to be
benefited under the provisions of this paragraph 4 and the preceding
paragraph 3, by bringing them together in the annual conference mentioned
above.
If in any year the entire income of any of the Funds is not used for the
purposes aforesaid, the surplus shall be transferred to the reserve of the
Fund in question and become part of its principal.
It is my hope that the Pergamon Holding Foundation, whose assets I have
helped to build up to their present massive capacity, will commit themselves
to support all of the foregoing purposes.
The Trust shall maintain a small professional staff responsible for
encouraging and supporting these programmes and ensuring their worldwide
dissemination.
I direct that all my shares of stock of any companies in which I may own a
controlling interest and of all companies in the Pergamon Group that my said
Executors may receive shall continue to be held by my said Executors and
shall not be sold or otherwise disposed of by them except as part of the
distribution of my estate; provided that the foregoing direction shall not
preclude the sale or other disposal of individual companies, when compelling
business or political considerations so dictate.
The provisions of Clauses 4, 8 and 10 of a Declaration of Trust dated 21
December 1986 constituting the Maxwell Charitable Trust shall, so far as
capable of so applying, apply to the Trusts of this Will as if incorporated
herein in extenso.
'Fund D to fund the efforts of individuals whose ideas . . .
contribute to the avoidance of conflicts between nations, the elimination of
racial hatred'
In the event of any dispute or difference amongst my Executors, the decision
of a majority shall control; any deadlock shall be resolved by lot.
I desire and declare that Jean Baddeley shall continue to be employed in and
about the management of my estate and that such engagement be upon the most
generous terms of compensation that may be deemed appropriate.
No Executor may be liable for any loss or breach of trust not attributable
to his own dishonesty and no Executor shall be bound to take any proceedings
against a co-Executor or former Executor or his personal representatives for
any breach or alleged breach of trust committed or suffered by any such
co-Executor.
In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand to this and the six (6)
preceding pages this 12th day of July, nineteen hundred and eighty-seven.

FT  19 JUN 92 / The Maxwells: Raids start with home arrests
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
POLICE began yesterday's events with carefully co-ordinated early-morning
raids on three homes in expensive parts of London - Chelsea, Hampstead and
Belgravia.
For Mr Kevin Maxwell, at his home in Chelsea, it was a highly public arrest.
Journalists had been tipped off and were waiting outside his four-storey
home when six detectives working with the Serious Fraud Office arrived in
two cars. It was the media presence that led his wife Pandora to mistake the
police for journalists.
Soon after 7am, Mr Kevin Maxwell and his brother Ian, who had been arrested
at his home in Belgravia, arrived at Snow Hill police station in the City of
London in separate cars. About an hour later, Mr Larry Trachtenberg arrived
at the same police station after his arrest at his Hampstead home.
In another raid during the morning, five plainclothes officers from the
Serious Fraud Office went to the City office in Wardrobe Place, where Mr
Kevin Maxwell had been working.
The officers entered the office at about 7.30am and left at 10.40am, taking
with them several sacks filled with documents and computer equipment.
Two secretaries arrived at about 9.30am and remained in the building during
the raid. They were joined there by a solicitor an hour later.
Two lawyers representing the Maxwell family also arrived and stayed inside
the building during the raid.
In Oxford, life appeared to be carrying on as normal inside Headington Hill
Hall, for 32 years the Maxwell family home.
Mrs Betty Maxwell, widow of Robert Maxwell, still lives in the 29-bedroom
Victorian mansion, but there was no sign of her. She has not been seen on
the estate for a few days. A former employee, who has recently been acting
as her chauffeur, is on holiday in the US.
Two of the 23 Pergamon Press journalists dismissed by Robert Maxwell three
years ago kept a vigil outside the automatic security gates. Pergamon Press,
the company around which Mr Maxwell built his empire, is still based on the
estate but is owned by the Dutch publishing group Elsevier.
Two of the sacked Pergamon Press workers, production editor Mr Howard
Waller, 27, and editorial assistant Mr Chris Tighe, 25, sat in deckchairs at
the back of a Ford Transit truck outside the only entrance to the 14-acre
estate.
They watched as a steady flow of couriers brought manuscripts from
Pergamon's authors. The Royal Mail will still not pass the National Union of
Journalists' picket line to enter the estate and mail is collected each day
from the sorting office by Pergamon staff.
In the early morning, police visited the country home of Mr and Mrs Kevin
Maxwell, Hill Barn, a converted barn on an isolated hill at Hailey near
Wallingford in Oxfordshire. Items were taken from the house in a polythene
bag.
A few minutes later, three men, accompanied by another who appeared to be
the keyholder, were let into a locked double garage across the gravel yard.
They searched one of the garage units but emerged after 15 minutes
apparently emptyhanded. The team, who said they were from the City of London
police, drove off shortly before 10am on their way back to London.

<TEXT>
MPS CAMPAIGNING on behalf of the Maxwell pensioners were encouraged
yesterday that Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the governor of the Bank of
England, would take a more active role in assisting in the recovery of
assets.
Three MPs from the all-party group - Mr Richard Page, Mr Frank Field and Mr
David Shaw - met Mr Leigh-Pemberton to express their concerns about what has
been seen at Westminster as too passive a role adopted by the Bank over the
Maxwell affair.
They came away with the impression that the Bank had been acquiring
information more actively behind the scenes, and that it would be working
closely with the special unit to help the pensioners which has been set up
in the department of social security and is led by Sir John Cuckney.
The MPs were also cheered that while Mr Leigh-Pemberton was very conscious
of the limits of the Bank's legal powers, he recognised also the powerful
influence that it could exert.
They expressed confidence that once he was sure of the information on which
he could act, he would be ready to do so, in order to contribute to ensuring
that the government's moral pressure on some banks and financial
institutions was effective.
He is to circulate to the MPs a note of the discussion which will set out
the Bank's position, and is ready to meet them in the autumn if that is
still wanted. The MPs had written asking him to talk to the group, but in
the event he may instead give evidence to the all-party social security
committee once that has been re-established.
Mr Leigh-Pemberton seems to have succeeded in softening the severely
critical stance which many among the 100-strong all-party group had taken
towards his approach.
One or two of the group, however, are still unhappy that the Bank will not
take a broader view of its duties and act as a City-wide regulator.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Major undeterred by Maastricht row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR last night underlined his determination to prevent the
uncertainty over the Maastricht accord from derailing British plans to place
the future enlargement of the Community at the centre of its EC presidency.
In talks in Downing Street with Mr Anbal Cavaco Silva, the Portuguese prime
minister, Mr Major said he wanted next week's Lisbon summit to give a clear
signal that the EC was ready to accelerate negotiations on the entry of the
Efta countries.
Mr Major plans to use the British presidency to lay the groundwork for
enlargement negotiations with Sweden, Norway, Finland and Austria in the
first half of next year.
Assuming that the result today of the Irish referendum on Maastricht is
positive, the British prime minister also wants the summit to give the
go-ahead for work to more closely define the responsibilities of the
Community.
Spelling out the implications of the 'subsidiarity' provision is seen as a
key element in any deal to allow Denmark a second referendum which might
endorse the treaties on political and monetary union.
During the British presidency, Mr Major would like to effectively shelve
Commission president Jacques Delors' proposals for a large increase in the
Community's resources.
But despite the clear rejection by EC finance ministers of any increase on
the scale recommended by the Commission president, British officials believe
that Spain will lead a group of southern countries determined to keep the
issue on the agenda.
So Mr Major will be looking for a declaration from the 12 leaders signalling
that the EC must respect the same budgetary constraints as national
governments.
In the Commons yesterday Mr Major repeated his insistence that Britain would
not be holding a referendum. He said such a vote would fall outside
Britain's traditions of parliamentary sovereignty.
The cabinet deferred its formal decision to endorse Mr Delors' appointment
for another two years. Ministers will now approve the re-appointment just a
few hours before Mr Major flies to Lisbon on Thursday evening.
The government last night gave its strongest warning yet of how damaging a
German decision to leave the Pounds 20bn European Fighter Aircraft project
would be for Germany's credibility with its European partners.
Winding up a short Lords debate on EFA, Viscount Cranborne, junior defence
minister, warned that if Germany withdrew it would be 'very difficult' for
its European partners to 'look Chancellor Kohl, his successors or ministers
in the eye and say: 'We believe you when you tell us that you are good
Europeans.''

FT  19 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour NEC ends wrangling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
LABOUR patched up its furious public wrangling over responsibility for its
April election defeat yesterday by acknowledging that the party had failed
to win back the full confidence of voters.
A four-hour inquest by the national executive - widely predicted to be
stormy - was sobered by devastating post-election opinion poll evidence
showing widespread distrust of the party's competence to govern.
The surveys of floating voters also confirmed the conclusions already voiced
by Mr Neil Kinnock, the leader, that Labour has still to live down its
factional in-fighting of the early 1980s, the 'winter of discontent' and its
economic record in power.
There was some discussion of the detailed conduct of the campaign, run by
campaigns co-ordinator Dr John Cunningham, including the 'Jennifer's ear'
affair, the Sheffield rally and the controversial role of the Shadow
Communications Agency. Nevertheless, Mr Larry Whitty, the general secretary,
said the meeting had been 'good and constructive'.
In his 58-page report, he explained the defeat as linked to a failure to
convince 'suburban man' that it was safe to vote Labour; difficulties in
getting the core vote out, especially the votes of older women; an
impressive Conservative grassroots machine; and the Tory tabloid press.
Mr Whitty also identified some of the campaign's successes, including the
shadow budget produced by Mr John Smith and the quality of Labour's election
broadcasts.
Observing that 11 per cent of Sun readers had switched to the Conservatives
in the last week of the campaign, he said that the party would now bring
pressure to bear through the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) to tackle
biased reporting where opinion was projected as fact.
Some 15 members of the 32-strong NEC added their observations about what
went wrong but there were no fierce recriminations over what was seen as a
hard-fought campaign.
Mr John Prescott, the deputy leadership candidate who voiced acid criticism
of overbearing unelected 'outsiders' on the campaign team on Wednesday,
yesterday expressed appreciation of the work of everyone involved in the
campaign.
Mr Kinnock appeared to recognise in his concluding remarks that the new
leadership must now seek to widen Labour's support. He said: 'If we are to
help the have-nots, we have to get the support of the haves and the haven't
enoughs.'
It was now time for the party to put aside blame and bloodletting, get over
the shock of defeat and look to the future.
Mr David Hill, Labour's communications chief, said he would be filing a
report on media election coverage to the PCC within a month. Labour believed
that the recent critical comments of the PCC on coverage of the royal family
constituted a precedent that justified an examination of political
reporting.
Mr Prescott yesterday won the backing of a white-collar rail workers' union
in his attempt to become Labour's next deputy leader.
He polled 3,190 votes in a ballot of Transport Salaried Staffs' Association
political levy-paying members, against 2,652 for Mrs Margaret Beckett and
1,987 for Mr Bryan Gould.
In the poll for the party's next leader, Mr John Smith beat Mr Gould by
5,685 votes to 2,111.
Only a quarter of the union's members voted.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Waverers 'relieved by result of
election'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONFIDENTIAL opinion polling conducted for Labour after its election defeat
showed that even voters who had once planned to vote for the party expressed
'surprise and relief' at the April 9 outcome, Ivo Dawnay writes.
The findings of the surveys, held to sound out sample groups of potential
floating voters, were a key reason that Labour's national executive
committee avoided recriminations over detailed campaign tactics yesterday.
The poll results were outlined by Mr Philip Gould, the head of the
controversial Shadow Communications Agency, at the NEC meeting. They
graphically demonstrated the alarming shallowness of Labour's support among
those it thought were its supporters.
The so-called qualitative opinion surveys do not give statistical data, but
they indicate broad opinion voiced by men and women voters chosen before the
election as potential waverers.
Researchers found a new readiness to cite 'self-interest' as grounds to vote
against Labour among groups of skilled and semi-skilled workers, aged 25 to
50, in Nottingham and Slough. They were all workers who had indicated their
intention to vote Labour or Liberal Democrat.
Opinions expressed showed uncertainty about what interests the Labour party
now represents and the view that a vote for Labour was no longer a
'self-interested working class vote'.
It was stated that voting for Labour was a vote 'for less fortunate people
by more comfortable, conscientious people'.
Among other reasons for opposition to Labour were negative and off-putting
associations voiced about the party. They included perceptions of Labour as
a party tied to the past, the winter of discontent, inflation and economic
failure, heavy industry and the traditional working class.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tories under pressure on prospects
for recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN is on its way to economic recovery, Mr John Major assured the
Commons yesterday.
He refused, however, to commit himself to a precise timetable.
A sceptical Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, reminded the prime minister
that 12 months ago he said the recovery would start 'within weeks' and that
Britain would be out of recession by the end of 1991.
'Why are you being so coy now?' he demanded.
Mr Major told Mr Kinnock not to be misled by reports that Mr Norman Lamont,
the chancellor, had said that Britain was three years away from full
recovery.
What the chancellor had actually said, he insisted, was that in 'two or
three years' people would look back and see that the right decisions had
been taken at the critical time.
The prime minister described the rise in unemployment in May to 2.7m as
'very unwelcome' but stressed that the rate of increase was slowing.
He also emphasised the recent economic indicators showing that manufacturing
production had risen three months running, while the rate of increase in
average earnings had slowed to 7 per cent.
Welcoming any movement from the 'trough' caused by government policies, Mr
Kinnock taunted the prime minister over his earlier optimistic forecasts,
which had proved to be 'absurdly wrong'.
Mr Major claimed that the recovery was 'later than it might have been'
because of Mr Kinnock's 'boasting' he would be heading a Labour government
after the election.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said unemployment was rising
towards 3m, and protested: 'It is now more than two months since the
election, and only a handful of weeks before school leavers come on to the
register.'
Tories jeered when Mr Ashdown accused the government of being 'so consumed
by self-satisfaction' that it offered no policies and no hope for those
without jobs.
The prime minister retorted that Mr Ashdown's only answer was to subsidise
the inefficient, the uneconomic and the out of date.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Ulster parties move on talks agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHERN Ireland Unionists and the Irish government are expected today to
take a first tentative step towards formal discussions on relations between
the north and south of the island.
Sir Ninian Stephen, the former governor-general of Australia, is to chair a
private meeting in London that will start to draw up an agenda for 'strand
two' of a talks process that started seven weeks ago.
Other participants will include the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour
party and the British government.
'Strand two' is the point at which the Irish government enters. It would be
the first time Unionist leaders and the Irish government have met formally
to discuss Northern Ireland's future since the 1973 Sunningdale conference.
However, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, has yet to announce
a formal start to the strand - a decision that will require the careful
balancing of Unionists' and nationalists' sensitivities.
Today's meeting is part of a complex compromise allowing talks to continue
without agreement in 'strand one' - on devolution in the province. The final
strand, involving just the two governments, begins preliminary work next
week.
Officials will represent the two governments while MPs or senior party
figures, rather than leaders, will stand in for the political parties.
During a debate yesterday on renewing 'direct rule' from Westminster, Sir
Patrick said that the talks 'are following a constructive pattern'.
During the debate there were Unionist protests when the SDLP's Mr Seamus
Mallon intervened in a speech by Ulster Unionist party MP for Upper Bann Mr
David Trimble to demand what his view would be if 'anyone involved in
confidential discussions . . might meet with leaders of paramilitary
organisations to keep them informed of what is happening'.
Junior minister Mr Jeremy Hanley later denied that either he or Sir Patrick
had 'any evidence' of the matter raised by Mr Mallon.
A question mark still hangs over the extent of the support the IRA is
receiving from Libya, Mr John Major, the prime minister, indicated in the
Commons yesterday.
He confirmed that at a meeting in Geneva last week Libya had provided some
information to Britain about its relationship with the provisional IRA.
Mr Major said preliminary assessment had shown that the information was
incomplete and unsatisfactory, but it did contain some positive elements
that might well prove useful.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Growth in average earnings falls to lowest for 25 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GROWTH IN average earnings fell to its lowest level for 25 years in April
and is expected to fall further in the next few months.
The fall, to an underlying rate of 7 per cent in the year to April, had been
long awaited. In spite of falling inflation and rising unemployment, the
underlying growth of average earnings - which measures levels of earnings
rather than pay rises - has hovered stubbornly at roughly 7.5 per cent since
the middle of last year. In December it fell to 7.25 per cent, where it
stayed until April.
The actual increase in average earnings in the year to April fell even more
sharply, to 6 per cent compared with 8.8 per cent in March.
The slowdown in the rate of earnings growth was spread across all sectors of
the economy. Average earnings for manufacturing employees fell from 7.75 per
cent in March to 7.25 per cent in April. The Department of Employment said
higher overtime working compared with a year ago was holding the figure up
by about 0.5 per cent.
Earnings growth in the service industries fell from 7.25 per cent to 7 per
cent, the lowest rate for 25 years.
According to the department, the overall fall in earnings growth in April
was partly the result of lower pay settlements of a year ago feeding through
to the index.
The April figure was also affected by the early payment of bonuses in March
rather than April to avoid higher taxes under a possible Labour government.
Figures for manufacturing unit wage costs, which fell sharply between March
and April, reflected higher productivity and the slowdown in earnings
growth. In April they fell by 0.4 per cent compared with a year before, the
first negative figure for just over four years. That compares with growth of
5.7 per cent in the year to March. In the three months to April, unit wage
costs grew by 2.7 per cent compared with 4.6 per cent in the three months to
March.
Manufacturing productivity, or output per head, grew by 4.9 per cent in the
year to April, the highest rate of growth since April 1989.
In the three months to April, it grew by 4.7 per cent compared with 3.8 per
cent in the three months to March.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Potential bidder found for London Riverbus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A POTENTIAL bidder for London Riverbus, the loss-making Thames service,
emerged yesterday with plans to develop a commuter network into the capital
using a fleet of 34 vessels.
The potential bid depends on cutting Riverbus's overheads by operating
smaller, 12-seat river taxis in off-peak periods.
White Horse Ferries, a Swindon-based company, said it was discussing a
takeover of Riverbus with the administrators of Olympia &amp; York, the failed
developer of Canary Wharf.
O&amp;Y rescued Riverbus from collapse three years ago when it led a consortium
of property developers that injected Pounds 2.5m to underwrite services
between Chelsea and Greenwich.
Riverbus has been operated by managers seconded from P&amp;O, the shipping
company, which owns the service in partnership with O&amp;Y.
White Horse plans to operate 26 12-seater river taxis, which would feed
passengers to high-speed ferries operating from London to Gravesend and
Tilbury.
Work on the prototype river taxi is nearing completion at the Griffon
shipyard in Southampton. The yard will also build eight long-haul craft
expected to carry up to 120 passengers.
River trials for the so-called Thames Fast Ferries are due to start in July
with the inaugural service starting in August.
Riverbus confirmed that White Horse had made an approach, but added: 'We are
considering a number of options for the future, not least at ministerial
level.'
Both companies hope to exploit plans to relocate civil servants in Docklands
by winning government backing for Thames transport services.
White Horse says that even if it fails to win control of Riverbus it will
continue with its Pounds 6m scheme to operate new river services into
London. The company is in talks with the City of London Corporation to build
a pontoon at Blackfriars to act as a hub for journeys to other parts of the
city.
According to Mr Lay, the French government has also shown an interest in the
White Horse vessels. He says there is scope for similar services on the
Seine in Paris.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Rise in lending points to upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE second successive monthly rise in lending by banks and building
societies has provided further signals of a modest upturn.
Lending by those groups to companies and individuals rose by a seasonally
adjusted Pounds 3bn last month, after a Pounds 5.1bn increase in April, the
Bank of England said yesterday.
The message about increased demand for credit was supported by the British
Bankers' Association, which said that its nine member banks increased
lending by an adjusted Pounds 2.2bn in May, after Pounds 2.6bn in April.
Any hopes about a strong uplift were dampened by other figures for growth in
the money supply, which indicated weak overall demand for goods and
services.
The Bank's figures for so-called M4 sterling lending to the private sector
came after a net repayment of Pounds 394m in March. M4, or broad money, is
private-sector holdings of notes and coins plus bank and building society
deposits.
The figures indicate that much of the extra lending by the association's
constituent commercial banks was to financial companies, rather than
manufacturers. The association said that as most of the increase in the past
two months had been due to seasonal factors, it was 'difficult to point to
where the demand is coming from'.
Unadjusted for seasonal variations, lending to financial groups increased in
May by Pounds 583m, while manufacturers repaid Pounds 200m of debt.
Individuals borrowed Pounds 462m.
Figures for money supply growth indicated only sluggish demand. Narrow
money, or M0, which comprises mostly notes and coins in circulation, rose a
seasonally adjusted 0.1 per cent last month to give a 2.5 per cent increase
for the year. M0 growth in the year to April was 2.3 per cent.
M4 rose by 0.3 per cent last month, bringing the year-on-year growth rate to
5.2 per cent. That is the lowest year-on-year rate since the Bank started
records in 1976. In April, the year-on-year rate was 5.7 per cent.
Mr Nigel Richardson, an economist at SG Warburg Securities, said the figures
were consistent with moving slowly out of recession. 'We may be seeing a
pick-up from the bottom,' he said.
Over the past year, expansion in the money supply as well as in lending
generally has been subdued as consumers and businesses have concentrated on
paying off debts.

THE COST of abandoning the Pounds 1.7bn planned extension of London's
Jubilee underground line may be more than Pounds 200m, according to the
London Docklands Development Corporation.
Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian developers of Canary Wharf in London's
Docklands, had promised to pay Pounds 400m over 25 years towards the line.
Canary Wharf was put into administrative receivership last month, putting
the Jub-ilee Line extension in jeopardy.
The government has said that it will not go ahead with the extension unless
a purchaser can be found for Canary Wharf that would be willing to take over
O&amp;Y's commitment.
In a briefing paper submitted to the Department of Transport, the London
Docklands Development Corporation says that taxpayers and shareholders of
construction companies have already spent more than Pounds 100m in
preparatory work on the extension.
London Transport says it has spent Pounds 100m on bringing designs to the
point at which contractors can tender for work. Contractors are estimated to
have spent a further Pounds 20m on preparing bids.
The development corporation estimates that the costs of aborting the
extension may be a further Pounds 35m to Pounds 85m.
Contractors have submitted bids for almost all of the 10-mile extension.
London Transport has already identified an all-Italian consortium led by
Italstrade, the Italian engineering group, as being likely to win the
contract a 2 1/2 -mile section.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Fire in Humberston B nuclear power station
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FIRE broke out yesterday in the pressure vessel of the Hunterston B
nuclear power station in Ayrshire. Scottish Nuclear, the state-owned company
that operates the advanced gas-cooled reactor station, said the fire
involved no nuclear material and there was no hazard to personnel or the
public, James Buxton writes.
The fire broke out in a temporary rubber skirt installed at the top of one
of the boilers in the pressure vessel of the reactor, which was shut down
for maintenance. Scottish Nuclear believes the fire was caused by sparks
from cutting equipment. The fire was put out by the station's fire team.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Nuclear dump site selected by Nirex is 'compromised'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GEOLOGICAL investigations by UK Nirex, the nuclear waste consortium, into
its chosen site for Britain's first underground repository for radioactive
waste suggest that it may have difficulty in arguing that it would be safe,
a report by independent consultants published yesterday says.
According to the report, by consultants Environmental Resources, information
from the first four test boreholes shows that water in the rock that would
surround the repository travels upwards into sandstone used as a source of
drinking water.
ERL says the borehole results show that the proposed repository site, near
the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant in West Cumbria, is in a mixing
zone where groundwater travelling in deep basement rock towards the sea
meets incoming saline water.
It says results suggest that the denser saline water forces the groundwater
upwards through the basement rock around the repository at a rate of about
4,000 cu metres a year, towards the aquifer sandstone above.
ERL says Nirex's preferred site near the Sellafield plant is, however, the
only possible local location, because it alone offers suitable basement rock
at the right depth.
Against that, it adds, the proximity of the Lake District hills, where the
basement rock outcrops and absorbs rainwater, compromises one of Nirex's
main site selection criteria: slow rates of water movement in regions of low
hydraulic gradients. That may affect the time it would take groundwater to
return to the human environment.
Nirex selected the Sellafield area for the Pounds 2.5bn, 800-metre deep
repository for low and intermediate-level waste after a 10-year search
throughout the UK.
ERL's report is one of a series about the repository commissioned by Cumbria
County Council, which has not yet determined its stance. The leaders of the
three political groups on the council said in a joint statement: 'Unless the
hydrogeology turns out to be better than demonstrated, so far we cannot see
how a depository, as currently proposed, could go ahead.'
Nirex, which this month announced a delay until next autumn in submitting
its repository planning application, said yesterday: 'We don't disagree with
the broad thrust of the report.'
It said, however, that ERL's assertion that groundwater was rising after
meeting the saline water was based on pressure measurements and had not been
confirmed.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Rembrandt print makes Pounds 159,500: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PRINT by Rembrandt, 'Christ Crucified between Two Thieves', sold for
Pounds 159,500 at Christie's yesterday, at the bottom of its estimate.
Executed in dryprint in 1653, the print is extremely rare: Rembrandt altered
the com-position dramatically in 1660.
It was the top price in an auction of Old Master prints collected in the
late 19th century by an aristocratic German family and only now being
dispersed. The first group to be sold brought in more than Pounds 2m last
December.
All told, there were 77 Rembrandt prints on offer. His 'Woman in the Bath
with a Hat Beside Her' of 1658 sold for Pounds 121,000, almost double its
estimate, and an etching of a shell, the only example of a Rembrandt still
life, went for Pounds 66,000.
The main disappointment was the failure of Durer's 'Knight, Death and the
Devil', engraved in 1513, to find a buyer.
A jeroboam - equal to six bottles - of Chateau Latour 1864 from the cellars
of Hatfield House, the home of the Marquess of Salisbury, sold for Pounds
6,534 at Christie's yesterday to a German collector.
A surviving jeroboam from this vintage is certainly unique - the bottle is
wrapped in brown paper to keep out the light and delay oxidisation.
A dozen bottles of the 1961 Latour were within forecast at Pounds 4,235,
while one bottle of the Chateau Lafite 1844 made Pounds 2,178. It was the
property of the late Caria Kaspia, the caviar king, the contents of whose
wine cellar totalled more than Pounds 68,000.
A bottle of Grande Fine Champagne cognac of 1818, bearing the legend
Restauration on the label and obviously produced to celebrate the return of
the French monarchy, sold for Pounds 602 at Sotheby's on Wednesday.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Call for better interim accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STOCK Exchange should demand that companies' interim accounts are more
extensive and should be reviewed by their auditors, the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales said yesterday.
The consultative document issued by the institute's auditing committee
called for interims, which are issued halfway between financial year-ends,
to contain balance sheets and cashflow information, as well details of the
profit-and-loss account.
The document said the Stock Exchange should require listed companies to
provide additional information and be subject to audit, while the Accounting
Standards Board and the Auditing Practices Board should issue appropriate
technical guidance.
The recommendations echo suggestions for an auditor's review of interims in
the Cadbury committee on the financial aspects of corporate governance,
which reported last month.
It also follows a similar proposal by the institute in February for
preliminary statements - which are often issued to the market several weeks
before the annual report - to be reviewed by a company's auditors.
The committee argues that companies' share prices tend to respond far more
to interim and preliminary announcements - which provide little and
unaudited information - than to the audited accounts.
Mr Graham Ward, a partner at Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, who is
vice-chairman of the committee, said: 'Half-yearly reports are a major
influence on the market, but there are no accounting rules or audit
requirements to ensure that the market is given reliable information.'
Audit procedures on a half-yearly report should include evaluating a
company's internal controls, ensuring that accounting records are up to
date, and examining the minutes of board and management committee meetings.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Jobless numbers up fastest in south-east
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNEMPLOYMENT increased in all parts of the UK in May but rose fastest in
London and the south-east.
Since May last year, the number of unemployed people in that region has
risen by 2.4 per cent, with one in 10 now out of work. According to the
Unemployment Unit, the research group, the number of jobless in the region
is the highest since the Second World War.
Other regions where un-employment rose faster than average included the east
Midlands, the west Midlands and the south-west. The lowest rate of increase
was in Scotland, where unemployment was only 0.6 per cent higher than a year
ago.
The unemployment rate for men was 12.9 per cent, significantly higher than
the rate for women, which was 5.2 per cent in May.
The stock of unfilled vacancies at Jobcentres fell by 5,000 last month. That
puts the average decrease in vacancies over the three months to May at
3,200.
The Department of Employment believes that with last month's increase of
21,300 in the total numbers of jobless, the monthly trend is now running
between 25,000 and 30,000 with no sign of any let-up over the next few
months.
According to measures used by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development, the UK unemployment rate is 10.4 per cent, above both the OECD
average of 7.2 per cent and the EC average of 9.4 per cent.
In the EC, only Ireland and Spain have higher unemployment rates than the
UK, according to the OECD standardised rates.

FT  19 JUN 92 / PM reviews progress on charters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   EXTENSION of market-testing
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
a step towards contracting out services - and performance-related pay will
be at the centre of the renewed impetus given to the Citizen's Charter
initiative at a seminar this morning chaired by Mr John Major.
Cabinet ministers and permanent secretaries have been summoned to the
three-hour session at Downing Street to report progress on introducing
charter proposals in their areas of responsibility.
The outcome is expected to include the promise of further charters shortly,
including one for London Underground passengers. Mr John MacGregor,
transport secretary, will also bring forward plans for a 'motorist's
charter' for better information about roadworks and delays.
Mr John Patten, education secretary, is expected to announce further
progress. A parent's charter has been published, but the Tory manifesto
included a pledge to increase information published about all schools in
each area.
Mr William Waldegrave, minister for public service and science, plans to
make a statement later this year on how far departments have come in
introducing market-testing. The move comes with the announcement that Mr
Waldegrave's responsibilities are to be extended to the Stationery Office,
which publishes government documents, and the Central Office of Information.
The Lord Chancellor's Department is expected to come under pressure to
explain its failure to produce a final draft of the Courts Charter.
The department, which is responsible for drawing up a charter to guarantee
standards of service for court users in England and Wales, is one of only
two government departments that has yet to publish charter material.
The delay in publication of a final draft is believed to be largely due to
difficulties in setting meaningful standards for court proceedings which
will meet the conflicting interests of all court users.
Contrary to recent speculation, the Courts Charter for England and Wales
will not be based on the Scottish justice charter, which covers standards of
service in the police and the prison service as well as the Scottish courts.
The English charter will cover four main areas: improvements in court
procedures, building on initiatives resulting from the review of civil
justice; improvements in facilities in court buildings, adding to the
standards already set for the court building programme; customer care; and
business standards, which will set out how court proceedings should run.
The charter is expected to be ready for publication by August but is not
expected to be published until after the summer parliamentary recess.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Advertising manager contests dismissal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A FORMER newspaper advertising manager told an industrial tribunal in London
yesterday she was forced out of a job by her manager's attitude to working
mothers.
Ms Suzanne Bennett, a Pounds 25,000-a-year advertising manager with Express
Newspapers until last year, is claiming sexual discrimination and unfair
dismissal and seeking compensation for lost earnings.
She said that while on maternity leave she heard that Mr Michael Moore sales
director, planned to make her life 'difficult' so she would resign.
She returned to work in January last year after giving birth to a son. She
said that in August Mr Moore told her he was surprised she had not had a
nervous breakdown 'juggling' her responsibilities.
She told the hearing he offered her five months' salary and her company car
if she left the company.
Ms Bennett, who denied that she had had any difficulty coping with
motherhood, said Mr Moore upset her by pushing her to make a decision she
did not want to make.
She accepted his offer, but a few days later Mr Moore called her into his
office and told her she had been sacked and should clear her desk that day.
Ms Bennett said that instead of the earlier package she had been offered she
was told she would receive only the statutory three months' salary.
Mr Moore denied sacking Ms Bennett and said her evidence that he would not
permit her to put her point of view by discussing the possibility of her
leaving was a 'figment of her imagination'.
The hearing was adjourned to a date to be fixed.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Lloyd's may fund extra aid for Names
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S of London is in discussions with agents and brokers at the insurance
market to fund extra hardship relief for Names suffering in recent losses,
Mr Alan Lord, chief executive of Lloyd's, announced yesterday.
A fully fledged bail-out scheme that would cap past losses has been rejected
as 'unviable', Mr Lord added.
Under the hardship arrangements, negotiated individually, Names - the
individuals whose assets back underwriting at the market - are allowed to
retain a home and a modest income. In return, Lloyd's restructures their
debts. 'We do not reduce them to penury', Mr Lord said.
Mrs Mary Archer, who chairs Lloyd's hardship committee, said the market's
governing council had reached agreement with 39 Names, while a total of 95
offers had been made. A total of 1,185 Names had applied to the committee.
'Contrary to popular opinion, Lloyd's has never bankrupted, nor will it
bankrupt Names who wish to meet their underwriting obligations,' said
Lloyd's.
Referring to the bail-out schemes, Mr Lord said the council had considered
three types of plan over the past two months covering: losses for 1989
alone; net losses for the 1986-89 period; and a loan scheme to help Names
facing liquidity difficulties. All were rejected on a variety of legal,
practical and commercial grounds, Mr Lord added.
A plan to limit Names' losses from next year has been introduced, its terms
improved from those proposed in January.

The scheme, promised in the Conservative election manifesto, allows rental
payments of up to Pounds 3,250 a year to be free of tax.
Up to Pounds 62.50 a week of gross rent paid on furnished lettings in the
taxpayer's only or main home will be tax-free. If the gross income exceeds
Pounds 3,250, the taxpayer can choose to pay tax on the excess (with no
allowance for expenses) or to pay tax on the whole profit after deduction of
expenses. The tax relief comes into effect this financial year.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Sunday trading row looms for MPs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT ministers are bracing themselves for fresh controversy over
Sunday trading as the issue is expected to return to the Commons within the
next year, Alison Smith and Ivor Owen write.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, told MPs yesterday that there was a
'real possibility' that the judgment by the European Court of Justice on
whether existing UK law was in conflict with that of the European Community
would result in the Commons having to decide the matter. The European court
ruling is expected early next year.
In that event, he said, the government would have to 'face up to all the
arguments'.
In spite of pressure from some Tory MPs, Mr Clarke refused to be drawn on
whether the government would introduce a measure or how it would handle any
legislation.
One option being considered is organising a debate that would enable MPs to
express a view on how present restrictions should be revised, and then
incorporating in legislation the approach that had the widest support.
While the original question would probably be the subject of a free vote -
so that MPs could make their decision without intervention from party whips
 -that decision might then be adopted as government policy and be enforced
by a three-line whip.
Ministers remain acutely conscious of the sensitivities of revising the
Sunday trading laws. Mr Clarke recalled yesterday that the move to full
deregulation introduced by the Thatcher government was rejected on second
reading by the Commons after it had been approved by the Lords.
The government hopes to spell out its course of action before MPs debate the
'Keep Sunday Special' trading bill proposed by Mr Ray Powell, a Labour MP
sponsored by Usdaw, the shopworkers' union. However, the earliest decision
from the European court is likely to be in February or March next year -
about the same time as Mr Powell's bill is due to be debated.
Mr Clarke said that he appreciated that the controversy cut across party
lines. He underlined the complexity of solutions based on provision being
made for the sale of certain types of goods, or of trade being restricted to
specified times.
'We want a law under which all retailers can compete on level terms,' he
stressed.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Big towns will be forced to privatise buses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PUBLIC-SECTOR bus companies in all Britain's largest towns and cities are to
be privatised under plans being prepared by the Department of Transport.
They include state-owned London Buses; the municipally owned bus companies
in the metropolitan areas of Greater Manchester, Merseyside, South Yorkshire
and Strathclyde; and bus companies in cities including Nottingham, Cardiff,
Southampton, and Hull.
Privatisation of the 35 companies will represent the biggest shake-up of
Britain's bus industry since privatisation of the National Bus Company's 56
component companies between 1986 and 1988. That coincided with deregulation
of the bus industry outside London and paved the way for outbreaks of fierce
competition in some parts of the country, followed by a series of mergers
and takeovers.
The latest plans will be outlined tomorrow by Mr Roger Freeman, minister for
public transport, at a private seminar arranged by Capital Strategies, a
London-based consultancy specialising in employee buy-outs.
Mr Freeman is expected to announce that the government intends to legislate
for compulsory privatisation of London Buses and all 34 municipal bus
companies as soon as possible.
The powers will be sought in the same bill as the one planned for the
deregulation of London bus services, for which parliamentary time has not
yet been found.
The government believes most local authorities can be persuaded to privatise
their companies voluntarily. Councils will be told that if they negotiate
deals in advance of legislation, they may be allowed to sell companies to
management-employee buy-out teams without the need for competitive
tendering.
Many local authorities, particularly Labour-led ones, are reluctant to part
with their bus companies. Faced with a choice between a voluntary sale to
the company's employees now or a compulsory sale after legislation, however,
many may choose the former.
Although it is already open to all local authorities to privatise their bus
companies, only nine have chosen to do so. The largest and most recent
example was West Midlands Travel, the former West Midlands Passenger
Transport Executive.
Mr Brian Souter, chief executive of Stagecoach, an acquisitive private bus
company, said he welcomed any move to bring more bus companies into the
private sector. 'But I would be very disappointed if there was not open
market bidding,'he said.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Revenue to use private agency staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIVATE employment agency staff will next month take over some of the most
confidential and politically sensitive work in the Civil Service as the
contracting out of central government services gets under way.
Personal secretaries, typists and other support staff at the Inland
Revenue's new head office building in Nottingham will be supplied under
contract by Blue Arrow Personnel Services.
Manpower Employment Services will provide word processing, secretarial and
support services at the Department of Health's Leeds headquarters.
The work contracted out in both cases involves handling confidential
correspondence and sensitive policy papers. The Leeds office is the
headquarters of the National Health Service management executive, dogged in
recent years by leaks about troubles in the government's health reforms.
In the Inland Revenue's Nottingham office the agency will supply personal
secretaries for senior civil servants involved in policy and management in
the capital taxes office and the superannuation funds office. With complete
access to their bosses' files, they will be required to sign the Official
Secrets Act and observe the same standards of confidentiality as civil
servants.
The contracting-out of jobs at the centre of the government machine is part
of a drive to put much of the Civil Service work out to competitive tender.
A white paper published last November suggested that 'market testing' could
save as much as 25 per cent of the Pounds 20bn central-government costs
annually.
The Blue Arrow bid is believed to have undercut that of the Inland Revenue's
own typists by as much as 25 per cent. The agency has guaranteed to provide
secretarial services between 9am and 6pm and to meet high accuracy and
turnaround targets.
In the health department, contracting out the secretarial work is expected
to save 10 per cent of staff costs. Manpower has offered a flexible approach
to staffing levels, removing staff from the site if the workload falls.
All government departments are drawing up, with the help of management
consultants, lists of activities to put out to tender. The Civil Service
unions have protested at the lack of support for the civil servants bidding
to retain work.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Head of Guinness family dies at 55
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD Iveagh, head of the Guinness brewing family, died in London yesterday
aged 55 after a short illness.
His death came three weeks after he left the Guinness board - leaving it for
the first time without a descendant of Mr Arthur Guinness, who founded the
Dublin stout brewery in 1759.
He was chairman of the company from 1962 until 1986 when he was succeeded by
Mr Ernest Saunders, later jailed for his part in the takeover of the
Distillers drinks group. Lord Iveagh then became company president until
last month, when he decided not to seek re-election to his position or to
the board.
Last night night Sir Anthony Tennant, Guinness chairman, said: 'I am very
sad to have lost a valued friend and colleague, who gave Guinness tremendous
service over very many years.'
Lord Iveagh, known to his friends as Ben, had joined the board in 1958 as
Viscount Elveden.
The following year he became assistant managing director in charge of the
Park Royal brewery in London. From 1960 his responsibility - still as
assistant managing director - included Dublin as well as London.
He succeeded to the Iveagh title, created in 1919, when his grandfather, the
second earl, died in 1967. His father, then Viscount Elveden, was killed in
action in 1945.
The earldom passes to his elder son Viscount Elveden, 22. He leaves another
son, Rory, 17, and two daughters, Lady Emma, 18, and Lady Louisa, 15.

JAPANESE companies in Wales are increasingly undertaking research and
development work in the principality and increasing the 'local' - European
Community - content of their products.
Those are the principal findings of an investigation of the economic and
social consequences of Japanese investment in Wales.
Three academics at Cardiff Business School - Mr Jonathan Morris, Mr Max
Munday and Professor Barry Wilkinson - found that nine out of 23
manufacturing companies surveyed had undertaken 'limited design work' with
one consumer electronics manufacturer 'intending to transfer major
development work from Japan in the next two years'.
The nature of the R&amp;D varied from the basic - using only three employees -
to companies such as Sony, Calsonic and Hitachi, with 'major design
departments employing upwards of 50 people'.
Four years ago a report by Mr Morris led to angry recriminations over his
finding that Japanese investment had largely led to the creation of assembly
work, for a mainly female workforce, having a limited effect on the rest of
the Welsh economy.
The new report shows job creation among men has increased materially - 47
per cent of the workforce in the plants that provided figures.
Of the 42 Japanese companies operating in Wales, 29 are in manufacturing,
with a heavy concentration in consumer electronics. The rest cover interests
such as golf-course ownership, property development, musical instruments and
distribution.
Takiron, the first company to come to Wales, arrived in 1972 to make PVC
corrugated sheeting. The largest, Sony, now employs about 2,500 people -
more than that traditional Welsh industry, coal. Other big names include
Hitachi, Matsushita, Brother Industries and Sharp.
The survey says local content of the manufacturing companies' products was
more than 50 per cent in over half the manufacturers surveyed, with a
'common range' of 60 per cent to 80 per cent in the large producers of
consumer electronics. The highest level of local content was in chemicals
and plastics, where three of the companies bought more than 95 per cent in
the EC. The survey adds: 'The majority of companies were actively seeking to
increase local content levels over the next five years.'
Slightly more than 200 of the 13,400 employed by the Japanese in Wales are
Japanese nationals. One company, Sekisui - which opened in Merthyr Tydfil in
1978 - had a completely non-Japanese workforce.
Social life for the Japanese can be difficult. The men tend to bury
themselves in their work. Some managers said they worked the same long hours
as they had done in Japan. 'Typically I work 8am to 10.30pm. I worked 3,300
hours in 1991,' one manager told the researchers.
Many of the Japanese wives speak little or no English and isolation is
accentuated for some when companies spread employees around the community
'as part of a policy to aid integration'.

A Russian Sukhoi Su 27 fighter, which Nato has codenamed Flanker, was put
through its paces above London's Thames Barrier yesterday, Daniel Green
writes.
It is one of the most advanced fighters built in the former Soviet Union.
The aircraft is equipped to carry up to 10 air-to-air guided missiles and is
also designed as an escort for long-range bombers. The potency of the
Flanker prompted European countries to embark on the troubled European
Fighter Aircraft project. Sponsored by a Russian insurance company, this
particular Flanker is visiting Britain for the Biggin Hill air show, where
it is part of a newly established Russian aerobatics team called The Test
Pilots.

<TEXT>
AN emergency urban aid package looks set to come to fruition in the US,
seven weeks after the Los Angeles riots sparked a new political interest in
helping the distressed inner cities, reports George Graham in Washington.
The House of Representatives passed the Dollars 1bn urban aid bill
yesterday, after a hard-won compromise between Democratic Congressional
leaders and the Republican White House. A Senate vote was expected later
yesterday.
The final package roughly splits the difference between an
administration-backed proposal to provide Dollars 500m of disaster aid - to
cover the damage caused by the Los Angeles riots as well as the Chicago
floods in April - and a more ambitious plan offered by the Senate.
The latter's proposals, backed by Democrats but also by some Republicans,
would have added Dollars 1.4bn more for summer job creation, youth and
crime-fighting programmes.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Perot factor unnerves the Mexican market: US commitment to
Nafta dents expectations of an imminent economic miracle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROSS Perot as US president may still be unlikely, but the prospect of a
close US presidential race this autumn is causing increasing anxiety among
Mexican officials and, more significantly, investors in the country's
volatile stockmarket.
The Mexican stock market fell 12 per cent in the first three days of the
week, partly recovering by yesterday. The plunge was in part because of Mr
Perot's (admittedly inconsistent) declarations against the proposed North
American free trade agreement. The fear is not just that he might win, but
that his popularity might force Bill Clinton, the Democratic candidate, and
wavering congressmen to be much more circumspect in their support for the
agreement.
Although Mexico's economy is in its best shape for at least 20 years, the
country remains acutely dependent on events in the US. Some 70 per cent of
Mexico's trade is with its northern neighbour, and if US growth were to
remain sluggish, Mexico's exports would suffer. More important, Mexico is
likely to run a current account deficit of more than Dollars 16bn this year,
and depends on mainly US capital inflows to plug the gap.
If the political uncertainty engendered by the Perot candidacy affects the
US economy, Mexico thus suffers too. Add to that the fear that Nafta will
not be passed, and the recent gloom in Mexico becomes understandable.
Nafta matters, says one investment banker visiting Mexico, because it will
encourage fund managers to treat Mexico as part of North, rather than Latin,
America. Mexican risk will fall appreciably, and Mexican companies will thus
be valued more like US than say Brazilian ones. For a country which
culturally and politically is much closer to most Latin American nations
than the US, that is quite a feat.
Mr Jorge Mariscal, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, put the case for the
agreement succinctly: 'For investors considering Mexico, it (Nafta) means an
historical shift in Mexican attitudes towards its northern partners and
therefore a drastic reduction in the perception of risk. Under Nafta, Mexico
would find it very difficult to revert to the protectionist, interventionist
economic models (of) the 70s and 80s'. If the agreement is in doubt, the
reverse logic can be applied.
The Mexican government is probably kicking itself for not starting the free
trade talks (in earnest) until September last year. Like almost everyone
else, they overestimated the popularity of US President George Bush, and
believed that his commitment to a free trade agreement was enough. Now they
will have to sit through the next six months, quietly cheering on George
Bush, while making discreet overtures to Bill Clinton.
The government has argued that the underlying economy is in good shape.
Mexico's total debt to GDP ratio is 29 per cent, against 74 per cent when
President Carlos Salinas came to power, suggesting that Mexico has put the
debt crisis behind it. Inflation is falling and is likely to be around 12
per cent this year, while the budget is in surplus. With or without Nafta,
the foundations for stable economic growth appear to have been built.
The trouble is that Nafta has raised expectations of an imminent 'Mexican
miracle'. This year alone Mexican companies have issued an estimated Dollars
4bn in equity, in an attempt to raise capital in anticipation of integration
with the US. Banacci, the financial group comprising Mexico's largest bank,
was planning to issue Dollars 1.5bn of new equity next week, although the
recent falls in the stock market mean it may have to offer fewer shares, at
a discount. Many banks and companies in line to issue stock after Banacci
may now postpone.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Federal Communications Commission yesterday announced that it would
allow the three traditional US television networks - NBC, CBS and ABC - to
own cable TV systems, subject to conditions. This ends a 22-year ban.
The agency prohibited cross-ownership of cable and broadcast networks in
1970, when the networks dominated home viewing and the FCC feared they would
trample on the fledgling cable industry.
Since then, however, the networks have suffered a sharp decline in their
share of the national audience as viewers have switched to cable.
The FCC first raised the possibility of relaxing the ban in 1982, but met
strong political opposition. It revived the idea last December.
The new ruling includes safeguards to allay the fears of local broadcasting
stations, not owned by the networks, which fear financially ruinous
competition. The networks would not be permitted to own cable systems
serving more than 10 per cent of homes nationally and 50 per cent of homes
in a local market served by only one cable company.

OFFICIAL figures showing a sharp rise in the US merchandise trade deficit in

subdued elsewhere, reports Michael Prowse in Washington.
The deficit jumped from Dollars 5.4bn in March to Dollars 7bn, the greatest

The unexpected deterioration reflected the combined impact of a jump in

NEW ZEALAND is to target the British Isles this year in a pilot programme to
attract 'quality' migrants.
The emphasis recently has moved from promoting migration to New Zealand in
Britain towards attracting immigrants from round the world. This has led to
substantial numbers of Asians gaining citizenship.
While there is no change in what is, in effect, a global quota of 25,000 a
year, the new scheme is expected to see 4,000 British migrants this year
compared with 3,000 last year.
Cumbersome rules - such as intending migrants must first have job, and no
New Zealand resident should be able to do it - have been relaxed.

PALESTINIAN delegates to the Middle East peace talks last night held their
first public meeting with Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine
Liberation Organisation, in a pointed challenge to Israel a few days before
next week's election in the Jewish state.
The carefully staged encounter in Amman was accompanied by an appeal by Mr
Yasser Abed-Rabbo, a senior PLO executive committee member, for Israelis to
'vote for peace' in next Tuesday's poll. He said there would be little
optimism if Mr Yitzhak Shamir's ruling Likud party won again.
Such interventions by the Palestinians tend to rebound in favour of Likud
and its right-wing allies. Although Mr Abed-Rabbo did not mention the
opposition Labour party by name, the right wing is bound to use his words to
portray Labour, which supports a more conciliatory stance in the peace talks
than Likud, as being supported by the PLO.
But this did not deter the PLO going ahead with last night's event at which
Mr Faisal Husseini, the leader of the Palestinian negotiating team, Mrs
Hanan Ashrawi, the spokeswoman, and Dr Haidar Abdel-Shafi, chief negotiator,
met and embraced Mr Arafat in front of the press.
Israeli jets raided alleged Hizbollah bases in south Lebanon yesterday, the
14th air raid in a month.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Massacre arouses fury in S Africa
</HEADLINE>

   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ALREADY tense relations between the South African government and the
African National Congress (ANC) were pushed close to breaking point
yesterday following the massacre on Wednesday night of at least 39 people in
the Boipatong township south of Johannesburg.
The incident follows the start earlier this week of an ANC mass action
campaign, aimed at breaking the deadlock in constitutional negotiations. The
government had fiercely criticised the campaign, warning it would aggravate
violence in the townships.
President F W de Klerk yesterday condemned the 'mindless killing' in the
township massacre and vowed 'we will not rest' until the killers were
brought to justice. He appealed for calm and urged 'all leaders to ensure
discipline and restraint among their followers'.
The massacre will complicate prospects for reaching agreement at the
Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa), the constitutional
negotiating forum, where relationships between the government and the ANC
have deteriorated sharply in the past few weeks.
Following a trip around the township, near Vanderbijlpark, Mr Cyril
Ramaphosa, ANC secretary-general, said: 'This type of violence could lead to
negotiations being derailed. The negotiations process is going through a
stage where it is being jeopardised by the government.'
He added: 'The collective charge sheet against the apartheid government is
being drawn up and President de Klerk is accused number one.'
Most witnesses of the attack - which according to some reports left possibly
as many as 50 dead - said it was conducted by residents of the nearby
Kwamadala hostel. There were also suggestions of police involvement.
The hostel, which houses residents for the nearby Iscor steelworks, is known
to be a stronghold of the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party. Inkatha denied
any link to the massacre and challenged the ANC to provide concrete evidence
of the involvement of hostel dwellers.
The failure of the government to curb violence has long been a main point of
contention between it and the ANC, which has repeatedly accused the police
of complicity in or indifference to acts of violence against black people.
Captain Craig Kotze, a police spokesman, said yesterday: 'It is now quite
obvious that the political temperature has been pushed unacceptably high (by
mass action) and has created a climate which can make incidents such as
these that much easier to happen.'

clause

<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EC MINISTERS have watered down a third-country retaliation clause in new
public procurement legislation which could have aggravated trade friction
with the US, Andrew Hill reports from Luxembourg. Internal market ministers
yesterday agreed a directive which will force utilities to put big service
contracts, ranging from maintenance and cleaning to accountancy and
insurance, to open tender.
The directive is the last in a series designed to liberalise EC public
procurement from the beginning of next year. The US is threatening trade
sanctions over an earlier directive on utility equipment contracts. That
includes a clause allowing utilities to favour EC bids over those from third
countries which have failed to open their own markets to competition.
The US says this so-called 'reciprocity' clause discriminates against non-EC
suppliers, particularly in the telecoms sector, and should be changed before
it comes into force on January 1, 1993.
EC ministers have agreed a more relaxed regime for the services directive.
This will let the Commission investigate alleged discrimination against EC
companies by third countries. Any retaliatory measures will have to be
approved by member states. The new measure will apply to energy, water,
telecommunications and transport companies, publicly or privately owned.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Italy's Mr Clean steps into the breach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW KIND of prime minister took on the challenge of governing Italy
yesterday and immediately set himself the task of steering the ship of state
away from the rocks.
The appointment of technocrat Professor Giuliano Amato marks a decisive
break with the past, having won the job for his ability and moral qualities
rather than in a backroom party deal.
He emerged from long talks with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro and pledged
action to improve public finances, clean up government and introduce
institutional reforms.
The 54-year-old constitutional law professor and former Socialist finance
minister said talks on forming a government could take time.
He expected to rely on the narrow parliamentary majority of Christian
Democrats, Socialists, Social Democrats and Liberals which formed the
previous government. However, it was clear he anticipated broader cross
party support.
Prof Amato's appointment represents a break with the established practices
of party-controlled politics.
He has been chosen not in a back-room deal but from necessity: as a man
capable of obtaining a broad cross-party consensus with high moral standing
and genuine grasp of institutional reform and economic policy. Similar
considerations led to the surprise election of Mr Scalfaro as president.
He is the first post-war prime minister to be chosen more for his technical
than political abilities. An academic who gradually shifted into politics,
he only became a deputy for his native Turin in 1983, and most of his
political experience has been as adviser and right hand man to Mr Bettino
Craxi, the Socialist leader and prime minister from 1983 to 1987.
It is an equally important departure for an Italian leader to be chosen for
his moral qualities. Amid growing outrage over the Milan municipal
corruption scandal involving rigged contracts and pay-offs to political
parties, Prof Amato represents a 'Mr Clean'. He is currently investigating
his Socialist party's corrupt activities in Milan.
This said, the process of his selection was tortuous. The new Italian
president has exploited the weakness of the main parties after the election
and demanded quick agreement on their candidates for the premiership. Faced
with deadlock this week, President Scalfaro took the initiative.
He said the outgoing four-party coalition lacked legitimacy after the April
elections and needed a broader base. Ideally this meant the backing of the
former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), the second largest
parliamentary grouping.
Mr Craxi objected, and insisted on his own candidature until President
Scalfaro made him realise on Wednesday that this was unrealistic. Mr Craxi
has been too heavily compromised by the Milan scandal.
In proposing Prof Amato as his substitute, Mr Craxi has salvaged some
honour: the Socialists have their deputy leader in the prime minister's
office, the Christian Democrats have the presidency and the PDS has the
speaker of the Chamber of deputies. The Christian Democrats have avoided the
embarrassment of having to chose a candidate when they cannot agree a
successor to Mr Arnaldo Forlani, who resigned after the party's poor
election showing.
The PDS and Republicans are happy to see Mr Craxi, a long-time enemy,
humiliated. His absence from government makes their support more
forthcoming. As for the populist Lombard League, the second largest party in
northern Italy, Prof Amato is a suitably neutral figure.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Moderate turnout in Irish referendum on Maastricht treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Clement weather and a religious holiday in Ireland yesterday helped produce
a moderate turnout in the country's referendum on the Maastricht treaty on
European union, writes Tim Coone. The result is expected about midday today.
An estimated 50-55 per cent of the 2.5m eligible voters went to the polls.
The turnout was well short of the record 71 per cent in 1972, when Ireland
voted to join the EC. But it was greater than the 44 per cent turnout in the
last referendum in 1987, which was called to ratify the Single European Act
and which was passed by a 70:30 margin.
A high turnout was thought likely to produce a 'yes' vote to ratify the
treaty. Party workers reported a late strong turnout by farmers, who are
generally in favour of Maastricht. Polling in urban working class areas was
reported to be lower than average, as was interest among young voters. There
is no tradition of exit polls at polling stations in Ireland to provide a
guide to the outcome.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Irish mist descends over Maastricht: The pro-treaty campaign
created some suspicion and irritation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF Ireland's voters turn out to have endorsed the Maastricht treaty in
yesterday's referendum, it will have been without enthusiasm. It would also
have been largely in spite of a pro-treaty campaign by the country's
political establishment which created suspicion and deep irritation.
Many people are plainly angry at being patronised by what they see as a
'we-know-best' elite which has done well out of Europe and hopes to do even
better. Until shocked out of its complacency by Danish voters' rejection of
Maastricht, the coalition led by Mr Albert Reynolds had not deigned to
explain or promote the treaty.
The government hijacked the airwaves, keeping its opponents off television,
annoying both the Yes and No camps in its obviously rattled attempts to ram
through ratification.
The country's leading paper, The Irish Times, in a strongly argued leader on
Tuesday in favour of a Yes vote, was lapidary in its judgment of the
government's campaign.
The government almost certainly erred tactically by overemphasising the
expected cash bonanza of IPounds 6bn (Pounds 5.5bn) from the EC's boosted
'cohesion' and regional aid effort for poorer member states - money which is
in question because of resistance by net contributors to the EC budget to
pay it.
The referendum result, in consequence, yesterday looked as though it would
be very close. A straw poll by the FT of a hundred or so people in a
cross-section of Dublin and in County Wicklow showed a 51-49 margin against
the treaty, with a further 18 voters claiming still to be undecided.
There were doubts about whether the fabled cohesion money would arrive, and
if so, whether this meant jobs. There was concern on both sides of the
abortion debate, and about the extent to which Maastricht's aspiration to a
future common defence dimension for Europe compromised Irish neutrality.
'I think they're keeping us in the dark about neutrality,' said Fiona
Murphy, a waitress. And despite Mr Reynolds' pledge of a new referendum in
1996 if the EC assumes joint defence commitments then, she was voting no.
Ireland has done well out of the EC. At one level, it gets IPounds 6 back
for each pound it puts into the Community budget. But more fundamentally, it
has nearly doubled its tradeable goods sector (from 31 to 51 per cent of
GDP) since entry. Europe has opened up markets and allowed this small,
peripheral nation to dilute dependence on the UK for the first time in its
modern history.
But neither Mr Reynolds' party, Fianna Fail, nor the three other main
parties supporting the treaty, have been able to activate their powerful
machines and appear to have little accurate information on door-step
thinking.
'Nobody except the civil service elite is interested in or in favour of
Maastricht,' admits one senior Irish Eurocrat, explaining the parties'
failure to canvass. Yet this probably sells ordinary Irish voters short.
Their ire is not primarily caused by Maastricht, nor do they appear
Euro-sceptical. Mr Christy Byrne, a small dairy farmer in the Wicklow
mountains south of Dublin, was voting yes while complaining 'there's nothing
in this for small farmers.'
Yet he felt that Ireland couldn't afford to be without Europe and that if
the government were 'more honest' the Yes vote would sweep it.
Anger is variously directed at politicians perceived as shifty, and the
crozier power of the the church. Under the previous government, these two
estates combined to toss the red herring of abortion into the treaty, as a
protocol guaranteeing that no EC law would interfere with Ireland's
constitutional ban on abortion.
The government subsequently tried to disentangle the two issues, by agreeing
to a separate and later referendum on the rights to information on abortion,
and to travel for pregnancy termination. What began as a cynical attempt to
get the church on side has ended by ranging anti-abortionists and pro-choice
groups against the treaty, leaving very little middle ground for Irish
women, whose vote could decide Maastricht's future.
Mrs Helen Kelly, a heavily pregnant resident of Glendalough in Wicklow, was
undecided on Maastricht. She was cynical about the government, and hostile
to the anti-abortion campaign, as 'just a way of trying to package the no
vote to throw it (the treaty) over.'
Her husband, Tom, a small road haulier struggling through the economic
downturn, was voting yes. 'I'd say go with Europe, what choice have we?'
In affluent Dublin areas like Donnybrook, Maastricht is not in doubt, yet in
mixed class areas of north Dublin like Drumcondra the vote yesterday was
nearly 2-1 against the treaty.
The gulf was equally visible in Bray, 12 miles south in Wicklow, now easily
accessible thanks to a new by-pass part-financed by the EC regional fund.
Yet in one hostelry where local working men had gathered to watch the
football televised on Wednesday night, Maastricht could not muster a single
indigenous vote.
'No, no and no,' said Liam, 'That stuff's for yuppies. There's nothing in it
for Joe Soaps and the workers like me.'
Irish and EC leaders have tended to take such people for granted. The future
of the Maastricht treaty hung on there being just enough voters to outweigh
them, even if many were saying yes out of fear of isolation from Europe
rather than enthusiasm for a cause no one has bothered to kindle.

<TEXT>
EAST Germany's state farms - a quarter of the former communist country's
agricultural land - are to be leased to farmers for 12 years and then sold
to east Germans and westerners, including the former nobility whose large
estates were confiscated after 1945, the Treuhand privatisation agency said
yesterday.
The agency said it was setting up a company to supervise the leasing of 1m
hectares of farmland and 400,000 hectares of managed forests. Previously
only one-year leases were granted, which made planning difficult for
tenants. Former collective farms are not included and will either continue
operating as co-operatives or return the land to the members who were
collectivised.
Mr Gunter Rexrodt, a member of the Treuhand management board, said priority
in the leasing arrangement would be given to former owners who again wanted
to work the land and to east Germans wanting to become private farmers.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Shelling halts UN relief of Sarajevo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE old quarter of Sarajevo was bombarded by Serb irregular forces last
night, defying fresh United Nations attempts to demilitarise and re-open the
airport at the besieged Bosnian capital.
Shelling also spread to other parts of the city and was heavily concentrated
on the suburb of Dobrinja, which has been blockaded by Serb irregulars for
the past 47 days.
Bombardment of the city earlier forced UN officials to abandon plans to send
in Canadian troops to take control of the airport.
'There is all out war here,' a UN official said, adding that the UN was
trying to get the Bosnian presidency, the Serb irregulars, and Serbia's
proxy army to sign a new agreement aimed at reopening the airport.
Serb irregulars have blockaded the airport, preventing all food and
humanitarian aid from reaching the city, whose 300,000 inhabitants have been
besieged for 75 days.
Members of the Territorial Defence force, which consists of Sarajevo's
Moslem, Serb and Croat communities, and which is trying to defend the city,
said yesterday that any new agreement was 'almost meaningless'.
'The Serbs sign a ceasefire, re-group, re-arm, and then bombard the city
from the surrounding hills in an attempt to divide our city,' said Mr Mirsad
Kulenovic, a former Yugoslav diplomat.
Mr Sefer Halilovic, commander of the Territorial Defence force, criticised
the UN for not doing enough to prevent the bombardment and killings.
He said the UN had made no attempt to stop civilians in the suburb of
Dobrinja from being taken out of their apartments by Serb irregulars.
UN officials said their mandate limited them to negotiating the reopening of
Sarajevo airport to allow an airlift of food into the city.
Western diplomats and journalists in Sarajevo said that over the past three
days, Serb irregulars had entered apartment blocks and had taken residents
to a prison in Pale, east of Sarajevo, the headquarters of Mr Radovan
Karadzic, and General Ratko Mladic, leaders of the Serb irregulars, and
Serbia's proxy army.
'The innocent civilians are taken as hostages in exchange for Serb snipers
captured by the Territorial Defence,' a western diplomat said. 'This is
happening under the eyes of the UN. This is happening every day. It is
unspeakable the evil which is taking place here.'

FT  19 JUN 92 / Maxwell's will: controlling an image beyond the grave
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROBERT MAXWELL'S last will and testament reveals a man determined to control
his image beyond the grave. He left a total of more than Pounds 2m to his
family and friends, with the rest of his personal estate going to causes
including world peace, the defence of Israel and the eradication of
Alzheimer's disease and cancer.
But beneficiaries who brought the Maxwell family or Maxwell companies 'into
disrepute' would lose their inheritance. Any who unsuccessfully challenged
the will would see their legacy cut to only Pounds 1,000.
The Financial Times has obtained a copy of the will, drawn up on July 12
1987 and amended on December 30 1990. The will's authenticity has
independently been confirmed by a lawyer involved in its preparation.
Maxwell left money to an Israeli synagogue to ensure that 'prayers be said
in perpetuity' for himself and his close relations on the anniversaries of
their deaths. He asked to be buried in an orthodox Jewish cemetery in
Jerusalem in accordance with orthodox rites.
Ms Jean Baddeley, Maxwell's former secretary and a close friend, inherits
Pounds 100,000 and 'shall continue to be employed in and about the
management of my estate . . .on the most generous terms of compensation'.
Robert Maxwell's widow, Elisabeth, inherits Pounds 500,000 and three
apartments in France. Each of Maxwell's seven children is to receive Pounds
200,000. His sister, Sylvia Rosen, inherits Pounds 150,000. Helene Atkin and
Michael Atkin, a niece and nephew, inherit Dollars 100,000 each.
Maxwell left everything else in his personal estate to charitable
organisations. For years, however, the ultimate owners of the Maxwell
corporate empire have been secretive offshore trusts in Liechtenstein and,
recently, Gibraltar. Investigators are now attempting to penetrate the
confidentiality that shields these trusts.
The named beneficiaries of the will may not receive anything. If creditors
force the estate into bankruptcy, they will rank above anyone mentioned in a
will.
The document was given to the FT by Mr Frank Field, the Labour MP who
chaired the House of Commons select committee on social security which held
hearings into the Maxwell affair.
Mr Field declined to identify his source except to say he was satisfied the
person had intimate knowledge of Maxwell's personal affairs.
In explaining his release of the confidential documents, Mr Field said: 'A
person approached me who was mortified about what happened to the pensioners
and concerned about the apparent lack of activity. I was asked to place this
information with the FT in the hope that other people who know part of the
story would come forward.'
Mr Field said he had been told that the bulk of Maxwell's assets was stored
in roughly a dozen charitable trusts based in Liechtenstein and that not
even Mr Kevin Maxwell knew the location of all the assets at the time of his
father's death. Much of the assets consisted of shares in various Maxwell
companies and the value of current holdings is unclear.

FT  19 JUN 92 / GPA abandons flotation after demand collapses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GPA Group, the privately-owned aircraft leasing company, yesterday was
forced to abort its planned global flotation valued at about Dollars 800m
(Pounds 432m) because of poor demand from institutional investors.
The move early yesterday, only hours before the shares were due to begin
trading, followed an acrimonious meeting in London between the Irish-based
company and its advisers.
Institutional demand in the US collapsed at the last moment, affecting
demand for shares from institutions in London and Dublin, where the
flotation was due to take place. By yesterday morning there was demand -
mainly from retail investors in international markets - for only 53m out of
the 85m shares the company hoped to sell. The planned offer had been raised
from 80m some 10 days earlier.
The rapid collapse of institutional demand, particularly in the US, was
blamed on falling world markets and concerns about the airline industry.
At yesterday's meeting between the company and its advisers, Mr Tony Ryan,
GPA's chairman and founder, implored his investment bankers to try to save
the flotation by lowering the price or issuing fewer shares.
But the advisers, which include Nomura as global co-ordinator, Goldman Sachs
and Merrill Lynch in the US, and J. Henry Schroder Wagg in the UK, felt the
issue could not go ahead without sufficient institutional demand. One said
yesterday: 'We had a duty to the retail investors as well as to the
company.'
The flotation had been expected to raise around Dollars 800m in new money,
valuing the group at Dollars 2.4bn. Without the new money the group will
have to rely increasingly on debt finance. GPA has to pay for Dollars 12bn
of firm orders from manufacturers for aircraft by the end of the decade.
Mr Maurice Foley, GPA's chief executive, said: 'We have never been dependent
on one source of finance and will continue to tap other areas.' He added
that the group was likely to go back to the debt market where it recently
raised Dollars 500m in a public bond issue. But the aborted flotation may
have an impact on GPA's ability to raise new finance.
The group's credit rating from Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, was
yesterday placed under review for possible downgrading. Moody's Investors
Service, the other big US agency, is already reviewing GPA for downgrading.
Moody yesterday warned: 'The aborted flotation is a negative factor.'
Mr Foley said that a downgrading would be 'unwelcome' but predicted that it
would not significantly affect the group's ability to raise new finance.
At a meeting at its London office yesterday GPA's senior executives
discussed the possibility of trying to go public again sometime in the
future.
GPA's orders account for more than 10 per cent of the outstanding orders
from the world's biggest civil aircraft makers, Boeing and Airbus Industrie.
The failure of the flotation could further disrupt the order books of world
aircraft manufacturers.
The share prices of Boeing and McDonnell-Douglas of the US, Fokker of the
Netherlands and stakeholders in the Airbus consortium, such as British
Aerospace, all fell yesterday.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Maxwell brothers face Pounds 135m fraud charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, ANDREW JACK and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kevin Maxwell and Mr Ian Maxwell, sons of the disgraced publisher Robert
Maxwell, and Mr Larry Trachtenberg, a US business associate, were yesterday
facing fraud-related charges after being arrested at their London homes.
The early morning arrests came eight months after Maxwell's death in the sea
off the Canary Islands and during one of the most complex investigations
carried out by the Serious Fraud Office.
The police made the arrests with the SFO's investigation only half
completed, and the decision to move yesterday took place against a
background of mounting pressure for action and intensifying press coverage.
More than Pounds 900m remains missing from a variety of Maxwell companies
and pension funds affecting thousands of Maxwell pensioners.
The three men face a total of 15 charges of conspiracy to defraud and theft
involving Pounds 135m.
Mr Kevin Maxwell, at 33 the youngest Maxwell son, and a former chairman of
Maxwell Communication Corporation, was charged with two counts of conspiracy
to defraud and six of theft. The charges include the alleged defrauding of
the Swiss Bank Corporation of Pounds 55m and the Swiss Volks Bank of Dollars
35m.
Mr Trachtenberg, the 39-year-old former London School of Economics lecturer
and financial adviser to the late publisher, was charged with two counts of
conspiracy to defraud SBC and Volks Bank and four theft charges.
Mr Ian Maxwell, the former Mirror Group Newspapers' chairman, was charged on
a single count of conspiracy to defraud Volks Bank of Dollars 35m.
The charges relate to only three of the five areas of inquiry still being
pursued by the SFO, and all but one of the alleged offences are said to have
taken place after Maxwell's death.
The five lines of inquiry are into the circumstances surrounding a Pounds
55m loan from Swiss Bank Corporation, the MCC pension funds, money missing
from MGN, an alleged share support operation and cash and investments
removed from MCC.
Accountants tracing Maxwell assets on behalf of creditors and pensioners
said yesterday that the charges against the three men would have no effect
on their investigations.
Following the arrests, the three men were taken to Snow Hill police station
in the City of London - not far from both the headquarters of the collapsed
empire, and the offices used by the brothers recently in an apparent attempt
to relaunch their business careers.
They were brought to the police station just after 7am and were detained
without being questioned before being charged. Reporting restrictions were
not lifted on their first court appearance, lasting just over one hour at
the City of London Magistrates, and all three were released on conditional
bail to reappear on September 1. The trial  - likely to be the largest case
of alleged fraud ever to come before the UK courts - is not expected to
start for two years. Mr Kevin Maxwell was bailed on sureties of Pounds
500,000, Mr Ian Maxwell on sureties of Pounds 250,000 and Mr Trachtenberg on
sureties of Pounds 300,000. In all cases, the sureties were provided by
friends and family. All three were ordered to surrender their passports, not
to leave the UK and to live at their home addresses.
After the hearing Mr Kevin Maxwell said he would oppose all the charges
against him.
'After seven months of trial by rumour, of trial by innuendo, of trial by
selective press leaks and of prejudicial media reporting, I am really
looking forward to being able to defend myself in a court of law where I
intend to vigorously and strenuously contest all and any charges against
me,' he said.
The arrest of Mr Kevin Maxwell began in something close to farce. When two
police officers rang the doorbell of his Pounds 1.7m house in Jubilee Place,
Chelsea, his wife Pandora mistook them for reporters. She opened an upstairs
window and shouted to the officers: 'Piss off - we don't get up for another
hour.'
When the officers rang the bell again she called out: 'I'm about to call the
police'.
They replied: 'We are the police, madam. Would you please open the door?'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE withdrawal of GPA's global share offer, the poor overnight performances
on Wall Street and Tokyo, and a gloomy outlook for several leading UK
stocks, combined to unsettle stock index futures in a volatile session,
writes Joel Kibazo.
On its last full day of trading ahead of today's expiry, the June FT-SE
contract opened at 2,571 and was briefly squeezed forward to 2,574. But that
momentum was curtailed as the market focused on the poor showing in other
leading markets and the news from GPA. James Capel was also reported to have
had a sizeable seller, all of which caused a retreat in the June future.
A rally was, however, seen late morning which sent June climbing to 2,575.
But that petered out in the early afternoon after downgradings of profits
expectations following a meeting at ICI, leaving the contract to drift to
the day's low of 2,552.
A rally just before the official market close resulted in June finishing at
2,565, a five-point premium to the cash market, as turnover reached 10,844
lots.
In the traded options market, trading in the FT-SE option, which expires
today, took centre stage as a total of 21,821 contracts were transacted out
of the day's market total of 39,745 lots.

FT  19 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei loses 2.4%
despite buying by investment trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE NIKKEI average set a 5 1/2 -year low for the second consecutive day as a
drop in the futures market prompted further arbitrage-linked selling, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average lost 400.24, or 2.4 per cent, to 16,045.56. The index
fell to the day's low of 16,030.91 in the morning session on arbitrage
selling and liquidation of holdings by corporations and financial
institutions.
Heavy buying in the afternoon by investment trusts helped recoup the losses,
and the Nikkei rose to 16,403.65. However, the improvement was eroded by
selling by a leading US broker towards the end of the session.
Volume rose from 288m shares to 330m. Foreign investors, who until recently
have been buyers of the Tokyo market, were seen selling real estate,
securities and bank shares. Traders said foreign interest towards Japanese
stocks was waning, although liquidation of holdings is not expected in the
near term.
Declines outnumbered advances by 905 to 118, with 85 issues unchanged. The
Topix index of all first section stocks dropped 30.97, or 2.4 per cent, to
1,245.64, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 4.46 to 976.04.
Comments by Mr Yasushi Mieno, Bank of Japan governor, ruling out scope for a
cut in the official discount rate also discouraged investors. In spite of
the denial, however, the sharp falls in share prices raised hopes of
monetary easing among bond market participants. The yield on the 129 10-year
benchmark fell to 5.395 per cent from 5.42 per cent on hopes of lower
short-term rates.
However, stock market participants ignored movements in the bond market.
Traders said buyers would be absent while the selling by arbitrageurs and
institutions continued.
A total of 212 shares fell to the year's low, as was the case with Nippon
Steel, Y5 cheaper at Y260.
Rumours that leading Japanese brokers had revised down their earnings
forecasts for the leading steel companies prompted selling. Institutional
investors sold holdings of leading blue chips.
Daikyo, the condominium maker, weakened Y19 to Y781. The issue fell by its
daily limit on Wednesday as rumours that the company faces financial trouble
circulated in the market. Although company officials denied such rumours,
traders said investors remained pessimistic about Daikyo's business
prospects.
Real estate companies were also weak, with Mitsui Fudosan finishing Y55 down
at Y830 and Mitsubishi Estate retreating Y21 to Y779.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 358.77 to 19,143.36 in volume of 22.3m
shares.
Roundup
WEAKNESS IN New York and Tokyo unsettled Pacific Rim markets.
NEW ZEALAND closed lower as investors, already scarce ahead of the July 2
government budget announcement, were further discouraged by weakness on
international markets. The NZSE-40 index closed 14.85 down at 1,515.95 in
turnover of NZDollars 24.9m (NZDollars 29.6m). An exception was Brierley
Investments, a cent up at 97 cents on the day's heaviest volume of 6.7m
shares.
AUSTRALIA held up fairly well in the face of the sharp declines in New York
and Tokyo, the All Ordinaries index ending 6.2 off at 1,624.9 after an early
low of 1,616.1. Turnover was steady at ADollars 271m. CRA fell 12 cents to
ADollars 14.24 after reporting that a strike had closed iron-ore production
at its Hamersley unit in Western Australia.
MANILA continued its downward correction as the composite index shed 36.04
to 1,499.78 in turnover of 184m pesos, after 264m. The decline was triggered
by a Dollars 2.125 loss to Dollars 39.625 for PLDT in overnight trading on
the American Stock Exchange. It fell 45 pesos to 1,045 pesos in Manila.
HONG KONG also extended its retreat, the Hang Seng index tumbling 49.96 to
5,796.10 in steady turnover of HKDollars 2.77bn. Utilities were sharply
lower: Hongkong Electric lost 40 cents to HKDollars 18.60.
KUALA LUMPUR was broadly lower in light trading, the composite index
slipping 6.69 to 596.50 in turnover of MDollars 103m (MDollars 186m).
Telekom Malaysia declined 30 cents to MDollars 13.70 and Tenaga Nasional 25
cents to MDollars 8.50.
SINGAPORE fell on profit-taking. The Straits Times Industrial index closed
11.41 down at 1,506.03 in turnover of SDollars 112.4m (SDollars 140.3m).
Shipping stocks were among the most actively traded, joining shipyard issues
on the list of losers. Hotel shares were also sold after a local report that
occupancy rates have slipped in the second quarter.
TAIWAN firmed in light dealings as late bargain hunting overwhelmed
midsession declines. The weighted index gained a net 24.88 at 4,628.78 as
turnover shrank to TDollars 28bn from TDollars 36.8bn. SEOUL dropped in
cautious trading. The composite index fell 12.87 to 563.85 in turnover of

FT  19 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): GPA, Maastricht add to
continental caution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GPA's aborted flotation and the Irish referendum on Maastricht took their
toll on bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. Frankfurt was closed
for a holiday.
AMSTERDAM saw Philips down another Fl 1.20 at Fl 29.90 following Wednesday's
profit warning with the shares expected to fall further today on the expiry
of options. Volume was estimated at some 4.5m shares, broadly the same as
the day before. The CBS Tendency index was 1.6 down at 125.8.
KLM's transatlantic price cuts on flights originating from the US sent the
shares lower. The airline was also rocked by speculation that a US airline
was about to file for bankruptcy: KLM has a 20 per cent stake in Northwest.
It closed down Fl 1.10 at Fl 38.10.
Some analysts said that the withdrawal of the GPA flotation would have less
effect on KLM than on Fokker, down Fl 1.30 or nearly 4 per cent at Fl 32.20
because of the latter's exposure to regional airlines which depend on
leasing finance.
Elsevier closed Fl 2.20 lower at Fl 107.50 on rumours that Mr Cornelis
Alberti, an executive director at Elsevier and tipped to become chairman,
was to resign.
PARIS ended lower after a volatile session as investors sold out, troubled
by weakness on other markets and Maastricht doubts. The CAC-40 index went as
low as 1,880.51 before closing 17.04 down at 1,891.80, its lowest close
since February 17. Turnover rose slightly to FFr2.7bn.
Michelin was one of the day's more prominent losers, falling FFr6.7 or 3.4
per cent to FFr193.3 ahead of its annual shareholders's meeting next
Thursday. Alcatel, another widely-held blue chip, lost FFr13 to FFr617.
Among smaller stocks, Hachette lost FFr3.4 to FFr128.7 in spite of the
company's forecast of a return to profit this year.
MILAN started about 0.5 per cent higher, following the favourable political
developments on Wednesday, but later came back slightly in view of the
weakness on foreign markets. The Comit index rose 2.1 to 471.79 in turnover
estimated at between L90bn-L95bn after L88bn on Wednesday.
Trading on the screen system was delayed by one hour due to problems with
the telephone lines linking the network. Sip was the most heavily traded on
the system, losing L73 to L1,278 in 7.02m shares, on fears that the
reorganisation of the sector would take longer than expected.
Weakness in the Italian bond market, following Wednesday's devaluation
fears, put pressure on the banking sector. Banca Commerciale fell L65 to
L2,955 and Credito Italiano lost L48 to L1,636.
ZURICH was relatively resilient, the SMI index closing 10.6 lower at 1,862.5
in moderate volume. Registered shares in Ciba-Geigy, SFr30 lower at
SFr3,280, topped the active list. Other chemicals were also lower with the
exemption of bearers in Merck which rose SFr18 to SFr696 on buying by one
small Zurich-based bank.
Swissair extended losses from midday to close SFr12 lower at SFr720. The
airline said on Wednesday that it planned to cut 400 of its 6,000
administrative jobs.
MADRID weakened in moderate volume, the general index losing 1.55 to 246.51.
Rumours that the chemicals group Ercros may file for bankruptcy drove the
shares down Pta33 or 15 per cent to Pta189.
STOCKHOLM fell ahead of the midsummer holiday today. The Affarsvarlden
General index fell 14.40 to 928.90 in moderate turnover of SKr430m, of which
trading in Astra accounted for SKr90m, as yesterday was the final day for
trade in Astra restricted shares. All Astra shares will be unrestricted from
Monday.
OSLO suffered its 13th consecutive decline, depressed by falls on the
foreign exchanges. The all-share index dropped 6.51 to 417.28 in trading
worth NKr250m.
Norsk Hydro shed NKr2.50 to NKr162. UNI Storebrand, which asked the
government for permission to hold its 28 per cent stake in the Swedish
insurer Skandia beyond June 30, saw its A shares drop NKr3 to NKr39.
COPENHAGEN moved against the trend, the KFX index closing 0.29 higher at
89.03 after a modest recovery by bank and insurance shares.
The insurer, Hafnia, in deep trouble because of unrealised losses on its
large stakes in Baltica and Skandia, saw its A rise DKr12 to DKr142, mainly
because of the rise in value of its 33.5 per cent stake in Baltica, whose
shares rose DKr20 to DKr460.
Danske Bank and Unidanmark edged up in quiet trading, mainly because the
domestic bond market stabilised.
HELSINKI's banks were another story. Free shares in KOP, one of Finland's
largest banks, fell FM1.2 to FM8 as the Hex index closed 17.7, or 2.2 per
cent lower at 769.2, although traders said that trading was extremely thin.
ISTANBUL jumped by 2.7 per cent with the 75-share index closing up 95.52 at
3,614.54, its highest level for over a month. Turnover was estimated at
TL205.7bn from TL144.8bn.

FT  19 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets: Italian volume continues recovery /
Review of last month's European equity turnover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
May was a volatile month for equity turnover on European stock exchanges,
with a weakening in Belgium, France and the UK balanced by gains elsewhere.
But even the winners were riding for a fall.
Italy put up the biggest increase in trading, turnover rising by 30.7 per
cent, extending and accelerating a 25.4 per cent gain in April after an
exceptionally weak March. It had periods of excitement, and stock market
rallies in May on the hopes of a recovery in political stability and in the
economy longer term, seen particularly in industrial shares in anticipation
of these events.
'People thought that Italy must have seen all the bad news,' says Mr James
Cornish of County NatWest, which produces the monthly turnover figures, 'but
the change in sentiment came ahead of any change in reality.' The Danish
'No' vote to the EC Maastricht treaty brought fear back into the Milan
bourse at the beginning of June; it had already been severely incapacitated
on June 1, when the screen trading system was knocked out of commission by
heavy rainstorms and lightning.
The Netherlands, up 20.5 per cent, was helped by the oil price rise and the
boost in trading which this gave to Royal Dutch. There is a sense in which a
market so sensitive to oil, the US dollar and the performance of its big
international stocks seems never to have a domestic story of its own to
tell.
'There is a good story to be told about the Dutch domestic equity market,'
says Mr Cornish; but he reflects wryly that, this month, it seems likely to
be submerged in this week's further, painful chapter in the Philips saga.
Germany, in May, put on 16.6 per cent as the threat of a metalworkers'
strike was averted. In this, it effectively returned to the January/March
level after a nervous April, but once again, as in the case of other
European bourses, its June trading has been seriously affected by worries
about EC stability - after the Danish vote, on the run-up to yesterday's
Irish referendum and in the prospect of a French version in September.
Political stories were also reflected in the UK and France, the former
falling by 14.1 per cent as the post-election spree evaporated and the
latter declining by 10.7 per cent following the April euphoria on the
appointment of Mr Pierre Beregovoy as prime minister.
Belgium dropped by 20.6 per cent. Here, the market was still up on the
average for the previous 12 months, and Mr Sebastian Scotney, Belgian
specialist at Dillon Read, says dividend dates were behind the decline:
'Quite a lot of the market goes ex-dividend during May, and the
dividend-interest buying which lifted April was replaced by post-dividend
languor in big blue chips such as Petrofina, Electrabel and Societe Generale
de Banque.'

FT  19 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Grenada hopes to revive nutmeg
cartel - Plans to give price support another try
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD'S two largest nutmeg producers are contemplating the destruction
of about 10,000 tonnes of stocks as part of an effort to stiffen the market
and improve prices. The destruction of the stocks, held by Indonesia and
Grenada, will be discussed by both countries in a few weeks when the
Grenadians will attempt to interest the Indonesians in the recreation of the
nutmeg cartel that collapsed two years ago.
The producers will also attempt to cut commodity brokers out of the
industry, and try to market directly to consumers.
'The stocks which both countries have are a liability and not an asset, and
they are depressing prices,' said Mr Denis Noel, Grenada's junior minister
of foreign affairs. 'We will consider using the strategy of major coffee
producers, which is to destroy some of the stocks. But any destruction will
have to be done jointly.'
Indonesia produces 75 per cent of the world's nutmeg and Grenada 23 per
cent. World production is about 12,000 tonnes a year at present, while
annual demand is for only 9,000 tonnes, according to Mr Noel.
The co-operation that the Grenadians are seeking will be outlined to the
Indonesian producers when a high-level government delegation from the
eastern Caribbean island visits Jakarta. Getting agreement on the
destruction of the stocks is one aspect of Grenadian plans to resurrect the
cartel, which foundered on changes in the Indonesian government's economic
policy involving extensive deregulation of the economy.
The subsequent removal of controls on the volumes put on the market has sent
prices down. In 1986, before the cartel was established, the world price for
nutmeg was about USDollars 1,000 a tonne. The marketing pact, in which both
countries set minimum prices for the nut, led to an increase to about
Dollars 7,000 a tonne. According to Mr Noel, prices are now about Dollars
2,000 a tonne.
In preparing the ground for closer collaboration, Grenada and Indonesia
recently established diplomatic relations. But Indonesian officials, saying
they wanted to see what proposals the Grenadians will be making before
commenting on their own position, have indicated that even if it is revived,
the marketing agreement will not be similar to the cartel that existed
before.
'In a deregulated economy where market forces are at play, it is out of
place for us to embrace any mechanism which seeks to control the market and
to fix prices,' one official explained.
Strengthening the market is more important for Grenada than it is for
Indonesia. Nutmeg is a significant foreign currency earner for the Caribbean
island but represents only a part of a larger spice industry in Indonesia.
'The nutmeg industry represents the major foreign currency earner for
Grenada,' confirmed Mr Noel.
When the Indonesian producers group, Aspin, and its Grenadian counterpart,
the GCNA, signed the agreement creating the cartel, there were quick and
significant benefits for the Caribbean island. Earnings from exports in 1986
were Dollars 1.85m, but the following year Grenadian farmers received
Dollars 5.55m in surplus payments.
Under the agreement creating the cartel, the Indonesian producers undertook
to sell their high quality nutmeg at between Dollars 6,800 and Dollars 7,000
a tonne and low quality at between Dollars 1,000 and Dollars 1,200 a tonne.
For their part, the Grenadians committed themselves to minimum prices of
Dollars 6,650 a tonne for their best nutmeg and Dollars 5,575 a tonne for
poorer quality.
Indonesia's high quality mace, the red lacy substance that surrounds nutmeg,
had a minimum price of Dollars 13,500 a tonne, with low quality not being
sold below Dollars 6,000 a tonne. The Grenadians agreed not to accept less
than Dollars 11,750 a tonne for their premium mace or Dollars 5,750 for the
secondary product.
The two producers' groups also agreed to control the volume of nutmeg and
mace placed on the market in order to maintain price stability. The agreed
volumes were determined on the basis of average production and stocks held
by both. Grenada's stocks reached 5,500 tonnes, with Indonesia's at 4,000
tonnes, said Mr Noel.
The cartel had a short life. By 1989 Grenadians were accusing the
Indonesians of reneging on the pact by selling nutmeg and mace below the
minimum prices.
An attempt to repair the damage had seemed to be successful, with Indonesian
and Grenadian officials agreeing to restore the cartel's pricing policy, the
Indonesians undertaking to sell their spice at 5 per cent above the agreed
minimum and the Grenadians adding 10 per cent to their prices.
But when the new economic policies were implemented in Indonesia, Grenada's
industry threw in the towel and reduced prices in an effort to hold on to
market share. The GCNA dropped the price of its top quality nuts by Dollars
2,300 a tonne, and the price of premium quality mace was reduced by Dollars
4,000 a tonne.
'When we talk with the Indonesians, we will also discuss co-operation in
marketing, which will allow us, as the producers, to deal directly with end
users,' said Mr Noel. 'This will allow us to bypass the commodity brokers.
The previous agreement collapsed, not because it was unworkable, but because
of changes in Indonesia.'

forecast

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
PRICES FOR most commodities could show a strong revival in 1993 if the
economies of the leading industrialised countries recover enough to
stimulate demand for raw materials, according to the Economist Intelligence
Unit, writes Our Commodities Staff.
'We expect the global economy to pick up in 1992 and most commodities are
sensitive to change on the demand side,' said Mr Alec Gordon, editor of the
unit's World Commodity Forecasts.
In the latest edition, of the 26 commodities prices covered by the EIU, 18
are seen as fetching higher prices in 1993 than this year, when many
commodity prices hit new lows because of the recession.
In the soft commodities, crops may be badly hit by drought and the ensuing
supply problems should support prices, Mr Gordon said.
He expected tea, sunflower and soyabean oils prices to do better in 1993
than this year. The coffee and cocoa markets are still heavily oversupplied
but if stock control measures succeed, prices could recover strongly, Mr
Gordon said.
Nickel, with its fortunes strongly linked to stainless steel production,
would benefit from a strengthening consumer goods sector, while use of
copper strongly depended on an upturn in the construction and power
transmission sectors, the EIU said.

towards free market

<TEXT>
NATURAL RUBBER producers have agreed for the first time to work towards a
new, open market system, with the possibility of international prices being
set through a centralised exchange in Singapore.
At the end of a three-day meeting here members of the the Association of
Natural Rubber Producing Countries agreed to 'develop and foster one
centralised open market in the rubber producing region'. The producers'
association, formed in 1970, groups Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Papua New
Guinea, Sri Lanka, India and Singapore which between them supply more than
80 per cent of natural rubber.
At present more than 70 per cent of the world natural rubber trade is
carried out through direct private party to party deals between plantations
or smallholder groups and the main consumer companies, mainly the tyre
manufacturers. Producer countries, frustrated by a prolonged period of low
prices, had said in the past that the system was unfair and had suggested
the formation of a rubber producers' cartel in order to gain higher prices.
Mr Ahmad Farouk, chairman of the Malaysian Rubber Research and Development
Board, said what was significant about the Singapore meeting was that
consumers' representatives were now expressing a willingness to work towards
a more open rubber trading system.
'What the big tyre companies want more than anything else is security of
supply. In the short term they might gain by cheaper, direct deals with
certain producers. But they also realise that the there could be supply
problems in the years ahead. Some producers, like Malaysia, are either
turning to what are considered to be more profitable crops like palm oil or
are industrialising fast, with the result that less rubber is being
produced. Another problem facing Malaysian rubber producers is a serious
shortage of labour,' said Mr Farouk.
Malaysia, for many years the world's biggest rubber producer, saw its
production last year decline by 3.4 per cent. Thailand is now top of the
world rubber production table.
Mr Farouk said that there was general agreement at the meeting that the
direct trading system had produced considerable distortions in the market.
'The volume of direct trade reduced liquidity in the market. We are all
agreed that natural rubber still has bright prospects in the long term. But
we must have a more transparent pricing system,' said Mr Farouk.
The meeting here set up a committee to examine how Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok and
Jakarta, which have physical markets, could link up with Singapore to
develop a proper rubber international futures market. 'It is important that
the futures market is linked to the producing countries so the cost of
production can be adequately reflected in the market price,' said Mr Farouk.
The committee will also examine ways of pricing natural rubber as an
industrial product, rather than a commodity, on the international market. Mr
Farouk said that a final decision on setting up the new market system would
probably be taken later this year.
Rubber output in Indonesia, the world's second largest producer, is expected
to fall by between 10 and 12 per cent in the first half of 1992 because of
to poor weather and low prices, a senior industry official said yesterday,
reports Reuter from Singapore.
'The government estimated that production will fall 10 per cent during the
first semester (January-June) but our own estimate is about 12 per cent,'
said Mr Asril Sutan Amir, vice-chairman of the Rubber Association of
Indonesia (Gapkindo).
He said first half output was forecast to fall by between 60,000 and 72,000
tonnes from the 600,000 tonnes last year. Indonesia's total 1992 output is
expected to fall to about 1.1m tonnes from 1.2m tonnes in 1991, he added.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Producers prepare for coffee
pact push
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COFFEE PRODUCING countries will meet tomorrow and Sunday in London to try to
tighten up their plans for a new international coffee agreement before
meeting consumers next week.
The proposals agreed at a meeting of producers late last month were
described by one anaylst as 'deliberately vague'. They envisaged a global
export quota of about 62m bags (60 kg each), incorporating selectivity
between different types of coffee and shared out between producing countries
on the basis of export performance in the free market since the collapse of
export quotas in July 1989.
Mr Nestor Osorio, Colombian delegate to the International Coffee
Organisation, said yesterday that with prices at 20-year lows there was
urgent need for market regulation. 'Producers are completely committed - we
shall be trying over the weekend to agree concrete proposals to take before
the consumers.'
Among the problems the producers will be trying to untangle are quota
allocation and a viable control system.
Colombia, the second biggest coffee producer after Brazil, has been the main
driving force behind moves towards a renewed pact. Mr Osorio believes if the
political will is there, movement towards a new agreement could be quick. 'I
think we have already lost a lot of time.'
Consumers do not appear to be in so much of a hurry. Mr Lawrence Eagles,
analyst with GNI, the London futures broker, points out that the willingness
of the US, the biggest consumer, to tolerate an agreement is based on solely
on the political motive of fighting the Colombian drug barons.
In any case they may not agree to such a low overall quota as 62m bags,
which is 10m bags below consumption and would force them to draw down their
stocks.
Market observers are not optimistic. Last week Mr Mark Dumas, managing
director of ED &amp; F. Man, the big London trade house, told a coffee
conference: 'My personal view is that unfortunately there will not be a new
agreement with powers to control the market'.
The Economist Intelligence Unit said yesterday in its World Commodity
Forecasts that it did not believe the producers will succeed in their aim of
activating a new agreement from October as the issues are too complex.

falls sharply

<TEXT>
COCONUT PRODUCTION in the Philippines, the world's leading exporter of
coconut oil and copra, may be 29 per cent less this year than originally
forecast, officials of the Asian and Pacific Coconut Community said
yesterday.
Mr PG Punchihewa, executive-director of the APCC, said that more than eight
months of low rainfall had severly affected the Philippines' production and
that 1992 production, measured in copra equivalent, was likely to be between
1.4m and 1.5m tonnes. In January the APCC estimated production would be
1.98m tonnes.
Industry officials say low rainful has been excacerbated by the eruption of
Mount Pinatuba and they do not expect production to recover until 1994. In
1990 the Philippines produced nearly 2.5m tonnes of coconuts.
Stocks of coconut oil in Rotterdam, the main trading centre, have fallen
sharply in the past year to 61,175 tonnes in mid-May from 134,575 tonnes in
May last year.
Copra meal stocks have also declined as a result of a 35 per cent
year-on-year fall in exports from the the Philippines for January-April to
141,019 tonnes.
Indonesia's exports of copra meal also declined, by 59 per cent in January
and February to 38,162 compared with the same period last year. However, Mr
Punchihewa said that Indonesia had enjoyed better than forecast rains and
1992 estimated coconut production at 2.25m tonnes remained unchanged.
APCC officials said they expected the world market price of coconut oil to
average Dollars 600 a tonne cif this year, up from Dollars 433 per tonne in
1991. In the longer-term, officials believe world prices will be sustained
by demand growing faster than supply.

LME TIN prices closed near 25-month highs. Three-month tin's early test of
support at Dollars 6,600 a tonne encouraged buying in the afternoon and the
market quickly made headway to within a whisker of the Dollars 6,700 level.
Dips continue to attract buying interest and sentiment is also aided by
forward technical tightness. ZINC was again buffeted by waves of
liquidation, three-month metal dropping below support at Dollars 1,210 a
tonne at one stage to touch a 3 1/2 -month low of Dollars 1,206. The squeeze
continued to unravel, exerting pressure, traders said. Traders were
expecting LME warehouse stocks to rise again today. Comex COPPER remained
lower at midsession on the heels of Chinese selling and falling equities
markets. 'The Chinese selling was enough to cap the market,' said one New
York analyst. Floor sources said many players took profits from Wednesday's
rise to lifetime highs across the board. The slippage in the Japanese and US
stock markets weighed on sentiment by pointing to lessening demand. New York
raw SUGAR prices were lower at midday as profit taking emerged after
Wednesday's advance above 11 cents a lb for the July contract.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: S African coal prices give
'barely adequate' return on investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONTRACT PRICE levels for coal are barely adequate at present to offer South
African producers a return on existing investments, never mind encourage new
investment, says Mr Allen Cook, chief executive of Randcoal, South Africa's
second largest producer.
Speaking at a recent conference in Australia, Mr Cook said although
international demand for South African coal would continue to rise in future
years, there were two major points of concern for the local industry. The
first concerns the high rate of cost escalation in recent years, which is
eroding South Africa's competitive position. This is a function of increased
wage demands, rising transport costs and continuing inflation of about 15
per cent.
Mr Cook said there was a significant drive in the industry to lower costs by
improving productivity. Agreement has also been reached with Spoornet, the
state rail company, to peg rail freight costs on the line to the Richards
Bay export port in the next few years at about half the inflation level.
The second issue is that 'current market conditions, recent price history
and some buyers' attitudes to pricing' militate against further investment.
Mr Cook said a buyers market had existed for a number of years, with the
real price for coal declining in all major currencies. 'The cost squeeze on
producers has led to a number of mine closures which, in the medium term,
will be detrimental to the continued secure supplies of coal from major
producing companies,' said Mr Cook. He added that it was in the interest of
all parties that a 'reasonable' price level should be set that encouraged
future investment in coal.
South Africa has port capacity to export 53m tonnes a year. Fob contract
prices would have to rise by between Dollars 5 and Dollars Pounds 8 a tonne
to make projects to expand capacity beyond this point viable, said Mr Cook.
Coal is South Africa's second largest export earner after gold. Last year
the country earned R4.2bn (Pounds 630m) from exporting 48.5m tonnes of coal.
Mr Cook said that with sanctions gone, large potential new markets were
opening up, particularly in Japan, Korea, Denmark, France, Holland, UK and
US. He said that Western Europe had regained its position as the main
destination for South African exports. Mr Cook said Europe remained a major
growth market for South African coal that was price competitive,
'particularly if the price of coal from current low-price producers in CIS
and Poland begins to reflect the actual cost of production'.

CHICAGO Board Options Exchange is seeking approval to list options on the
Standard &amp; Poors 100 and 500 indices that expire quarterly. The CBOE already
trades S&amp;P 100 and 500 options, but these expire monthly.
The exchange believes that quarterly expirations for these heavily-traded
products would help accommodate institutional investors whose performance is
judged on a quarterly and yearly basis. Mr Duke Chapman, CBOE chairman, said
the move was 'in response to customer needs'.
The products, referred to as Quarterly Index Expirations, or QIXs, in the
filing, would have similar terms to the corresponding regular index options.
This means the S&amp;P 100 QIXs would have American style exercise, while the
S&amp;P 500 QIXs would have European exercise.
The exchange intends to list the new options for as many as eight quarters.

FT  19 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: ADB signals start of
borrowing programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN increasingly ambitious borrowing programme was marked yesterday by the
Asian Development Bank.
This year, the ADB hopes to borrow over Dollars 3bn from the capital
markets. This is expected to increase by around Dollars 500m a year over the
next few years. Until last year, the bank borrowed under Dollars 1bn
annually.
Increased borrowing partly reflects increased lending to the developing
nations of Asia. Demand for loans has increased with the pace of economic
development. Loan disbursements were over Dollars 2bn last year, against
just Dollars 600m in 1986.
The ADB was also able to fund some lending from excess liquidity built up
during the mid-1980s.
Mr Rip Min, assistant treasurer, said excess liquidity resulted from a
change in the bank's lending terms in 1986 when it moved from making fixed
to mostly variable rate loans.
The change was designed to limit the bank's own refunding risk, by ensuring
that its return from lending was always in line with its cost of funds.
Since market risk was lower, lending margins were cut.
As margins were reduced, borrowers pre-paid outstanding loans, leaving the
ADB with a substantial over-hang of liquidity which is only now back to the
pre-1986 level.
The ADB currently makes 'hard loans' to development projects at a margin of
40 basis points over its cost of funds.

from withholding tax
</HEADLINE>

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian Treasury is studying ways of issuing bonds free of withholding
tax for foreign investors, according to a senior Finance Ministry official.
Although the scheme is not new, the news had an immediate effect on the
market, which has been extremely sensitive recently. Trading in Italian
government bonds has been highly volatile for the past two weeks following
growing political uncertainties about Italy's ability to meet the EC's
convergence criteria for Economic and Monetary Union.
However, the notion of issuing debt free of withholding tax for foreigners
is fraught with difficulties, and may even be impossible. Paying coupons
gross to foreign investors would lead to the creation of two markets for
Italian government paper. A German attempt in the late 1980s to introduce
withholding tax on domestic government debt proved short-lived owing to
technical difficulties. Such complexities would be even greater in the case
of Italy, where interest on government bonds is paid on an accrued basis
rather than as a lump sum on the coupon date.
The Finance Ministry said the step was being considered in view of
repayments of withholding tax made to foreign bondholders in recent months.
The decision to start reimbursements provided a considerable fillip to the
domestic bond market, which has gained in appeal for foreign investors over
the past two years thanks to Italy's relatively high interest rates and a
variety of reforms which have improved liquidity and trading practices.
The ministry said all outstanding claims on government paper had now been
repaid. It implied that the size and number of reimbursements had triggered
the Italian authorities to look into ways to streamline the system further,
including exempting foreign investors from withholding tax altogether.

FT  19 JUN 92 / International Bonds: Asian Bank launches Dollars 500m
Eurodollar deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Asian Development Bank yesterday launched its first Eurodollar bond
issue for four years, raising Dollars 500m 10-year funding in a deal
lead-managed by Goldman Sachs.
The 7 1/2 per cent bonds were re-offered to investors at a fixed price of
99.492, where the yield was 27 basis points more than US Treasury bonds of
the same maturity.
Most participants in the deal commented that the pricing was aggressive. On
Monday, OKB, the Austrian state-backed financial institution which is one of
the most admired names in the Euromarket, launched 10-year paper on a yield
spread of 26 basis points.
Eurodollar yield spreads have generally widened this week as institutional
investors liquidated holdings of dollar bonds as the US currency weakened on
the foreign exchange markets. The OKB bonds, for example, were yesterday
trading on a yield spread of around 30 basis points over Treasur-ies.
However, despite the tight pricing and lacklustre market conditions, the
deal sold quickly. Syndicate officials reported buying in equal amounts by
institutional investors in the Asia and Europe, including central banks.
'ADB's absence from the Eurodollar market gave this issue a scarcity value,'
commented one syndicate official. 'Investors are tired of buying World Bank
and EIB paper.'
Like these other supra-national institutions the ADB carries a top triple-A
credit rating. However, the EIB and World Bank can both sell bonds at
artificially tight yield spreads because their securities are exempt from
withholding tax in Italy.
While EIB and World Bank bond issues are supported by a core of tax-driven
Italian demand, the ADB issue was supported by buying from the Far East. The
bonds traded at a yield spread between 26 and 28 basis points through the
day, closing in London in the middle of this range.
The deal was scheduled to be launched early next week, however the market is
expecting additional Eurodollar issuance. City of Kobe thought to be the
first borrower in the market.
Elsewhere, the ADB also raised Fl 300m 10-year funding yesterday from an
issue lead managed by ABN Amro. Syndicate officials reported a warm response
from European institutional investors.
General Electric Capital Corporation, the funding arm of the US
manufacturer, became the latest borrower to make an underwritten bond issue
under the legal documentation of its medium term note programme.
The company launched CDollars 100m five-year paper, underwritten by a
syndicate of banks led by Kidder Peabody. The deal carried traditional
Eurobond fees of 1 7/8 per cent. Bankers said that the only difference
between the issue and a conven-tional Eurobond was the documentation.
China has issued a set of rules to govern the public issue of shares by
state industries, Reuter reports from Beijing.
Joint-stock regulations, drawn up by the State Planning Commission, are the
first to specify which sections of China's massive state sector will be
allowed to turn to private investors for money.
The new rules are part of Beijing's attempt to give more structure to the
'stock market fever' which is sweeping China.
Chinese stock markets have been opened in Shanghai and Shenzhen, just across
the border from Hong Kong.

THE Sydney Futures Exchange is in advanced talks to link it with the Globex
after-hours electronic futures and options exchange, Reuter reports.
Mr Gary Ginter, managing director of Globex, said: 'It's down to the final
strokes of a draft (letter of intent).'
However, the Sydney exchange is unlikely to play an active role in Globex
trading until around mid-1994, because the optic fibre line used for
transmissions is not due to be laid across the Pacific until then.
Globex - a joint venture between the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the
Chicago Board of Trade, developed with Reuters - is in advanced talks with
three different sets of potential member-exchanges, including Sydney and
four exchanges in New York, Mr Ginter said. The four exchanges are the New
York Futures Exchange, the Cotton Exchange, the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa
Exchange, and the Commodity Exchange.
Fairly advanced talks are taking place with an exchange in Europe, which he
declined to name. The Marche a Terme International de France (Matif) has
signed as a member and will go live in early 1993.

SOUTH KOREA is to allow the creation of joint-venture merchant banks with
foreign partners for the first time in 13 years, AP-DJ reports from Seoul.
The Ministry of Finance said up to three merchant banks would be set up this
year to 'accelerate the deregulation of the financial industry'.
It said each of the new merchant banks would be capitalised at Dollars
38.5m. Domestic financial institutions, mostly banks and insurance firms,
must own more than 50 per cent of the joint ventures, it said.
Foreign financial institutions will be able to make an equity participation
of between 10 and just less than 50 per cent.
The ministry said it would give preference to applicants wishing to help
small and medium-sized companies move their plants to China, eastern Europe
and the former Soviet Union.
According to reports, several conglomerates, including Samsung and
Lucky-Goldstar, have sought to set up merchant banks with foreign banks.

FT  19 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Taiwan loosens grip on China
Steel - A Dollars 680m rights issue will leave 76% in state hands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUISETTA MUDIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE second part of the partial privatisation of Taiwan's biggest steel group
gets under way this month when local investors have the opportunity to apply
for a Dollars 680m issue of shares.
The issue by China Steel reduces the Taiwan government's stake to 76 per
cent. It completes a share disposal programme worth more than Dollars 1bn to
the government.
In May, 5 per cent of the company was sold to foreign investors in the form
of Global Depository Receipts (GDRs).
Other local companies are eager to issue GDRs. President, the
privately-owned food group, hopes to sell Dollars 100m of GDRs soon. Asia
Cement and Chiah Hsin Cement have also submitted applications.
China Steel, Taiwan's only integrated steel mill, was founded in 1971. It
grew, with US help, into a vast, sprawling plant worth Dollars 5bn and
capable of competing in the Japanese market.
Despite the worldwide drop in steel prices, it managed to maintain net
margins at 17.4 per cent in 1991. China Steel dominates the local market
with a 60 per cent share. It will continue to concentrate on domestic
business as demand continues to rise.
The government will retain a controlling stake for at least four years.
Privatisation will eventually free China Steel from the onerous process of
obtaining parliamentary approval for all big decisions, and bringing new
flexibility to financial, personnel and budget management.
Last month, legislators pressured the government into forbidding China Steel
from investing in Taiwan Aerospace, saying the move was too far from the
corporation's core business to be justified. Taiwan Aerospace was to have
invested up to Dollars 2bn in McDonnell Douglas, the US aircraft-maker, but
it is now doubtful whether the deal will go ahead in its original form.
China Steel is also exploring a joint venture with the Australian steel
company BHP to produce coking coal and iron ore, essential raw materials for
steel-making.
A planned joint venture to build two new blast furnaces in Malaysia has been
shelved indefinitely owing to a lack of government incentives. However,
China Steel says it remains open to negotiations with the Lion Group, its
proposed partner.
A fourth blast furnace is planned for the Kaohsiung site, and the company
will be expanding its rod and bar production capacity, as well as extending
its range of value-added products, such as stainless steel. Mainland China
might be also be considered as a location for further expansion.
China Steel is already looking ahead to the next share issue. 'Maybe if this
goes well the government will push out another 20 per cent. From there it
would be a small step to moving to a 49 per cent minority government stake,'
the company said.

NIPPON Mining, the Japanese petroleum refiner and copper company, reported a
consolidated pre-tax loss of Y3.34bn (Dollars 26.29m) and indicated that its
acquisition of Gould, a US computer and copper company, had been an
unexpected burden.
The loss for the year to end-March followed a profit of Y14.9bn in the
previous period, while the after-tax loss swelled to Y16.3bn, compared with
a profit of Y5.3bn. Group sales fell 12.7 per cent to Y1,052.9bn.
Sales have been falling in Japan, but the biggest problem for the Japanese
company has been the Illinois-based Gould, which it said had a Y24.6bn loss
because of costs associated with the restructuring of the company.
Gould, purchased in 1988, was intended to be the centrepiece of Nippon
Mining's expansion of its overseas operations and its diversification into
electronics, but those plans have been compromised by the prolonged slump in
the computer and semiconductor markets.
The company admitted that its electronics-related business has been weak and
that demand for Gould's copper products has also been less than expected,
though it is confident that the liquidation of unprofitable businesses will
produce profits this year.
While Nippon Mining's sales were likely to have continued to fall, forecasts
for the current year are distorted by a merger with Kyodo Oil, scheduled for
December 1. Taking that merger into account, the company is forecasting a
pre-tax profit of Y16bn and total sales of Y1,400bn.
Mr Minoru Nagaoka, Tokyo Stock Exchange chairman, yesterday called on
Japanese companies to raise dividends and lower the minimum trading units of
their shares to entice investors back to the stock market, Reuter reports.

<TEXT>
BARRIERS between Japan's banking and securities business are to be lowered
following legislative reform yesterday allowing banks and securities houses
to enter each other's businesses.
While banks will not be allowed to enter broking - partly because of strong
opposition from the securities industry - the legislative changes symbolise
an end to prolonged debate over financial sector reforms.
They come at a tough time for Japanese financial institutions, following
sharp falls in the stock and real estate markets.
While banks are considering establishing securities subsidiaries
specialising in underwriting as early as next year, brokers, facing severe
downturn in profits, are unlikely to have the financial strength to enter
the banking arena.
The reform bills also include the establishment of a financial markets
watchdog next month. It is to be headed by Mr Toshihiro Mizuhara,
superintendent public prosecutor of the Nagoya High Public Prosecutor's
Office.
The House of Councillors also passed revisions of the Loan Business Law,
which will increase the Finance Ministry's grip on non-bank financial
institutions.
Meanwhile, the Japanese insurance industry has presented an advisory report
to the Finance Ministry pressing for deregulation Deregulation of life and
non-life insurance has lagged behind liberalisation in broking and
securities.
Insurance companies also want to enter banking and broking, and are keen to
acquire a share of the lucrative underwriting business.
The report also recommends the easing of barriers between life and non-life
industries, where both parties can sell accident, illness and nursing
insurances.
Proposals for legislative changes are expected to be presented during the
ordinary session of parliament in 1994. Although the reforms could be
implemented as early as 1995, industry officials are sceptical of an early
implementation.

FT  19 JUN 92 / International Company News: Ford, Chrysler 'lowest cost'
makers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD MOTOR and Chrysler of the US have become the world's lowest-cost car
manufacturers, helped by the fact that American vehicle parts manufacturers
have a 27 per cent cost advantage over Japanese rivals, claims a US study
released yesterday.
The report, by the independent Washington-based Economic Policy Institute,
could prove controversial.
US analysts agree that Ford and Chrysler have made great advantages over the
past few years to narrow the production cost gap with Japanese rivals, but
many believe the Japanese, and Toyota in particular, still have a
significant edge.
The study, carried out with the help of the highly-regarded Office for the
Study of Automotive Transport at the University of Michigan, estimates that
the direct cost of producing a small car is Dollars 5,415 at Ford, Dollars
5,841 at Chrysler and Dollars 6,216 at Toyota.
However, the severe problems facing General Motors, the largest US
manufacturer, are underlined by the finding that it requires Dollars 7,205
to produce a small car.
The report said one reason for this was that GM relied on outside parts
suppliers - more efficient than in-house subsidiaries - for only 30 per cent
of its supplies, compared with 50 per cent for Ford and 70 per cent for
Chrysler.
GM, which also lags the other two companies in utilisation of its factories,
is in the throes of a huge restructuring which involves both plant closures
and a rationalisation of its parts supply network to slash costs.
Other analysts said a weakness of this kind of study was that it made
comparisons in terms of currencies, which can fluctuate widely over time.
The figures showing Ford and Chrysler on top also assume that all factories
work at full capacity, and they do not include pension and healthcare costs,
and differences in costs of capital between the two countries.
The study estimates that US plants ran last year at 62 per cent of capacity,
compared with 95 per cent for Japan, adding Dollars 800 to Dollars 1,500 to
Detroit's costs per car. It also faced a Dollars 600 disadvantage because of
the high US cost of pension and healthcare benefits.
When these factors were taken into account, Toyota became the lowest-cost
producer, with Ford slipping to second place.
Mr Clyde Prestowitz, president of the policy institute and a critic of
Japan's trading practices, argued that Detroit's survival was still
threatened by factors beyond its control, and he called for action by
Washington to support the industry, including easing its welfare benefits
burden.
The study will be regarded as helpful ammunition by the auto parts industry
in its campaign to sell more to Japanese assemblers.
The US industry has long argued that it is more efficient than Japanese
rivals, but has been kept out of assemblers' plants by the keiretsu system

FOSCHINI, the South African clothing, jewellery and accessories retailer,
yesterday reported taxable profits of R168.9m (Dollars 46.9m) for the 15
months to March on turnover of R1.15bn.
This compares with pre-tax profits of R148.9m on turnover of R822m for the
previous 12 months. Annualised figures for the 15 months are not strictly
comparable because they include two calendar first quarters, traditionally
periods of low profit.
Net income for the 15 months came to R92.9m against R73.4m for the 12
months. The figure includes a first-time dividend and attributable retained
income from Foschini's 35.3 per cent holding in Oceana Investment
Corporation of South Africa. Oceana holds 34.4 per cent of Etam, the UK
fashion retailer which it failed to take over last August.
Earnings per share were 216.2 cents for the 15 months, compared with 181.2
cents for the previous year. A scrip dividend of one new share for every 83
held has been declared.
Mr Stanley Lewis, chairman, said
profits, which compare favourably with its main competitors, reflected
Foschini's strategy of catering to the broad middle market where disposable
income was increasing.
The current year had started satisfactorily and he was confident progress
would be maintained.

<TEXT>
MR LEON Charney, a former adviser to the Carter administration who may
launch a bid for United Press International, said he was considering a plan
to revive the ailing news service through public offerings to subscribers
and correspondents, AP-DJ reports. Under the plan, UPI would become a
co-operative.
Mr Charney, who recently provided Dollars 180,000 to keep UPI operating
until June 22, yesterday met in Amsterdam with a representative of the
National Postal Lottery, which may pump as much as Dollars 3.5m into UPI
under a proposed rescue plan. The foundation raises money through lottery
sales.
The Dutch foundation's efforts are being led by Mr Bob Goldner, a former UPI
executive, and Mr Julian Isherwood, a UPI journalist based in Copenhagen.
It expects a restructured UPI to expand coverage of environmental and Third
World issues.
Mr Charney said an investment by the Dutch foundation, if it materialised,
would provide funds to keep the news wire running for an extended period
while detailed plans for a public offering could be worked out.

THE HEAD of Mexico's union of telephone workers has denied reports his group
planned to sell its stake in Telmex, the Mexican telephone utility. Mr
Francisco Hernandez Juarez said yesterday the union would instead enlarge
its 2.9 per cent holding.
'In the next two months we will be seeking to buy an additional 2 per cent
of the company, and are looking for credits to make the purchase,' he said.
Telmex shares have fallen sharply over the past week on the rumours.
Banacci, which owns Mexico's largest bank, appears ready to make a planned

FT  19 JUN 92 / International Company News: O&amp;Y unveils revised plan for
restructuring of debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; York yesterday outlined a new debt-restructuring proposal which
would include extending repayments on most of its debt for five years. It
would also mean disposing of some of its Canadian properties and other
investments.
The company reaffirmed an earlier plan to convert some of its CDollars
13.5bn (USDollars 11.2bn) debt into equity. However, it continues to insist
that control remain with its existing owners, Toronto's Reichmann family.
The new proposals, which are still being discussed with key creditors, were
contained in a progress report to the Ontario court of justice.
Separately, a group of Canadian banks applied to the court to terminate
interest rate swaps with O&amp;Y. The banks argued that the value of the swaps,
which are considered an asset, is declining as interest rates fall.
O&amp;Y, however, maintains that it requires the instruments to protect it
against adverse interest rate movements.
In its submission, O&amp;Y reiterated the importance of remaining a going
concern. It warned that immediate liquidation would result in 'significant
losses to virtually all groups of creditors'. It also said common management
of its properties 'serves to increase asset values in the aggregate'.
The latest restructuring proposals call for loans to be categorised as
either convertible debt or non-convertible debt. At the end of the five-year
standstill period, convertible debt-holders would have the option of
exchanging their claims into common shares.
The company also promised to draw up annual 12-month and 24-month business
plans to be approved by an operating committee representing the creditors.
It proposed liquidating marketable securities on an orderly basis, except
for certain core holdings, including its stakes in Gulf Canada Resources,
newsprint-maker Abitibi-Price, and property developer Trizec.
Meanwhile, O&amp;Y's information officer filed his first monthly report on the
ailing developer's financial condition yesterday, and promised monthly
briefings to the company's far-flung creditors.
The report, compiled by Mr Bernard Wilson, a partner at Price Waterhouse,
will be made available only to O&amp;Y's creditors and other outsiders this
morning.
The reports stem from creditors' efforts to obtain more detailed information
since O&amp;Y filed for bankruptcy protection for its Canadian assets on May 14.
O&amp;Y handed control of the Canary Wharf project in London's Docklands to
administrators two weeks later, but its US buildings remain outside the
court orders.
The court order covers about two-thirds of O&amp;Y's CDollars 13.5bn debt.
Creditors affected by the Canadian order, including 91 banks and many
holders of publicly-traded securities, have been divided into six committees
to facilitate negotiations on the restructuring plan which O&amp;Y is now
compiling.
Mr Wilson said a PW corporate finance team was also working with O&amp;Y and the
creditors 'in a pro-active manner' on the restructuring plan.

NATIONAL Semiconductor, the Silicon valley chip manufacturer which has been
restructuring itself, yesterday reported sharply higher fourth-quarter net
earnings of Dollars 27.5m, up from Dollars 5.6m a year ago.
Mr Gilbert Amelio, president and chief executive, said the figures
represented 'the best profit performance for semiconductor operations in any
quarter in the past five years'.
Sales totalled Dollars 491.5m, compared with Dollars 444.9m, and earnings
per share worked through at 22 cents, against 3 cents.
The quarter included 14 weeks rather than the normal 13. Mr Amelio said that
taking this into account, sales and earnings still increased in the fourth
quarter, both year to year and compared with the third quarter.
Gross margins achieved the company's goal of 30 per cent, due mainly to cost
reductions from the restructuring programme.
The results were also helped by an Dollars 11m after-tax gain from patent
licensing fees.
The company said business conditions during the quarter showed strong
seasonal improvement, with worldwide bookings up substantially over the
third quarter and over the previous year's fourth quarter.
Computer peripheral bookings continued to improve and automotive orders
showed strong gains over 1991's unusually low levels.
National Semi said that it expected economic trends to improve slightly in
the coming fiscal year, 'but not enough to offset the normal seasonal
patterns in bookings and shipments'. It had entered the current quarter with
an improved backlog and had not yet seen the normal summer seasonal
slowdown.
For the full year, the company reported a net loss of Dollars 120.1m, or
Dollars 1.24 a share, on sales of Dollars 1.72bn This compared with a loss
of Dollars 151.4m, or Dollars 1.56, on sales of Dollars 1.7bn in 1991.

Matra merger
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HACHETTE, the heavily-indebted French media group, yesterday announced
details of a FFr2.8bn (Dollars 581.3m) recapitalisation package to finance
its proposed merger with Matra, one of France's largest defence companies.
Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere, the chairman of both Matra and Hachette, said that
Hachette was on course for a return to modest net profits this year - having
sustained a FFr1.93bn loss in 1991 - but it was still experiencing pressure
on operating margins.
Hachette was also under pressure because of the cost of servicing its debt,
he said. The group incurred heavy borrowings to finance an ambitious
expansion programme in the late 1980s and is trying to make disposals. Mr
Lagardere said he expected within weeks to announce the sale of Hachette's
landmark building on Boulevard St Germain in Paris for around FFr500m.
For several months Hachette, which is trying to recover from the collapse
earlier this year of La Cinq, the French TV station, has been locked in
negotiations with its shareholders and bankers over its proposed
recapitalisation. The talks include the Gan insurance group, and Credit
Lyonnais and Banque Nationale de Paris, the state-controlled banks.
At an extraordinary general meeting yesterday, Hachette secured
shareholders' consent to implement its proposals, which include issuing
FFr900m of new ordinary shares and FFr600m of convertible bonds. The
remaining FFr1.3bn will be raised by the issue of subordinated floating
notes, a form of debt that resembles equity.
Mr Lagardere said the recapitalisation should be completed by the end of
this year or early next year and that Hachette would then proceed with the
Matra merger. This merger, which Mr Lagardere claims will yield considerable
cost benefits, has been fiercely criticised in France because of the
apparent lack of synergy between the two companies.
Hachette was last year affected by the impact of the economic slowdown on
its media businesses, particularly in the US, as well as by the La Cinq
debacle.
The company managed to make operating profits of FFr636m last year, but fell
into the red chiefly due to a provision of FFr1.8bn on La Cinq.
Mr Lagardere said its markets were 'still in a recessionary phase' and that
the group may suffer another fall in operating margins in 1992. However, he
said there were signs of recovery in the US.

SPARBANKEN, the Swedish savings bank, has posted a SKr750m (Dollars 132.7m)
operating loss for the first four months of the year after loan losses
totalling SKr3.073bn, writes Robert Taylor in Stockholm.
The bank said yesterday that the deficit was in line with estimates made at
the time of the Swedish government's SKr7.3bn bail-out of Forsta Sparbanken
in April.
The Swedish savings bank industry is going through drastic change. By the
end of the year, Sparbanken will merge with 10 regional savings banks, the
Stockholm-based Forsta Sparbanken and Swedebank. The aim is to streamline
the industry by creating the largest savings bank in the country with
SKr540bn in assets.
By 1994, Sparbanken intends to cut costs by SKr2bn from a level of SKr9.5bn
at the beginning of the year in an effort to achieve a 15 per cent
profitability ratio.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEMAND for shares and warrants in STET, the Italian state-owned company
which controls the country's telecommunications activities, has almost
doubled the quantity of paper on offer.
The news, which follows the closure of the deal ahead of schedule on Tuesday
evening, will raise L707bn (Dollars 592.1m) for IRI, the cash-strapped state
holding company which controls STET.
After all warrants are exercised, IRI's stake in STET will fall to around 53
per cent of its ordinary shares and just 1 per cent of its holding stock.
IRI currently has about 69 per cent of STET's ordinary shares and 30 per
cent of the savings stock, if all outstanding warrants are exercised.
The secondary sale of equity in STET was launched on Monday. The offer was
constructed in the form of 'packets', priced at L2,020,000 apiece. Each
packet comprised 1,000 ordinary STET shares along with 50 warrants
convertible into a further 500 ordinary shares and 100 warrants convertible
into 1,000 savings shares.
Around 6,700 offers, for a total of 680,000 of the 'packets' of shares and
warrants being placed, were received, against the 350,000 packets on offer,
according to the lead-manager, Mediobanca. Some 53 per cent of the offers
had come from Italian investors and the remainder from abroad. Around 3,600
shareholders put in bids for over 215,000 packets, and will receive 175,000,
according to Mediobanca.

UNICHIPS, the privately-owned Italian company which is the country's biggest
maker of potato crisps, is expanding further in Europe with the purchase of
Crecspan, Spain's second-biggest crisps group.
The vendor is Borden, the US multinational which bought Barcelona-based
Crecspan in 1984. No price for the deal, in which Rothschild Italia advised
the purchaser, was revealed.
Unichips, controlled by Mr Alberto Vitaloni, the son of the founder, is best
known in Italy for its San Carlo brand, which has around 50 per cent of the
domestic potato crisps market. The company started operating in Spain in
1989, and the following year bought control of Flodor in France, where it is
also the market leader.
With its latest acquisition, made for cash, Unichips will have sales of
around L750bn (Dollars 628.1m) this year.

FT  19 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Photoprocess cuts LIG profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DROP in photoprocessing results caused London International Group, the
consumer products and services company which makes Durex condoms in the UK,
to report a dip in pre-tax profits from Pounds 17.4m to Pounds 16.9m in the
year to March 31.
LIG said these results reflected a good operating performance in health and
personal products but a worse than anticipated downturn in photoprocessing
services as a result of the continuing recession.
Overall turnover rose by 7.8 per cent to Pounds 398.1m (Pounds 369.2m). The
group took Pounds 22.5m of restructuring costs above the line, in line with
the new accountancy draft standard. The restated comparable exceptional
figure for the previous year was Pounds 21.9m.
LIG's photoprocessing division saw operating profits drop by more than half
to Pounds 5.9m (Pounds 12.5m) on marginally increased turnover of Pounds
119.5m (Pounds 117.3m). ColourCare continued to gain market share, but sales
were cut by the recession and profits were substantially affected.
ColourCare had seen some some volume pick-up since the year-end, but there
was little sign that the photoprocessing market was improving.
Traditionally, 60 per cent of photoprocessing volume is in the first half,
with almost 40 per cent concentrated in July, August and September, so LIG
said it was too early to make any comment on photoprocessing performance for
the year.
Health and personal products saw operating profits increase by 15.4 per cent
to Pounds 42.7m (Pounds 37m) on turnover of Pounds 278.6m (Pounds 247.7m),
up by 12.5 per cent.
LIG said the condom business worldwide continued to grow at an average
annual rate of 2 to 3 per cent, and overall the group's brands gained market
share.
As planned, Biogel surgeons' gloves came into operating profit in North
America and continental Europe. In the US, Biogel had achieved more than 15
per cent of its target market, against 6 per cent last year. Throughout the
UK and continental Europe, Biogel continued to increase its market shares.
Following last year's announcement, all primary manufacture of surgeons'
gloves had been transferred to the group's new factory in Malaysia. Closure
of the UK plant, with the loss of 650 jobs, accounted for Pounds 13.4m of
the exceptional item.
On the restated basis, earnings per share fell to 6.34p (6.86p), but the
final dividend was held at 6.25p, giving a total for the year of 9.45p
(9.25p).

265m
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERN TRENT, the Birmingham-based water and sewage company, yesterday
announced the biggest profits so far for the privatised water sector.
But the company admitted Biffa, the waste management arm acquired last year,
would not earn enough to cover its interest charges until next year at the
earliest. Severn Trent's shares fell 7p to 375p.
The company reported a 6.4 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds
265m in the year to March 31, up from Pounds 249m. The increase came from
average price rises of 15.2 per cent, held back by falling interest income
as the company invested in improved water and sewage quality.
Turnover increased to Pounds 822m (Pounds 627m), helped by price rises and
an 11-month contribution from Biffa and other non-regulated businesses.
Biffa made annualised operating profits of Pounds 12.5m, compared to the
Pounds 25m interest bill on its Pounds 212m acquisition price-tag. Mr John
Bellak, chairman, said Biffa would continue to dilute earnings this year
because of the recession. But he expressed 'no regrets' about the purchase.
Operating profits increased 32 per cent to Pounds 261m (Pounds 197m). But
interest income fell sharply from Pounds 51.5m to Pounds 4.3m. Capital
expenditure increased 48.5 per cent to Pounds 585m.
The company went from net cash of Pounds 229m to net borrowings of Pounds
170m during the year, creating gearing of 9 per cent. Mr Bellak said capital
spending has now peaked.
Earnings increased 5.7 per cent to 68.2p (64.5p). The company is
recommending a final dividend of 12.9p (11.7p) for a 19.3p (17.55p) total.
At the interim stage, Severn Trent announced a 1.5 per cent increase in
pre-tax profits to Pounds 137m (Pounds 135m) on turnover 26 per cent higher
at Pounds 395m (Pounds 313m).
Debtors increased nearly 50 per cent to Pounds 157.5m (Pounds 108.2m). About
half the increase was due to acquisitions while some customers showed a
growing reluctance to pay.
Staff numbers increased by 300 to 7,400. At Biffa, where the emphasis was
towards higher margin business, staff totals fell 180 to 1,836.
Three other water companies also reported increases yesterday:
Pre-tax profits at Essex Water for the 12 months to end-March were Pounds
18.2m against Pounds 15.7m for the previous 15 months. Turnover was Pounds
61.7m compared with Pounds 68.9m. The comparison are not meaningful because
of the change of year-end.
The final dividend is 34.3p making a total of 70.9p, payable from earnings
per share of 202p. The total dividend and earnings for the previous 15
months were 78.83p and 163p respectively.
Suffolk Water turned in pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.2m from turnover of
Pounds 14.5m. Again there are no meaningful comparisons because of the
change of year-end. Profits for the previous 15 months were Pounds 4m from
turnover of Pounds 16.3m.
Earnings per share came out at 79p and the final dividend is 21.5p for a
45.1p total. Earnings for the previous 15-month period were 72p and the
total dividend was 37.95p.
While Brockhampton Holdings, parent company of Portsmouth Water, reported a
pre-tax profit of Pounds 2.85m from turnover of Pounds 22m in the year to
end-March.
This compares with profits of Pounds 2.79m from turnover of Pounds 19.7m
last time. Earnings per share increased by 22.7 per cent to 21.1p and a
final dividend of 3.3p makes a total for the year of 4.95p.

<TEXT>
LEARMONTH &amp; Burchett Management Systems (LBMS), a computing services company
quoted on the USM and specialising in computer aided systems engineering
(CASE), returned to profit for the year ended April 30 1992 after a
disastrous 1990-91.
It made pre-tax profits of Pounds 303,000 compared with losses of Pounds
1.7m the year before. Turnover was up 10 per cent at Pounds 21.4m (Pounds
19.5m) and earnings per share worked out at 0.7p, compared with 10.5p
losses.
No dividend is being recommended. Mr Rainer Burchett, LBMS chairman, said
that the company still had Pounds 1.8m of borrowings and that it was
premature to talk of paying a dividend in 1992 although it could be possible
next year.
LBMS, established in 1977, is one of the oldest companies in the CASE area.
CASE involves methods and software technologies which make it simpler and
more efficient to write computer programmes.
LBMS had a sound business record until two years ago when a combination of
heavy spending on research and development, acquisitions that proved
difficult to digest, increased competition and the recession resulted in a
sharp decline into loss.
Mr Burchett said that the investment in research and development had
resulted in new CASE software which had been well received in the market
place. In addition cost cutting and restructuring coupled with improved
sales and marketing had resulted in a substantial improvement.
The company has a blue chip list of clients and has expanded into the US and
Australia.

FT  19 JUN 92 / UK Company News: BTR sells cables stake to partner for
Pounds 37m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BTR yesterday sold its stake in a joint venture cables business acquired
through the takeover of Hawker Siddeley, to partner Delta for Pounds 37m
cash.
Delta said the purchase of the outstanding 36 per cent minority stake was
the 'post-script' to the merger in 1988 of the two companies' cable
interests.
'We have acquired the whole of Hawker's cable business, without having to
pay a premium for it,' said Ms Alexandra Hockenhull of Delta. The purchase
would push Delta's gearing - which was 13 per cent at the end of 1991 - up
slightly.
Pre-tax profit attributable to the minority stake in Delta Crompton Cables
last year was Pounds 2.7m, Ms Hockenhull said. The net asset value of the
minority stake is Pounds 34.2m.
For BTR, the Pounds 37m should help to cut the group's weighty debt, which
last month was reported to represent about 90 per cent of shareholders'
funds. Every Pounds 25m is estimated to reduce gearing by 1 percentage
point.
The sale was sparked by BTR's Pounds 1.55bn acquisition of Hawker Siddeley,
the UK engineering group, last year. Delta had first option on the Hawker
stake in the case of a takeover. An independent valuation set the selling
price.
Delta Crompton Cables was subjected to a wide-ranging restructuring
following the merger, including closing three of the nine cable sites. 'We
will now derive 100 per cent of the rationalisation,' said Ms Hockenhull.
Delta Crompton Cables makes energy, communication and high performance
cables for the industrial and regulated electricity markets.

FT  19 JUN 92 / UK Company News: FKI profit falls 24% but sales picking up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LONG-awaited business strategy was revealed yesterday at FKI as the
electrical engineering company revealed that recession in North America and
the UK had sliced 24 per cent off pre-tax profits.
The pre-tax return fell from Pounds 40.2m to Pounds 30.5m in the year to
March 31, on sales 5 per cent down at Pounds 739.1m. About 87 per cent of
FKI's business is in the UK and North America.
Mr Bob Beeston, the former BTR executive brought in to revive FKI as group
managing director, said the company would boost margins through price
increases and cost-cutting, rather than chase volume. The aim was to get a
10 per cent return on sales, compared with a current 4 per cent.
Mr Whalley was bullish about the group's prospects. He said there were signs
that the US economy - which represents about 40 per cent of FKI profits -
was beginning to pick up.
Order intake in four of the group's five businesses - the exception being
process control - was between 15 and 30 per cent ahead in the first two
months of the current year.
The final dividend is held at 1.3p. Added to the halved interim the total
was 2.3p (3.3p). Earnings per share fell from 6.71p to 4.88p.
COMMENT
The addition of Mr Beeston and his BTR cohorts has done much to restore
faith in this company. The revival of the US economy promises good rewards,
with the hardware business sitting at the front end of the cycle, while
President Bush's negotiations with the Japanese are already benefitting the
transplant business. The cost-cutting programme should bring some Pounds 5m
in savings next year, and help eliminate loss-makers. Forecasts are between
Pounds 36m and Pounds 40m, which on yesterday's price of 77p leaves a p/e of
11 to 13 times. That looks pretty cheap considering the sector average of
more than 14 times.

FT  19 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Manweb advances to Pounds 95m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANWEB, the Chester-based regional electricity company, raised pre-tax
profits by 61 per cent from Pounds 58.9m to Pounds 94.7m in the year to
March 31.
Like the other regional electricity companies, Manweb earned most of its
bumper profit from price increases in April 1991, which were exceptionally
high to compensate for undercharging the year before.
In addition, Manweb said, the comparable profits were depressed by
exceptional costs. Excluding these effects, profits would have increased by
only 26 per cent.
Earnings per share rose by 60 per cent to 58.7p (36.7p) and by 71 per cent
on the pro forma figure of 34.3p. The dividend is raised by 14 per cent to
18.25p for the year, via a final of 12.8p (11.2p).
The advance in operating profit to Pounds 93.2m (Pounds 56.8m) was earned in
the core distribution business, which increased its contribution by 83 per
cent to Pounds 106.3m.
This was despite a 0.75 per cent decrease in units of electricity sold, as
recession depressed industrial sales.
The company saved Pounds 10.2m in operating costs, mainly by shedding 1,000
jobs, or nearly 18 per cent of its workforce.
In the supply business, however, an unforeseen Pounds 11m increase in costs
gave a loss of Pounds 5.3m, rather than the Pounds 6m profit the company had
expected.
The retail division lost Pounds 1m, about the same as the previous year, and
contracting was also loss-making.
Manweb's strong cash flow paid for capital investment of more than Pounds
60m, slightly down on the previous year. Gearing was down from 27.9 per cent
to 13.3 per cent, and the return on capital was 19.6 per cent on an historic
cost basis.
Continued cost cutting is expected to save between Pounds 3m and Pounds 4m
via about 150-200 more job losses. Both the supply and retail businesses are
expected to move into profit, and electricity sales are forecast to grow by
about 1 per cent.
COMMENT
Manweb rather disingenuously based its demonstration that its underlying
profit growth was only 26 per cent on actual tax and interest figures for
the year to March 1991, rather than the pro forma figures which should be
the basis of an accurate comparison of the two years. In fact, underlying
growth is closer to 35 per cent.
That said, Manweb's defence against the regulator was very sound. It has
slashed costs dramatically, and has detailed plans for investment in the
core business - capital expenditure is due to rise to maybe Pounds 85m next
year. The only worry is that a company with a reputation for prudence should
have failed - unlike East Midlands and Norweb - to foresee the increase in
charges that pushed the supply business into loss. The City will be hoping
that it fulfils its hopes of turning this and the retail business around
next year.
The company has forecast real dividend growth of 5-7 per cent in the period
to 1995, as this year's profits were a one-off. Analysts predict pre-tax
profits of Pounds 105m-Pounds 110m for the year to March 1993, putting the
company on a prospective p/e of about 5.1.

FT  19 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Shanks &amp; McEwan pleases City with 30% rise
to Pounds 31.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHANKS &amp; MCEWAN, the waste management company, yesterday reported a 30 per
cent increase in profits, after a full year's contribution from Rechem, the
hazardous waste company it acquired last year.
The final months of the year were, however, severely hit by recession with
volumes of the highest margin wastes particularly affected.
The jump in pre-tax profits from Pounds 23.9m to Pounds 31.1m on sales 24
per cent higher at Pounds 145.8m nevertheless pleased the market, which had
been anticipating a poorer performance, and the shares rose 9p to 207p.
Earnings per share fell from 13.2p to 11.9p and the the final dividend is
maintained at 3.44p, giving a total of 5.7p, up 3.6 per cent on the year.
Mr Peter Runciman, chairman, said that while profit margins had been eroded
the longer-term prospects were 'extremely encouraging.'
Total tonnage handled in the waste division rose by 2 per cent but margins
were eroded and its profits contribution fell from Pounds 12.65m to Pounds
12.55m.
The environmental services division, which includes Rechem, increased
tonnage handled by 13 per cent but processing cost rises were not fully
recovered and profits rose only 10 per cent to Pounds 9.54m.
The technical services, or waste treatment division, increased sales by 18
per cent but profits were only marginally up at Pounds 3.59m.
The construction division increased its contribution from Pounds 1.72m to
Pounds 2.67m.
There was also a Pounds 3.8m one off increase in debt from the Inland
Revenue's request for corporation tax payments to be accelerated.
COMMENT
Shanks &amp; McEwan used to be seen as the Rolls-Royce of a racy industry with
equally racy ratings. Then last year the sector lost some of its glister,
not because its green credentials faded, but because the markets belatedly
realised waste volumes and profits were not recession proof. Nevertheless,
longer term Shanks is a company that will reap the benefit of increasingly
stringent environmental legislation. While the waste treatment division
could still do with some bolstering, its landfill sites have relatively
exclusive market positions and the Rechem acquisition has brought a vital
presence in hazardous waste. But growth will only resume rapidly once the
economy begins to move again. Shanks's costs are largely fixed and there is
therefore little prospect of further cost cutting to boost earnings
dramatically this year. Pre-tax profits are forecast not much higher than
this year's Pounds 31.1m, giving about 12p of earnings again, and puts
Shanks, in the absence of recovery, on a correctly priced 17.3 multiple.

FT  19 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Brokers downgrade profit forecast for MFI
Furniture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COUNTY NatWest Securities, the stockbroker, has cut its profit forecast for
MFI Furniture, the retail group coming to the market next month.
The issue is being handled by County NatWest's merchant banking side, but
the securities division is acting independently in writing research.
County NatWest Securities is now forecasting a trading profit of Pounds 86m
for the year to April 1993, a reduction from an estimate of Pounds 100m made
before the pathfinder prospectus was issued a week ago. The forecast
represents a rise of 17.3 per cent over the Pounds 73.3m reported for the
1991-92 financial year.
Despite the reduced forecast, the broker still regards the shares as 'one of
the more attractive and safer recovery stocks in the sector'. It says its
1993 forecast indicates a price of 145p, and advises clients to buy a full
weighting in the shares at up to 150p. At that price the market value of the
group would be Pounds 872m.
The pathfinder prospectus indicated that the group's sales were currently
flat. This caused the broker to cut its prediction for sales growth in the
current financial year from 10 per cent to 6 per cent. In turn that led to
the lower trading profit forecast.
County NatWest Securities is forecasting pre-tax profits of Pounds 77m,
excluding exceptional charges of Pounds 26m relating to interest on the
group's debt before the flotation and a bonus being paid to management. It
also forecasts earnings per share of 8.9p, which would be an increase of
18.7 per cent over the pro-forma figure of 7.5p for 1991-92 shown in the
pathfinder prospectus.

<TEXT>
GEI International achieved progress in the second half, but not enough to
match the previous year's result. The pre-tax outcome for the year to March
31 came to Pounds 3.12m, compared with Pounds 5.57m, on sales little changed
at Pounds 77.94m.
As in the first half, when profits came to only Pounds 511,000, the special
steels activities were hit by the UK recession. Steels suffered a loss of
Pounds 0.98m for the year, compared with profits of Pounds 1.3m previously.
Packaging machinery and processing machinery lifted their contributions to
Pounds 3.3m (Pounds 2.84m) and Pounds 1.58m (Pounds 1.56m) respectively.
Net interest paid rose to Pounds 774,000 (Pounds 123,000). Earnings declined
to 6.7p (9.7p). The final dividend of 4.85p makes an unchanged 7.32p total.

Widney, the Birmingham-based engineering group, continued its trend of

Pounds 97,000 in the six months to March 31.
Turnover declined slightly from Pounds 10m to Pounds 9.69m and at the

(Pounds 1.62m).
The interest charge for the current six months was reduced to Pounds 411,000

(nil) related to the costs of an aborted acquisition.
Losses per share were reduced to 0.33p (0.89p).

FT  19 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Lookers halved to Pounds 615,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits of Lookers, the Manchester-based motor dealer and
agricultural machinery group, were halved, from Pounds 1.23m to Pounds
615,000, in the half year to end-March. Turnover declined by Pounds 19.7m to
Pounds 154.4m.
Mr Ken Martindale, chairman, said the results of the businesses operated by
the group had variously affected the economic difficulties referred to in
his last review.
Profits on car sales were reduced against the background of a national
market which was down by more than 13 per cent on the previous year and 35
per cent on three years ago, he said. However, profitability of service and
parts remained steady.
Results from the caravan business deteriorated slightly, although contract
hire profits showed a considerable increase. Car delivery and van
bodybuilding also improved.
The interest charge fell to Pounds 3.14m (Pounds 4.3m). Gearing has been cut
from 115 per cent to 107 per cent.
Losses per share were 0.9p (2p earnings), while the interim dividend is
unchanged at 2p.

FT  19 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Brent Walker deeper in loss at Pounds 387m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KEN Scobie, chief exec-utive of Brent Walker, said that yesterday's
results were not as bad in cash terms as they looked.
Although there was a pre-tax loss of Pounds 387.2m (Pounds 122.7m), Pounds
157.8m of the Pounds 235.8m interest charge was converted into term debt.
The interest charge reflected the impact of higher interest rates imposed by
the banks and a full year of borrowings taken on in 1990.
Also the profits were struck after provisions for the fall in value of
properties and other assets of Pounds 142.5m (Pounds 97.7m).
However, the group has not written down the value of Pounds 1.1bn of
property assets which are being retained for the long term. These would be
worth 'significantly' less if they were revalued now but the directors do
not expect the fall in value to be permanent.
Group sales were 10 per cent lower at Pounds 1.58bn and operating profits
were down 55 per cent to Pounds 48.4m.
After tax of Pounds 7.26m (Pounds 19.8m) there were extraordinary charges of
Pounds 15.8m (Pounds 216m) relating to businesses being sold.
The William Hill betting division suffered a fall in sales from Pounds 1.5bn
to Pounds 1.4bn, which Mr Scobie said was a remarkably good performance
given the chain's bias towards the south east of England. However, a fall in
turnover has a geared effect onoperating profits, he said, which fell from
Pounds 57.1m to Pounds 45.4m. William Hill had had a better start to the
current year, he said.
Sales by the public houses division fell from Pounds 139.8m to Pounds 124.2m
and profits from Pounds 20m to Pounds 13.4m. Within that the Pubmaster chain
of pubs held its profits but other businesses weakened.
Mr Scobie said he expected the chain to total 3,000 pubs by the end of this
year, and he had a longer-term aim to reach 4,000 or 4,500. Rapid
improvements in trade were being seen in pubs which had been refurbished.
Profits from other activities, such as property development, were Pounds
1.1m (Pounds 34.9m).
The group said its claim for a substantial cut in the price of William Hill,
which it bought from Grand Metropolitan in 1989 for Pounds 685m, had now
gone to an independent expert. Brent Walker has still not paid the final
Pounds 50m of the purchase price which is accruing interest.
The group is preparing its accounts on a going concern basis. This depends
on Grand Metropolitan not demanding payment in full of the Pounds 50m and
interest, and on the group operating within the terms set by its banks in
the restructuring.

FT  19 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Enlarged Stirling more than doubles to
Pounds 2.44m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STIRLING GROUP, which acquired fellow clothing manufacturer Ritz Design
Group for about Pounds 19.2m at the end of 1991, more than doubled pre-tax
profits to Pounds 2.44m in the year to March 31.
The rise, from Pounds 1.06m, was struck on turnover 72 per cent ahead at
Pounds 68.2m. Reasons for the advance, said Mr Peter Sheldon, chairman, were
several.
The integration of the Fiona Rose nightwear business, acquired in 1990, with
Bentwood's existing nightwear operation, played a part. Also important were
improved manufacturing performances in the factories, tight cost controls
across the group and the first-time contributions from Fiona Rose, E
Gifford, the casualwear distributor acquired in July, and Ritz.
Some 70 per cent of both Ritz's and Stirling's clothing output was supplied
to Marks and Spencer. Before the Ritz buy, Stirling had laid off more than
200 of its workforce, and rationalisation of the expanded group had entailed
the loss of a further 495 jobs, mainly from the closure of four smaller
Bentwood factories.
Some Pounds 1.78m had been set aside from reserves to cover the
rationalisation costs. The accent was now on consolidation and no more job
cuts were expected, Mr Sheldon said.
Earnings rose from 2.23p to 3.08p, heavily diluted by the increase of the
shares in issue from 37m to 86m after the Ritz buy. The proposed final
dividend is lifted 15 per cent to 1.15p - 'especially pleasing for the Ritz
shareholders who have only been with us three months', said Mr Sheldon - for
a total of 1.65p (1.5p).

FT  19 JUN 92 / GPA Group's Aborted Global Issue: Market takes the
cancellation in its stride
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOST cheerful interpretation that analysts could put on the sudden
cancellation of the GPA Group flotation yesterday was that it removed one
source of supply of new stock.
Money earmarked for the issue could be diverted elsewhere in the equity
market, which is beginning to suffer indigestion from the weight of new
paper being sold.
But as less optimistic strategists put it, hardly any UK investors had
earmarked cash for GPA anyway.
The announcement that the issue had been pulled at the last moment was
certainly a factor in the 35.7 point fall in the FT-SE 100 index to 2,562.7.
But the market had already coped with the postponement of the 3i flotation
until next year. Strategists feel the stock market has more to worry about
than delayed flotations.
Overnight falls in New York and Tokyo, due to pressure on corporate profits,
were more frequently cited as reasons for nervousness in the UK market
yesterday.
The dampening of hopes for economic growth in the UK and the prospect of
further downgradings of earnings estimates were also viewed as more serious
concerns.
As one strategist put it: 'GPA barely makes it into the top 10 of reasons to
be bearish.' The market could become more concerned, though, if there were
suggestions that the cancellation of the flotation put GPA's financial
position into doubt.
A well-publicised, last-minute, cancellation like GPA's - unlike 3i's issue
which was still some way from the market - cannot help sentiment towards
other issues in the pipeline, but it may have little real impact. The UK
market is experiencing the greatest run of new issues, apart from
privatisations, since the 1987 stock market crash.
Wellcome Trust, the majority shareholder in Wellcome, the pharmaceuticals
group, which is planning a Pounds 4bn secondary offering, said that GPA's
cancellation 'in no way changes or affects our plans.' However, Wellcome's
shares fell 26p to 919p yesterday.
Like GPA, the Wellcome sale is a big international offering. But corporate
financiers agreed the GPA flotation was so distinct from the Wellcome issue
that the latter should not be seriously affected.
They noted that Wellcome's sale structure was more flexible than GPA's had
been, allowing it to direct shares to areas of stronger demand. Further, the
group is more readily comprehensible to investors, and is part of a
well-researched sector of the market.
Wellcome is also putting a great effort into educating investors through a
massive international road show. And since it is a secondary offering, it is
being priced against an existing share quote, whereas GPA's pricing was a
much more difficult exercise.
Other issues in train, such as MFI and Kenwood, are not expected to be
seriously damaged by GPA's decision. More worrying for them is the general
fall in the stock market over recent weeks, which will be reducing the
prices vendors can expect for the shares.

FT  19 JUN 92 / GPA Group's Aborted Global Issue: Advisers learn a costly
lesson from success-related deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GLOBAL offer for GPA Group's aborted Dollars 800m (Pounds 432m)
flotation was billed as the first of its kind. For the advisers involved it
proved to be the most expensive
None of the investment banks engaged for the flotation, which included
Nomura International as global co-ordinator, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs
and Salomon Brothers in the US and Schroders and BZW in the UK, will be paid
a penny. Their fees were success related. Failure will have cost them dear:
during the past year GPA absorbed a bigger chunk of their time than any
other planned flotation.
Only Hambro Magan, the company's permanent financial adviser, is on a
retainer.
Some of the advisers yesterday said, that after having done so much work on
the issue, they would like to establish an arrangement whereby they might be
put on a retainer for future advice.
Mr Maurice Foley, GPA's chief executive, said he was still looking at all
the options, including whether it was possible to seek a public listing.
But, as to retainers, it was too early to tell. All he could say was that
technically all of the advisers' contracts have expired and so they could be
seen to have 'stepped down'. Although he made it clear that they had neither
been fired nor resigned.
The listing was to have been simultaneous in New York, London, and Dublin,
with a placement of shares in Japan. There was to be a public offer by
tender to give the issue maximum flexibility.
Instead of asking US banks to underwrite a fixed price without knowing the
demand - something which they are increasingly reluctant to do - lead
managers sought to build up a book of orders before pricing the shares.
There was a price range of Dollars 10 to Dollars 12, following a 1-for-1
scrip issue, but the actual price would not be fixed until the investment
bankers had clear figures of demand in each country.
Each market was given an indicative amount; 30m shares to the UK, 20m to the
US, 15m to Japan and 15m to the rest of the world. The competitive tensions
between the different markets was expected to ensure demand.
As late as last Sunday evening the advisers believed that the issue would be
oversubscribed. This was because they had a better response from retail
investors than institutions.
Indeed, only 10 days ago the advisers leaked the fact that they had
persuaded the company to issue another 5m shares. 'I am not into
recriminations, but we were advised to increase the number of shares on
offer (from 80m to 85m) 10 days before we had to pull the issue,' Mr Foley
said yesterday.
The issue collapsed when it became clear on Monday that there was no
institutional demand from the US. According to Mr Foley that affected
sentiment in the UK and the rest of the world.
'The complexity of the the bookbuilding issue,' said Mr Foley, 'with one
domino leaning on the other, may not have been the right way.'

away from deal - Demand falls short by 30m shares leaving financial advisers
bitterly disappointed

<TEXT>
DEMAND for GPA Group's shares fell well short of the goal set by the
aircraft lessor's financial advisers, with UK and US institutional investors
shying away from the deal.
Originally, GPA had hoped to sell 80m shares worldwide, with 30m in the UK
and Ireland, 20m in the US, 15m internationally (continental Europe, the
Middle East and Asia), and 15m in Japan.
Instead, by early yesterday morning, the financial advisers to the issue
found that there was only demand for about 50m shares, with nearly half of
that - 22.93m - coming from retail investors in Japan.
Although some of the other financial advisers remained sceptical about the
strength of Japanese demand for the shares, Nomura, the global co-ordinator
for the issue, denied its managed investment funds would have been used to
mop up the shares. It said that two-thirds of the demand from Japanese
retail investors was new money.
Demand from international investors, particularly Swiss, German and Middle
Eastern institutions, was healthy, amounting to 13.3m shares. However, in
the UK and Ireland demand amounted to only 7.5m shares, while in the US
there was only a demand for 6.5m shares. In both cases, the institutions
were notable by their absence, according to the financial advisers involved
in the flotation.
One adviser said: 'US institutional demand was disappointingly small -
though maybe it would have been better if there had been more time to sell
the issue.'
With such a low proportion of institutions willing to buy, financial
advisers pointed out there was not a substantial enough investor base for
the deal to go ahead, and expressed concern that the retail investors could
have quickly sold out if the issue had gone ahead.
Financial advisers and investors yesterday provided plenty of reasons why
GPA had not proved a popular stock. Many pointed to the current difficulties
faced by the US airline industry, general market conditions, and the
reluctance of the US fund managers to commit themselves to the issue before
seeing the response of the UK investors.
One of the advisers to the issue complained: 'There wasn't any single issue
which arose, but it was partly the fact that the US investors seemed to be
looking to the UK for a lead, while the UK investors looked to the US for a
lead.'
Another of GPA's financial advisers blamed conditions in the US market for
IPOs (initial public offerings). 'Several recent (IPO)issues have
subsequently traded at below the price offered, which doesn't look good.'
GPA's rapid growth and the domineering style of its senior management made
some potential investors wary. The head of investments at one of the UK's
biggest insurers said: 'People are very nervous about these large
entrepreneurial businesses - it hasn't been a good year for them.'
In addition, GPA's high level of gearing and the complex financial structure
of the group put off the more cautious investors. 'It's the sort of business
that's very difficult to understand,' said one. 'It's like a pyramid of
cards. If something goes wrong, the whole lot could come down.'
The airline industry analyst at one of the largest US mutual funds, which
has Dollars 70bn under management, gave several reasons for turning down the
GPA offer. 'GPA badly needed access to public equity finance, which is not
the best motivation for a global share offering,' he said. 'Investors were
unnerved by the air of urgency.' He added an assortment of further reasons
for remaining cautious including:- The cyclical peak in leasing margins and
residual aircraft values has already been reached against a background of
decline in the airline industry as a whole.
It was 'common knowledge' as early as last year that Air Canada and Air
Lingus wanted to liquidate their holdings in GPA, and the stock was touted
around the US. GPA's financial strength was questionable. Total debt rose
from Dollars 2.7bn in 1991 to Dollars 4.1bn in 1992. Gearing rose from 240
per cent to 330 per cent.
The company is commited to raising Dollars 11.9bn to fund aircraft purchases
to the year 2000, with a further Dollars 9.1bn required if it exercises
options on aircraft. Lines to meet these funding needs are not in place.
Lease financing from Japanese banks, the engine of the business in the
1980s, has dried up. This could lead to an increase in on GPA's cost of
funds.
GPA's profitability was already in decline. Upward pressure on funding costs
will accelerate this.
Most of GPA's customers were not among the top league airlines, so its
exposure to credit risk is substantial.
The failure of the issue has clearly been a bitter disappointment to many of
the financial advisers concerned, particularly Nomura given that it was the
company's first mandate as global co-ordinator for an equity deal outside
Japan.

FT  19 JUN 92 / GPA Group's Aborted Global Issue: Debt still accessible, but
more expensive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FAILURE of GPA Group's share sale leaves the group facing an increase in
its cost of borrowing - though financiers said yesterday that it would still
have access to debt.
The likely rise in borrowing costs was signalled yesterday as Standard &amp;
Poor's, the US rating agency, placed GPA under review for a possible
downgrade. Moody's Investors Service, the other big US agency, is already
reviewing GPA for downgrading.
The group currently carries a Baa1 credit rating from Moody's, one notch
lower than S&amp;P and only two notches above the 'speculative' grades shunned
by most investors.
Mr Phillip Baggaley, credit analyst with S&amp;P in New York, said: 'Following a
period of rapid development, GPA does need an injection of equity. Failure
to complete the share offering will weaken the balance sheet going forward,
although there is no sign of any cash or liquidity problem.'
GPA has relied until now on three main sources of debt finance: banks, bonds
and securitisation (under which it has sold bonds with the backing of
aircraft leases as security). It has also succeeded in selling shares in a
number of private placements. One banker said: 'They have tried all the
avenues: no one particular form of finance has been enough for them. This
will make it a bit more difficult.'
GPA's main banking facility is a Dollars 2.075bn syndicated credit line
negotiated with a group of 73 banks in 1987. Other lines include a Dollars
325m interim facility signed in September last year, falling due for
repayment in December 1993 and March 1994.
Although these committed bank lines are secure, banks are unlikely to extend
additional credit.
GPA made its first public bond offering at the end of last year, a Dollars
500m seven-year issue in the US market, and has placed bonds and preference
shares privately with institutions several times. While US institutional
investors may have been unwilling to commit equity capital to GPA, it has
raised substantial debt finance in the US. Yesterday however, trading in its
bonds had dried up in New York. Dealers at US investment banks were
unwilling to quote a price on the debt.
The US market has also been a source of short-term liquidity for GPA via its
Dollars 250m commercial paper programme, set up in March 1990. The
prospectus said GPA had on average Dollars 84m commercial paper outstanding
at any time. S&amp;P said yesterday its short-term commercial paper rating for
GPA would not be reviewed.
Securitisation remains one of the group's best chances of raising further
debt in the near future. Last week, GPA made the first issue of securitised
aircraft leases.
Under the issue, 14 aircraft leases were placed in a special purpose company
which then issued bonds. The cash flow from the leases is used to pay
bondholders.
Similar techniques are well established in other areas of the financial
markets: credit card debt and mortgages are often securitised in the US.
The special purpose company which owns the aircraft leases and issued the
bonds is 'ring-fenced' and should be immune from any financial difficulties
at GPA. The price of last week's bonds were barely affected by yesterday's
news.
Analysts said that the availability of securitised finance depended on the
health of the airline industry. If charter companies leasing the aircraft
default, bondholders will only continue to receive payments if the aircraft
can be repossessed and either leased or sold.
That means that securitised bonds look a less attractive investment if
airlines and charter operators are in financial difficulty, if income from
aircraft leases falls, or if the residual value of commercial aircraft is
depressed.

FT  19 JUN 92 / GPA Group's Aborted Global Issue: General Ryan loses the
battle of the bulge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHANNON headquarters of GPA looks more like the branch office of a small
software company than the nerve centre of a worldwide business.
Its main operations room, however, resembles the war games room of a
military headquarters.  Maps, charts and data can be instantly called up
fromm blinking banks of computers on to three movie screens. Information on
every jet manufactured in the western world - maintenance history, owner,
technical data - can be shown in seconds.
Simultaneously, maps can be displayed showing the locations of individual
aircraft types, beside charts of the latest exchange the world's main
financial centres.  The locations of GPA's 100-odd marketing agents in the
field can be superimposed, and game plans drawn up.
Here the company's executives meet every Monday morning to discuss strategy.
 Chariman Tony Ryan, who started GPA with Dollars 50,000 in 1975, does not
tolerate excuses for missed meetings.
The grandson of a station master, and son of a train driver, 56-year old
Ryan started with Aer Lingus as a dispatcher at Shannon airport when he was
19.  Quickly moving up through the ranks, he discovered there was money in
jet aircraft leasing when he leased two 747s for Aer Lingus in the
mid-1970s.
Guinness Peat, the merchant banker, and Aer Lingus, helped him set up GPA,
providing 90 per cent of the capital.  The company initially earned
commissions by placing one airline's surplus aircraft with those short of
jets.
Since 1987, he has built a star-studded cast of non-executive directors,
including: Nigel Lawson, former UK Chancellor, Garrett Fitzgerald, former
Irish prime minister, Sir John Harvey Jones, chairman of The Economist,
Peter Sutherland, chairman of AIB Group and former EC Commissioner, and
Shinroku Morohashi, president of Mitsubishi.
Today, 'the business of GPA is turning airplanes into attractive financial
assets and selling them to investors,' says Mr Ken Holden, GPA's chief
strategist.  Its 300 employees - about a third of whom are abroad at any one
time doing just that - produced a profit of US Dollars 279m in the last
financial year, almost trebled in five years.
GPA's rapid growth put it on the verge of becoming Ireland's biggest
company.  Had it been floated, GPA would have accounted for 20 per cent of
the Dublin stock market capitalisation.
Mr Ryan's implacable drive and his creation of a major international
business from such humble beginnings, has won him admirers, but also
detractors.  One Dublin banker said yesterday: 'He has been very arrogant
with the institutions, and there are probably more than a few people
laughing up their sleeves at the moment.'
As Mr Maurice Foley, GPA's chief executive said recently, leasing 'is a very
cold, unsentimental business, even in Ireland'.

hoped to reduce stakes

<TEXT>
IRISH institutional investors and shareholders that had together planned to
dispose of some 6.5m shares in yesterday's combined offering in GPA Group,
were unwilling to comment on the company's surprise decision to withdraw the
offer.
But there was widespread unhappiness elsewhere in Dublin. 'The signals in
the London market had been there for weeks,' one banker said.
'The failure of the offer has a lot to do with GPA's own arrogance. GPA was
forcing the pace the whole time over the price of the offer. You can't push
institutions uphill, and GPA weren't prepared to recognise that. For years
they have been promising a public offer, but then they kept turning to the
institutions and asking them to keep their holdings for another year. They
have lost a lot of friends like that'.
Although some existing GPA shareholders were due to reduce their stakes,
institutions and retail investors had been expected to buy a total of
between Dollars 30m (Pounds 16.2m) and Dollars 40m of new shares in Dublin.
As a result, Irish institutions would have shown a net increase of about
Dollars 20m in their holdings.
Mr Mike Moroney of Goodbody stockbrokers said a number of the larger
institutions already holding GPA stock were looking to reduce their
exposure, as once floated GPA would have represented 20 per cent of the
Dublin stock market's market capitalisation.
He said that the target exposure to GPA as a percentage of their Irish
market portfolios that the institutions were aiming at was about 6 per cent.
'Some would have been wanting to reduce their level to that, others would
have been looking to get in', he said.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Mario Conde walks through fire yet again: The bank chairman
who became a media magnate after a boardroom coup in Madrid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mario Conde has just infuriated Madrid's close-knit financial community with
yet another example of his ability to walk through fire.
On Wednesday the 42-year-old chairman of Banesto, one of Spain's biggest
banks, became a media magnate when he engineered the takeover of a
television channel and a daily newspaper. Antena-3 TV was taken over in a
swift, Banesto-financed Dollars 100m (Pounds 54m) move by Mr Conde, Mr
Rupert Murdoch, the Australian-born publisher, and a Madrid publisher
friend, Mr Antonio Asensio.
Mr Conde has learned quickly to do his business the way most of Spain does -
with his friends. He first bounded on to the financial stage in 1987 when he
and a friend sold their bulk chemicals producer to Montedison for Pta65bn
(Pounds 355m). With the proceeds they bought their way on to the Banesto
board just as the bank was being threatened with a takeover and Banesto's
rattled board made him president within days of his arrival.
Since January 1988, Mr Conde has become easily the most controversial
personality in Spain, making enemies as easily as he holds on to his
friends. He rudely cleared Banesto's board of its venerable old shareholders
and set himself the almost impossible task of untangling the bank from the
cross-holdings that linked it to a vast industrial empire.
The government openly dislikes him, not least because the media has decided
he may become Spain's first democratically elected conservative prime
minister if Mr Felipe Gonzalez ever decides to retire.
Mr Gonzalez criticises him in public. The Finance Ministry stopped him
selling Banesto's insurance subsidiary offshore and, when he finally
separated Banesto's industries from the bank and merged them into an
industrial corporation, it allowed him only a fraction of the tax waiver
permitted by the law on revalued assets. The Bank of Spain last year
threatened to challenge Banesto's accounts for not passing portfolio losses
through profits, but backed off.
Earlier this month he stoked those fires by calling for a referendum on the
Maastricht Treaty, to the fury of the government, and last month he was
attacked at a shareholder's meeting by BP, which claimed he had reneged on a
deal to buy back Banesto shares owned by an oil refiner he sold in 1991.
Antena-3 TV may be his best means of defending himself from public attack.
But to be effective, Antena-3, the least successful of three commercial
channels licensed in 1989, needs to improve its ratings radically. To do
that, Mr Murdoch's experience and his US and UK programming will be vital.
However, anyone trying to remove Mr Conde from Banesto risks causing great
damage to the institution at the same time. And the Banesto group is
troubled. After creating his industrial corporation, Mr Conde had wanted to
float some of it for around Dollars 800m. The invasion of Kuwait collapsed
the markets, saddling him with industries accounting for 1 per cent of
Spanish gross domestic product in an economy the government was trying to
cool down.
It has succeeded, and so Banesto's industrial profits plummeted 48 per cent
to Pta12.6bn last year. Unable to float the corporation, he is selling it
piecemeal: Petromed to BP last year; the insurer Union y Fenix into a joint
venture with AGF. Industrial affiliates' profits fell 76 per cent on average
in 1991. As a result consolidated (bank and industrial) profits fell 7.3 per
cent to Pta52.3bn in 1991. For the right price, all the companies are for
sale.
At the bank itself, he has managed to sustain asset growth through extremely
aggressive lending. Last year Banesto's lending grew 50 per cent faster than
the banking sector. This might backfire as bad debts rise to record levels
and the investors have cut Banesto's stock market capitalisation by 30 per
cent to around Dollars 270bn.
But, says Mr Joaquin Tamames of the corporate analysts Axel Group, the
banking business is coming good. 'Over the last three years consolidated
operating profits have increased remarkably and the bank is containing
costs.' Banesto bank profits rose 14 per cent last year to Pta45.6bn and
consolidated group fee income from banking services rose some 70 per cent to
Pta54bn.
Mr Conde is, nevertheless, constantly on a knife edge and he deals with it
by running at trouble rather than away from it. Three months ago he signed a
deal with the Count of Godo, the founder of Antena-3 TV, to take stakes in
the television channel and Mr Godo's rich newspaper, La Vanguardia, in
Barcelona. Criticised by the government and journalists, Mr Godo hastily
pulled out of the deal.
On Wednesday he learned a little about crossing Mr Conde and was toppled
from his presidency of Antena-3. One of the next chapters in this adventure
might be a government-inspired attempt to find someone to take over Banesto.
The stock is cheap with the shares yielding about 20 per cent more than the
banking average, but local buyers are scarce and Mr Conde knows the last
thing Madrid wants is another foreigner swallowing a large slice of Spain's
economy.

FT  19 JUN 92 / ICI warns that signs of rise in UK demand have petered out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPERIAL Chemical Industries, the British chemicals giant, yesterday warned
analysts that signs of an upturn in UK demand during late March and early
April had petered out.
Mr Ronnie Hampel, chief operating officer, told analysts during a seminar
that the company's caution during the first quarter about prospects for the
rest of the year had been justified.
ICI's shares closed down 36p at Pounds 12.35.
The good few weeks at the end of March and beginning of April had proved to
be restocking. There had been no sign of an upturn in April and May, said Mr
Hampel.
The results of industrial chemical operations were likely to be lower than
last year, he warned.
Only in the US had there been signs of an upturn and even there it had been
weak.
'Any improvements will be the result of self-help,' he said.
'We can only hope rather than expect an economic upturn to help us in the
second half of the year.' He said that, by the end of the second quarter,
restructuring had led to annualised savings of Pounds 250m.
Analysts yesterday downgraded their forecasts explaining that ICI's first
half was always stronger than the second.
Previous estimates of full-year profits had ranged from about Pounds 900m to
Pounds 930m.
After downgrading they were between Pounds 830m and Pounds 875m.
Some analysts were also preparing downgrades for other bulk chemicals
groups.
Agrochemicals had also proved disappointing, said Mr Hampel. Wet, cold
weather in Europe and the US mid-west had meant second-quarter results would
be lower than last year.
Concerns in France about the EC's Common Agricultural Policy reforms had led
to slower sales.
Credit in eastern Europe was also proving a problem.
Analysts, who had expected up to 10 per cent growth from agrochemicals,
believe the division could make less this year than 1991.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Yorkshire and Tyne Tees agree TV merger: Deal to create
third-largest independent TV company seen as forerunner to industry
consolidation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YORKSHIRE Television and Tyne Tees Television, two northern England
companies that won independent television franchises last year, yesterday
announced terms of a merger.
A recommended offer from Yorkshire values the Tyne Tees share capital at
Pounds 30.4m and the deal has been approved in principle by the Independent
Television Commission.
Such mergers were not expected until after the ITC's formal moratorium on
non-recommended bids was lifted in January 1994. But yesterday's deal is
seen as a forerunner of the consolidation likely to occur among the
companies that won franchises last year.
At Westminster, Mr Robert Maclennan, Liberal Democrat home affairs
spokesman, urged the government to review the Broadcasting Act with a view
to tightening ownership rules. 'When the Broadcasting Act went through
parliament, the then minister in charge, David Mellor, argued strongly
against a regional ITV company taking over a neighbouring TV company,' he
said.
He predicted the merger would 'destabilise' ITV 'as larger groups are formed
to compete effectively for advertising'.
Yorkshire and Tyne Tees were among the highest bidders for franchises last
year and put their finances under some strain, analysts say.
The merger would make the combined group the third-largest independent
television company behind Thames and Central.
The all-share offer involves 17 new Yorkshire shares for every 10 Tyne Tees
shares, valuing each at 292p. Yorkshire last year bought a 20 per cent stake
in Tyne Tees. Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, owns 20 per cent of
Yorkshire.
Yorkshire shareholders will be entitled to a bonus issue of warrants
allowing them to subscribe to Yorkshire shares which, if fully taken up,
would raise Pounds 20m for the combined company.
Mr Clive Leach, Yorkshire chief executive, said the combined group would
have 16 per cent of the ITV audience but 12 per cent of its advertising
revenues.
'Yorkshire's position is undoubtedly relatively improved and it goes some
way to redress the imbalance with companies that got their franchises on
comparatively cheaper terms,' one analyst said.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Union asks for check on Courage pension fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CITY regulators have been asked to investigate the pension fund manager of
Courage, the brewer, after the fund was forced to write off a Pounds 10m
investment in a company related to Foster's Brewing Group, Courage's
Australian owner.
The Transport and General Workers' Union has written to Imro, the
self-regulatory body for the fund management industry, asking for an
investigation.
The union also wants Imro to look at the separation of the fund management
from the main company. The investment manager for the fund is Pyrford
International, formed by the managers of Elders Investment Management in
early 1991 in a buy-out from Foster's, then known as Elders IXL.
Courage said that since the write-off in 1990-91 the trustees had decided to
invest no further money in companies related to Courage and Foster's. The
pension fund also owns the head office of Courage, at Staines, Middlesex,
and part of another building but has no other internally related
investments.
Imro said it was considering the TGWU letter and had had talks with the
Occupational Pension Board, Courage, the fund trustees and the union. It had
not launched a formal investigation.
The TGWU request follows the appointment of receivers earlier this month to
Mr John Elliott's International Brewing Investments, which had a 32 per cent
stake in Foster's.
The receivers were appointed by BHP, the Australian energy and steelmaking
company, following the end of a moratorium on interest payments on about
ADollars 2.6bn (Pounds 1.05bn) of debt acquired by IBI to finance the
purchase of its Foster's shareholding.
In a letter to Imro at the end of May, Mr Brian Revell, TGWU acting national
official, said his union and its Courage members had been concerned for some
time that the ownership structure had major debt problems.

The Salvage Association sounds an appropriate sort of resting place for
those discarded on the political scrapheap. So John Butcher, who produced a
crushing defeat for the Conservatives when standing against Shirley Williams
in the 1981 Crosby by-election, and who has just arrived as the
Association's chief accountant, should fit in well enough.
In fact, the salvage with which Butcher will be concerned is not personal,
but rather marine in nature - the organisation being in the business of
handing out technical advice to the London insurance market about marine
claims.
Butcher's connection with the sea? 'I can't comment on that, my role is to
look after finance; my colleagues don't expect me to know about safety at
sea,' says the Royal Navy Reserve Volunteer of ten years' standing.

Prudential has long been running commercials on how Britain's wives long to
be free - and it is easy now to see why. An NOP survey released by the Pru
yesterday revealed that only 53 per cent of British women would stay with
their husbands if they had the choice of a Continental man instead.
They viewed Italian men as the hottest prospects - 11 per cent of the women
would prefer one. The French came second with 6 per cent, while Greeks,
Spaniards and Dutchmen tied at two points lower. Danes, whether or not
boosted by their macho treatment of Maastricht, were preferred by 3 per
cent.
Europe's least desirable men in the she-Brits' eyes were Germans,
Luxembourgeois and Portuguese. But as they tied at 1 per cent apiece, they
have the consolation of knowing that someone, at least, loves them.

How long should a non-executive director sit on the board of a major
company?
Sir John Hoskyns, who has almost finished revamping his Burton board, says
that three years is 'absurdly short' while five to seven years, is
'optimum'. After that there is a danger that a director loses his
impartiality by getting too close to the company.
Since Sir John took over the Burton chair in November 1990 he has behaved
like a model corporate citizen. The management team has been completely
overhauled, the finances have been stabilised - thanks to last year's rights
issue - and he has recruited an impressive array of non-executive directors.
Yesterday, Whitbread's Peter Jarvis, and Caroline Marland, deputy managing
director of The Guardian, were added to a list of non-execs which includes
Bats' Brian Garraway and John Brown, an old property hand.
Not only is their arrival another sign that Burton is over the worst but it
means that whatever else the company lacks it will not be short of expert
advice. But the presence of the new faces is yet another reminder that Mark
Littman and Ladislas Rice, the last of the old Burton non-executive guard,
have long since passed their sell-by date.

Why is it that most of us would 'extract' water but the National Rivers
Authority warns about excessive 'abstraction'?
Of the industry's several contradictory explanations, the one that makes the
most sense is that 'extraction' is permanent while 'abstraction' implies
that the water eventually will be returned to the river.
Observer suspects that, unlike the hapless River Darent, this one may run
and run.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Observer: When teacher knows best
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Richard von Weizsacker, the German president, has stirred up a storm in Bonn
with his new book which fiercely criticises the quality of the country's
political leadership. So who does run Germany today?
One group whose influence certainly has not waned is the august body of
German economics professors.
Sixty members of this fraternity discomfited the government only last week
by signing a petition against European monetary union.
Theo Waigel, the finance minister, staunchly backed by the chief economists
of the big three German banks, did his best to counter the academics'
criticisms. But, if history is anything to go by, it seems likely that the
professors' views will prevail.
The last time that the economics profession caused a similar flurry was in
1969, when 100 economics professors signed a public statement condemning the
government's refusal to revalue the Deutschmark.
The episode was one of the contributory factors behind the breakdown of the
Grand Coalition government led by Kurt Georg Kiesinger. Five months later,
the professors won the day when the Bonn government - a Social Democrat
administration under Chancellor Willy Brandt, following Kiesinger's
ignominious autumn departure - decided the second revaluation of the D-Mark
since the war.
German professors are long-lived animals. So, for conspiracy theorists at
least, it is worth pointing out that the latest professorial broadside was
supported by several who also signed the 1969 petition - including, notably,
the redoubtable Herbert Giersch, the former head of the Kiel economic
institute.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Letter: Alternative view of Mexico
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHRISTOPHER WHALEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Edward Mortimer's article (Foreign Affairs, June 10) about Mexico
contains useful insights, but shows how journalists are frequently charmed
by attractively adorned dictators.
The National Solidarity Program did not spring from Salinas' work at
Harvard, but out of political necessity. The job of stealing an election,
for example, is made easier if only a quarter or even half the precincts
require rigging. In contrast to massive, pre-election social spending
programmes of the 1960s and 1970s, Pronasol is a rifle-shot approach to
acquiring political support, but one with neither transparency nor public
accountability for the sources and uses of funds spent.
The PRI uses Solidarity to funnel hundreds of millions of dollars into
public works projects in opposition strongholds, buying votes from otherwise
recalcitrant citizens. Mortimer paints an image of Mexicans thanking El
Presidente for his generosity, a surreal scene reminiscent of feudal times.
Mortimer rightly observes there is no effective political opposition in
Mexico (at the moment, at least). But he fails to note that the vast
political and financial advantages made possible by Washington's support,
and the related access to foreign credit, make discussion of effective
political opposition to single party PRI rule an absurdity.
Mortimer criticises the limited role played by the press, but might rather
have said that honest Mexican journalists live with very real danger.
Indeed, consider the privileged foreign journalists: First, the visiting
scribe, like Mortimer, attends a carefully orchestrated political rally and
rides comfortably in the presidential jet. The result: a filtered,
pasteurised look at Mexico, though thankfully Mortimer does mention the
violent deaths of journalists.
Then there are the local correspondents, the insiders, who know the
realities and players in Mexico City very well indeed, but decline to write
about difficult subjects like fraudulent elections, trade deficits, drugs,
or corruption within the privatisation process, for fear of being excluded
from the next drinks party in fashionable Polanco.
Dictatorships like China, Mexico and Kuwait will disappear only when
journalists stop treating them with undue reverence. If we could but pierce
the carefully maintained facade of Salinastroika with well chosen words,
Mexico's people might feel our moral support, as did the peoples of eastern
Europe, and thereby discover the will necessary to create a truly viable
democracy. Viva Zapata]

FT  19 JUN 92 / Letter: Costs that influence central banks' mood for
Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROBERT PRINGLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, There is evidence to support Observer's suspicion ('Banker's cutback',
June 17) that some EC central banks are 'expensive'; or at least that their
running costs vary widely. Using data from annual reports and information
supplied by the central banks, Central Banking puts the operating expenses
of five EC banks in 1990 as follows: Bundesbank DM2bn (Dollars 1.35bn); Bank
of Italy L1,5l0 bn (Dollars 1.34bn); Bank of France FFr6.52bn (Dollars
1.28bn); Bank of England Pounds 170m (Dollars 294m); Netherlands Bank Fl
227m (Dollars 120m). Where possible these figures exclude the cost of
printing bank notes.
There are obviously historical reasons for these variations: staff numbers
vary widely, from over 16,000 in the case of the Bundesbank and Bank of
France to 1,500 in the Netherlands Bank, as do the functions performed by
the banks. Nevertheless, central bankers are well aware that their costs
will come under closer scrutiny as they travel down the road to Emu, which
is one reason why some of them are less than enthusiastic about the
Maastricht Treaty.

vetting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr A KENNETH SNOWMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I also was saddened by the headline 'United front falls apart' (June
13) on an otherwise completely just report from Susan Moore - the fair at
Grosvenor House is doing well, looks very good and is certainly not falling
apart.
The president and members of the executive of the Grosvenor House Antiques
Fair (Letters, June 15) are well aware of my own feelings about the appeal
which reversed the earlier ludicrous rejection by the vetting committee
since I wrote to them on June 14 as follows: 'As we knew would be the case,
you conducted our appeal in the matter of the Burgundian Jewel in an
entirely exemplary way and this was in the best tradition of the
association.'
That, however, is not what it is all about. What I and my colleagues were
not pleased about was the wholesale rejection this year of - again I quote -
'so many perfectly good objects from our stand (dramatically more than ever
before in our long experience) many of which had been exhibited during
previous years . . . I feel it is essential that many more academic and
disinterested specialists be brought in as we have been suggesting by letter
for the last three years'.
I am happy to say that this policy is now being pursued and I hope, as a
former president of both the British Antique Dealers' Association and The
Antique Dealers' Fair, that it gains momentum, and that the judgment of the
vetting committees will in the future be beyond reproach for the benefit of
everyone. A Kenneth Snowman,

FT  19 JUN 92 / Letter: Telecoms in need of a different structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr J M HARPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader 'Time to review the regulators' (June 10) was right for
telecoms in many respects, although it missed one point. The regime and the
work of Oftel undoubtedly need review. Sir Bryan Carsberg is much respected
in the industry. But could it really be correct for him as the new
director-general of fair trading to review his past actions as director
general of telecommunications?
Oftel's accountability to parliament certainly needs strengthening. The
House of Lords does not at present have a role in these matters. It has a
unique collection of public figures with experience between them both of
running and of overseeing the big utilities. They could play a valuable part
in improved machinery of oversight.
But this will not be enough. Telecoms has a special problem. Unlike that of
electricity, BT's structure was left unaltered at privatisation. It is so
big that it overshadows its competition; and as a private sector
near-monopoly it presents government with even greater difficulties of
oversight than its public sector predecessor.
This is the heart of the matter. Last July you advocated change in structure
for telecoms. You were right.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Chips go down in electronics
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS HAS been a troubling week in Europe's electronics industry. A surprise
profits warning from Philips of the Netherlands, which had been recovering
from its financial crisis of two years ago, was followed yesterday by
confirmation that Siemens of Germany is sharply scaling back its commitment
to memory chips, of which it is the leading European-owned producer.
These developments raise fresh doubts about the prospects for European-owned
companies in a sector where, despite extensive government support, they have
struggled to survive. But their plight needs to be seen in the perspective
of recent upheavals, which have also scarred electronics producers in the US
and Japan. The problems are more than cyclical: they stem from structural
changes in the industry.
The worst mistake EC policymakers could make would be to respond by plying
Europe's electronics industry with still further subsidies and trade
protection. Excessive reliance on such favours contributed largely to
Philips' past difficulties by insulating it from commercial realities.
Rather, policy should focus on removing the remaining barriers to free
competition in Europe.
The most obvious barrier is the long-standing 14 per cent EC tariff on
semiconductor imports. This has failed to encourage a strong home-grown
semiconductor industry, while piling unnecessary costs on European chip
purchasers. There is also something badly wrong with a European market in
which the prices of many computer and consumer electronics products remain
far above US levels. The price discrepancy, which penalises every European
information technology user, calls for thorough investigation by EC
competition authorities.
Changing dynamics
These distortions have been encouraged by myopic European industrial
policies which have ignored the changing dynamics of electronics markets. At
its most absurd, the approach is summed up in the recent assertion by an
industry lobbyist that 'without semiconductors, Europe has no industrial
future'. Rarely has special pleading contained so many half-truths and non
sequiturs.
Europe is in no danger of being starved of semiconductors. The world market
is awash with the devices, and every boom in demand stimulates costly
investments in new capacity. Many are sited in the EC, where US- and
Japanese-owned chip plants are proliferating - often generously assisted by
local taxpayers. Furthermore, actual chip production accounts for a
diminishing share of the margin and value-added in the industry, which must
increasingly be sought in the products and systems that use chips.
Commercial success
State-of-the-art component technology remains an important driver of
innovation in the whole electronics industry. But its possession is no
longer a guarantee of commercial success. At the same time, such success is
possible for firms that exploit the fruits of others' technological
advances. Speedier technological diffusion and plummeting hardware prices
have conspired to erode the innovator's advantage, turning innovations
rapidly into commodities.
Only by successfully differentiating final products can companies hope to
prosper long-term. That calls for much more emphasis on marketing, a
function most electronics producers have largely ignored. Even the
once-mighty IBM has been revealed as deficient: until recently, it did not
even know the true costs of its sales force. The industry has much to learn
from marketing-intensive low-technology business-es, such as soap and
cornflakes.
But productive marketing also requires a demanding market. Europe's biggest
weakness in electronics is a lack of the demand pull provided in the US and
Japan by well-informed customers hungry for new and cost-effective products.
The solution is not dirigisme, the mistake EC bureaucrats are making in high
definition television (HDTV), by yoking manufacturers and broadcasters into
support of probably obsolete home-grown technology. It can only be achieved
by making markets operate more efficiently. That is a goal worth pursuing
for its own sake. It also offers Europe's electronics industry its best
long-term chance of survival.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Major's privatisation of personal choice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Forget about the Labour party. Yesterday's quarrelsome inquest into its
election defeat is doubtless of great interest to students of bio-diversity.
They may wish to protect even the most suicidally-inclined of endangered
species. The rest of us do better to study real events.
One such took place on Tuesday night, when Mr John Major addressed the 15th
anniversary dinner of the Adam Smith Institute. The prime minister said next
to nothing new, yet his speech was a revelation. It turns out that when he
indicated during the April campaign that he would, as he now puts it,
'privatise choice', he really meant it. If 'privatise choice' puzzles you,
hang on a moment. All will be made plain. But first note a second event of
political significance. This occurred on Wednesday. The protagonist was Mr
Norman Lamont. He was addressing a business gathering in Surrey. 'In two or
three years,' he said, 'people will look back and see that it was now,
during this critical period, that the right decisions were taken.'
Put these speeches together and you have a clear picture of the strategy for
British domestic policy over the medium term. The economy will be tightly
managed. The discipline of the exchange rate mechanism remains in place.
There was no panicky cut in interest rates before the election; in the
chancellor's view there is no case for one now. The government's ambition is
to halve the inflation rate to 2 per cent or 3 per cent and keep it falling
towards zero. This squares with the Treasury's attempts to force public
expenditure planning totals for 1993-94 down below the levels agreed in the
pre-election round.
So far, so predictable. Election bribes are there to be taken back when you
have won. That established, we can return to 'privatising choice'. Mr
Major's explanation of this intriguing phrase is that 'where once socialism
nationalised or municipalised personal choice, taking it away from the
individual and the family, we will give choice back to them and extend it
further'. This, he told the institute, is 'the greatest and most
far-reaching' privatisation, and 'the one to which I am most committed'. As
I see it, three consequences follow. The public services will be turned
upside-down. Local government will be further diminished. And there will be
no extra money to ease this revolution through.
Take central government first. The Citizen's Charter is not welcomed by the
Civil Service, but No 10 Downing Street is determined to promote it. It is
holding another seminar on the subject. I assume that they will be wearing
their lapel-badges. Contracting-out of services, a success in local
government, will be attempted in central departments and agencies. This must
be about as popular with officials as a 10-year stretch in Canary Wharf. The
mandarins intensely dislike open government, but an attempt will be made to
weed secrecy clauses out of many existing laws. Do not hope for too much.
Government self-regulation of what should and should not be secret is never
to be trusted.
There are few contemporary headlines in all this, but the net effect could
be dramatic. The structure of Britain's central administration in 2000 might
be unrecognisable to anyone who last saw it in, say, 1980. Those who look
for local government around millennium-time may need a magnifying glass. The
great town hall barons of the 1970s, with their direct labour forces,
council-house fiefdoms, and monopolies over state education services will
have been swept away. The local government commission will doubtless reduce
the number of local authorities. Mrs Margaret Thatcher started the process
of rescuing council tenants from local authority control; Mr Major is
clearly determined to complete the job.
Most strikingly, the education service is being taken away from
locally-elected bodies. This is apparently not centralisation. 'No
bureaucrat decides whether a school should apply to become
grant-maintained,' says Mr Major. 'It is the governors and parents.' Yet
control over local governance follows the money to pay for it; seven-eighths
of council revenue from taxation is now received in the form of cheques from
Whitehall. When it comes to sink schools, Mr Major intimated on Tuesday,
control will be direct. 'If the governors or the local authority are
unwilling or unable to put things right, then we must find ways to raise
standards in them.'
For the rest, it will be indirect. The universities, polytechnics and
sixth-form colleges already have their own appointed 'funding councils'; a
similar non-elected intermediary body for the country's 4,900 secondary
schools cannot be far behind. This will surely require a fresh corps of
administrators. Even Mr Major's government is wary of taking on the
country's 24,000 primary schools, although it seems to think that by
allowing groups of them to become self-governing it can keep the new
intermediary bureaucracy to a minimum.
There is more. 'The inspection of key public services . . . will be . . .
independent of the services they inspect,' said the prime minister. Schools
are being given a new free-range inspectorate; social work departments will
likewise be audited by outsiders. Throw in a couple of new organograms
there. Add just one more for the better management (with no extra money) of
the police. 'There should be a policeman passing your door regularly, and
not just when the burglars have called,' said Mr Major.
Much of this programme makes sense. It is also likely to be popular.
Concentrating on individuals and their needs is the spirit of the age. It
may even be applied to pensions policy. Here the Tory inclination is to
fund-members' rights of ownership to the funds to which they contribute. Mr
Robert Maxwell's thievery give a political force to such a strategy.
Yet something is missing from the whole picture, and here I do not mean
cash. What is to be the role of local democracy? Are people always to be
mere customers, except once in four or five years at general elections? Mr
Major is saying that Whitehall knows best. Local councils may merely manage
the collection of rubbish, town planning, and old people's homes. In Europe
he bangs the drum for subsidiarity. At home, he is selling an improved
version of Mrs Thatcher's conglomerate, United Kingdom plc. Its board is
packed with Conservative ministers. Shed no tears for them. They will keep
their jobs - as long as they please the customers.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Lloyd's and its casualties
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE ARE two separate issues to examine when considering what Lloyd's of
London, the insurance market, should do to cope with the impact of the
losses of 1988-90 on some of its members.
First: was there wrongdoing? Did Lloyd's business practices unfairly
penalise innocent new members, sucking them into syndicates with a higher
than average chance of encountering heavy losses? This is the issue that Sir
David Walker, former chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, has
been examining; his report is due next month. If Sir David finds that there
were systemic weaknesses at Lloyd's which allowed abuses to take place,
those members affected will have a strong case for sharing the burden with
their fellows. This is a moral issue, turning on questions of natural
justice, equity and fairness.
The second issue looks similar, but is in fact different. If there was no
wrongdoing, or if it was confined to a limited number of cases, should there
nonetheless be a general sharing of pain within the market, to ease the
plight of those worst affected by the losses?
Both those who answer yes to this question and those who answer no have made
great play with moral issues. Here, though, the strongest arguments have
always been coldly commercial. A bail-out was, said its advocates, the only
way of digging Lloyd's out from under the blizzard of legal cases that
threatened to overwhelm it and its reputation. It was worth every member's
while to pay up, to preserve the future of Lloyd's and the income it would
generate in years to come.
Commercial reasons
Logically, the question of wrongdoing precedes the question of a general
bail-out. Lloyd's has chosen to answer the questions in reverse order.
Yesterday, the Lloyd's council announced that it has rejected the arguments
for a bail-out. Appropriately, it reached its decision for straightforward
commercial reasons. The losses of its worst-hit 2,500 Names are so great
that setting aside a fund to compensate them would have gobbled up too much
of Lloyd's capital. And anyway, half those Names are no longer members;
giving them help would do nothing to strengthen the market's future
capacity.
The arithmetic did not add up, so no bail-out. Instead, brokers and managing
agents are to be asked to contribute to Lloyd's hardship committee, chaired
by Mrs Mary Archer.
Even with extra cash, it cannot work quickly. Of the 1,185 members who have
applied to Mrs Archer's committee, only 95 have so far been offered a
settlement, and only 39 have accepted. These settlements, says Mr Alan Lord,
Lloyd's outgoing chief executive, allow distressed Names to keep their
houses till they die, living 'not opulently but quite as well as many people
you would expect to meet in a small country village'.
Rustic bliss
The prospect of rustic bliss will not stop the lawsuits. Lloyd's council
must have known that. Its decision against a bail-out scheme represents its
best judgment of the balance of commercial advantage, a judgment it is there
to make.
That does not exempt it from greeting the Walker report, when it appears,
with an appropriate response. If the report points to wrongdoing or
negligence, Lloyd's will find itself urged to compensate those members
affected with funds drawn from the membership generally.
It would be wrong for the council, in considering this issue, to cite the
decision against a general bail-out; instead, the appropriate precedent is
Lloyd's contribution out of its members' funds to the settlement of lawsuits
over the losses of the Outhwaite syndicate.
As well as dealing with the legacy of past losses, Lloyd's must turn its
attention to the future. Here, the most urgent need is to build capital
rapidly to maintain market share and offset the withdrawal of disenchanted
Names. Yesterday's other decision - to create a 'stop-loss' fund that will
prevent Names from being wiped out in future  - will offer some limited
help. But the best hope of an influx of new funds lies in the proposal to
admit corporate capital. Lloyd's now believes that this will not require a
change in the law; it is talking of introducing corporate capital from the
beginning of 1994. Such a change cannot come too soon.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Arts: Bartoli's 'Cenerentola'/'Cosi fan tutte' - Opera in
Italy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM WEAVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Concluding its opera season, the Bologna Comunale has just mounted a
sparkling new Cenerentola, obviously intended also as a contribution to the
Rossini bicentenary festivities, which continue in full spate throughout
Italy. The new production served further as a showcase for the young
mezzosoprano Cecilia Bartoli, the brightest rising star in the Italian
operatic firmament, known as much for her notable recordings as for her
theatre appearances.
But Bartoli in the real life of the stage is even more exciting than Bartoli
on discs, for in addition to her vocal virtuosity she is an engaging,
natural actress, sensitive to words, including those of her
fellow-performers. She never performs in a vacuum, but securely in context.
In Bologna she was surrounded by first-class performers. Cenerentola is not
a mezzosoprano vehicle: it makes heavy demands also on the other
interpreters, and the casting of Ramiro, Magnifico and Dandini is as
important as the choice of the heroine. Bologna had William Matteuzzi,
Claudio Desderi and the talented young Lucio Gallo for these three parts,
and the spiteful stepsisters were aptly played by Fernanda Costa and Gloria
Banditelli. The philosopher Alidoro, of whom little but stately nobility is
required, was strongly cast, too; and the bass Pietro Spagnoli added to that
nobility of mien authority of voice and evident human concern. Riccardo
Chailly, the permanent conductor of the Comunale, used the new critical
edition of the score, which inspired a translucent reading with far more
subtlety and charm than the usual. Chailly allowed the vein of pathos to run
through the performance.
Bartoli's Cinderella, however, was not pathetic or sentimental, even in the
opening scenes. Her first words to the prince were immediately moving in
their simplicity. In the end, when goodness has triumphed and the radiant
newly-made princess proclaims that her forgiveness of her stepsisters will
be her revenge, there is just a hint that vengeance will get the upper hand
and the stepsisters had better watch out. This Cinderella is a young woman
of strong character, whether among the embers or on the throne.
In unusually good voice, Matteuzzi portrayed a youthful man of spirit,
convincing as prince and lover. The young Gallo has a big, commanding voice,
perhaps more suited to verismo opera than to Rossini; but he handled it well
and provided an untraditional, originally comic valet-turned-prince. Claudio
Desderi was a Don Magnifico totally in command, outrageously funny and
infallibly musical, singing not grumbling his music. Like all the others, he
was firmly supported by the staging of Roberto De Simone, whose view of the
piece entirely corresponded to that of Chailly: the comedy always had a
welcome elegance. Greedy, self-important, foolishly ambitious, this Don
Magnifico was, nevertheless, an aristocrat.
Odette Nicoletti designed delightful costumes; and Mauro Carosi invented a
splendid and versatile set, a high arch crowning two curved staircases, in
Vesuvian-villa style. Thus, with a minimum of shifting, the scenic elements
could be transformed from the Baron's decaying palace to the Prince's
country seat. The Comunale orchestra was obviously in complete agreement
with Chailly's approach, and they played at the top of their form. The
chorus, too, seemed newly energised. All this bodes well for the recording
which Decca will make just after the final performance of the season.
Stimulated largely by the success of his recent recordings, considerable
interest surrounded the Italian debut of John Eliot Gardiner as producer,
staging Mozart's Cos fan tutte at the charming Teatro Comunale in Ferrara.
This was a co-production with the Teatro Sao Carlos of Lisbon, where it was
seen last month. The Ferrara opening night, last Friday, was sold out; and
critics and cognoscenti came from all over the country for the event.
The reception was warm, but the artistic results were mixed, and some of the
specialists were disappointed. Not with Gardiner's conducting, which was, as
expected, of great authority and sensibility. From the very first bars of
the Overture it was clear that the excellent English Baroque Soloists were
in secure hands: tempos were firmly set, but never so rigid as to exclude
expressive play. And, except for a very few awkward horn blurts, the sound
was sweet and silken, unusual for an 'original instruments' orchestra.
It was the voices that fell short of expectation, especially the women.
Amanda Roocroft (Fiordiligi) and Rosa Mannion (Dorabella) both have a pretty
soprano sound, but without personality. True, in Gardiner's view, the two
sisters should be, for much of the piece, virtually identical (and they wore
confusingly twin costumes in the first scenes); but their interchangeable
sameness quickly became monotonous. The generic quality of their singing was
exacerbated by their woeful enunciation of the Italian text and the excess
of gesticulation and grimacing that marked their acting was a hindrance
rather than a help to comprehension. In the mugging department, Eirian James
was the worst offender; the voice also lacked charm.
Carlos Feller gave the Italian words their proper value, and his Alfonso was
the only character with three dimensions. He really looked and moved like an
18th century Neapolitan gentleman, not like a costumed singer.
Unfortunately, his voice is an unpleasant bark and he had difficulty with
pitch. The boys - Rainer Trost (Ferrando) and Rodney Gilfry (Guglielmo) -
were generally better actors, but their singing suffered from the same lack
of focus as the girls', and their Italian was only marginally better.
In a long evening (four hours including one interval), the generic singing
grew soporific, and one could not help wondering if it was worth opening
cuts and restoring often-suppressed recitative. Gardiner, in a programme
note, insists that he has turned producer only to prevent someone less
knowledgeable from mucking about with the work. An excellent motive, and his
staging does indeed respect the text and the music, except for a few
instances where the maestro himself succumbs to produceritis, introducing
chained prisoners into the scene of the troops' arrival and two mincing
Pulcinellas into the near-wedding.
The story is firmly set in late 18th century Naples by the splendid,
seductive sets as costumes of Carlo Tommasi. Dorabella and Fiordiligi could
not have been brought back to their native Ferrara in a more handsome visual
context.

Movies are on television every day of the week nowadays, but Friday remains
more of a movie night than most. 633 Squadron (6.30 BBC2) is a routine war
film about RAF Mosquitos bombing an 'impossible' target: a German rocket
fuel factory in Norway. It is memorable chiefly for Ron Goodwin's
unforgettably repetitive music. The Couch Trip is yet another example of
Hollywood's ambivalent relationship with psychiatry. An escaped lunatic
replaces a celebrity sex therapist offering advice on a radio programme, and
is wildly successful with the punters. (10.20 BBC1).
C4 shows the 1946 American version of The Postman Always Rings Twice with
Lana Turner as the beautiful predatory woman and John Garfield as the
smitten drifter. 'Ossessione' had more class but, considering the Hays
Office rules, this one is surprisingly successful at conveying the heat of
the sex (11.40).
The Masque Of The Red Death is Corman's best horror movie. Better still,
Nicholas Roeg photographed it before turning director. Vincent Price is a
splendid Italian prince and there is a powerful sense of the mediaeval
(11.55 BBC1).

FT  19 JUN 92 / Arts: Austerity with a baroque twist / Review of the art and
craft of the Hutterites and Mennonites
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In summer, the colony bell wakes everyone at 6.15 am. The bell calls the
adults to the communal kitchen for a breakfast of prunes, cheese, smoked
ham, bread, jam and coffee. Quickly and in order the men file in, hang their
hats and take their assigned places on benches around a long table. All wear
black working trousers and coloured shirts; the mature men are bearded. The
women follow and sit at a second table, their hair identically arranged,
their clothes another uniform of polka-dotted head scarves, long patterned
dresses and aprons. No children are present.
A short prayer. Each person eats quickly and in silence. Another prayer. The
dishes are carried into the kitchen. Women finish clearing the tables and
begin washing up. The procedure takes seven minutes in all.
The colony is Hutterite, the date the mid 1960s. For the first time,
outsiders had been admitted to observe and photograph the life of what is
the most long lived of all Christian Utopian communities. The Hutterites,
like the other two surviving German-speaking Anabaptist sects, the
Mennonites and the Amish, chose to separate themselves from church and state
in the 16th century. Endlessly persecuted, not least for their pacifism as
well as for their separateness, they sought refuge and land to farm first in
Prussia or Russia, then the US, and latterly in Western Canada.
Unlike the Mennonites and the Amish, their life is communal, their modest
earthly goods the possession of the community rather than an individual.
Moreover, they have continued to resist integrating into a wider community.
In North American in 1965, a population of some 16,500 Hutterites was
recorded in 170 colonies.
An image of those cheerless, regimented breakfasts ought to haunt like a
spectre 'All Things Common', a beautifully presented small show of Mennonite
and Hutterite furniture, textiles, metalwork, ceramics and calligraphy at
Canada House. So seductively simple and wholesome are these workaday rustic
chests and chairs, and handsome quilts, that the harshness of the life for
which they were made is blurred in a romantic mist.
The Hutterite children who slept in the gaily painted turn-of-the-century
cradle, and played in the child's wagon of around 1930, were not allowed to
favour their own mothers above other members of the community.
Indoctrination began early: by the age of two they would be aware that the
needs and will of the colony took precedence over those of the individual.
Indeed, the individual will had to be broken, individuality suppressed.
There appears to be a contradiction between what we see in this exhibition
and what we know. Despite their austerity, the so-called 'Plain Folk' in
sombre blue clothing appear not so plain after all. Unlike the Shakers who
rationalised 18th century English furniture to create a new, streamlined,
functional style, Mennonite and Hutterite craftsmen continued to copy and
simplify old prototypes. Those prototypes happened to be in the most
immodestly exuberant and self-indulgent of decorative styles, the baroque.
The survival of Germanic forms and decorative traditions among these - and
other - widely dispersed and much travelled Germanic colonies is striking.
Theirs is a similar small repertory of essential furniture: blanket boxes,
wall cupboards, chairs, tables and sleeping benches, which serve as storage
chest, bench and bed. In the latter, in particular, we find Baroque
curlicues and scrolling arm rests, back rests and skirts. Throughout are
unexpected bright primarily colours, inlay, trompe l'oeil, and Hansel and
Gretel heart-shaped cuts outs.
In contrast to Shaker furniture and artefacts, some of these pieces seem
fussy, galumphing and poorly made. What they lack in aesthetic and technical
refinement, however, they often make up for in spirit. We can imagine the
sense of satisfaction felt by the man who carved the heart in the top of the
cabbage cutter here, or forged the heart-shaped trivets, as well as the
simple pleasure derived by those who handled them.
An instinctive feel for colour and design is evident in the traditionally
patterned Mennonite quilts on show. That sense of design is also apparent in
perhaps the most distinctive works here - the lively manuscript illumination
known as 'fraktur'. Again, the art form derives from Swiss-German
traditions, but it flowered in the New World. The motifs that once decorated
the borders of important family documents became as important as the script
itself, and even exist without it. Eight-pointed stars, hearts, birds,
flowers, animals and trees of life weave their lively, rhythmic watercolour
courses across the page.
All Things Common continues at Canada House, Trafalgar Square, until July 3.

Who says there is no point in reinventing the wheel? Hugh O'Neil has done
just that with a revolutionary golf cart which features slits on the outer

a round to an oval as they traverse.
The result is a machine which can go anywhere in extreme weather conditions
but which exerts about a quarter of the pressure of an average man's foot.

ONE of the chores of building a computer spreadsheet is checking that the
data has been accurately entered. Reading the numbers back to a colleague is
both time-consuming and tedious.
But Temair Software, based in Rhode Island, has developed a software package
called Spreadsheet Echo which enables the computer to read Lotus 1-2-3
spreadsheet numbers back to the user.
The software will read back a range of numbers either by row or column, can
be told to pause between cells, and speak in either a male or female voice.
The user can also set speed or volume levels and listen through the
computer's internal speaker or through headphones.
The programme, which costs Dollars 99.95, is also multilingual.

<TEXT>
Feeling run down? Researchers at Utrecht University now think that prolonged
acute stress could weaken the body's immune system, making it more prone to
illness.
In their study the researchers subjected secondary school teachers to stress
by asking them to solve an impossible three-dimensional puzzle under a time
constraint. The volunteers' white blood cell count was taken immediately
before and after the stress test. In some teachers the number of natural
killer cells had risen considerably by the end of the test, but returned to
normal within 30 minutes.
Although it is difficult to draw conclusions the researchers believe that
the number and intensity of stressful events have a negative effect on the
body's resistance. In the long term this could increase the chance of
infections. Utrecht University Academic Hospital: The Netherlands: 31 30

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lever Brothers, the UK detergents business of Anglo-Dutch consumer products
company Unilever, has a new chief executive, Andrew Seth, who arrives from
Lever Europe in Brussels. He had been a general manager in charge of
household cleaning products for the past two years, and earlier held a
series of positions with Lever elsewhere in Europe as well as America. In
the late 1970s and early 1980s he had been marketing director of Lever
Brothers in the UK.
Seth, 55, replaces Roy Brown, who at 45 has moved up to the Unilever main
board as a regional director with responsibility for Africa and the Middle
East. Clearly on the Unilever fast-track, Brown has moved speedily through
the ranks. He had been chief executive of Lever Brothers for less than 18
months, where one of his principal tasks had been to oversee the
implementation of the UK end of the new Lever Europe strategy - the drive to
make the European detergent businesses work together more effectively. Also
during Brown's time there, Lever introduced concentrated liquid detergent to
the UK market.
Among a range of many previous posts within the group, he has been technical
director of Bird's Eye Walls and chairman of Plant Breeding International.
His overseas experience comes partly from a period in the mid 1980s when he
was chairman of Unilever's plantations activities.

FT  19 JUN 92 / People: Instructive role for Wally Olins
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wally Olins, one of the UK's design gurus, has decided to go back to school.
'Not before time,' might be the cry of all those critics of the revamped
corporate image sector of the design world, of which Olins is a leading
light.
But before the knives flash too fiercely, let it be known that Olins is
returning to education not to learn but to instruct. He has just been
appointed visiting professor at Lancaster University management school,
where he will be involved initially in the school's MBA courses.
Later he will participate in the expansion of the school's marketing
programme; there are plans to introduce an advertising course this year.
Olins will continue his role as chairman of Wolff Olins, the corporate
identity consultancy, which he co-founded.
Lancaster clearly feels chuffed with the appointment. Its press release
proudly mentions Wolff Olins' corporate identity work for VW/Audi,
Prudential, Bovis, Akzo and the Metropolitan police force in London. But
strangely, it omits to mention the most famous recent Wolff Olins work, the
corporate redesign for BT, the implementation of which is estimated to have
cost some Pounds 50m.
The new logo - a silhouette of Pan blowing a heraldic trumpet - met with
widespread derision, not least because Pan blew a syrinx.
*****
Lord Kindersley, who has chaired Brent Walker through its Pounds 1.65bn
refinancing, is to retire from the group at next month's annual meeting. He
was appointed in January 1991 expecting a fairly brief, though arduous,
tenure of the job. But the repeated delays in completing the refinancing
until the end of March this year kept him occupied seven days a week.
Now, at 62, he looks forward to spending some time on his other interests,
he says. One of his top priorities is to organise a deer-park owners'
initiative to improve the marketing of venison. He has 400 deer of his own
in Kent. His preoccupation with Brent Walker, which yesterday reported an
annual loss totalling Pounds 411.4m, has, he says, nearly cost him his place
on the management committee of Wimbledon. And he feels that as chairman of
the Thailand Investment Trust he really ought to visit the country.
Also resigning is Alan Clements (right), former ICI finance director, who
joined as a non-executive director in the early stages of the refinancing as
well. He subsequently became the only non-executive director on the board
and had to carry the burden that entailed. He too has other interests
requiring his time, not the least his directorship of Mirror Group
Newspapers.
Brent Walker is in the process of recruiting a new chairman and some
non-executive directors. Some names should be ready by the agm.

THE STANDARD STEAMSHIP OWNERS' PROTECTION AND INDEMNITY ASSOCIATION
(BERMUDA) LTD V GANN AND ANOTHER Queen's Bench Division (Commercial Court):
Mr Justice Hirst: June 5 1992
AN ENGLISH jurisdiction clause in the rules of a P &amp; I club constitutes an
agreement between the club and its members to which the court will give
effect unless there is good reason for not keeping the parties to their
bargain; and where proceedings are begun in a competing jurisdiction, an
English choice of law clause in the club rules is a significant factor in
favour of England as the appropriate forum.
Mr Justice Hirst so held when refusing an application by the defendants, Mr
Edmund A Gann and Caribbean Marine Services Co Inc (CMS), to set aside Mr
Justice Evan's order granting the plaintiff club, the Standard Steamship
Owners' Protection and Indemnity Association (Bermuda) Ltd, leave to serve
the proceedings on the defendants out of the jurisdiction.
HIS LORDSHIP said that the club was a shipowners' mutual assurance
association, which issued and provided insurance on the basis of its rules
from year to year.
Its claim, amounting to more than Dollars 1.8m, was for loss and/or damages
arising from non-payment of supplementary calls and relief calls.
It submitted those sums were due from the defendants. It alleged they were
parties to the insurance policy. The defendants' case was that the parties
to the policy were not the defendants, but individual shipowning
corporations.
Mr Gann was a US citizen resident in San Diego California. CMS was a
Californian company based in San Diego.
Mr Gann was beneficially interested in a number of individual corporations
which owned vessels engaged in tuna fishing off the west coast of the US,
managed by CMS. The defendants alleged those companies were the assured.
Reference to the 'defendants' was without prejudice to that point.
From 1983 onwards the defendants' P &amp; I risk business was insured by the
club, following an approach from Lloyd's placing brokers instructed on the
defendants' part by San Diego brokers.
From 1987 the club made a number of supplementary calls on members. Also the
defendants sold a number of their vessels and as a result the club claimed
release calls in respect of the cessations.
The claims were resisted by the defendants on various grounds, including the
ground that the insurance was on a fixed premium basis, and that the club
was not entitled to require them to meet supplementary or release calls.
It was the defendants' case that in relation to that ground the club was
unable to sustain an arguable case sufficient to justify maintenance of the
order for service out of the jurisdiction. If they failed on that point,
they submitted that San Diego, not London, was the forum conveniens
(appropriate forum) for the proceedings.
Rule 2(2) of the club rules provided that 'these rules and any contract of
insurance between the association and an owner shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with English law'.
Rule 32(1) provided 'the owner hereby submits to the jurisdiction of the
High Court of Justice in England'.
Mr Bueno for the defendants submitted that the burden was on the club to
persuade the court to reach a tentative conclusion that it had a good
arguable case. He was probably right. (See The Olib (1991) 2 Lloyd's Rep
108; Overseas Union Insurance v Incorporated General Insurance, FT, December
4 1991.)
A telex dated November 17 1983 from the club to the defendants, stated 'it
is not possible for us to offer owners a fixed premium quote'.
The club had demonstrated a good arguable case on the merits on this point.
Mr Bueno contended that the burden of proof was on the club to satisfy the
court that England was clearly and distinctly the appropriate forum for
trial of the action, relying on Spilidia (1987) AC 460.
Were it not for the defendants' submission to the jurisdiction, that would
be correct.
But the authorities plainly established that the court would give effect to
the jurisdiction clause, though still retaining a discretion to grant a stay
if the defendants could show strong reasons against holding the parties to
their bargain (Chaparral (1968) 2 Lloyd's Rep 158; El Amria (1981) 2 Lloyd's
Rep 119).
Mr Bueno invited the court to disregard or at least to attach very small
weight to the jurisdiction clause, and argued it was one-sided.
That submission was unacceptable in relation to a clause drafted in standard
form typical of the rules of P &amp; I Clubs generally, where the member was
both insurer and insured.
Approximately three months after issue of the writ the two defendants
together with all the individual vessel-owning corporations, issued
proceedings in San Diego against the club, its management companies, and a
number of other defendants including individuals who were executives in
various broking firms.
They sought declarations that they were not liable for the supplemental and
release calls. Against the club and its managers, they sought damages for
fraudulent misrepresentation; and against the brokers, damages for
fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation, and for breach of duty.
Mr Bueno submitted that the centre of gravity of the dispute was San Diego.
He said the disputes must be looked at as a whole, and it was essential that
they should all be tried in one action to avoid the risk of inconsistent
decisions.
For that purpose, he submitted that the San Diego action, in which the
parties involved in all aspects of the dispute had already been joined, was
the appropriate forum.
He submitted that the English choice of law clause should be given little or
no weight, since there were no difficult issues of English law which would
appropriately be reserved for decision by an English court. He said the main
area of dispute would be on issues of fact.
That was not accepted.
Serious questions of law would arise as to the relationship of principal,
agent and sub-agent vis-a-vis the club. Those questions would turn on issues
of principle and construction of documents.
Construction of the documentary material was, as the authorities plainly
showed (see The Magnum (1989) 1 Lloyd's Rep 47, 51), best undertaken by the
English courts employing English law canons of construction. If the task
were undertaken in San Diego the court, in applying English law, would need
to rely on the expert evidence of English lawyers brought to California at
considerable expense. That was a serious disadvantage.
The English choice of law clause was a significant consideration in favour
of English jurisdiction.
The centre of gravity of the case was in London, not California, because:
(i) On all main issues the crucial point of contact was in London between
London brokers and the club. The witnesses relevant to those aspects were in
London and the relevant documents would mainly be in London.
(ii) The defendants' claims against third parties, which were by no means
all London based, would only arise if the club succeeded in its claim.
(iii) It seemed likely that the number of witnesses for each jurisdiction
would be evenly balanced, and that the preponderance of documents would be
in London.
The crucial point was the risk of inconsistent decisions, which the court
must strive earnestly to avoid (El Amria).
There should be no difficulty, if the defendants chose to do so, in their
joining the US third parties in the English proceedings as necessary and
proper parties.
The present action was in being for a considerable period before the
defendants launched their San Diego proceedings, and it was their decision
to sue in San Diego which created the possibility of a conflict.
Those considerations, coupled with the conclusions that English choice of
law and the English centre of gravity strongly favoured proceedings in
England, led to the conclusion that the appropriate forum was London.
For the club: Jonathan Gaisman (Richards Butler).
For the defendants: Antonio Bueno QC and Robert Bright (Hill Taylor
Dickinson).

FT  19 JUN 92 / Technology: Driving through the border lines - Europe's
cellular phone network is poised to cross national frontiers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Good news is on the way for car telephone users in Europe who find their
phones stop working as soon as they drive over a national border into an
incompatible network.
From the beginning of next month, the first commercial examples of a new
generation of cellular telephones, able to receive and make calls anywhere
in Europe, come on sale in France and Germany.
They are based on a common European standard, called GSM (Global System for
Mobile Communications), to be phased into full operation over the next five
years in the 17 countries that have agreed to use the GSM norm. The current
patchwork of six conflicting regional systems will, for the time being,
continue alongside the new network.
It is no surprise that France and Germany are the first to introduce GSM.
They badly need to catch up. A large number of businessmen and women cross
their long frontiers regularly and yet both countries have among the lowest
use of cellular phones in Europe, well behind Britain, Switzerland and the
Scandinavian countries.
GSM, a digital transmission system, is radically different from the current
analogue generation in that it delivers ultra-clear sound and a range of
clever functions. In addition, a GSM phone can be plugged into a fax
machine, a computer or even a teletext terminal like France's Minitel system
without a modem.
Each subscriber has a smart card which stores personal information. This is
slotted into the phone to make it work. The card, rather than the terminal,
contains the subscribers' telephone number and tells the operator where to
send bills. If necessary, a subscriber can leave his phone at home and rent
or borrow a portable one, whether in a taxi or someone else's office. The
card can also be programmed so that calls can be forwarded. Incoming calls
can be held while the phone is engaged, and outgoing or incoming calls can
be barred.
Baptised 'Itineris' in France, the system is being launched by France
Telecom in Paris and Lyon from July 1, with the German system to follow a
week later. France Telecom plans to cover three more cities by the end of
the year and 90 per cent of France by 1995. SFR, the French private sector
cellular phone operator, plans to unveil its own GSM system shortly.
Itineris phones, initially supplied by Orbitel, Nokia and Motorola, sell for
between FFr10,000 (Pounds 1,000) and FFr15,000, slightly cheaper than
existing cellular phones. Prices could even halve in the next five years as
European sales grow and allow the producers of terminals to achieve
economies of scale, predicts Marcel Roulet, president of France Telecom.
Clearly, it is too early to say how Itineris will go down with the French
public. The coming year will be for 'technical evaluation', with commercial
take-off likely in 1993, believes Roulet.
Already, technical experts point to two possible improvements. Some users,
they fear, might be baffled by the big choice of functions, so some form of
automatic guidance would be desirable, like the help function on a computer
program. Second, because equivalent chips on GSM smart cards and existing
French telephone charge cards are positioned differently, it will be
impossible in the future to use the same bit of plastic for both.
However, GSM should avoid the capacity limits imposed by the shortage of
radio frequencies, which affects the two analogue networks, France Telecom's
Radio 2000 and SFR. Instead, digital technology will increase capacity in
the European countries that have applied the standard to 20m, compared with
just 3.4m subscribers now.
On the strength of this, France Telecom believes that around a fifth of its
income from telephone charges will come from cellular services by the end of
the decade.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A computer that does not need software to tell it how to perform a task
appears to be a contradiction in terms, but that is what Ricoh, the Japanese
office equipment company, unveiled yesterday in Tokyo.
Don't start erasing software files from your computer just yet. Ricoh's
experimental neural computer - so called because it imitates human thinking
processes - can only learn 16 characters at a time, even though it is put
together with microchips that are blazingly fast.
This is indeed a primitive performance for a computer that is 500 times
faster than the typical workstation, and four times faster than
supercomputers.
Ricoh's neural computer is none the less a tantalising hint of things to
come. In a year or so Ricoh hopes to install a small neural computer in its
office photocopiers - one that will learn by itself, without software that
sets parameters, how to adjust all of the interrelated variables that
determine whether a copy comes out with even tone.
The neural computer itself is not a new concept. Other Japanese companies
like NEC, Fujitsu and Hitachi have developed neural computers that learn
from their mistakes until they can perform a task. The theoretical advantage
is that these machines should eventually be able to deal with ambiguous
situations and to make judgments, like the human brain. They could be useful
for text or voice recognition.
Morio Onoe, professor emeritus at Tokyo University and general manager of
Ricoh's R&amp;D group, says that existing neural computers have combined the
traditional central processing unit with software that imitates the
functions of neurons of the human brain.
Ricoh's computer, by contrast, has no central processor, just 16 neurons
that operate in parallel and are linked together. This allows them to
perform at much higher speed. The computer is fed information in digital
form and given a goal, but left to its own devices on how to achieve it.
So far the tasks performed are simple. The computer, for example, was
yesterday fed equations describing the rolling of a ball on a tilted
see-saw, and told to move the see-saw to prevent the ball from falling off
the end. After a dozen of so failed attempts, the computer managed to
balance the ball in the middle.
Onoe says the advances have come in two areas: the dispensing of software
that instructs the computer how to perform specific tasks and higher-speed
processing of complex problems.
The experimental computer is put together with 32 neural chips which Ricoh
developed two years ago and which have a single neuron per chip. The
computer has a processing speed of 128 MCPS (million computing connections
per second).
The drawback of Ricoh's neural computer is that it requires a huge amount of
computing power to learn something useful.
Onoe says the first practical applications for the computer will be in
mechanical control, where the variables are relatively few. While Ricoh
plans to use the technology in its own office machines, it would also
welcome partners to develop control systems for factory robots. Use of the
computers for voice or character processing will require much larger
capacity.
Don't expect the machines to appear on desk tops any time soon. But they
could eventually learn not only to process words, but print out letters from
dictation and eventually, perhaps, write the memos on their own too.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Management: How stress can make you tick at work - Why some
people can cope well with pressure while others crack up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNY COZENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stress was once thought to affect only top executives, who had important
jobs and stomach ulcers to prove it. But then psychologists discovered that
people further down the occupational ladder were even more stressed than
those at the top.
The floodgates opened and researchers started describing stress in
taxi-drivers, stockbrokers, policemen, doctors and even in vicars. Far from
being ashamed that they felt under pressure, people began boasting about the
stress in their professions.
Academic research has now gone a step further: increasingly it shows that
although some jobs are stressful, certain types of people survive, while
others have problems.
The idea is that factors within the individual are as important as ones
related to the job. Some researchers put it down to personality, others to
early experience, and some are even looking for the job satisfaction gene.
This new line of research emerged in the 1980s, striking a chord with the
general emphasis placed during the decade on the individual.
Most of the studies have followed people over a long period of time to see
how they feel about their jobs, to assess their symptoms, and see what
effect life events like marriage and relocation have had.
One US study using 10 years of survey data on almost 5,000 men and women
looked at the effects of major life changes on well-being.
It found that individuals' scores were fairly constant over time, even when
they had been through stressful events, like changing jobs or partners or
moving house.
The research does not doubt that most of us feel bad as a reaction to things
going wrong or to being under severe pressure. Instead, its message is that
the majority find it relatively easy to adapt to these changes, but the rest
will react with symptoms of stress.
A review by two American stress researchers looking at a number of studies
of life stress - occupational or otherwise - concluded that around 25 per
cent of the population was chronically stressed.
Another long-term American study found that teenagers' dissatisfaction with
their jobs correlated closely with how the same people saw their jobs when
they were in their fifties.
An employer's natural response to this new body of research might be to page
the in-house psychologist to identify the stressed workers with a view to
firing them. Once that small, dissatisfied group had been removed, the boss
could then make the job as difficult as possible, knowing the rest could
take it.
It is not as easy as that. While some people are more susceptible to stress
than others, stressful aspects of the environment do lead to poorer
performance and mistakes, whoever is doing the job.
A recent study of banks in the US found that the attitudes of the counter
staff in any particular branch were closely reflected by the attitudes of
the customers.
So if the bank clerks were unhappy with the personnel policy of their
branch, this was reflected in the customers' attitudes about service.
Moreover, stressed people sometimes have other attributes that the
organisation needs: a recent study of junior doctors showed that those who
were chronically stressed over a couple of years had more empathy with
patients than the cheerful lot.
There is plenty of evidence that providing psychological help within the
workplace, as the Post Office and some commercial organisations have done,
reduces the symptoms, improves job satisfaction and discourages absence. A
recent study by Professor Cary Cooper and his team from the University of
Manchester Institute of Science and Technology found that absence fell by 50
per cent on average for those who had attended the Post Office counselling
service.
There is also evidence that introducing a more general stress management
course - one that reaches cheerful employees as well as those who might be
more in need - reduces mistakes. For example, an American study looked at 67
hospitals and found that the number of litigation suits for malpractice was
related to levels of stress in the employees. When they introduced an
organisation-wide stress management programme, drug prescription errors were
halved and litigation suits fell from 31 in one year to nine the next.
In a recent study that I conducted with a colleague looking at change in
attitudes after therapy, we found that not only did people's symptoms fall
after therapy but they also liked their jobs more. They enjoyed being with
their colleagues more, felt much more competent and felt their workload was
less demanding. They were even more satisfied with their pay.
Not everyone reacts to their job in a way which makes them stressed. What
matters is that difficult jobs continue to be be improved, and that the
people who find themselves affected are given the help they need, wherever
it's possible.

FT  19 JUN 92 / The Property Market: New lease of life in landlord-tenant
fight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The relationship between landlords and tenants in the UK is being strained
to breaking point. At a time of recession, the workings of the institutional
lease - 25-year leases with upwards-only rent reviews - is seen as unfair,
archaic and inflationary by tenants throughout England and Wales.
Now the gauntlet has been thrown down by tenants. Businesses have been
encouraged by the glut of empty commercial space and their own
recession-induced financial pressures to challenge the system openly. The
landlords are defending a leasehold structure that provides secure flow of
income, thus underpinning the value of property and so the finances of
institutions, property companies and banks which lend to the sector.
Critics argue that the existing system damages the economy by allowing
landlords to profit at the expense of tenants, many of whom are already
struggling under the burden of recession. 'Landlords continue to make money
in a recession and in doing so they serve to deepen the recession,' says Mr
Giles Henschel of the Covent Garden Business Group, which represents local
businesses.
Some economists believe that the institutional lease distorts the letting
market in the way that unions are seen to distort the labour market.
Lettings on new leases, which account for just 4 per cent of the market, are
the only part of the system that function smoothly.
According to Professor John Burton of the European Business School, rents
are dictated by legal and institutional factors, making them 'impervious to
market forces'. This 'constitutes a 'core' inflation problem for the British
economy as a whole,' he says.
But the debate about leases goes beyond academic concern. For the structure
of leases is having a critical impact on many businesses.
Last month, Tandy, a multiple retailer, closed down a profitable store in
Chatham, Kent, because it could not reach agreement on the lease. 'We are
making a stand,' says Mr Barry Liddle, chief executive of Tandy. 'If we have
to lose 30 or 40 stores I am willing to do that. If not, nothing will
change.'
Tenants are demanding the following changes: An end to 25-year leases.
Criticism of such long leases was recently voiced by Mr Andrew Buxton, chief
executive of Barclays, which rents a large amount of property across the UK.
'Twenty-five years leases are required for financing purposes or perhaps to
satisfy the institutional desire for long investments, but how many
businesses plan 25 years ahead?' he asked.
'At the moment it is a classic case of industry satisfaction and
institutional desire being put before the customer. Very few other
industries can take such a complacent attitude,' he adds.
An end to upwards-only clauses in rent reviews. Tenants argue that the
upwards-only ratchet is inflationary and unfair to tenants at a time when
rents should be falling. Boots, the chemist, recently won a court battle
over its refusal to accept an upwards-only review on a retail property in
London centre.
An end of privity of contract, which allows landlords to claim unpaid rent
from previous tenants. The controversy about tenants' continuing liability
has come to a head over the past year as unexpected bills for rent due on
former premises have pushed many struggling companies into receivership.
The case for reform has been promoted by Sir John Banham, director-general
of the Confederation of British Industry. 'Small businesses are being forced
into bankruptcy through no fault of their own,' he says.
A change in the way rent reviews are determined. Critics say that reviews
are often unreasonable because they ignore vacant property, the state of the
economy and the ability of tenants to pay.
Professor Burton believes that rent review disputes should be resolved by
the Lands Tribunal, with members drawn from both sides of the commercial
property leasing market.
Mr Henschel of Covent Garden Business Group dislikes this system because
decisions are made at arbitration by surveyors, who may have a tendency to
favour landlords. 'No surveyor will put his neck on the line because future
business depends on his ruling. I would like to see a parliamentary review
of the whole system,' he says.
An end to confidentiality clauses. If rents are to be set according to
recent deals in a particular area, there should be greater openness about
those deals, perhaps through a national rent register. 'Confidentiality
clauses inflate market levels,' says Mr Henschel.
Some aspects of the commercial property lease are likely to yield under this
pressure. The Lord Chancellor, for example, is expected to recommend a
change in the law on privity of contract. Tenants would no longer be
responsible for the rent owed by their successors for the duration of the
25-year lease; instead they would guarantee only their immediate successor.
The proposals would probably only apply to leases that were assigned after
the legislation came into force.
'This is in the spirit of a good British compromise,' says solicitor Mr
Steven Fogel of Titmuss Sainer &amp; Webb, who was on the Law Commission's
working party which recommended a change in the law. Bankers are concerned,
however, that a change would make property finance, which relies heavily on
the quality of a tenant's covenant, even more difficult to secure.
Market pressures alone are forcing some landlords to accept shorter leases
and break clauses in heavily over-supplied markets such as the City of
London. Some institutions make a virtue out of necessity when accepting a
15-year lease on the grounds that a building often needs refurbishment by
that stage anyway.
But most property owners are uneasy about changes to the lease structure.
They fear that yields would be pushed up to compensate for the diminished
security of income, with severe effects on the property industry and banks.
The Prudential, one of the largest UK landlords, will fight any changes to
the 25-year lease, says its chief executive Mr Hugh Jenkins. 'Only as a last
resort would we give up long-held terms of trade. In this market we would
rather let the rents take the strain than start monkeying around with lease
structures,' he said.
Landlords argue that tenants should take the rough with the smooth, having
enjoyed the benefits of a system that gave them artificially low rents
during much of the 1980s and the rights to assign their leases at large
premiums. They believe that tenants will stop clamouring for change once an
economic recovery gets under way.
'During the 1980s a lot of tenants made a fortune from selling their
leases,' says Mr Peter Hunt, chairman of Land Securities, the UK's biggest
property company.
The abolition of privity of contract and upwards-only review clauses would
be a setback to the industry and ultimately the economy as a whole, adds Mr
Hunt. If such changes took place, pension funds would be less likely to
invest in property with the result that yields would rise, new developments
would be constrained and ultimately rents would go up.
The counter-argument is that the rigid institutional lease has inflicted
damage on tenants and the economy and, in the end, on the property market
itself.
Tenants have been put under extra pressure to the point where they have been
put out of business. Long leases have made landlords complacent and
neglectful of their customers. Lease inflexibility at a time of falling
rents has prevented tenants from assigning their old leases and so created a
huge oversupply of new buildings in areas such as central London.
Apart from the changes concerning privity of contracts, these arguments are
ultimately likely to be settled by the relative strengths of landlords and
tenants. The optimists say that the concessions wrested by tenants will only
last for as long as property is in oversupply. Tenants, however, are
determined to cling onto any gains they make. They are not merely seeking
short-term advantage; they wish to change the industry for good.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tories under pressure on prospects
for recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN is on its way to economic recovery, Mr John Major, the prime
minister, assured the Commons yesterday. He refused, however,to commit
himself to a precise timetable.
A sceptical Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, reminded the prime minister
that 12 months ago he said the recovery would start 'within weeks' and that
Britain would be out of recession by the end of 1991.
'Why are you being so coy now?' he demanded.
Mr Major told Mr Kinnock not to be misled by a newspaper report that Mr
Norman Lamont, the chancellor, had said that Britain was three years away
from full recovery.
What the chancellor had actually said, he insisted, was that in 'two or
three years' people would look back and see that the right decisions had
been taken at the critical time.
The prime minister described the rise in unemployment in May to 2.7m as
'very unwelcome' but stressed that the rate of increase was slowing.
He also emphasised the recent economic indicators showing that manufacturing
production had risen three months running, while the rate of increase in
average earnings had slowed to 7 per cent.
Welcoming any movement from the 'trough' caused by government policies, Mr
Kinnock taunted the prime minister over his earlier optimistic forecasts,
which had proved to be 'absurdly wrong'.
Mr Major claimed that the recovery was 'later than it might have been'
because of Mr Kinnock's 'boasting' that he would be heading a Labour
government after the general election.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, warned that unemployment was
rising inexorably towards 3m. He protested: 'It is now more than two months
since the election, and only a handful of weeks before school leavers come
on to the register.'
Tories jeered when Mr Ashdown accused the government of being 'so consumed
by self-satisfaction' that it offered no policies and no hope for those
without jobs.
The prime minister retorted that Mr Ashdown's only answer was to subsidise
the inefficient, the uneconomic and the out of date.
'Clearly we need the right sort of economic policy that will sustain
long-term employment prospects. That is what we are putting in place,' he
said.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Shorts to cut another 400 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Belfast Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORT BROTHERS, the Belfast aircraft and missiles manufacturer, announced
400 job losses yesterday.
The company blamed the redundancies on the recession and said they would
affect all areas of its operations.
Shorts, acquired by Bombardier, the Canadian transportation group, in
October 1989, has given 90 days' notice to the Department of Economic
Development.
The company has ceased production of the FD360 commuter aircraft and is
running down production of the 323 Sherpa military aircraft for the US Army
and National Guard.
Shorts said there would be some enforced redundancies but efforts would be
made to keep them to a minimum.
The company added: 'Basically, the reduction has been recession-driven.
'Some of our biggest customers, such as Rolls-Royce, British Aerospace and
Boeing, have been scaling down operations, so there has been a knock-on
effect.'
The job losses come on top of 300 redundancies announced in January, but
overall employment at Shorts is still ahead of the level at the time of its
privatisation.
The company is Northern Ireland's largest private employer with 8,200 in the
province and a further 600 in mainland Britain, compared with a total of
7,500 at the time of the sell-off.
Shorts has doubled turnover in the past 2 1/2 years to about Pounds 400m a
year.
The previously loss-making operation recorded a profit of Pounds 26m in
1990-91.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Fears over dropping Tube line extension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COST of abandoning the Pounds 1.7bn planned extension of London's
Jubilee underground line may be more than Pounds 200m, according to the
London Docklands Development Corporation.
Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian developers of Canary Wharf in London's
Docklands, had promised to pay Pounds 400m over 25 years towards the line.
Canary Wharf was put into administrative receivership last month, putting
the Jubilee Line extension in jeopardy.
The government has said it will not go ahead with the line unless a
purchaser can be found for Canary Wharf that would be willing to take over
O&amp;Y's commitment to the extension.
In a briefing paper submitted to the Department of Transport, the London
Docklands Development Corporation says that taxpayers and shareholders of
construction companies have already spent more than Pounds 100m in
preparatory work on the extension.
London Transport says it has spent Pounds 100m on bringing designs to the
point at which contractors can tender for work. Contractors are estimated to
have spent a further Pounds 20m on preparing bids.
The development corporation estimates that the costs of aborting the
extension may be a further Pounds 35m to Pounds 85m. It says that delaying
the work would only increase costs.
'Office and other space will fill up very much more slowly if the Jubilee
Line extension is postponed or cancelled,' it warned.
Contractors have submitted bids for almost all of the 10-mile extension.
London Transport has already identified an all-Italian consortium led by
Italstrade, the Italian engineering group, as being likely to win the
contract a 2 1/2 -mile section.
The development corporation refutes the view that government funds earmarked
for the extension could be used for other transport projects. It said: 'Even
if the Treasury agreed to such an approach, which is doubtful, London
Underground and British rail would not be able to bring sufficient projects
forward at such short notice.'

FT  19 JUN 92 / EOC warns of pensions 'debacle'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is in danger of creating 'another poll tax debacle' over its
handling of the equalisation of state pension ages for men and women, the
Equal Opportunities Commission warned yesterday.
Many people would not know until it was too late that they might be
substantially worse off under pension measures being considered by the
government, the commission said. Women in particular stood to lose if their
age of entitlement to state pension was raised from 60 to 65 - the present
retirement age for men.
The commission accused the government of failing to consult widely enough
and of blocking some options for reform with 'a selective wall of
statistics'. A Department of Social Security paper on options was issued at
the end of last year. Organisations are to make their comments by the end of
this month.
Moves to equalisation follow a European Court ruling in 1990 that different
retirement ages for men and women are discriminatory. The DSS consultation
paper favoured a common retirement age of 63, while the pensions industry
and organisations such as the British Institute of Management want a
flexible scheme, with retirement possible between 60 and 70.
Ms June Bridgeman, commission deputy chairwoman, said the government was on
the verge of a decision that would shape the pensions system for the 21st
century.
'It will affect many things besides the immediate question of setting a
common age for old-age pensions,' she said. It concerned everyone, yet most
people were unaware that the consultation was taking place.
'It is crucial that the changes make people generally better - not worse -
off and win popular support. If it does not do these things, the government
is in danger of risking another poll tax debacle.'
The commission yesterday described a common pension age of 60 as the 'best
and simplest option'. It said millions of women already had a raw deal and
the commission was concerned that equality might be achieved by making women
even worse off.
She added: 'The largest number of complaints received by the EOC from men is
about pensions. For equality to be achieved to the detriment of women would
be a bitter pill for both sexes.'

FT  19 JUN 92 / Pressure likely for Courts Charter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LORD Chancellor's Department is expected to come under pressure today at
the prime minister's six-monthly seminar on the Citizen's Charter to explain
its failure to produce a final draft of the Courts Charter for consideration
by ministers.
The department, which is responsible for drawing up a charter to guarantee
standards of service for court users in England and Wales, is one of only
two government departments that has yet to publish charter material.
The delay in publication of a final draft is believed to be largely due to
difficulties in setting meaningful standards for court proceedings which
will meet the conflicting interests of all court users.
Contrary to recent speculation, the Courts Charter for England and Wales
will not be based on the Scottish justice charter, which covers standards of
service in the police and the prison service as well as the Scottish courts.
The English charter will cover four main areas: improvements in court
procedures, building on initiatives resulting from the review of civil
justice; improvements in facilities in court buildings, adding to the
standards already set for the court building programme; customer care; and
business standards, which will set out how court proceedings should run.
Improvements to facilities in court buildings will include such things as
separate waiting rooms for witnesses and defendants, facilities for
children, improved access for the disabled and changes to the layout of
courtrooms to make them more friendly without reducing security.
Customer care will cover such matters as complaints procedures, the wearing
of name badges by court staff, and keeping court facilities clean.
Standards are causing difficulties for the department because the interests
of defendants, prosecutors, witnesses, jurors, judges and court staff often
conflict. A defendant on bail pending trial may want as long a delay as
possible before the case comes to court, while the prosecution may want to
move to trial quickly.
The charter is expected to be ready for publication by August but is not
expected to be published until after the summer parliamentary recess.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Congress spending axe threatens supercollider

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TEXAN politicians yesterday began a desperate rearguard action to try to
save the Superconducting Supercollider, after the House of Representatives
voted to kill the Dollars 8bn scientific research project.
The supercollider's goal is to find out more about subatomic particles by
smashing them against each other in a 54-mile oval tunnel, now under
construction near Waxahachie, Texas.
But the project, derided by its critics as a pork-barrel scheme with no
scientific value, appears to have fallen victim to Congress's new enthusiasm
for cutting expenditure.
'The House was looking for a blood sacrifice and they found it in the
Supercollider,' said Congressman Joe Barton, in whose district Waxahachie
lies.
Supercollider funding could be restored by the Senate, but its leading
backer there, Senator Bennett Johnston of Louisiana, warned yesterday that
it faced an uphill fight.
The spending axe in Congress has been much sharpened by a recent surge of
attention to the spiralling federal budget deficit. A bid to amend the
constitution to require the government to balance its budget narrowly failed
last week to win the necessary two-thirds majority in the House.
After signalling their attachment to the principle of fiscal rectitude, the
280 members who voted for the constitutional amendment appear to be shy of
showing hypocrisy by voting so soon afterwards for lavish spending projects.
House committees have agreed in recent days cuts in defence spending - and
even in the Congressional operating budget.
The supercollider has had its critics since it was proposed in 1986, among
them scientists who feared it would take almost all the federal money
available for scientific research. The administration claimed at first that
it would cost Dollars 5.3bn, but its estimate has since risen to Dollars
8.2bn, and critics' estimates run to more than Dollars 11bn.
Texas chipped in Dollars 1bn in order to lure the supercollider to
Waxahachie, but the administration has claimed all along that a quarter to a
half of the cost would be met by foreign participation.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Venezuela trims growth projection
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VENEZUELA has reduced its economic growth projections this year to 4-5 per
cent, from the 5-6 per cent or more forecast at the start of the year, Mr
Pedro Rosas, finance minister, said.
Due to lower than expected world oil prices, the central government and
PDVSA, the national oil company, have both ordered big budget cuts, thus
reducing projected economic growth from the record high expansion of 9.2 per
cent in 1991.
It is still uncertain what impact Venezuela's ongoing political crisis and
the accompanying uncertainty will have on the economy. Last February, a
group of army officers tried unsuccessfully to oust the government of
President Carlos Andres Perez. Since then, the country has been afflicted by
violent anti-government protests.
The minister said the government was now expecting a general fiscal deficit
of about 5 per cent of GDP for 1992. Of this, 3.5 percentage points would be
caused by PDVSA's ongoing capital investment programme while 1.5 points
would be due to the central government's fiscal shortfall.
PDVSA will finance most of its deficit through international credits, the
minister said. In April, Mr Gustavo Roosen, PDVSA president, said his
company's external debt was Dollars 2.17bn and its obligations to Venezuelan
banks the equivalent of Dollars 923m.
The Venezuelan government registered surpluses in its consolidated budgets
in both 1990 and 1991. The national oil company provides the government with
most of its tax revenue, and officials now expect petroleum exports this
year to total about Dollars 10.9bn - down from an earlier estimate of
Dollars 13.5bn.
Despite the political problems, foreign investment during the first four
months of 1992 was considerably higher than for the equivalent period last
year, Mr Rosas said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OFFICIAL figures showing a sharp rise in the US merchandise trade deficit in
April provided an early warning yesterday of possible adverse trade trends
later this year, if the US economy continues to revive and demand remains
subdued elsewhere.
The deficit jumped from Dollars 5.4bn in March to Dollars 7bn, the greatest
shortfall for 17 months, the Commerce Department said.
The unexpected deterioration reflected the combined impact of a jump in
imports and a fall in exports.
Wall Street analysts were taken by surprise, having forecast a deficit of
about Dollars 5.7bn.
The deterioration in April, however, overstates the rate at which the
deficit is widening. For the first four months of the year, the deficit grew
modestly - to Dollars 21.6bn compared with Dollars 20.8bn last year. Exports
were up 6.5 per cent relative to last year.
Separate figures yesterday for weekly unemployment insurance claims
indicated continuing softness in US labour markets. Claims fell 2,000 in the
week ending June 6 to 407,000.
A significant improvement in job prospects is not expected so long as the
claimant total remains stubbornly above 400,000.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE prospects for Congressional approval of the US contribution to the
Dollars 24bn international assistance package to Russia have been much
improved, but not guaranteed, by President Boris Yeltsin's speech to the US
legislature on Wednesday.
Yesterday, Mr Bill Clinton, the prospective Democratic presidential
candidate, had breakfast with the Russian president and afterwards urged
Congress to take swift action.
Mr Clinton rejected any link between the provision of assistance and Russian
progress in identifying US prisoners of war who may have been held on
Russian soil. 'We have no reason to believe that he (Mr Yeltsin) will not
proceed in complete good faith on that. We would not even know about that
issue had he not raised it,' Mr Clinton said.
The Congressional leaders still have not set a date for formal consideration
of the aid package, the grandly titled Freedom Support Act. Yesterday,
Senator John Warner, the Virginia Republican, predicted a vote 'in a week or
10 days.'
Mr Yeltsin's speech and personal lobbying seem to have swayed doubters on
both the Republican right and Democratic left.
The most conspicuous convert was Senator John McCain, the Republican from
Arizona and a former prisoner of war, while Senator Patrick Leahy, the
Vermont Democrat and sceptic on the efficacy of aid to Russia, conceded that
the Yeltsin speech 'will win him a lot of votes.'
However, Congress still expects President George Bush to follow the
successful summit by canvassing hard in the days to come on Capitol Hill.
The president said he thought support in Congress for Russian aid was now
'overriding.'
Critical voices still resound, even so. For example, Mr Ray Flynn, mayor of
Boston, said yesterday it was 'outrageous' that Congress should 'bail out'
Russia while providing 'a pittance' to American cities.

FT  19 JUN 92 / China tightens credit to prevent economy overheating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA'S central bank has acted to tighten credit in an attempt to prevent
the economy from overheating as a result of rapid growth, its governor said
yesterday.
Li Guixian, governor of the People's Bank of China, said during a visit to
London that the economy had been growing at an annual rate of 11 per cent
during the first quarter of 1992. Industrial production was up by 18 per
cent, and imports by 23.5 per cent, while exports were up only 12.5 per
cent.
The People's Bank has imposed special reserve requirements on banks -
increasing the proportion of their deposits which they must lodge with the
central bank - and tightened credit ceilings.
Li said it was considering increasing interest rates, but would not take a
final decision for two or three months.
China's economy has gone though a series of boom-bust cycles in the past
decade. The most recent retrenchment was relaxed last year, and economic
growth was boosted in January when Deng Xiaoping, the country's paramount
leader, exhorted the nation to undertake more radical reform.
Asked whether the latest measures would cause another sharp drop in economic
growth, Li said: 'I do not think that we will have another similar slump as
in earlier years, because we have learned from experience. Now we are mainly
relying on monetary policy to maintain GNP growth at 8 to 9 per cent.'
His actions to restrict credit may indicate official fears that inflation is
running at a higher level than figures suggest. First quarter statistics
show inflation of 5 per cent, compared with last year's 3 per cent. However,
economists believe that in some areas inflation is significantly above the
official figure.
Li said he would take measures to tighten credit if inflation was above 10
per cent, and to loosen if inflation fell below 5 per cent. 'I am very
confident that inflation this year will be under control at 6 to 7 per cent
because our monetary policy is effective.'
The government was continuing with reforms of banks and state-owned
industries, Li said, such that loans would be made only to profitable
enterprises making marketable, high quality products. However, he admitted
that the bankruptcy law had not been applied because there was no social
security system to cope with unemployment. 'No effort is being spared to
improve the social security system. Once it has been fully established, the
bankruptcy law will be fully and strictly implemented.'
On the development of China's stock markets, Li said it was unlikely that a
third exchange - after Shanghai and Shenzhen - would be opened in the next
three to five years. It was necessary to strengthen regulations and increase
public awareness. China should take note of previous stock market collapses
in other countries: 'It is more important to learn from the experiences of
failure than success.'

<TEXT>
SOME 200 trade unionists died in the 15 months to March as repression of
trade union activity continued in many parts of the world, the International
Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) says in a report published today.
The ICFTU's annual report to the International Labour Conference in Geneva
cites abuses of trade union rights in 85 countries, including 2,000 cases of
detention and numerous instances of death threats, abductions,
disappearances, harassment and spying.
Colombia - where over 50 trade unionists were murdered in the survey period
 -China, Guatemala, El Salvador, Iran, Peru, Sudan and South Africa 'are the
world's most dangerous places for trade unionists', the report says.
The ICFTU says an increasing number of companies, often multinationals
operating in developing countries, are resorting to mass dismissals to
oppose workers' basic demands. More than 50,000 workers were sacked in the
survey period for activities recognised as legitimate under international
conventions, the report notes.
It also draws attention to evidence in a growing number of countries of
connivance between managers, landlords and local security forces.
The previous year's report listed 264 deaths and 2,422 detentions, citing 72
countries.

<TEXT>
THE Japanese authorities yesterday declined to intervene to support the
country's flagging stock market, which fell yesterday to its lowest level
since October 1986.
The Nikkei index lost 400.24 points to close at 16,045.56 - some 8 per cent
down on the week so far and 59 per cent off its all-time high recorded in
1989.
The market has been hit by gloomy reports about the state of the economy,
including a survey by the Bank of Japan published last Friday which showed
business confidence had sunk to a five-year low. Investors' fears have been
compounded by warnings from securities companies of further declines in
corporate profits.
Many investors and businessmen alike believe the economy will recover only
if the government and the Bank of Japan take measures to boost growth,
including an increase in public works spending and a further cut in interest
rates.
Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Keidanren, the employers' federation,
yesterday called for extra public works spending to boost the economy. But
Ministry of Finance officials said there were no plans to intervene in the
stock market or to increase public spending. Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance
minister, told a Diet committee that the government was still monitoring the
effects of a public works spending package announced at the end of March and
of a cut in the official discount rate in April. However, many economists
believe it is a matter of time before the government and the Bank of Japan
consider further such measures.
Japan is under US pressure to make a strong pledge to promote growth at the
Group of Seven leaders' summit in Munich early next month. Reuter adds:
Japan said yesterday it extended a record Dollars 11bn (Pounds 6bn) in
official development assistance in 1991, up 19.6 per cent from the year
before.
The sum accounted for 0.32 per cent of gross national product against 0.31
per cent in 1990, the Foreign Ministry said.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Beijing opposed to cabinet posts for Hong Kong Democrats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA yesterday made its most direct intervention yet in the politics of
Hong Kong when a senior official said Beijing would oppose the appointment
of any member of Mr Martin Lee's United Democrats to the colony's Executive
Council, or cabinet.
Mr Guo Feng Min, the Chinese head of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group
(JLG), said in Beijing yesterday that such appointments would not be
conducive to the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong.
Mr Guo was speaking after the 23rd meeting of the JLG, a meeting which was
noteworthy for the Chinese departing from the agenda to remind Britain that
the Basic Law - the Chinese-drafted constitution for Hong Kong after 1997 -
would not be amended before the handover to provide for more directly
elected seats to the colony's legislature.
Mr Guo's remarks were an attempt to limit the room for manoeuvre by Mr Chris
Patten, Hong Kong's governor-designate, before he arrives in the colony on
July 9. Mr Patten was widely expected to bring Mr Lee and some of his
colleagues into his cabinet.
The Democrats represent most of the democratically elected politicians in
the colonial legislature following last September's elections.
But Mr Guo's remarks make plain what many have long suspected: that Beijing
sees no role in Hong Kong's political life for the Democrats, whose
involvement in anti-Chinese government activities after the June 1989
Tiananmen Square uprising has made Beijing deeply suspicious.
Last night, the Hong Kong government issued a brief riposte. A spokesman
said that 'appointments to the Executive Council were entirely a matter at
the discretion of the governor.'
China's intervention in local politics came on the day when four members of
Hong Kong's cabinet broke ranks with the government and issued a paper
calling for cuts to one of the core projects in Hong Kong's multi-billion
dollar airport development.
The decision by the four, all members of a conservative grouping known as
the Co-operative Resources Centre, will give added comfort to Beijing which
is arguing with Britain about the cost of the airport. This week's meeting
of the JLG produced no sign of when and where China proposes to meet Britain
to discuss the issue of airport finance.
Mr Allen Lee, Mrs Celina Chow, Mrs Rita Fan and Mr Edward Ho joined 16 other
members of the CRC to call for cuts of HKDollars 5.5bn (Pounds 380m) in the
cost of construction of a railway that is planned to link the urban areas of
Hong Kong with the colony's new airport at Chek Lap Kok.
Their proposals would cut the cost of the railway from HKDollars 22.2bn to
around HKDollars 17bn in March 1991 prices.
Their call marks a reversal by the four who, as members of the governor's
cabinet, approved the financing plans for the airport and related projects
earlier this year. Mr Ho is also a director of the MTRC, the
government-owned entity which has contracted to build and finance the
railway.
Their break with government policy throws into question their continuing
membership of the cabinet. It also undermines the position of those who have
been objecting to Mr Martin Lee's membership of the cabinet on the grounds
of his refusal to observe 'collective responsibility'.
The government said it would study the CRC's paper and consult the MTRC as
to its feasibility. An MTRC executive said last night that the changes
proposed would damage the financial viability of the project.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Turkmens revert to the days of the Khan: The certain result
of Sunday's presidential election in Turkmenistan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE LEVINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOTERS go to the polls on Sunday to elect a president in the former Soviet
republic of Turkmenistan. They know who the winner will be. Mr Saparmurad
Niyazov, the former Communist party boss, is standing for a further term and
has brooked no opposition.
A committee of the republic's compliant ruling council approved his
candidacy and allowed no others to register. The state-run newspapers and
just about everyone on the streets say no one really minds.
Mr Niyazov has clearly instilled fear in the local population - few will
criticise him, even privately. The ubiquitous response to anything but
routine questions about Mr Niyazov is, 'People don't speak about that.'
At the same time, political analysts add that Turkmens look for central,
strong leadership, and note that Mr Niyazov won the October 1990 election
with 98.3 per cent of the vote. 'If you had all the possible opposition
candidates registered, possibly Niyazov's victory would be only 92 per
cent,' said a western resident.
The Benetton shop in downtown Ashkhabad purveys, for hard currency, a
colourful selection of beachwear. And buyers snapped up five new Renaults
this month at the former Soviet republic's first western trade fair. But
modernity is coming only fitfully to Turkmenistan, which is still ruled
largely like the nomadic, desert kingdom it once was.
The conservative Mr Niyazov is in many ways as powerful as was the Khan of
Merv whom the Bolsheviks destroyed. Turkmenistan's series of Khans had power
of life and death over their subjects before the 20th century.
'Communism here was just the old feudalism in red colours,' said a Russian
who grew up in Ashkhabad. 'Now the system has just passed back to the old
way.' More to the point, said an ethnic Turkmen, 'In this country there are
not laws. There are instructions.'
Mr Niyazov was educated in St Petersburg and is Russified. Indeed, he is
said to consider Russia something of a big, wiser brother, to be consulted
on the various foreign proposals that cross his desk.
Mr Niyazov rose through Party ranks and was appointed Turkmenistan's first
secretary by then Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in 1985. He is an
engineer by education and is married to a Russian. His excellence as a
political strategist, was demonstrated by his survival after the Soviet
Union's collapse in December.
In a land where, until relatively recently, you had to be able to recite
your tribal background and ancestors for seven generations to get anywhere,
Mr Niyazov is an orphan with no provable ancestry at all.
In addition, though, there is the former Communist party structure built up
over the last seven decades. Mr Niyazov juggles them. 'His power comes from
the past, and from his personality. He's a very capable man,' said an Asian
scholar on the region. Helping to strengthen Mr Niyazov's position as well
is the absence of Moslem fundamentalism despite a largely Sunni Moslem
population.
Mr Niyazov has concentrated power in his office and that of two lieutenants.
They are his trade minister, Mr Valeri Otsersov, an ethnic Russian; and his
investment committee director, Mr Atah Chariov, who has ancestors from the
important Tekke tribe of Merv.
This concentration makes Mr Niyazov's 16-member ruling council largely
superfluous, and frustrates investment initiatives by foreigners and locals
alike.
As factories and flats quickly go private throughout the former Soviet
Union, Mr Niyazov has declared that in Turkmenistan no dwelling shall be
sold for a decade, and that the state will relinquish no share of its
enterprises.
Mr Niyazov's conservatism is rooted at least partly in fear of the business
'mafias' that have sprung up elsewhere in the former Soviet Union, according
to state officials. 'If we give up state property to private people, there
will just be a lot of theft,' said Mr Abdi Kuliev, foreign minister.
Western and regional interest has been high. The wealth expected from
Turkmenistan's natural gas and oil - 10,000bn cubic metres of proven natural
gas reserves and 213m tonnes of oil, according to the state - has attracted
ample attention. Turkmenistan is negotiating to supply Ukraine and other
republics for hard currency, while Italian interests are seeking to arrange
a barter deal under which they would finance a refinery. But foreign
approaches have so far run up against the republic's go-slow attitude to
development.
Its location between China to the east and Iran and Turkey to the west and
south are also selling points. One project going ahead is a venture with
Iran to build a railway which provide the final link of a track from Beijing
to Istanbul.
Mr Niyazov has lavished attention on his frequent foreign visitors, housing
some in the old Communist party hotel and holding banquets in their honour.
But this attention - representatives of General Motors and Rank Xerox have
called this month - has not quickened his pace of reform.
He apparently feels in no rush. 'The people here have nothing against the
old traditions,' said a Russian professional based in Ashkhabad. 'That's why
Niyazov's position is quite stable.'

<TEXT>
MR Anand Panyarachun, the Thai prime minister, yesterday called for close
co-operation between the government and the private sector to revive the
country's economy and avoid a repeat of last month's political violence.
His comments, made in his first speech since his deadlock-breaking
appointment on June 10, referred indirectly to two key issues that need to
be resolved if public confidence is to be revived.
These are the kind of government that will emerge after elections in August
or September, and what will happen to military commanders who are still in
their posts despite being blamed for using weapons of war to suppress
demonstrations in Bangkok (leaving more than 40 protestors killed and
several hundred missing).
Mr Anand echoed the views of many analysts by attributing the conflict to
the failure of the political system, traditionally dominated by the
military, to keep up with the rapidly expanding business sector.
His call for a greater business role in easing political tension as well as
in devising economic policy coincided with moves by a group of leading
business figures to promote 'better' politicians.
The group announced yesterday it was setting up a fund to support candidates
it believed would be less likely to buy votes and to engage in the politics
of power and personal patronage that led to last month's protests.
Members of the group said they would boycott members of the five coalition
parties whose decision to back as their prime minister General Suchinda
Kraprayoon, former army chief, triggered the anti-military campaign.
Mr Anand made his speech at a seminar organised by industry, trade and
banking associations. A former diplomat and businessman himself, he said he
had accepted the invitation because the business community was determined
not to allow a repeat of the conflict. He also said he would use closed-door
diplomacy to work out a face-saving compromise on the future of the military
leaders.

subsidy dispute

<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Community has threatened to counter-retaliate against the US if
Washington goes ahead with trade reprisals over EC oilseed subsidies,
fuelling the increasingly bitter row between the world's biggest traders.
At today's meeting of Gatt's governing council, the EC will offer the US
negotiations on trade concessions in other areas to compensate for the sales
lost by American soyabean producers under the oilseed subsidy regime.
Washington has said it wants the subsidies dismantled. But indications were
yesterday that the US may be willing at least to discuss compensation terms,
thereby avoiding a head-on collision in the Gatt meeting.
On June 9, Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, published a list of EC
exports worth about Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1bn) a year, from which about
Dollars 1bn-worth will be selected for imposition of prohibitive tariffs if
the two sides cannot reach a negotiated agreement.
A Gatt disputes panel has twice condemned the EC's oilseed subsidies,
originally paid to processors and now paid to farmers, for violating a 1962
accord with the US under which oilseeds - soyabeans, rapeseed and sunflower
seeds - enter the EC duty-free.
The American Soyabean Association claims it has lost sales of Dollars 2bn a
year as a result, though the US administration puts the figure nearer
Dollars 1bn. Even so, it is the largest retaliatory package Washington has
ever contemplated.
EC officials said yesterday that Brussels would be justified in
counter-retaliating against unilateral US reprisals, which are outlawed by
Gatt. 'If one party goes outside Gatt, the other is not bound by Gatt rules
either,' one senior official said.
The disputes panel recommended speedy action by the EC either to dismantle
the oilseed subsidies or negotiate compensating concessions, in the absence
of which the US should be authorised to take reprisals. But if the US
rejects an EC compensation offer, trading partners may be disinclined to
sanction retaliation. Gatt officials say its legal system 'is being
stretched to the limit' by the oilseeds case.
Today's Gatt council meeting will hear a call by Costa Rica for
consultations with the EC over a Brussels decision to extend quotas on
bananas from Central America. Costa Rica, which says the decision breaches
international fair trade rules, says it will take the case to a Gatt
disputes panel if the decision is not rescinded.
The council will also hear requests from Albania, Estonia, Moldova and
Turkmenistan for Gatt observer status ahead of possible membership. Gatt
officials say other CIS states have indicated their intention to apply for
observer status; Slovenia has said it wants to open membership talks.

former Soviet Union, east German producers have suffered an unmitigated
disaster.
Only two years ago West Germany still managed DM28bn (Pounds 9.5bn) in
exports to the Soviet Union, but this fell to DM18bn last year. The decline
was even more dramatic than it appeared as the figure included east German
exports for the first time. Sales to all former Comecon countries, as a
percentage of total German exports, were 4.1 per cent in 1990 and 2.7 per
cent last year. In the heyday of German trade with the East in the
mid-1970s, nearly six per cent of German exports went to Comecon buyers.
Mr Karl-Hermann Fink, managing director of the eastern trade board of German
companies trading with the East, is pessimistic. He forecast a further slide
in German exports to the former Soviet market this year of between 20 per
cent and 30 per cent.
Although there were a few hopeful signals, most large west German companies
with sizeable exports to Moscow had registered the alarm signals early
enough to enable them to switch to other markets. Mannesmann, for example,
cut output and sought alternative markets for its pipes, with some success,
in North Africa and South America.
But companies such as Mannesmann have kept their manufacturing capacity and
retain a presence to try to prevent competitors from capturing orders when
they pick up. The company is following potential energy ventures in the
Commonwealth of Independent States, such as the Sakhalin oil and gas project
in which Japanese companies are also interested.
Some smaller German companies, which sold a large proportion of their output
to Moscow are hurting far more. The situation is worse for those not being
paid by former Soviet buyers and not covered by the German Hermes export
credit guarantee agency.
The shoe company, Salamander, one of the few production-oriented German
joint ventures with a Soviet partner tried, not very successfully, to bridge
Soviet payments problems by selling east German shoes to the Russians. The
company, however, sought other markets to compensate and reported healthy
earnings in April.
The impact of the trade collapse on east German companies has been a
nightmare for the Treuhand agency which still owns nearly all the large
producers who were dependent on the Soviet market for 60 per cent and more
of their output.
SKET, the heavy engineering manufacturer in Magdeburg had placed high hopes
on deals with Ukraine to modernise steel mills it had built there. The
projects were to have been paid for by shipments to the West of Ukrainian
rolled steel. The Ukraine even gave the necessary counter-guarantee needed
in order to finalise the granting of Hermes credits. But in practice the
state guarantee proved to be inoperable, a predicament which could take
another year or so to be resolved.
Waiting this long would be fatal for SKET and other east German
manufacturers such as Deutsche Waggonbau, Europe's largest producer of rail
carriages which exported 75 per cent of its output to the Soviet Union.
'These companies need a breathing spell in order to develop new products and
new markets in the West', Mr Fink said. But in the meanwhile they will
require even higher subsidies from the Treuhand agency, which cannot allow
them to collapse as it would deal a fatal blow to the cities and towns where
they are located.
The difficulty in finding alternative markets for products developed for the
former Soviet Union is illustrated by the 15 new ships ordered by Soviet
shipping lines and built at Warnemunde, where they still lie at berth.
Although the vessels are covered by Hermes credits, the buyers did not agree
to the altered rate of currency exchange. The idle ships cost the builder
nearly DM800,000 a day in insurance and maintenance charges and cannot be
re-sold elsewhere without costly rebuilding.
Hermes credits to the former Soviet Union were sharply cut to DM5bn this
year, mainly for the Russian Republic, and will probably only be slightly
extended, Mr Fink said. This month Bonn government said that Moscow, after a
long delay, had given the necessary counter-guarantees to allow Germany to
release current Hermes export credit guarantees to east German companies.
A significant expansion of Hermes guarantees was politically impossible,
according to Mr Fink, because of the already strained Federal budget. The
collapse in orders from the CIS may also deter potential western buyers from
placing orders with east German companies suspected of being candidates for
closure by the Treuhand.

THE STATE-OWNED Telephone Organisation of Thailand (TOT) yesterday awarded a
contract to install and operate 1m provincial telephone lines to a Thai
consortium planning to buy equipment from Canadian, French and Japanese
companies.
The deal is the second part of a controversial expansion plan designed to
ease Thailand's badly-congested communications system. Talks on the first
part were concluded last year when a contract was awarded for 2m new numbers
in Bangkok to the Charoen Pokphand Group, whose associates include British
Telecom.
The government hopes investors' confidence will recover, now that a big
infrastructure deal has been struck so soon after last month's political
violence. A number of other infrastructure projects are under way or could
be started soon, making up for investors' hesitancy after the recent
political troubles.
The TOT board meeting was held in extraordinary circumstances. The chairman
is Gen Issarapong Noonpakdee, army commander, who has not been seen in
public since the army suppressed the anti-military demonstrations last
month. The board met at the closely-guarded Army Operations Command
headquarters.
The winning consortium is led by Loxley Bangkok, a Thai trading company. Its
main suppliers will be Northern Telecom Canada and Alcatel, of France, and
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, of Japan. The original project was a single
package for all 3m new numbers. The civilian government of Mr Anand
Panyarachun, installed by the military after last year's coup, then fell
into conflict with the general by ruling that the deal, originally awarded
to the CP Group, was too monopolistic.
The convolutions of Thai politics have brought the Anand government back to
power following the protests and the resignation of the pro-military
government set up after the March general election. The generals still
dominate state enterprise boards, but pressure is growing for them to be
replaced by appropriate professionals.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Delors warns of 'crisis and stagnation'

<TEXT>
IF THE Maastricht treaty on European union is not ratified, there will be
'stagnation and crisis', Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European
Commission, warned yesterday.
He predicted that the Community would then turn into a free trade area. 'At
the smallest confrontation between member states, there would be a new
crisis, until in the end the free trade area itself would disappear,' he
said in an interview with Figaro newspaper.
Asked about the implications if the treaty were to be defeated in the French
referendum, Mr Delors said: 'There would be a general panic, because France
has made its mark on the construction of Europe ever since the beginning.
And as far as I am concerned, the dream would have been shattered.'
Mr Delors acknowledged that he and the Commission had both come in for
criticism: 'I am contested, that is true, but so much the better: it proves
that I am not an antiseptic and immovable bureaucrat behind his desk.'
But he parried the implication that the Commission was to blame for the
current crisis in the Community. 'The Commission is under scrutiny, but it
is not alone: there is also the council of ministers, the European
parliament and the national governments.'
A narrow majority among the 17 European commissioners has come out in favour
of letting a small number of European Free Trade Association (Efta)
countries into the Community, without any further institutional changes
beyond those already contained in the Maastricht treaty, writes David Buchan
in Brussels.
This view, emerging from a confidential Commission discussion on Wednesday,
will be relayed to tomorrow's meeting of EC foreign ministers, called to
prepare next week's Lisbon summit where enlargement will be discussed.
The recent surge in anti-Maastricht opinion has changed the Commission's
prevailing sentiment, which had been that key changes like more majority
voting - beyond that enshrined in the Maastricht pact - would be needed for
a more numerous Community to function efficiently. The predominant Brussels
view is now that, for a three or four Efta states to join the EC in the
1990s, only technical adjustment to the number of commissioners and MEPs
would be necessary.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE long-dormant Western European Union is today expected to agree to give
itself a genuine military role, including the capacity to send peace-keeping
forces to flashpoints like Yugoslavia and Nagorno-Karabakh.
Foreign and defence ministers of the nine-nation organisation are meeting
outside Bonn to discuss what practical military steps can be taken to
implement their declaration on a common European defence identity, attached
to the Maastricht treaty.
That declaration, which states both that WEU will be developed as 'the
defence component of the European union' and as a means to strengthen the
European pillar of the Atlantic alliance, is diversely interpreted by member
states.
While Britain has put the accent on the organisation's continuing close
relationship with Nato, France, Germany and some other members see its role
as leading gradually, but inexorably, to a common European defence policy
under the political direction of EC governments.
These ideological differences, however, should not prevent ministers from
taking decisions on the forces to be assigned to the WEU for purposes
ranging from peace-keeping and humanitarian operations to military
intervention outside the Nato area of the Gulf War type.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the British defence secretary, has proposed that
European multinational units such as the planned
Dutch-Belgian-German-British Nato division, the UK-Netherlands amphibious
force or the Franco-German corps could be put at the disposal of the WEU.
The ministers are also due to give the green light to a 40-member WEU
military planning cell.
In a declaration to be issued at the end of the meeting, the WEU will offer,
as did the Nato Council earlier this month, to make its forces available for
peace-keeping operations at the request of international organisations such
as the United Nations and the 52-nation Conference on Security and
Co-operation in Europe. Decisions on whether to take part in such operations
will be taken on a case by case basis by WEU member states.
The ministers are also due to invite Greece, Denmark and Ireland, the only
three EC members not already in the WEU, to join the organisation as full
members or observers. Of these three, only Greece has applied for full
membership.
The WEU will examine ways of enforcing international sanctions against
Serbia, possibly with a naval blockade in the Adriatic, Mr Wim van Eekelen,
its secretary general, predicted yesterday, David Buchan reports from
Brussels.

FT  19 JUN 92 / German president attacks 'power crazy' politicians
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN politicians, undermined by growing voter apathy, declining popular
esteem and scandals over pay and privileges, are now facing criticism from
Mr Richard von Weizsacker, the president.
In an interview with two leading newspaper correspondents, the former
leading light in the ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU), attacks the
lack of leadership in the German political establishment, accuses the
parties of being 'power crazy' and irresponsible, and questions the
direction of the country's unification policy.
His words have been seized upon by government opponents as an attack on the
ruling coalition, and in particular on his former party colleague,
Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
That was swiftly rejected by the president's office. The reality is that his
criticism was aimed across the entire German political establishment,
represented by the hot-house of political intrigue in Bonn.
Mr von Weizsacker is concerned at the way party political debate appears to
be undermining the constitutional basis of German democracy.
The result is that inner-party debates, and the regular 'coalition
negotiations' between the three parties in the German government, have
become the real decision-making bodies - leaving the classic balance between
executive government and parliamentary control little more than theoretical.
The president's intervention follows a series of local elections in which
all the traditional political parties - his own CDU, the main opposition
Social Democratic Party (SPD), the minority Free Democrats (FDP), and the
Bavaria-based Christian Social Union (CSU) all lost ground, partly because
of voter apathy and partly to the radical extremes of left and right.
Scandals over politicians' pay rises have undermined their public standing
in Hamburg and Saarland. In the latter, Mr Oskar Lafontaine, deputy leader
of the SPD, has just survived a no-confidence vote.
Two opinion polls show unprecedented popular scepticism, with those doubting
the veracity of their political leaders rising from just one third in 1977,
to 60 per cent this April. In another poll only 28 per cent believed the
right people were leaders.
What appears to have worried Mr von Weizsacker most of all, however, is the
scepticism directly related to unification. In the east, mistrust of
politicians is highest of all, and real unemployment is still rising. In the
west, there is unwillingness to face the full costs of helping the east.
The president has already appealed for a new national tax to pay for the
eastern economy. That was flatly rejected by Chancellor Kohl and his
colleagues. His latest intervention should step up the debate.

FT  19 JUN 92 / Fall in value of arms trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD arms trade in large conventional weapons dropped by 25 per cent in
value last year to Dollars 22.114bn, according to the annual survey of the
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute published yesterday. The
break-up of the Soviet Union was the main reason, Sipri argues.
During the 1980s that country was responsible for around 40 per cent of the
global trade, but that figure had shrunk to less than 20 per cent by last
year. The value of Soviet weapons exports last year was roughly 22 per cent
of that recorded in 1987, says Sipri.
The US is now by far the largest exporter of large conventional weapons,
accounting for 51 per cent of deliveries last year to a value of Dollars
11.195bn. The dissolving Soviet Union accounted for Dollars 3.93bn worth of
arms exports. But Sipri reveals that Germany is now the third largest
conventional arms supplier in the world with sales last year valued at
Dollars 2.015bn - far more than China (Dollars 1.127bn), Britain (Dollars
999m) and France (Dollars 804m).
Last year there was a marked reduction in arms imports to the developing
world - Dollars 12.336bn from Dollars 16,720bn in 1990. However india was
the largest arms importer (Dollars 2.009bn), followed by Israel (Dollars
1.676bn), Turkey (Dollars 1.559bn) and Afghanistan (Dollars 1.220bn).
Thailand increased its arms imports substantially.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERIAL agreement on a European company statute - which would simplify
the legal position of multinational companies in the Community  - has again
been postponed, possibly until the end of this year.
EC internal market ministers, meeting in Luxembourg yesterday, failed to
narrow their differences over the European Commission's proposals.
The measure would allow multinational companies to become societes
europeennes (SEs). They would be subject to a single EC company law, instead
of having to meet different legal requirements in each member state.
Portugal, which holds the EC presidency until the end of this month, has
pushed hard for adoption of the statute. But its efforts have been thwarted,
partly because of persistent objections from some member states about
proposals to encourage employee participation at board level in SEs.
Britain, for example, argues that such provisions could set a precedent for
binding EC company legislation later. One Portuguese official said yesterday
that he thought the UK had missed a good opportunity to agree a directive
over the past six months.
British officials said the technical nature of the measure meant it would
probably not be considered by ministers until near the end of the UK's
six-month presidency, which follows Portugal's.
Member states were last night still discussing a directive aimed at
protecting national treasures once internal EC frontiers are removed on
January 1, 1993. British auction houses are concerned that a measure,
allowing a wide definition of national treasures which cannot be exported,
could restrict the European art market. Ministers were still discussing
compromise proposals yesterday evening.

ENSO-Gutzeit, the Finnish pulp and paper group, has returned a FM76m loss

a FM182m (Dollars 42.4m) loss for the same period of 1991, writes Robert
Taylor in Stockholm.
Net sales went up by 9.3 per cent to FM3.36bn. The company said internal
rationalisation measures would ensure a continuing revival towards
profitability, but operations would still be showing a loss by the end of
the year.
Mr Jukka Harmala said competition had kept prices down, particularly for
fine papers and publication papers, while the paperboard market was stable
and demand for Scandinavian sawn timber increased.

<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission is threatening to fine seven sugar companies in the
UK, Ireland, France and Denmark on suspicion that they have been illegally
protecting their home markets from competition, and so forcing prices up.
The Brussels competition directorate has sent five sugar producers - among
them, British Sugar, Tate and Lisle, and Irish Sugar - and two sugar trading
companies a formal 'statement of objections', alleging infringements of the
anti-cartel Article 85 of the Treaty of Rome.
The companies have the chance to present their case in a formal hearing in
Brussels, before the Commission takes any final action. The latter could be
some months off.
The action, which came to light yesterday in a statement by Greencore, owner
of Irish Sugar, to the Dublin Stock Exchange, follows a seven-month
investigation from September 1990 to March 1991.
The Commission alleges that from mid-1986 until the start of its
investigation, the companies concerned took a variety of actions which
insulated their national markets, particularly the UK, from any effective
competition from abroad.
Article 85 bars companies from pursuing practices which generally 'have as
their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of
competition' within the EC.

A US delegation of officials yesterday pressed India to attend a conference
of South Asian countries on nuclear non-proliferation.
India is not a signatory to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT),
despite having exploded a nuclear device in 1974, arguing that the treaty
discriminates in favour of established nuclear powers.
Pakistan proposed the five-nation conference for a nuclear weapons-free
zone, to which China - another nuclear power that has refused to sign the
NPT - is to be invited.
While the US still feels that India should sign the NPT, it sees the
conference as the next best alternative. India has not specifically turned
down the proposal, but believes it does not tackle the issue of nuclear
proliferation. It also feels that the Pakistan proposal does not take into
account its security needs. Officials said the proposed conference does not
place controls on Pakistan's clandestine nuclear weapons programme.
Also discussed at the two-day Indo-US talks were US curbs on spares and
components for research and development in India's missile technology
programme. The curbs were imposed after India recently tested an
intermediate ballistic missile despite US disapproval.

THE prospect of a break-up of the Commonwealth of Independent States came
closer yesterday after Ukraine stepped up its conflict with Russia over the
Crimea.
An adviser to Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk said Russia would be asked
for guarantees that it would not claim Ukrainian territory at the
Ukrainian-Russian summit next week.
Professor Mykola Mykhalchenko warned that Russian failure to agree to
Ukraine's demands - particularly acute because of the Russian parliament's
claim to Ukraine's lush Crimean peninsula - could precipitate the break-up
of the CIS. Ukraine also hopes to resolve the row over division of the Black
Sea fleet and will seek agreement with Russia on deported people which would
enable the Crimean Tatars to return home.
'Ukraine cannot be a member of an association together with another state
which has claims on its territory,' Professor Mykhalchenko said.
Prof Mykhalchenko said it was unlikely Russia would accede to Ukraine's
terms, and that Ukraine may try to force Russia out of the CIS on the
grounds that it is threatening other member states. Ukraine is unlikely to
succeed in this but it has enough allies in the CIS, such as Azerbaijan, to
cause a big rift.
Prof Mykhalchenko said the meeting at the Russian Black Sea resort of
Dagomys was Russia's last chance to acknowledge Ukrainian sovereignty and
show that 'we, the Ukrainians, are not the ones who are souring relations.'
His comments suggest Ukrainian politicians are proving immune to Russian
efforts to apply economic pressure. According to Ukrainian economic experts,
last week in Moscow Russian negotiators said that Russia would charge world
prices for oil the moment Ukraine introduces a separate currency and leaves
the rouble zone.
This could be devastating for Ukraine, heavily dependent on Russian
subsidised oil, but in Paris this week Mr Kravchuk said Ukraine would
introduce a separate currency, the hryvnia, in August or September.
At Dagomys Ukraine will seek an agreement on prices and the introduction of
the hryvnia and a formula for dividing the former Soviet Union's debts and
assets. Prof Mykhalchenko said failure to agree 'could have very negative
effects on relations'.

TIME appeared to be running out yesterday for the prospects of the London
School of Economics being able to relocate to County Hall, as it wishes.
Although a meeting of ministers yesterday afternoon did not take a final
decision on the future of the headquarters of the former Greater London
Council, giving the LSE a last chance to put together a formal bid for the
site, it seems unlikely that the LSE and the government will be able to
agree quickly a deal that would be acceptable to all sides.
The building has already been bought by Japan's Shirayama Corporation from
the London Residuary Body - the organisation winding up the affairs of the
GLC.
Ministers pointed out yesterday that if the government did exercise its
power to require the LRB to accept a lower price for the property - as would
almost certainly be the case if it went to the LSE - the arrangement would
still have to be agreed with the London boroughs, whose amounts from the
proceeds would correspondingly be reduced.
The government has come under some cross-party political pressure to
exercise its powers and help the LSE acquire the property, but there are
powerful pressures in the opposite direction as well: just three days ago
Shirayama itself threatened to pull out of the deal unless the government
clarified its stance on the future development of the site.
Answering questions in the Commons yesterday, Mr John Redwood, environment
minister, said a statement would be made 'in the near future.'
His pledge came in response to a question from Mr Tony Banks, Labour MP for
Newham North West, who tabled an early day motion earlier this week urging
the government to delay the building's sale while 'full and detailed
consideration' was given to the proposal that it become the LSE's home.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Cohse to drop opposition to trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE health service union Cohse looks likely to drop its campaign against
self-governing hospital trusts, Catherine Milton writes.
The move would mean the 200,000-strong union, which represents about 20 per
cent of health service staff, accepting the end of centralised collective
bargaining in the NHS and concentrating on local deals. It would remain
opposed to the principle of trusts.
NHS bargaining has traditionally been highly centralised, but the spread of
trusts has led to fragmentation. The union believes that centralised
bargaining will remain important for setting national minimum rates.
Discussions will take place at regional and branch level in the next few
weeks.

FT  18 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Increased selling pressure hits
shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEPRESSING news from the corporate sector, but this time from overseas,
added to the woes of a UK stock market already upset yesterday by a firm
rejection overnight from Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the
exchequer, of another early cut in domestic interest rates.
Later, the chancellor followed his strong line on interest rates with a
speech reaffirming the government's commitment to the Maastricht proposals,
in particular to economic convergence and to sterling's entry to the narrow
bands of the ERM range; the market read this as final rejection of political
pressures for an immediate base rates cut.
But it was shock waves from Amsterdam, where Philips warned that
second-quarter profits would be below the comparable period, that finally
upset the UK stock market. Having been 21 Footsie points down in reaction to
Mr Lamont's overnight speech, London was rallying successfully towards
midsession, halving its early fall and regaining the Footsie 2,606 mark,
until the news from Philips threw it into reverse.
Share prices moved lower for the rest of the session and the FT-SE 100 Index
closed 17.9 down at 2,598.4. The market's view of near-term prospects was
fairly gloomy, although most strategists took a cautiously positive view of
the day's list of important economic data.
The rise of 0.3 per cent in retail sales in May was slightly above
expectations, while a 0.2 per cent gain in manufacturing output in April was
regarded as an indication of an uptrend in production.
'Today's economic data are consistent with a slow, steady recovery in the
economy,' said Mr Ian Harnett of Strauss Turnbull, UK securities arm of
Societe Generale. But he drew attention to further data due this week, led
today by wages and unemployment statistics.
The international blue chips were held in check yesterday by firmness in
sterling, which hurts overseas revenues.
On a more domestic level, nervousness was caused again by the prospects of
tomorrow's expiry of the June future on the FT-SE Index. Large positions,
both bullish and bearish, remain open on the June Footsie contract and
prices of the underlying blue chip stocks could be in for heavy and
contrasting pressures as the leading securities houses strive to balance
positions ahead of Friday's futures expiry deadline.
Seaq-reported trading volume remained unimpressive at 423.7m shares, against
391m in the previous session when retail business remained well short of the
Pounds 1bn mark regarded as the sign of a healthy equity market. However,
traders said that 'some stock came out yesterday'.
While not too happy to see the Footsie 2,600 mark so quickly abandoned
again, market professionals held to the view that, while share prices may
remain uncertain for the near future, the relative value of equities against
gilts will provide support. The mildly positive response to yesterday's
economic statistics suggested improved confidence but the Philips statement
turned the spotlight back on to the corporate sector.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE strong rally in stock index futures recorded on Tuesday petered out
following overnight falls in Tokyo and the lack of news on a cut in interest
rates, writes Joel Kibazo.
June opened around 2,605, well down from Tuesday's close but at a premium to
cash of about 2. But it was sent into retreat by selling mainly from
independent traders and had fallen to 2,592, below the cash market level, by
9am.
After a bout of sideways trading, June recovered due to support at the lower
levels coupled with the release of two sets of UK economic data. One showed
a rise in manufacturing in April and another a slight increase in high
street sales, all of which sent the contract climbing back to 2,609.
With little in the way of features in the afternoon, June drifted lower,
while the poor opening on Wall Street ensured that any attempts at a rally
were kept in check. June closed at 2,599, down 21 on the previous close but
just ahead of the underlying cash market. Turnover at 6,810 was poor.
Traded options remained dull with turnover reaching a mere 25,939 lots, of
which 11,476 was recorded in the FT-SE 100 option. GEC was the most actively
traded stock option. It traded 1,620 contracts, with the February 240 calls
the busiest series.

FT  18 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Optimistic Fed report falls
on stony ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US STOCK markets accelerated their decline yesterday after a Federal Reserve
report that the economy continued to improve at a modest pace dampened hopes
of a further cut in interest rates, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 41.73 lower at 3,287.76. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 fell 6.06 to 402.26, while the American SE composite
lost 6.38 to 379.74 and the Nasdaq composite dropped 10.83 to 553.24.
Turnover on the New York SE was heavy at 243m shares, while falls outscored
rises by 1,422 to 381.
Prices opened weaker in the wake of the steep fall in Tokyo to a 5 1/2 -year
low and on concern about the fragility of the US markets. The selling,
however, did not start in earnest until after midday, when the Fed's 'Beige
Book' report on business conditions across the US was released.
The book indicated that the economic recovery was continuing, and that
inflationary pressures in the economy were light. Investors, however, chose
to sell on the report, probably because they believed the news of improving
economic conditions further reduced the chances of another interest rate
cut. A late burst of program selling added to the downward pressure, sending
the Dow tumbling past its support level of 3,300.
The losses were spread throughout blue chip issues. General Motors fell
Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 41 5/8 , General Electric Dollars 1 to Dollars 76
3/8 , Westinghouse Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 17 1/2 and Coca-Cola Dollars 1
3/8 to Dollars 39 3/8 . Coca-Cola was also affected by reports that the soft
drinks group had told analysts that second-quarter estimates of 42 to 44
cents a share were appropriate.
Telefonos de Mexico shares, heavily bought by US investors in the wake of
the group's privatisation last year, continued to suffer, falling a further
Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 45 3/8 .
Upjohn declined Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 32 1/4 in heavy trading after the
drugs group said it did not expect second-quarter net income to exceed the
70 cents a share earned a year ago. The news depressed some other drug
stocks, with Pfizer dipping Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 67 5/8 , Merck Dollars
1 1/2 to Dollars 47 1/4 , Glaxo ADRs Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 25 3/4 and
Schering-Plough Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 50 3/8 .
AMR, parent of American Airlines, eased Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 62 5/8 on
news that it will probably report a second-quarter loss because of higher
fuel prices and the recent air fares war.
Medical Care International dropped Dollars 6 1/2 to Dollars 48 1/2 after
agreeing to merge with Critical Care America.
Canada
THE Toronto market mirrored the Wall Street weakness, the TSE 300 composite
index finishing down 39.1 at 3,368.2 as declines outpaced advances by 347 to
221 after substantial volume of 30.2m shares valued at CDollars 361.7m.
Traders noted that the selling was broad-based, touching every sector except
the real estate and construction index.
Bramalea was a bright exception, rising 15 cents to CDollars 1.20 in spite
of reporting a first-half loss of 22 cents per share, compared with a profit
of 2 cents for the same period last year. The diversified real estate
company also halted payments on its common dividends.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Money Markets: Bullish trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADE IN the sterling futures and cash markets was bullish yesterday after
the British chancellor made a strong commitment to European monetary
convergence and the possibility that the pound would enter the narrow bands
of the European Monetary System.
The comments from Mr Norman Lamont gave a strong boost to sterling on the
foreign exchanges, pushing the pound up by a pfennig against the D-Mark to
close at DM2.9250. His remarks also boosted sterling futures. The September
short sterling contract ended up 3 ticks at 90.26, and the December contract
up 2 ticks at 90.55.
Traders said Mr Lamont's speech reinforced the bullish mood created by two
tabloid newspapers on Tuesday, both of which said that a near-term base rate
cut could be signalled by the UK authorities. The longer dates in the
sterling interbank market reflected that mood: everything from six-month
sterling libor out to one-year finished down  1/16 at 9 7/8 per cent.
The shorter dates were also softer, in spite of the large shortages forecast
by the Bank of England this week. One-week sterling libor ended at 10 3/8
per cent, from a previous close of 10 1/2 per cent. Three-month money closed
unchanged at 10 per cent, although in the morning it had been up at 10 1/16
per cent. The June short sterling contract expired at 89.94, coming into
line with that rate.
The Bank of England's operations were in the style of Monday and Tuesday.
The shorter dated Bands 1 and 2 were bought at 9 7/8 per cent, Band 3 at 9
21/32 per cent and Band 4 at 9 19/32 per cent.
In the morning, the Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 1.5bn. It
then purchased Pounds 18m of Band 3 bank bills, Pounds 7m of Band 4 bank
bills, and Pounds 331m of bills for resale to the market at 9 15/16 per cent
on July 6.
Later, the Bank bought Pounds 18m of Band 1 bank bills, Pounds 18m of Band 2
bank bills, Pounds 121m of Band 3 bank bills, Pounds 2m of Band 4 bank
bills, and Pounds 152m of bills for resale to the market on July 6 at 9
15/16 per cent.
In the afternoon, the Bank purchased Pounds 344m of Band 1 bank bills,
Pounds 12m of Band 2 bank bills, Pounds 14m of Band 3 bank bills and Pounds
2m of Band 4 bank bills. The Bank provided late assistance of around Pounds
380m.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Overt intervention by Italians
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN currencies had a turbulent afternoon on the foreign exchanges
yesterday after the Bank of Italy intervened heavily in the open market to
support the lira, writes James Blitz.
Although opinion polls suggest that the Irish people will vote 'Yes' to the
Maastricht Treaty on European union today, traders have been noticeably edgy
about the overall prospects for European Monetary Union (Emu) since the
Danes voted 'No' in their referendum. Yesterday, the lira fell victim to
uncertainty yet again: the failure of the Maastricht accord would reduce the
incentive for this politically muddled country to reduce its massive budget
deficit.
Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, fanned the flames over the Italian
currency yesterday. The bank said Italy's budget deficit could lead to a
devaluation of up to 8 per cent. Heavy lira selling ensued, the currency
dipped below L758 to the D-Mark for the first time in six months and ended
firmly at the bottom of the grid in the European Monetary System.
The Italian central bank responded with its heaviest intervention in the
market this month, selling D-Marks for lire. A Bank of Italy official was
forced to confirm publicly that the speculation about a devaluation was
'nonsense'. But at L757.50 to the D-Mark, the currency was trading close to
the intervention point, suggesting that the Italians' efforts amounted to
little more than a holding operation.
By contrast, sterling appreciated sharply against the D-Mark after Mr Norman
Lamont, the UK chancellor, underlined Britain's commitment to European
economic convergence. He also said the pound could enter the narrow bands of
the EMS when the time was right.
There was nothing new in Mr Lamont's remarks, but the market's directionless
mood made his statement seem important. Sterling rose nearly a pfennig
following the statement, peaking at DM2.9254 before closing at DM2.9250. A
mixed batch of UK indicators had little effect on the pound: May's retail
sales were poorer than expected, increasing by 0.3 per cent, and May's
industrial production figures were only marginally better than predicted,
rising 0.7 per cent.
Sterling was helped by a weaker tone to the D-Mark, which lost ground to the
US dollar. There was nothing concrete behind the US currency's strength. A
dealer said that today's holiday in Germany had led to short-term dollar
buying; another said that an Irish 'Yes' to Maastricht would weaken the
D-Mark as Emu tensions ease.
The dollar climbed more than a pfennig against the D-Mark to finish at
DM1.5780 in Europe. In New York it slipped back to a DM1.5745 close.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copy-cat contract war breaks
out in New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW York Commodity Exchange (Comex) has begun a copy-cat contract war
with the New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex) in a drive to raise its
trading volume. It has applied to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,
the US futures industry regulator, to list platinum futures and options and
palladium futures, products already traded at Nymex.
'These contracts will complement our existing metals products,' said Ms
Donna Redel, Comex's new chairman.
The exchange said that industry users had asked to have the contracts
listed, in part because traders would benefit from being able to
cross-margin platinum and palladium with its gold and silver contracts. It
plans to launch the new products immediately after receiving CFTC approval.
The move follows the news early this month that Comex intended to list a jet
fuel futures contract that would compete with Nymex's heating oil futures,
which are at present used to hedge jet fuel physical trading. Comex expects
to make a formal application to the CFTC to list the contract before the end
of 1992.
Earlier this year, Comex won CFTC approval for a Dubai sour crude contract,
although a sour crude contract began trading at Nymex in February.
The contract for platinum - the more important of the two metals - to be
listed at Comex will be for 50 ounces of 99.9 per cent purity,
specifications that match the current Nymex contract. But Nymex, which has
traded platinum since 1956, decided some 18 months ago that it would change
its contract's specifications to correspond more closely to international
standards, which now require 99.95 per cent purity.
Nymex's October 1992 platinum contract, now holding 6,137 lots of 50 troy
ounces in open interest, and those beyond that date are already for the new
purity standard.
Mr Lou Guttman, Nymex chairman, said: 'As an exchange, we have to do what
international standards demand, or else our contract becomes antiquated'.
He conceded that some in the industry might have been peeved at the change
in contract specification, but he believed that his exchange's platinum
contract would continue to enjoy deeper liquidity and that the trade would
always go where the liquidity was. Mr Guttman predicted dismissively that
Comex's new platinum futures 'will join the others on the shelf of failed
contracts at Comex'.
In recent years Comex has failed to extend its range of active contracts
beyond copper, silver and gold. According to figures from the Futures
Industry Association, trading on Comex fell 26 per cent between 1987 and
1991, from 17.9m lots to 12.6m, while trading at Nymex grew by 53 per cent,
from 22.5m to 34.4m, over the same time period.
Ms Redel, aggressively trying to achieve a turn-around in her exchange's
fortunes, is casting a wide net for new products. She has even snagged a new
financial future on the Eurotop 100, an equity index that trades at the
European Options Exchange in Amsterdam. But in the process, Ms Redel seems
to be willing to step deliberately on Nymex's toes.
Ill-will permeates relations between the two exchanges. Their
on-again-off-again merger talks failed once more last year and a decision
early this year by Nymex to withdraw from a joint project with all of the
New York exchanges, including Comex, to build a new trading floor embittered
relations further.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cuban industry goes
international - The country's first licensing round
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RUTLEDGE and PHIL WRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CUBA WILL offer eight or nine blocks for production-sharing contracts with
foreign oil companies later this year, and a British company,
Simon-Robertson (previously Robertson Research and now part of the
Stockport-based Simon Group) has won the contract to organise the country's
first licensing round. An official announcement of Cuba's new oil policy
will come on Sunday and presentations, probably involving senior Cuban
industry ministers, will be held in London and Calgary in November and
December.
A number of blocks have already been allocated to foreign companies in
separate bilateral deals. From next August a French consortium involving
Total and Compagnie Europeene des Petroles, which signed a contract with the
Cubans in December 1990, will begin drilling in its northern oil zone
blocks. Brazil's Petrobras, Canada Northwest Energy, and the Swedish
company, Torus, have also been allocated blocks.
The northern oil zone is more than 1,000 km (620 miles) long and between 80
and lOO km deep, running parallel to Cuba's northern coast and extending
into the promising and largely unexplored offshore area. It already accounts
for most of the country's domestic production (15,000 barrels of heavy crude
and and 1.5m cu ft of gas a day).
The southern oil zone consists of about 60,000 sq km, occupies practically
the whole of the onshore area and extends to adjacent offshore areas to the
south.
Cuba's state oil company Cupet was formed out of the amalgamation last
December of the upstream enterprise Union de Petroleo with the downstream
company Cuba Petroleo. At the same time a specialist subsidiary called
Commercial Cupet has been established to concentrate on dealing with foreign
partners.
The country previously depended for 95 per cent of its oil needs on the
Soviet Union, which gave gave its oil industry a distinctly downstream
character. A fourth refinery built by Cuban engineers according to Soviet
specifications has only recently been completed, giving the country a total
refining capacity of 11m tonnes a year. But there is a strong impression
that the upstream segment was tending to lag behind.
The main producing fields, Boca de Jaruco and Varadero, were discovered in
1969 and 1971 respectively. While their very heavy, high sulphur crude has
swelled Cuba's production considerably since then subsequent discoveries
proved disappointing until 1989 when a small new field, Pina, was discovered
in the central part of the southern oil zone.
It has 30m barrels of proved reserves of medium gravity, medium sulphur oil,
compared with the more than 80m barrels of proved reserves in Boca de Jaruco
and Varadero. Cuba has 20 distinct oil basins with in situ reserves
estimated at 1,100m barrels.
Ironically Cuba is now competing with its old ally the former Soviet Union
for foreign capital investment. Russia and the other states of the CIS
certainly have the oil but to date foreign companies have not always found
it easy to negotiate contracts in what is often an unpredictable and
turbulent political environment.
In contrast, evidence from recent visitors suggests that Cuba's commercial
relations with foreign companies are handled in a brisk and business-like
manner. Moreover the country has firmly established foreign investment laws
dating from 1982, which have already proved effective in attracting Spanish
capital into its rapidly growing tourist industry.
Asked if they would welcome US oil companies into Cuba, the unanimous answer
received from Cuban officials is 'yes - if their Government would let them
come'.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Government Bonds: Italian bonds fluctuate wildly on
devaluation fears

ITALIAN government bonds plunged on rumours of a devaluation of the lira
yesterday, but later recovered their losses to close slightly higher on the
day after a volatile trading session.
Dealers said the market opened on a relatively bullish note and prices rose
initially on reports that Italy's President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro could be
close to appointing a prime minister after a two-month political deadlock.
However, traders said the early gains were completely wiped out in the
afternoon by a market report forecasting that the lira would be devalued by
5 per cent. The report led to a weakening of the lira, forcing the Bank of
Italy to intervene in the foreign exchange markets. The news prompted heavy
futures-driven selling from foreign bond houses. A Bank of Italy official
was quoted dismissing the devaluation rumours as untrue.
The futures contract, which had opened at 95.45, fell from its high of 95.93
to a low of 95.26, but later traded up to end the day at 95.48.
Elsewhere in Europe, dealers noted some switching out of Germany, Belgium
and the Netherlands into Danish government bonds in anticipation of an
easing in short-term interest rates. Following the results of the Danish
referendum on the Maastricht Treaty, the Danish central bank allowed
short-term rates to move up to protect the currency, but dealers said the
rates are expected to edge lower soon.
The rest of the European bond markets saw dull activity ahead of today's
Irish referendum on Maastricht and the public holiday in parts of Europe.
UK government bonds ended the day barely changed with many market
participants waiting on the sidelines ahead of the Irish referendum.
The Liffe gilt futures contract traded in a range of 97.22-98.01 and ended
the day around 97.30, slightly up on its opening level of 97.29. The May
retail sales figures and April industrial production data released yesterday
had no perceptable impact on the gilt market, dealers said.
The Bank of England supplied some of its index-linked stock - the 4 1/8 per
cent gilt due 2030 - to the market yesterday at a price of 98 7/8 . Dealers
estimate that approximately Pounds 300m of the Pounds 500m tranche has been
sold so far.
US Treasury prices firmed slightly across the maturity spectrum in
exceptionally quiet trading.
The benchmark 30-year government bond was up  7/32 at 102 3/16 , yielding
7.838 per cent. The two-year note was up  1/32 at 100 5/16 , yielding 4.937
per cent.
Although the absence of fresh economic news left the market adrift during
the morning, there was sporadic retail and institutional buying. This,
combined with overnight gains on foreign markets, kept the long end of the
market in positive territory.
The day's only news was the release of the Federal Reserve's 'Beige Book', a
compilation of reports on business conditions in the 12 Fed districts. The
report had little effect on sentiment, however, confirming that economic
recovery was continuing, but steadily.
Later in the session, the Fed announced that next week it would sell a
record Dollars 15bn in two-year notes and Dollars 10.5bn in five-year notes,
another record.
JAPANESE government bonds closed at the highs of the day, lifted by hopes of
an easing in interest rates and helped by the US Treasury market's firmness
overnight.
Yesterday's sharp drop in the Tokyo stock market led to speculation that the
Bank of Japan may allow an easing in short-term interest rates soon. The
Nikkei average fell 507.73 points to 16,445.80, its lowest close since
October 1986.
In the futures market, the September contract, which opened at 102.00,
breached an important resistance level and ended the day at 102.33. The next
key resistance level is 103.12. In the cash market, the yield on the
benchmark No 129 issue opened at 5.47 per cent and moved to 5.405 per cent
at the close of trading in Tokyo.
AUSTRIA'S OTOB futures and options exchange is to launch a new Austrian
Traded Index (ATX) contract on August 7, Reuter reports. ATX futures and

FT  18 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Moody's predicts growth in
German bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEED to raise funds for the development of eastern Germany is expected
to lead to further growth in the German bond market, according to a report
by Moody's, the US credit rating agency.
However, this substantial public demand for financial funds may leave little
room for an increase in domestic corporate bond issuance, adds the report.
Moody's says public sector bonds currently account for 74 per cent of total
domestic outstanding issues, and the proportion is likely to increase
further as state budgets come under pressure over the next few years.
As a result, there may be less scope for domestic corporate borrowers - many
of whom have been encouraged by the recent lifting of regulations - to raise
funds in the German market.
Outstanding issues of D-Mark bonds amounted to about DM1,920bn at the end of
1991, with the domestic sector accounting for 87 per cent of the total
outstanding amount, and making Germany the third largest bond market after
the US and Japan.
The US rating agency warns that factors such as regulation and the
competitiveness of the other European bond markets could threaten the
development of the D-Mark Eurobond market. In particular, Moody's points to
possible changes in the taxation of interest income in Germany, and the
recent emergence of the Ecu bond market.
The Ecu bond market has recently taken a battering following Denmark's
rejection of the Maastricht Treaty, and is not expected to see much new
issuance in the immediate future.
However, Moody's report says the Ecu market 'could attract supranational and
high-grade sovereign and corporate borrowers, some of which might reduce
their DM Eurobond issuance levels. This could result in a lower average
credit quality of outstanding DM Eurobonds.'

rescue

<TEXT>
MR LEON Charney, a former adviser to the Carter administration who may
launch a bid for United Press International, said he was considering a plan
to revive the ailing news service through public offerings to subscribers
and correspondents, AP-DJ reports. Under the plan, UPI would become a
co-operative.
Mr Charney, who recently provided Dollars 180,000 to keep UPI operating
until June 22, yesterday met in Amsterdam with a representative of the
National Postal Lottery, which may pump as much as Dollars 3.5m into UPI
under a proposed rescue plan. The foundation raises money through lottery
sales.
The Dutch foundation's efforts are being led by Mr Bob Goldner, an former
UPI executive, and Mr Julian Isherwood, a UPI journalist based in
Copenhagen. It expects a restructured UPI to expand coverage of
environmental and Third World issues.
Mr Charney said an investment by the Dutch foundation, if it materialised,
would provide funds to keep the news wire running for an extended period
while detailed plans for a public offering could be worked out.

FT  18 JUN 92 / International Company News: AMR expects second-quarter loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, yesterday underscored the
impact of a price-cutting war on US airline profits when it warned it would
almost certainly make a second-quarter loss.
American blamed the red ink on fare price-cutting and a significant increase
in fuel costs.
American has traditionally led pricing in the industry and sparked off the
current war last April when it announced a new, simpler domestic fare
structure which sharply cut the price of its most expensive tickets. The
airline said at the time that the initiative was likely to take as much as
Dollars 100m off first-quarter revenue but could eventually raise revenue by
as much as Dollars 350m annually.
However, the new fare structure for business passengers was quickly undercut
by rivals desperate for customers, while in late May the industry
temporarily slashed tourist fares in an effort to drum up summer business.
Northwest Airlines led that round, but American then seized the initiative
with even deeper cuts.
Northwest announced this week it would raise domestic fares 10 per cent from
June 26 in what was seen by the industry as an attempt to regain lost
revenue and encourage its rivals to push up fares as well.
However, none of the big three US carriers - American, United and Delta -
made any immediate move to follow Northwest's lead.
AMR reported net income of Dollars 20m, or 28 cents a share, in the first
quarter of this year, on revenues of Dollars 3.51bn. In the second quarter
of last year the company made Dollars 10.3m, or 15 cents a share, on
revenues of Dollars 3.19bn.
The company's shares dipped yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange,
closing down Dollars 3/4 at Dollars 62 5/8.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AIR CANADA has put its five DC-8 cargo aircraft up for sale as part of
efforts to rationalise its cargo operations, writes Robert Gibbens in
Montreal.
Air Canada has failed to make its key domestic cargo operations profitable,
partly because of the long recession. The airline saw overall cargo revenues
slip to CDollars 354m (USDollars 297m) in 1991 from CDollars 413m in the
previous year.
Air Canada said it was selling the DC-8s to reduce debt and bring unit costs
in line with other carriers. The five aircraft, which were used in Canada,
are expected to fetch between USDollars 125m and USDollars 130m and should
find a receptive market.
Total cargo capacity will not change greatly after the sale because Air
Canada this spring brought into service three new 747-400 combination
passenger-cargo aircraft on its international routes.
Air Canada also plans to sell its credit card operation for about CDollars
300m.

FT  18 JUN 92 / International Company News: Bramalea seeks to restructure
its debt
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAMALEA, the embattled North American real estate developer, has suspended
dividends and asked its banks to restructure its CDollars 4.8bn (USDollars
4.03bn) debt. It also warned that it might write down the value of its land
holdings and other assets.
The company, part of the resources and financial services empire controlled
by the Toronto branch of the Bronfman family, has financial problems which
are at least as severe as those of Olympia &amp; York, the property developer
which sought protection from its creditors last month.
Bramalea has been given a more sympathetic hearing by creditors than O&amp;Y
because of a perceived willingness to share more information with outsiders,
as well as Bramalea's sustained efforts to raise cash through asset sales.
Bramalea yesterday reported a net loss of CDollars 18.6m, or 22 cents a
share, for the six months to April 30, against CDollars 3.8m profit, or 2
cents, a year earlier. Operations drained CDollars 6.9m from cash-flow,
against a positive contribution of CDollars 29.4m last year. Interest
payments totalled CDollars 105.3m.
Its shares climbed 15 cents on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday to
CDollars 1.20, but they remain far below their 1988 peak of CDollars 28.75.
The biggest millstone around Bramalea's neck is the undeveloped land in
California and southern Ontario which it bought during the last boom.
Mr Marvin Marshall, chief executive, said the asset disposal programme begun
last year was taking place 'at a slower pace than originally anticipated'.
The company has so far raised CDollars 358m and expects to generate CDollars
2bn by 1997 to reduce its debt.
He added that a new business plan was being prepared. It will include new
lines of credit to meet working capital requirements and the extension of
maturity dates on existing debt. The main lenders are understood to be
Canadian, US and Japanese banks.
In contrast with family-owned O&amp;Y, Bramalea has been able to call on its
controlling shareholder for support. Trizec, the Calgary-based developer
with a 67 per cent stake in Bramalea, recently took up the lion's share of a
rights issue, boosting Bramalea's equity base to CDollars 935m on April 30
from CDollars 884m last October. Trizec and Bramalea's combined debt of
CDollars 14bn exceeds O&amp;Y's total debt.

FT  18 JUN 92 / International Company News: Digital reorganises European
operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIGITAL Equipment, the world's third-largest information technology group
after IBM and Fujitsu, is reorganising its European operations in a bid to
restore flagging sales and profitability. The changes, which will create a
single organisation for Europe, take effect from July 1.
The reorganisation, pioneered by Digital's UK subsidiary over a year ago,
removes the company's geographically divided management structure in favour
of one focused on industrial sectors.
The company has created five industrial sectors across Europe, including
financial services, manufacturing and telecommunications. Within each sector
entrepreneurial units have been formed to concentrate on individual
industries and companies.
Mr Geoffrey Shingles, chairman of Digital's UK subsidiary, said: 'For the
first time we can look at our business industry by industry and company by
company.'
The reorganisation removes one layer of management, reducing the managerial
structure to three levels. Managements in individual countries will remain,
but they will be responsible principally for providing services and
resources to the industrial units. These include human resources, legal,
financial and communications activities.
Digital is the world's largest manufacturer of minicomputers for commercial
and technical customers, but it has been severely hit by moves to networks
of personal computers and workstations which provide equivalent power to
minicomputers at a lower cost.
It reported a third-quarter loss of Dollars 294m on operating revenues of
Dollars 3.25bn, and has been cutting staff for over two years in attempts to
restore profitability.

FT  18 JUN 92 / International Company News: IBM to market components to
rivals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE and MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines is for the first time actively seeking to
sell its semiconductor technology products to outside customers. As part of
the new marketing strategy, it has set an ambitious target of achieving
annual chip sales of Dollars 500m over the next three years.
IBM, the world's largest chip-maker, has until recently consumed internally
all of the output of its large chip plants. Previous sales to third parties
have been modest, occurring mostly in response to specific requests from
customers.
The new semiconductor marketing strategy represents a marked departure from
past practice. It is the latest example of an effort by IBM to raise Dollars
3bn in annual revenues from sales to original equipment manufacturers by
next year.
IBM's entry into the semiconductor market potentially creates a powerful new
competitor for other chip-makers. However, IBM is not expected to compete in
the market for standard commodity chips. Instead, it will focus on 'high
value-added products' in which it has a technological advantage.
Such products include IBM's thermal conduction modules, a core packaging
technology used in its mainframe computers. 'Everything made by the
technology products division, of which the semiconductor operations are a
part, is on the table,' said IBM.
The company is confident that selling a key component to competitors will
not damage its position in the mainframe market. 'Customers don't buy IBM's
mainframes only because of this technology,' it said. Other factors, such as
software, product quality and pricing were distinguishing factors, the
company said.
Excess capacity in semiconductors is one reason for the decision to sell to
third parties. Technological improvements alone have brought annual
production gains of 20 per cent to 30 per cent, the company said. 'We have
reached a point where IBM's internal consumption cannot consume all its
output.'
IBM's entry into the semiconductor market adds a new twist to the ongoing
trade battle between the US and Japan in the computer chip field. Currently,
IBM's sales in Japan are excluded from the US government's preferred method
of calculating the foreign share of the Japanese market. The US has argued
that IBM is a special case because it does not sell to outside customers.
If IBM were included in calculating foreign semiconductor sales in Japan,
the figure could increase by close to 2 percentage points, bringing it to
about 16.5 per cent, much closer to the 20 per cent target at the centre of
the tense trade row.

FT  18 JUN 92 / International Company News: Upjohn shares hit 52-week low on
earnings warning

<TEXT>
SHARES in Upjohn, the US pharmaceuticals group, tumbled to a 52-week low
yesterday after the company warned that second-quarter earnings would not
exceed last year's. The damage done by the Halcion sleeping pill controversy
was partly to blame.
In the 1991 second quarter, Upjohn had net earnings of Dollars 124.4m, or 70
cents a primary share, on sales of Dollars 859.4m, compared with income of
Dollars 111m, or 62 cents, on sales of Dollars 751.7m in the same period of
1990.
Upjohn is offering voluntary early retirement to about 1,100 employees,
taking charges against earnings in the third quarter.
On Wall Street, shares in Upjohn fell Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 32 1/4 in
heavy trading. The stock, which has been subject to merger rumours in recent
months, was quoted above Dollars 47 before concern about possible
side-effects of the world's fastest-selling sleeping pill exploded into an
international debate over the drug's safety late last year.
Although Halcion will probably remain on the market in the US, it has been
banned in the UK and the negative publicity has cut sharply into sales.
These dropped 39 per cent in the first quarter of this year. Last year,
Halcion brought in Dollars 237m of Upjohn's Dollars 3.4bn in sales.
Upjohn's troubles, however, run deeper than the problems surrounding
Halcion. Mr Theodore Cooper, chairman, said Upjohn's weak second-quarter
outlook also reflected softness in the company's US prescription
pharmaceutical business. a
The company said a move by pharmaceutical wholesalers to keep fewer
inventories on hand was an industry-wide problem.
Upjohn's agricultural businesses has also been hurt by the recession and
drought. Mr Cooper does expect earnings and sales gains for the whole of
1992.
The warning and the job cuts come on the heels of an announcement of a
temporary freeze on hirings and salary increases earlier this month.
Analysts have been concerned about Upjohn's prospects for many months,
citing the lack of new drugs in the company's pipeline and the number of
important drugs losing their patents by the end of 1994. These include
Halcion and the Xanax tranquilliser.
Mr Sam Isaly, an analyst at Mehta &amp; Isaly in New York, said: 'Upjohn faces a
bleaker and bleaker future. It will lose at least half its sales and the
equivalent in profits when its products of off-patent."
Although Upjohn expects the Food and Drug Administration to approve as many
as six new product or product line extensions this year, Mr Isaly does not
believe these drugs are big enough to compensate for the drugs coming
off-patent.

Shares in Wace Group fell 23p to 120p yesterday after the printing services

Mr Frans ten Bos, Wace's chairman, told shareholders at the annual meeting:
"In my statement with the results for year ended December 31, 1991, I said

'In the UK both our printing and pre-press operations are finding times

the market place is as tough as it has ever been. Pressure on margins

FT  18 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help boost Chemring to Pounds
2.65m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOTH ORGANIC growth and 'the successful integration of the acquisitions made
in 1991' helped Chemring Group lift pre-tax profits almost 10 per cent from
Pounds 2.41m to Pounds 2.65m in the half-year to March 27.
Mr Philip Billington, who became chairman on January 1, said he was aiming
to increase Chemring's non-defence side to 60 per cent, though he stressed
that the defence side made 'defensive, rather than offensive products', such
as radar countermeasures and flares.
Group turnover rose almost 20 per cent to Pounds 18.5m (Pounds 15.4m), with
acquisitions accounting for Pounds 2m of the rise.
In May 1991 the company bought Octavius Hunt - which makes smoke pesticides,
sparklers and specialist matches - for Pounds 1.54m in cash, shares and loan
notes. In July it paid FFr6.5m for 49 per cent of Traco, the French
electrical transformer manufacturer, to combine with Securelec of which it
also owns 49 per cent. In August it added Horace Sleep to its Vacuum Reflex
specialist clothing company and in September the marine division of Kilgore
was absorbed into the pyrotechnic operations of Pains-Wessex.
The group has 70 per cent of the global market for marine pyrotechnics.
Chemring would go to the market for larger acquisitions, said Mr Billington,
but had Pounds 3.1m cash at the period-end for smaller buys.
He was looking for companies 'with markets and manufacturing processes we
understand'.
Earnings emerged at 35.54p (31.39p) and the interim dividend is lifted 10.9p
(9.9p).

155m

<TEXT>
A STRONG performance from Mercury Communications boosted the year-end
results of Cable and Wireless.
The subsidiary increased trading profit by 34 per cent to Pounds 155m
(Pounds 116m) in the 12 months to March 31, on increased sales of Pounds
915m (Pounds 702m). Group pre-tax profit rose to Pounds 644m (Pounds 609m).
Lord Young, chairman, said Oftel, the telecommunications regulator, had done
a 'smashing job' in proposing that BT cut the average level of its prices by
7.5 percentage points below the rate of inflation, against 6.25 points at
present.
'This is as good as we could have hoped for,' he said. 'It will prevent BT
from putting up their domestic prices where they have no real competition.'
Mercury is committed to increasing the number of residential customers from
200,000 to 2m by the year 2000. In total it has 781,000 lines.
It is also restructuring its sales and network management to work closely
with cable TV operators.
Margins in 1991 rose in spite of a 10 per cent cut in international prices.
The company's share of the UK international market increased from 14 to 18
per cent. Mercury has now captured 31 per cent of international calls to
Japan and 32 per cent to Switzerland.
From next January a BT-style pricing regime will affect group operations in
Hong Kong.
Its 58.4 per cent-owned HongKong Telecom has agreed to a one-off 8 per cent
reduction in international charges in the first year, followed by a 2 per
cent cut in each of the next two years.
The rules allow the subsidiary to increase domestic charges by inflation
minus 4 per cent. With inflation running at 10 per cent prices are likely to
continue to rise.
Lord Young dismissed the threat of competition - due in the 2006. Its local
services are free and the group charges residential customers monthly rental
of just Pounds 5.
HongKong Telecom increased trading profit by 28 per cent to Pounds 475m
(Pounds 370m) on sales of Pounds 1.37bn (Pounds 1.1bn).
Its international traffic rose by 15 per cent, while traffic between Hong
Kong and South China increased by 35 per cent.
Group trading profit increased by 27 per cent to Pounds 727m (Pounds 572m).
Lord Young said growth in the current half would prove even better.

Barlow Rand of South Africa, for the monopoly Spanish Caterpiller
distributor, Finanzauto.
Bibby and Finanzauto executives were meeting in Madrid late yesterday,
negotiating a possible increase in the bid price.
They were not available for comment.
The Spanish stock market commission said Bibby would be able to modify the
Pta 1,300 a share offer if it got approval from its shareholders.
The bid, worth some Dollars 130m (Pounds 71.4m), is the first hostile

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With the announcement of a Pounds 57,000 pre-tax loss for 1991, Office &amp;
Electronic Machines has set out its plans for the future.
Activities now comprise a small office furniture and office stationery
business in Burgess Hill, Sussex, but this is too small to be viable.
The directors feel the company needs to be much larger and expect that over
the next few years it will evolve with a number of stakes in a wide variety
of businesses, some listed, some not, in a number of industries.
In the short term they believe that considerable opportunity exists for a
well-financed investment in the property market. In the last few weeks they
have entered into a joint venture to develop, on a forward funded basis, a
series of industrial warehousing complexes.
The company's 1991 loss compared with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 68,000 and
was struck on total turnover of Pounds 2.07m (Pounds 12.6m).
In continuing activities there was a deficit of Pounds 233,000, after an
operating loss of Pounds 668,000 on turnover of Pounds 1.43m.
Losses per share were 3.1p (earnings 6.3p). Again there is no final
dividend, which makes the total for the year an unchanged 0.1p.

expanding to 119p at September 30 1991. By May 29 1992, however, it moved up

The trust produced earnings per share of 3.2p for the year ended March 31,
compared with 2.9p, and is raising the dividend to 3p (2.85p) through a
final of 1.8p (1.65p).
Total income was Pounds 1.5m (Pounds 1.57m) and pre-tax revenue Pounds 1.01m
(Pounds 1.07m).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong contribution from the stockbroking side enabled Oceana Consolidated
Company to return a pre-tax profit of Pounds 72,000 for the year ended March
31 1992.
That compared with a loss of Pounds 1.29m previously, after exceptional
charges of Pounds 1.63m relating to an insurance claim and the writing down
of the value of an unquoted investment.
Turnover of this financial services group increased by Pounds 1m to Pounds
9m. Earnings per share were 2.31p against losses of 16.74p and the dividend
is raised to 1p (0.75p).

AF Bulgin reported reduced pre-tax losses of Pounds 107,401 for the year to
January 31. For the previous 12 months the loss was Pounds 505,225.
Sales in the period under review declined to Pounds 12.2m (Pounds 14.1m).
Exceptional costs of Pounds 70,933 (Pounds 562,567) represented the
reorganisation of overseas subsidiaries and redundancies.
The extraordinary charge of Pounds 60,914 (Pounds 202) reflected termination
costs of an overseas subsidiary and provisions against group investment.
The electrical and electronic components company is paying an unchanged
single final dividend of 0.1p. Losses per share fell to 0.4p (1.21p).
The directors said the first quarter of the current year had shown an
improvement, but the second half must be regarded with caution.

Earnings per share fell to 10.58p (15.99p) but an unchanged final dividend

FT  18 JUN 92 / UK Company News: End seen to Riva/Hugin dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONG-RUNNING saga of the Pounds 10m 'black hole' in the accounts of
Hugin Sweda, the Anglo-Swedish retailing systems manufacturer acquired by
Riva Group in 1989, may be close to a conclusion.
It is believed that Riva is now anxious to agree Pounds 1m in settlement of
its dispute with both the former executive directors of Hugin Sweda and with
its own former advisers, Peat Marwick McLintock, the accountants.
Peat Marwick said yesterday that negotiations were still continuing and
refused to comment on the size of any possible settlement.
The story has involved three years of sabre rattling but little action. At
one stage Riva issued a writ claiming Pounds 15m damages against the Hugin
Sweda directors and was planning to sue Peat Marwick, which resigned as
Riva's auditors last year, for a similar sum.
The dispute began when Riva, a Bolton-based manufacturer of electronic
point-of-sale equipment, discovered unexpected liabilities of between Pounds
10m and Pounds 12m in the accounts of Hugin Sweda, which it had bought
hoping to benefit from its European distribution network.
It is thought that Riva is keen to settle now rather than continue with
expensive and time-consuming litigation which might bring no substantial
increase in the amount awarded.
News of a possible settlement may bring some comfort to Riva's shareholders,
who have otherwise little to cheer about.
The company yesterday reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 3.2m in the year to
end-December 1991 compared to a profit of Pounds 778,000 last time.
Operational losses were comparatively low at Pounds 105,000, blamed on
difficult trading conditions together with low levels of demand.
The net cost of borrowings, however, totalled Pounds 1.95m and there was an
exceptional charge of Pounds 1.15m made up of Pounds 365,000 costs
associated with refinancing arrangements approved last month and
restructuring costs of Pounds 789,000.
Turnover fell 13 per cent to Pounds 57.3m (Pounds 65.9m), partly as a
consequence of strategic withdrawal from unprofitable market segments.
Losses per share amounted to 12.3p (2.4p earnings). There is no dividend.
The directors said the resumption of dividend payments could only be
envisaged once the group returned to profitability and reduced bank
borrowings significantly.

FT  18 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Exceptionals and interest costs leave
Waddington 22% lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGHER interest charges and restructuring costs knocked pre-tax profits at
John Waddington, the packaging, printing and games company, back 22 per cent
to Pounds 12.5m last year.
The company, which yesterday announced the appointment of managing director
Mr Martin Buckley as chief executive, revealed a better operating
performance, however. Profits were just Pounds 340,000 down at Pounds 18.3m
on sales slightly ahead to Pounds 231m (Pounds 228m).
Interest charges rose by Pounds 1m to Pounds 3.6m for the 12 months to April
4, although gearing by the year-end had fallen from 54 to 42 per cent. Net
debt was down by Pounds 6m to Pounds 29m.
The 140 redundancies, out of a total of 3,800 staff, and other cost-cutting
measures had resulted in an exceptional Pounds 2.2m charge. However, they
would save more than Pounds 2m on an annual basis, said Mr Geoffrey Gibson,
finance director.
Packaging showed the greatest improvement last year with a Pounds 2m
increase in operating profits to Pounds 11.5m. The printing division
suffered declining demand and severe competition in the UK business
stationery market. Operating profits fell from Pounds 4.7m to Pounds 2.5m.
Games, for which Waddington is best known with names such as Cluedo and
Monopoly, fell by Pounds 200,000 to Pounds 3.4m at the operating level.
Mr David Perry, who was appointed deputy chairman yesterday, said the
company would benefit from the Pounds 96m five-year capital expenditure
programme: 'I believe the result of that investment will start to show
regardless of any improvement in the economy.'
Earnings per share dropped from 14.75p to 11.59p. The final dividend was
held at 4.3p, for an unchanged total of 7.9p.
COMMENT
The only surprise in Waddington's results was its decision to take the
Pounds 5.3m charge on the Pacplas plastics disposal below the line. But
since this is in accordance with current law, there were few real quibbles.
The capex programme has yet to prove that it can bring dramatic returns, but
will ensure that operating profits are protected. The new Pounds 16m carton
factory is a feather in Waddington's cap, but is getting lower prices than
expected. Credit must go to management for holding operating profits and
increasing the packaging return. Nevertheless, the jury appears to be out on
whether it can provide significant earnings growth. Forecasts are for Pounds
17m this year, and the shares at 204p give a multiple of 13 times. A solid
company, if unexciting at the moment.

FT  18 JUN 92 / C and W rules out global alliance: Telecommunications group
unveils 5.7% profits rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD YOUNG, chairman of Cable and Wireless, the UK-based international
telecommunications group, yesterday said he was talking to groups about
partnerships for specific projects but ruled out a global alliance.
His comments came as the group unveiled a 5.7 per cent increase in pre-tax
profits to Pounds 644m for the year to the end of March. Turnover increased
from Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 3.1m.
The increase in pre-tax profits was achieved after Pounds 70.3m of
exceptional items relating to group rationalisation, the merger of Mercury
Personal Communications with Unitel, a US-owned operator, and the
devaluation of the Jamaican dollar.
Before the UK election in April Cable and Wireless was in talks with
American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&amp;T) about a possible global alliance.
The talks broke down because of AT&amp;T's concern about the election.
Reports that AT&amp;T wants to reopen talks followed re-election of the
Conservative government.
However, Lord Young ruled out further talks about a global alliance. He
said: 'We do not believe it is in our interests to form a global alliance
with anyone. We are in talks with everyone about the possibility of
establishing individual partnerships over individual projects.'
Since Cable and Wireless rejected a BT Syncordia-type strategy - taking on
the world's big telecommunications groups - it no longer believes a global
alliance is in its interest.
Lord Young said: 'We felt that there was not sufficient returns out of a
Syncordia-type strategy taking everybody on everywhere.'
Instead the group will concentrate on business services, basic
telecommunications in its traditional areas of strength such as Asia and the
West Indies, and mobile phones.
It is looking at establishing a joint company with Intertelecom in Russia,
to provide a service to western Siberia, the 'Golden Ring' of large towns
surrounding Moscow, and St Petersburg. 'In 25 years people may say this was
the best decision the group ever made,' said Lord Young.
Earnings per share were down 4 per cent to 30.1p because of exceptionals and
the higher tax charge of Pounds 134m compared with Pounds 115m. A final
dividend of 9p (against 8.1p) makes a total of 13.25p compared with 11.8p.

FT  18 JUN 92 / BICC in Pounds 55m US power cable deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BICC, the UK-based cables and construction group, yesterday announced a
Pounds 55m deal which will double its share of the power cable market in
North America.
BICC Cables, the group's North American subsidiary, has provisionally agreed
to buy the electrical division of Reynolds Metals, a leading maker of
transmission and distribution cables in the US and Canada.
Reynolds' electrical division employs 900 people in factories in Washington
State, Texas and Arkansas in the US, and LaMalbaie in Quebec, Canada. No
decision has been made on how many people will transfer to BICC.
BICC's purchase is in line with the strategy outlined when making a Pounds
154m rights issue last month. It said companies in the fragmented and
recession-hit North American cable industry could now be bought cheaply.
The UK group itself suffered from the downturn. In March BICC described its
slide last year from an annual profit of Pounds 24m in North America to a
loss of Pounds 3m as the group's 'biggest single disappointment'.
Reynolds does not disclose profits on the Dollars 200m annual sales by its
electrical division, but said the disposal would have no material effect on
its operating results.
Although the deal will double BICC's share of the North American cable
market to about 25 per cent, the UK group said it did not expect to face any
regulatory obstacles.
As part of the transaction, Reynolds will have a long-term agreement to
supply BICC with aluminium redraw rods from its new rod mill in Becancour,
Quebec.
BICC Cables intends to integrate the Reynolds US operations with its Cablec
Utility Cable company in the US and the Quebec operation with the utilities
division of Phillips Cables.
BICC Cables has 17 North American plants with 3,200 employees.
BICC announced the sale to private investors of Metal Manufactures
Construction, the group's loss-making Australian electrical and mechanical
engineering contracting business. The consideration of ADollars 2m (Pounds
800m) is the net book value of the business, after extraordinary provisions
of about Pounds 13m taken by BICC in March.

FT  18 JUN 92 / Surge in US business optimism may aid Bush
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WHITE HOUSE hopes that economic recovery will arrive in time to improve
President George Bush's election prospects will be boosted today by a survey
suggesting that US chief executives are more confident about the economic
outlook than at any time since 1984.
The Conference Board, a New York business analysis group, says its index of
confidence jumped eight points to 70 in the past three months. It says the
'overwhelming majority' of business leaders expects the economy to improve
in the next six months.
The quarterly index rose seven points in the first quarter of this year and
is now more than double the low point reached in the final quarter of 1990
after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
Confidence is now well above the highest levels registered last year when
the economy began a faltering recovery.
The improvement in boardroom sentiment is running ahead of consumer
confidence, which is up modestly but still far below levels normal during a
recovery.
The discrepancy may reflect extensive restructuring in many sectors, which
is improving profitability but undermining job security for white collar as
well as blue collar workers.
The board's index is based on the assessment by chief executives of current
economic conditions compared with those six months ago, their expectations
for the economy six months ahead, and predictions for their own industries.
The most recent survey notes a sharp improvement in business leaders'
assessments of current conditions. Nearly 80 per cent said the economy had
improved in the past six months; only 30 per cent expressed such optimism in
the previous survey.
Chief executives are also more optimistic about the outlook for their own
industries; 65 per cent reported an improvement, against fewer than 40 per
cent in the first quarter. The 'overwhelming majority' of chief executives
are optimistic, said Mr Jason Bram, an economist at the board. Some 85 per
cent of those polled forecast economic improvement in the next six months.
Three out of four business leaders predicted an increase in their companies'
profits over the next year, with only 6 per cent expecting a fall.
Executives cited growth of demand as the main source of higher profits. Only
12 per cent said they expected to generate profits by raising prices,
indicating that inflationary pressures may remain subdued during the
recovery.

FT  18 JUN 92 / EC's greencar-lover proposes sacrifice tosave cities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Carlo Ripa di Meana, the EC environment commissioner, yesterday said he
was ready to become car-less, and so should other city dwellers, to help
prevent Europe's cities being choked by the internal combustion engine.
Saying he was ready to set the example of abandoning his Alfa Romeo, Mr Ripa
di Meana unveiled a study showing that it would cost between two and five
times less to live and work in car-free cities because of the savings people
could make in not having cars to buy, park, insure and maintain.
Mr Ripa di Meana, an idealist who stayed away from this month's Earth Summit
in Rio de Janeiro because of what he thought would be its failure to take
sufficiently tough action on the planet's environment, insisted the report
showed that car-free cities could be a practical proposition.
Limited numbers of car users in city centres could be made to pay steeper
fees for parking, and city authorities could be persuaded to invest more in
public transport, escalators and moving walkways.
Following the lead of Amsterdam, whose residents recently voted to restrict
cars in their city centre, other European cities ranging from Naples in
Italy to Bath in England had become interested, Mr Ripa di Meana said, in
making the transition from what he called 'the car dream to the dream city -
the car-less city'.
The Commission plans to convene a meeting in September of interested city
leaders to exchange ideas on ways of 'adapting the car to the city, instead
of the city to the car', the commissioner said.
Mr Ripa di Meana, who recently proposed levying a special Community eco-tax
on carbon fuels, said he was far from hostile to cars, which would always
have a use on longer, out-of-town journeys.
But he was ready to make what for an Italian represents the ultimate
sacrifice by giving up the use of his own car, 'a red Alfa Romeo with a
three-way catalytic converter, which runs on unleaded petrol'.
He has made sacrifices before. 'I used to own an XK120 Jaguar of the kind
that won Le Mans in the 1950s. But it was very heavy on petrol, and now I
only have a miniature of it on my desk.'
Curbing his love affair with the car has not been easy, though. Three years
ago he did the London to Brighton vintage car rally. 'It was freezing', said
the Italian commissioner, 'but I loved it'.

FT  18 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: UK economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It looks suspiciously as though some manufacturers became a little
over-optimistic about the economy around the time of the general election.
While output of consumer goods industries rose by 1.5 per cent in the three
months to April, retail sales actually fell by 0.1 per cent between March
and May. The classification of consumer goods is not quite uniform from one
statistical series to another, so there may be nothing behind this apparent
discrepancy. The standard explanation is that increased production was going
to rebuild stocks ahead of anticipated economic recovery. That is fine so
long as the recovery actually takes place. If demand fails to grow, the 1
per cent rise in overall manufacturing output over the past three months is
unlikely to reflect a lasting trend.
Yesterday's retail sales figures did not, however, offer much reason to hope
for solid growth in consumer demand. The further jump in clothing and
footwear sales looks remarkable at first sight, but is probably no more than
a response to the unseasonably warm weather. The depressing reality is that
seasonally-adjusted household goods sales are back to their lowest level
since January - another reminder that sustained recovery will require an
upturn in the housing market, which is still distressingly remote.
There was a further curiousity in yesterday's industrial production figures.
Output of investment goods fell by 1 per cent over the three months to
April, which sits oddly with recent sharp increases in imports of capital
goods. The sinister interpretation is that when recovery does finally come,
it will not be to the benefit of the UK investment goods industry, but to
its foreign competition.

FT  18 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: NFC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is something comfortably predictable about NFC. In announcing flat
first-half profits of Pounds 45m, it confirmed its forecast of Pounds
90m-Pounds 100m for the year. It also gave the City no particular reason to
question the forecast. That may explain the 4 per cent jump in the shares
yesterday. Recent weakness has been above all due to fears that NFC would
not escape the downgrades to which much of the rest of the transport sector
has been subject.
Granted, the company could do with some economic recovery to boost its truck
rental and home removal business. Its figures point to some improvement
between the first and second quarters, but that may be mostly due to a
heavier bill for redundancies in the first quarter. Nor should one read too
much into the planned additions to its rental fleet. Trucks can be sold as
well as bought. NFC's current appeal owes something to the fact that it is
less of a cyclical stock than other companies in this sector. Its logistics
division is a leading player in the growing dedicated distribution market
which is both difficult for competitors to enter and relatively recession
proof. On the basis of its own forecast, NFC is on a prospective multiple of
about 18. That is not particularly expensive, but other transport companies
may eventually have more recovery potential.

<TEXT>
Given that the market had hoped there would be no more bad news from
Philips, yesterday's 18 per cent drop in the share price was perhaps an
understandable reaction to the profits warning. The question is whether the
market over-reacted. On a negative reading, Philips' protracted
restructuring programme has done little to reduce the group's vulnerability
to leaner competitors in consumer electronics. Moreover, any dent in its
recovery has implications for its ability to resume dividend payments. On
this view, the shares are best avoided until the extent of the damage
becomes clearer when second-quarter figures are revealed in August.
Arguably, a more persuasive interpretation is that, while the consumer
electronics market has become even more competitive, Philips' wider recovery
effort is scarcely off the rails. The management's assumption was that
consumer business would stabilise after price falls in the first quarter.
Instead, May saw further pressure on prices, particularly in Europe. Hence,
yesterday's warning about the second-quarter performance.
As today's results from Nokia Data should show, Philips has not been
suffering alone. Even Sony has already felt pain. It is indeed rational for
investors to calculate that Philips will probably not have the mettle to pay
a dividend if earnings are lower this year. Doubtless they will also
remember that any payment would always be nominal. Despite yesterday's fall,
those who backed the shares for recovery may reflect that the long-term odds
remain in their favour.

FT  18 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Cable's calming message
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Judging by the 4 per cent rise in its shares, yesterday's annual results
from Cable and Wireless were a successful exercise in investor reassurance.
But it is too early to conclude that the shares deserve more than a limited
re-rating following their 15 per cent underperformance this year. After the
abortive AT&amp;T talks and fumbled senior management changes, C and W needs to
do more than remind the market that its main businesses have unusual scope
for growth. Management must now convert that into profits.
The figures were marred by a Pounds 70m exceptional charge which held the
pre-tax rise to 6 per cent. Thanks to the collapse of the Jamaican dollar,
the charge was Pounds 18m higher than expected. Nevertheless, the 12.3 per
cent full-year dividend increase was more than adequate compensation, and
the one-third jump in Mercury's trading profit to Pounds 155m was a welcome
bonus.
With global alliances ruled out as insufficiently profitable, C and W's
strategy is to concentrate on basic telecoms and mobile telephony, using the
lucrative business market as a bridge. That will require annual investment
of Pounds 1bn for the next three years, while gearing will rise to around 40
per cent this year. The weak dollar remains a hindrance; each one-cent
movement against sterling affects the bottom line by Pounds 3m. All the
same, either Mercury or Hong Kong Telecom should be enough to give C and W a
competitive advantage. If the sluggish UK economy fails to push Mercury
along, Hong Kong Telecom's link with China should oblige. It is hard to deny
the group's long-term attractions.

FT  18 JUN 92 / One in four Irish voters undecided in poll on Maastricht
</HEADLINE>

ONE in four voters in today's Irish referendum on the Maastricht treaty is
still undecided, according to a public opinion poll published yesterday.
The poll, published in the Irish Times, showed that although declared 'yes'
voters outnumber 'no' voters by 49 per cent to 28 per cent, more than half
of those polled believe the government has handled its pro-Maastricht
campaign badly.
Even Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said only that he was
'cautiously encouraged' by the results of the poll.
Campaign managers for the 'yes' vote yesterday complained that some priests
are campaigning against the treaty, in spite of a decision by Catholic
bishops to keep the Church neutral.
The decision by 2.5m Irish voters will not be available until Ireland's
principal returning officer makes a declaration around noon tomorrow.
The result will have a profound impact on the future economic and political
course of the European Community. If the Irish follow the Danes and vote
'no', there seems little doubt that the treaty, which establishes the legal
framework for the creation of a common currency and common citizenship for
some 340m people, will have to be scrapped. If they vote 'yes', there are
hopes that the remaining 10 EC states will ratify the treaty.
As in Denmark, the opinion polls showed a significantly greater proportion
of women than men were undecided. And considerably fewer women (44 per cent)
than men (55 per cent) said they would vote 'yes'.
Both feminists and anti-abortion groups have been campaigning actively for a
'no' vote and should the treaty be defeated in spite of the poll
predictions, women's votes will clearly have been an important factor.
A large sector of the 'no' camp has run a clever campaign, championing
liberal causes such as the environment, neutrality, job promotion and
women's rights. It has argued that ratification of Maastricht will have
adverse effects in all these areas.
In addition many of those who voted positively in previous referendums on
European issues, such as the one in 1987 which approved the Single European
Act, may find themselves divided between an economic decision on the one
hand, and a moral one on the other due to the complication of the abortion
issue.
The overall weakness of the 'yes' campaign, in contrast to the vitality of
its opponents, together with the continuing large number of floating voters
have thus created considerable uncertainty over the outcome.
Mr Michael Gallagher, a political science lecturer at Trinity College in
Dublin, said: 'I have no doubt the polls have been done as accurately and as
professionally as in the past, but no one is too confident in them now since
the recent experiences of Denmark and the UK (election).'

FT  18 JUN 92 / Book Review: Plea for no muscle-play

<TEXT>
Die Grenzen der Macht (The Limits Of Power)By Michael Sturmer Siedler
Verlag, Berlin, DM37, 255 pages
The German,' wrote Theodor Heuss, West Germany's first president, 'appears
more complex and inexplicable to himself and to other nations because his
history is more complex than that of other countries.'
One of the reasons for the complexity of Germany's history is its place on
the map. It has become a cliche to affirm that Germany's position in the
middle of Europe, at the crossroads of ideas and the intersection of armies,
has greatly contributed to the vicissitudes of Germany's national saga
during the past four or five centuries.
The byways of Germany's past, and the still open questions over the reunited
nation's future, form the focal points of Michael Sturmer's book. One of the
best-known German historians, with a deep interest in the nexus between
economics and politics, Sturmer takes the reader on a magisterial grand tour
of the dells and the high ground of his country's history.
His title underlines that this is no plea for a resumption of German
muscle-play. At the beginning of the 1980s, Sturmer was an adviser to Helmut
Kohl in the Bonn chancellery. Some of the misunderstandings and suspicions
concerning Germany's foreign policy during the past two years - over its
relationship with Moscow, for instance, or its stance on the Gulf War and
Yugoslavia - might have been dispelled had a man of Sturmer's formidable
analytical and public relations skills remained at Kohl's side.
Sturmer contends that German power, stretched beyond its limits under the
Third Reich, and then squeezed to nothing by defeat and dismemberment in
1945, will remain highly constrained now that the nation is whole again.
Germany is being reminded, Sturmer notes, of its 'historical dilemma' in the
centre of the continent.
Germany has the size and the influence to shape the future of the 'European
system'. But the country itself will be shaped by the balance of forces
stemming from the break-up of the Soviet Union, the redefining of the US
role in the world, and the relationship with France. And the limits of
German power will continue to be defined - just as they were during the
years of division - by the degree of trust it earns from its neighbours.
Germany's influence is due to its position straddling east and west, as well
as to the strength of its economy. But Sturmer knows that, at the heart of
Europe, the ending of the Cold War creates risks as well as opportunities.
Sturmer's fundamental question - 'Where do Germany and the Germans belong?'
has to be posed afresh. 'Between the Rhine and the Oder lies a land which
must still, through painful experience, find its internal balance and its
external role.'
Precisely because of the uncertainties, Sturmer is convinced that Germany
will be able to play this role only if it resists the temptation to become
once again a 'bridge' between east and west and remains firmly anchored in
the Atlantic community. Sturmer ascribes great importance to maintaining the
US military presence in Europe.
One of Sturmer's theses is that Hitler not only destroyed the Reich, but
also undermined 'the German future'. With unity and sovereignty now
recovered, Hitler's thrall has weakened. Somewhat ambiguously, Sturmer
alludes to the tendency for Germans to become less apologetic for the crimes
of the Third Reich. 'With increasing distance, Hitler's place in European
history will become less sharp.'
But Sturmer also expresses irritation with compatriots who use the
catastrophe of the Third Reich as an excuse to prevent Germany from bearing
its greater responsibilities, for instance, by sending troops on
peace-keeping missions abroad. Germany will have to become 'actor and not
spectator' on the world stage, Sturmer writes - but he leaves unclear
exactly how this new strategic role should look.
There is another intriguing gap in the book, relating to the integration of
the European Community. Sturmer is a skilful guide through the paradoxes of
German history. But at the end of the journey, Sturmer makes clear that
united Germany's place on the political map will be determined by the degree
of power it wishes to assign to supranational institutions.
Sturmer writes correctly that the new impetus in 1990-91 to European
political and monetary union was part of Germany's Beruhigungspolitik
(policy of calming fears), aimed at lessening distrust about the might of a
united Germany. He also half-approvingly records the remark of a French
diplomat equating Germany's D-Mark to France's possession of nuclear
weapons. Sturmer leaves open whether Germany will be willing to take the
step of monetary disarmament by allowing the D-Mark to be subsumed into a
single European currency.
Like many influential Germans, Sturmer is in fact (although he does not say
so in the book) sceptical about whether a European central bank will really
be set up. Sturmer might have spelled out more clearly that a premature
abandonment of the D-Mark is one limit on German power which his country is
not, after all, willing to countenance.

FT  18 JUN 92 / A hotbed of high-tech: California's Silicon Valley is
enjoying a revival in innovation and entrepreneurship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFFREY OWEN and LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was tempting, in the late 1980s, to write off Silicon Valley. Some even
called it the 'next Detroit'; the latest example of the declining
competitiveness of American industry. It appeared that the valley's famed
entrepreneurial spirit was being crushed by the onslaught from Japan.
Look again. Today, this northern California complex of high-technology
industries is brimming with confidence.
'People think this industry is maturing,' says Mr Steve Jobs, chairman of
Next Computer and as co-founder of Apple one of the valley's most celebrated
entrepreneurs. 'They are so wrong. Every time a technology window opens
there is an opportunity completely to rearrange the industry.' He agrees
that the targeting of a new venture has to be more precise. 'At Apple, we
threw a dart at a white wall and where it landed we painted a bull's eye. At
Next we are trying to do something far more ambitious because the market is
more sophisticated.'
If the technological opportunities seem boundless, so too is the valley's
capacity to exploit them. Thanks to the momentum of innovation and
entrepreneurship which began before the war and accelerated in the 1960s,
Silicon Valley has a rich infrastructure of electronics engineers,
subcontractors, venture capitalists, public relations advisers, headhunters
and lawyers, all of whom have a part to play in getting a venture off the
ground. 'I could start a semiconductor company on the telephone from my
home,' says Mr Wilfrid Corrigan, chairman of LSI Logic, a leading
semiconductor manufacturer.
Mr Andy Grove, chairman of Intel, the world's largest maker of
microprocessors, compares it to the theatre business in New York which has
an itinerant workforce of actors, directors, writers and technicians, as
well as experienced financial backers. By tapping into this network you can
quickly put a production together. It might be a smash hit, like 42nd
Street, or it might be panned by the critics. Inevitably the number of
long-running plays is small, but new creative ideas keep bubbling up.
'Silicon Valley is a technology crucible,' says Mr Irwin Federman, who ran a
leading semiconductor company in the 1970s and is now a venture capitalist.
'Every engineer in the valley has at the back of his mind that if he comes
up with an interesting product he can start a company. Not too many
opportunities get wasted.'
Mr Dick Moley, an engineering graduate from Manchester, came to the US in
1961 to work for the engineering group Westinghouse in Pittsburgh, then for
Hewlett-Packard in the valley. 'I saw all these start-ups and I thought -
I'll be a wimp if I don't try it.' He was part of the team that created
Rolm, a pioneer in computer-controlled private telephone exchanges. He is
now running another start-up, Stratacom, inventor of the 'frame relay'
method of squeezing large quantities of data through narrow bandwidth
telephone lines.
Silicon Valley's family tree, displayed on many office walls, goes back to
the 1950s. Mr Corrigan, a Liverpudlian who came to the US in 1961, and Mr
Grove, a Hungarian emigre, both worked for Fairchild Semiconductor, the
progenitor of a long line of entrepreneurial companies. Fairchild itself was
a spin-off from Shockley Laboratories, set up by Mr William Shockley,
inventor of the transistor, in 1955.
But the valley is no respecter of grey hairs. It is a meritocracy in which
everyone has a chance to succeed. It matters little where you come from, or
what you have achieved in the past, only what you can contribute today.
'The American dream lives in Silicon Valley,' says Mr Jerry Sanders,
chairman of American Micro Devices (AMD) and another Fairchild veteran. It
attracts people, according to Mr John Sculley of Apple, 'who are willing to
roll the dice and lose it all'.
But it is not a get-rich-quick casino. It is risk-taking allied to intense
effort; casual style that lightens the grind of 60-hour weeks; brashness
combined with professional pride and a desire to build great companies;
intense competition tempered by a respect for the individual.
This last characteristic is widely attributed to Hewlett-Packard, one of the
valley's oldest companies; it was founded just before the Second World War.
'Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard had a very positive view of human potential,'
says Mr Jobs. 'That was their greatest gift to the valley; they saw people
as part of the solution, not part of the problem.'
Yet even Hewlett-Packard cannot live by corporate values alone. It is
threatened by upstarts, such as Sun Microsystems which invented the
workstation market, aimed precisely at the professional and scientific
customers which Hewlett-Packard had regarded as its own. Having painfully
absorbed Apollo, one of Sun's rivals, Hewlett-Packard is now storming back,
winning market share in the workstation sector.
This ability of the larger companies to re-invent themselves under
competitive pressure is emerging as one of the valley's strengths. After its
success in the early 1980s, Apple had to undergo what Mr Sculley, chairman
and chief executive, calls 'a series of wrenching re-births' before
recovering its momentum.
Mr Sanders at AMD has flirted with disaster on several occasions. 'When you
have survived a few crises, it gives you a sense of assurance about
yourself, a kind of self-worth,' he says. One of AMD's crises came in the
mid-1980s when part of its design team left to form Cypress Semiconductor.
There are those who question the value of the constant fragmentation of the
industry through spin-offs and start-ups. Mr Sanders, for example, argues
that Cypress 'will never become an important global competitor'.
Does the Silicon Valley model discourage the creation of strong, global
companies capable of taking the long view? Mr Grove at Intel insists on the
need for 'agile giants' in the semiconductor business, but the agility, he
acknowledges, comes in part from the newcomers sniping at their heels.
A start-up, Chips and Technologies, caught Intel napping in the mid-1980s by
offering personal computer 'chip sets', a kit of semiconductor parts to
build a personal computer. Although Intel was at the time the sole supplier
of the microprocessor 'brains' chip for PCs, the sale of chips that surround
the microprocessor was an important portion of its business.
'In retrospect it was a simple thing to do,' says Mr Grove. 'They thought of
it, we didn't'. More recently a product announcement from another minnow,
Cyrix, caused the Intel share price to drop by 15 per cent in one day.
There is also a 'Wild West' aspect to the valley. Today's gun-slingers are
trigger happy with lawsuits, aimed at would-be competitors allegedly
infringing patent rights. The plethora of litigation demonstrates that even
neighbours and personal friends can be brutal competitors. 'We have learnt
to live in an environment where we are violent competitors one day, allies
the next,' says Mr Sculley.
Even Japanese rivals can sometimes become allies, as evidenced by several
trans-Pacific technology and marketing agreements. The technological
achievements of Japanese companies, in manufacturing for example, are
recognised and even admired in Silicon Valley. However, there remains a
strong undercurrent of resentment - the result of Japan's alleged refusal to
buy American chips - among veterans of the semiconductor industry.
Outsiders have also dubbed US chipmakers 'Japan bashers', yet there is no
sign of racial disharmony in the valley. Indeed, it is a melting pot of
Asian, European and South American immigrants. Getting rich is a strong
motivator and one that few are embarrassed to acknowledge. Hence the
importance of stock options, which give employees a stake in the success of
fledgling companies.
A move by Congress to tax companies on stock options granted to employees is
being vociferously opposed by valley executives. 'It would change
everything,' says Mr Rodger Higgins, another British transplant who arrived
in Silicon Valley 10 years ago and recently joined Clarity Software, a
start-up company developing office applications programs for computer
workstations.
But the Silicon Valley method of creating wealth is by building, rather than
by speculating. 'Whatever has been created here that has been really
important,' says Mr Sculley, 'has been done with an incredible amount of
passion behind it.'
The sources of new science are the universities - not only neighbouring
Stanford, which has played a seminal role in the valley's development.
Apple, for example, took over work on speech recognition that had started at
Carnegie Mellon University. Radical innovations within the valley itself,
like the integrated circuit, are rare.
'Silicon Valley people,' says Mr Sculley, 'are great connoisseurs of
technology.' When one of the so-called 'paradigm shifts' occurs, the
entrepreneurs are quick to move in. Many believe that Silicon Valley
companies are on the cusp of just such an opportunity, created by the
marriage of computer and communications technology to create a broad new
class of mass market products ranging from hand-held computers to
interactive entertainment systems.
Apple's recently unveiled 'Newton' technology, is a prime example. Early
next year Apple will launch a hand-held 'personal digital assistant', a
device designed to help people keep track of appointments, and scribbled
notes, send fax messages and arrange meetings. But Apple is not alone.
Already, dozens of new Silicon Valley ventures have being formed to ride the
new digital consumer electronics wave.
Whether this new technology fulfils its promise, Mr Grove of Intel is surely
right to stress that business success in the 1990s and beyond will depend on
speed - responding faster to market conditions, getting information around
the country faster, making strategic changes faster. In an environment where
product lives are shorter - 'there are no safe havens', as Mr Federman puts
it - the hyper-competitive atmosphere of Silicon Valley, with its adaptable
giants, cheeky spin-offs and ambitious start-ups, is an American asset which
no other country has yet been able to match.
