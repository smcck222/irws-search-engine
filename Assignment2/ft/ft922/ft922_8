FT  17 JUN 92 / International Company News: Framatome posts flat profits for
year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FRAMATOME, France's supplier of nuclear reactors, yesterday announced stable
profits for 1991 and its first order for five years.
The group reported a net profit of FFr986m (Dollars 182.25m) against FFr984m
in 1990, on turnover up slightly to FFr14.2bn from FFr13.6bn over the same
period.
State-controlled Framatome, subject two years ago to a failed bid for
control by Alcatel Alsthom, the private sector telecommunications and
engineering group, has suffered from the international decline in demand for
nuclear plant.
It expects turnover to fall again this year to FFr13.1bn, on which it is
forecast-ing a FFr900m net profit.
Framatome's main nuclear customer, Electricite de France, has completed the
expansion of its ambitious nuclear plant programme, but, as expected, did
pass on an order for a 1,450 MW power station earlier this month. However,
it lost a contract to build a steam generator in Belgium to Mitsubishi of
Japan.

FT  17 JUN 92 / International Company News: PolyGram pays Dollars 25m for
Philips' CD plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLYGRAM is buying a CD manufacturing plant in the US for Dollars 25m from
Philips, the Dutch electronics group, which owns 80 per cent of the record
and entertainment group.
The acquisition follows earlier agreements between the two for PolyGram to
acquire a CD factory in Germany and one in France for a total of around
Dollars 100m from Philips.
The US factory has a capacity of 60m discs per year and produced 50m CDs
last year.
It employs 530 full-time staff, and 60 per cent of production from the
factory went to PolyGram itself, with the remainder going to third parties.
The group's sales of CDs has been growing and they have increased as a
proportion of the overall product mix in unit terms, from 48 per cent in
1990 to 58 per cent last year.
The three recent acquisitions of CD manufacturing facilities from Philips
was based on what PolyGram sees as a need to have a guaranteed, fast and
economical supply of CDs for its largest markets.
The group plans to make CD-I discs for interactive TV games and other
programmes stored in compact discs.
PolyGram also announced plans recently to manufacture digital compact
cassettes, the new audio cassette tape format to be introduced by Philips,
at its Amersfoot plant in the Netherlands.

FT  17 JUN 92 / International Company News: Foreign stake in Total set to
rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN ownership of Total, the French oil company, will rise from 30 per
cent to 40 per cent as a result of the forthcoming government share sale,
the group said yesterday.
Mr Serge Tchuruk, chairman, welcomed the move as likely to improve the
liquidity of the market for Total shares and help dispel an image of heavy
state control. The sale, by far the biggest of the socialist government's
programme of asset sales, will take place before July 10 if market
conditions permit.
It will reduce the stake held by the government and state controlled
institutions from 33.9 per cent to 15 per cent. The state's direct stake
will fall from 31.6 per cent to 5 per cent. State controlled banks and
insurance companies will raise their stake from 2.3 per cent to 10 per cent,
said Mr Tchuruk.
The existing state-owned investors are the insurance groups GAN and AGF, but
it is not yet known which groups will buy the extra shares to be offered to
the public sector. The sale, organised by Paribas, is expected to raise up
to FFr10bn (Dollars 1.84bn) to fund the government's employment policies,
but there will be no fresh cash for the company.
Most of the new foreign shareholders will be British and American, said Mr
Tchuruk. Of the 22.9m shares being sold, 35 per cent will be made available
to the French market, 32 per cent will be for the US and 33 per cent for the
rest of the world.
The government does not plan to create a golden share to defend Total
against takeovers, but will have the right to suspend any board decision
likely to modify control, said Mr Tchuruk. In addition, Total would be
seeking to build up a larger core of loyal long term shareholders, he said.
The company's existing statutes oblige investors to declare shareholdings of
2 per cent.
Total did not envisage raising fresh capital for its own needs.

FT  17 JUN 92 / International Company News: Swiss to grant banking licences
to Japanese
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALL Japanese banks and securities companies that qualify will be granted
Swiss banking licences before the end of the year, according to a senior
Swiss government official.
The large Japanese financial fraternity in Switzerland has been in a state
of high tension in recent weeks because of the approach of a deadline under
Swiss law obliging all non-banks to convert themselves into banks by the end
of the year.
Applications from Japanese financial institutions have been blocked pending
the completion of bilateral negotiations on various financial issues.
Mr Alexis Lautenberg, head of the financial and economic division of the
foreign affairs ministry, said yesterday that the talks had been
'successful' and so all the Japanese institutions that 'qualified
objectively' would get licences. 'They should relax and be confident,' he
added.
In the talks, the Swiss sought an easing of Japan's tight restraints on
overseas deposits by individuals and the abolition of restrictions on
ownership links between the securities and banking units of Swiss banks in
Japan.
Mr Lautenberg would not reveal the results, which hinge in part on the
passage this week of a financial reform bill in the Japanese parliament.
Twenty Japanese banks and securities houses have Swiss banking licences, but
21 with Swiss operations do not. Mr Lautenberg said that Switzerland would
not issue 21 licences.
The conversion to bank status requires a sharp increase in capital and it is
expected that many institutions, suffering from a capital squeeze at home,
will not apply.
The attraction of the Swiss licence to the Japanese is that, from the
beginning of next year it will enable them to operate throughout Europe,
provided that Switzerland joins the European Economic Area.
Japanese bankers and brokers believe that 10 licences will be offered. The
Japanese MoF will then decide to whom they should be issued.

FT  17 JUN 92 / International Company News: Kuwaitis seek a smoother ride in
Spain - The search following the resignation of KIO's investment manager
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MADRID investment bankers, in the doldrums as a sluggish economy has taken
its toll of acquisitions and stock market flotations, have been galvanised
by news that the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) is looking for a new
investment partner in Spain.
KIO, based in London, needs help in Madrid to manage its vast Spanish
holdings following the resignation earlier this month of its Spanish
associate, Mr Javier de la Rosa, as deputy chairman of Grupo Torras, KIO's
Spanish holding company. In keeping with the orthodox investment strategies
being moulded by KIO's new post-Gulf war managers, it wants a partner, and
is understood to be talking to J. P. Morgan, First Boston and, possibly,
Banco Bilbao Vizcaya.
A partnership with any of these institutions would be a world away from the
ride KIO experienced with the mercurial Mr De la Rosa for the past eight
years.
KIO stumbled across him as a young banker in 1984 when he helped it buy a
small paper company, Impacsa, in Catalonia. In the years that followed, KIO,
with Mr De la Rosa as an independent point man, spent about Dollars 2bn
buying Spain's biggest chemicals group, ERT, creating the country's largest
papermaker, Torras Hostench, and buying one of its largest foods groups,
Ebro Agricolas.
The partnership was close. The bank he ran when they met collapsed in 1986
and, despite the resulting controversy, KIO stuck with him. KIO's nerve only
failed once, in 1989 when it pulled out of a venture with two Madrid
businessmen to try to take control of Banco Central.
By then, though, the Kuwaitis were the biggest foreign investors in Spain.
KIO-Torras-De la Rosa were merging ERT with a fertiliser company to form
Ercros. They owned Prima, an aggressive property group. They bought a
stockbroker and a small insurance company. In Ebro, like ERT, they shook the
establishment by mounting Spain's first hostile takeovers.
The holding company, Torras, went public in 1988 and then, capitalised in
the markets at around Dollars 1.6bn, bought its shares back two years later
as Spain's economic boom began to falter and the market, having been tapped
for large rights issues, began to worry about the effect Torras'
acquisitions were having on profitability. Torras felt it was being
undervalued in the markets.
Ercros and Ebro continued to quote in the markets but KIO and Mr De la Rosa
had tight control of the Grupo Torras holding company. After the invasion of
Kuwait in 1990, KIO injected some Dollars 2bn into Grupo Torras to reassure
fidgety creditors. Last year, those loans were converted into equity, nearly
doubling Torras capital to Pta21bn (Dollars 212m) and boosting reserves by
some Pta155bn to Pta180bn.
By then Mr De la Rosa had begun to say he wanted to devote more time to his
own expanding financial interests, but KIO, preoccupied by the war, was in
no condition to assume close control of Torras.
Also, Ercros had begun to go badly wrong. A merger with the state's
fertiliser producer had not stabilised domestic prices and Ercros last year
lost more than Pta15bn. Grupo Torras is said to have lost Pta9bn in 1991.
Prima has also gone into debt as the property market has cooled.
Mr De la Rosa needed to stabilise Ercros before leaving Torras. Earlier this
year he persuaded the US commodities group Freeport MacMaRon to pump new
capital into a joint venture with the Ercros fertiliser and mining
operations. To get support from Madrid, which had heavily subsidised part of
Ercros, he persuaded Mr Jose Recio, a banker and member of the ruling
socialist party, to become president.
Two days after Mr Recio arrived at Ercros, Mr De la Rosa announced he was
leaving Torras, although he has bought 20 per cent of the profitable Ebro
group this year and intends to keep it. Whether KIO is happy with this
remains to be seen, and it is not clear whether the amicable parting will
remain so.
But without Mr De la Rosa, even as an adviser, KIO's new management faces a
tough time understanding the nature of its assets in Spain, and it needs
time to decide what to do with them. Today KIO's leadership is meeting Mr
Carlos Solchaga, the Spanish finance minister, to discuss its plans.
But Mr De la Rosa's impetuous style has made him powerful enemies and KIO
may not find that time. Last February, in a move that could have alarmed
KIO, Barnett Fernandes, a London public relations company sent a note, on
behalf of an unnamed client, to UK newspapers denouncing Mr De la Rosa's
businesses and accusing him of plotting to topple the governor of the Bank
of Spain.
A shy, secretive investor, KIO shuns from publicity and may have been
content to bid farewell to Mr De la Rosa, now 44. And if the Kuwaitis do
find a new partner in Spain, it might be to do no more than find a way out.
Although Mr De la Rosa believes KIO will stay, he would take a hard look at
any of the businesses they shed. He already knows them better than anyone.

FT  17 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Taunton Cider to join market with Pounds
150m tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAUNTON CIDER, the UK's second largest cider maker, is expected to raise
between Pounds 75m and Pounds 85m from its planned stock market flotation
later this month.
The company, acquired by its management last year for Pounds 72.5m from a
consortium of brewers including Bass, Courage, and Scottish &amp; Newcastle,
will have a market capitalisation of about Pounds 150m.
Directors and more than 500 employees, who invested a total of Pounds
650,000 in the management buy-out backed by Samuel Montagu and Morgan
Grenfell Development Capital, will emerge with a 10 per cent stake - worth
about Pounds 15m - in the company. The original lending institutions will
hold about 50 per cent of the enlarged share capital.
The share offer will be split equally between the public and a placing with
institutional investors. The offer price will be announced on July 7.
About Pounds 70m raised by the issue of new shares will be used to pay off
bank and other borrowings, reducing the company's debt to about Pounds 10m
or less than 50 per cent of shareholders' funds. The sale of shares by
existing shareholders is expected to amount to about Pounds 10m.
Mr Peter Adams, chief executive, who led the management buy-out, said
yesterday that the increased financial flexibility provided by the flotation
would enable Taunton to take advantage of further opportunities for growth.
Results for the year since the buy-out, published in the pathfinder
prospectus yesterday, showed a 34 per cent increase in operating profits to
Pounds 16.7m (Pounds 12.5m) on turnover 11 per cent ahead at Pounds 105.3m.
Operating margins rose from 13.1 per cent to 15.9 per cent. Pre-tax profits
fell from Pounds 10.3m to Pounds 7.4m, reflecting interest charges of Pounds
9.6m on the buy-out debt.
Taunton claims a 33 per cent volume share of the UK cider market compared to
the 45 per cent of HP Bulmer, the market leader.
Heavy advertising by the two companies, which has given cider a more
contemporary image, helped to maintain overall market growth last year to
76.8m gallons, worth nearly Pounds 600m, while sales of beer and spirits
declined. Though the cider market has more than doubled in volume in the
past 20 years, sales still represent less than 6 per cent of beer sales.
Taunton's growth took off in the late 1960s and early 1970s with increased
distribution through Courage and Bass pubs and the launch of Dry Blackthorn,
its mainstream brand and number two to Bulmer's Strongbow, which now
accounts for 35 per cent of the company's sales.
In recent years, Taunton has had a successful record of new product
development, particularly in the higher-margin, premium sector, which is now
dominated by its Diamond White brand.
Red Rock, launched in 1989, has been targeted on lager drinkers; and its
most recent brand, Brody, launched nationally last month has already
achieved significant distribution.
Mr Adams said yesterday that the programme of new product development would
continue with the introduction of brands to meet varying consumer tastes and
to capitalise on trends in the drinks market.

Sheriff Holdings, which serves the contracting and construction industries,
slightly improved both turnover and profit in the six months ended March 31
1992.
Sales were up Pounds 3,000 to Pounds 4.7m and pre-tax profit rose Pounds
8,000 to Pounds 161,000. In the core plant business, hire turnover
experienced a marginal downturn, whereas sales of minor equipment and cabins

from Abelson Plant, purchased last December for Pounds 2.55m.
Since the purchase gearing had been reduced from 85 per cent to below 70 per
cent.
Earnings improved to 1.7p (1.5p). The interim dividend is lifted to 1p

Pounds 84.5m from BET, the business services group, Mr Hancock and his
seven-man buy-out team are floating Anglian with a market valuation of about
Pounds 200m.
To say the least, Mr Hancock's team has greatly benefited from the
misfortunes at BET where new management is trimming back on the excesses of
a late 1980's acquisition binge.
Not only did the buy-out team obtain a company that was already cash
generative and profitable, but just before BET's financial year-end in
March, Anglian was also able to make an early repayment of a Pounds 30m loan
note which BET provided to help finance the buy-out.
By repaying early, Anglian is able to avoid paying BET a considerably
greater deferred consideration on flotation.
Anglian's first year results after the buy-out produced operating profits of
Pounds 15.5m, broadly in line with projections made to BET.
It was during the next year, and despite the recession, that the MBO team
made profits sing and laid the basis for shareholders to seek an earlier
than expected exit through the flotation.
After increasing prices by 7.5 per cent in February 1991 and cutting costs,
operating profits for the year to March 1992 jumped to Pounds 23m on
turn-over almost unchanged at Pounds 145.6m.
Net cash from operations jumped 19 per cent to Pounds 26.7m and operating
margins were nearly 50 per cent higher at 15.8 per cent.
According to Mr Hancock, current trading is 'at least as good as last year'
despite no real sign of any economic upturn.
'In the short term we may have to continue the same discounting policy but
with new products in September we will not be so reliant on discounting
policy,' he says.
'We expect to make 15.8 per cent margins with the same discounting policy.'
While the company has been forced to discount, it has remained remarkably
unscathed by slow consumer spending. Before recession hit - and indeed
before BET sold - the company cut 180 jobs in its manufacturing plants in
Norwich and closed some of the branches through which it supports and
co-ordinates its self-employed sales and installation teams.
Anglian has also had little exposure to the new building market. Almost 75
per cent of sales are replacement windows and doors made from rigid PVC-U, a
product Anglian successfully introduced to the UK market 12 years ago.
From this base Anglian has more recently moved into conservatories and is
breaking into the new build market and sales to commercial and local council
buildings.
Despite this vertical integration, Anglian has only managed to carve a 7 per
cent to 8 per cent share of the replacement window market. The fact that
this is enough to make it market leader ahead of Bowater Windows and Everest
is testimony not only to the market's fragmentation but also to the degree
to which the company can be grown through increases in market share in the
absence of economic recovery, Mr Hancock says.
There is also growth potential geographically by spreading branches through
the Midlands, the north of England and Scotland and through expansion over
the longer term in France.
The flotation itself is relatively straight forward, involving a placement
of half the shares on offer, by NM Rothschild, and a public offering of the
other half.
About half the company is to be sold. The company will raise approximately
Pounds 56.3m net from a placement and public offering that will be priced on
June 29.
The providers of the venture capital, led by Legal &amp; General Ventures, will
sell a portion of their stake, raising a further Pounds 40m.
As a result the MBO team will be left with about 8 per cent of the enlarged
capital, the workforce will have about 4 per cent and existing shareholders
will keep about 40 per cent.
The proceeds will be used to redeem Pounds 23.6m of preference shares and
the Pounds 30m debt that replaced the loan note from BET and BET will
receive a Pounds 1.5m deferred consider-ation.
As a result, Anglian will add about Pounds 1.4m to cash balances which on a
pro-forma basis stood at about Pounds 10m in March.
At the very least the company's profits will benefit from not having to pay
Pounds 5.7m of interest as it did last year.
Pricing will be decided a week ahead of the closing date for public
applications on July 7.
It will be the subject of intense discussion with brokers and is a
relatively difficult decision as there are few comparable quoted companies
on which Anglian's rating can be based.
The company operates in an industry known to bring either feast or famine
and in which there have been some notable failures.
On the other hand, it has to some degree suffered at the hands of salesmen
from competing double glazing companies who have spent the last three years
undermining Anglian by telling potential customers that the company is
either up for sale or so heavily leveraged that it is unreli-able.
Once shareholders have backed the company with Pounds 200m of equity, this
is a slur they will no longer be able to deploy.
The company's advisers would like Anglian to be rated alongside other
building materials companies.
If that were the case, Anglian could float at a price between 240p and 280p
and would carry an earnings multiple in the mid teens and still be at a
small discount to the sector.

vaccines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
SMITHKLINE Beecham, the Anglo-American pharmaceuticals group, has completed
two deals aimed at positioning itself as a significant force in the world
vaccine market. The agreements mean it is now the second largest in the
market after Merck of the US.
The first deal, with the State of Michigan's department of public health,
gives SB exclusive rights to distribute the department's vaccines in the US
outside Michigan. The products are for diphtheria, tetanus, whole-cell
pertussis and rabies. The two organisations will also jointly research and
develop other paediatric vaccines for US distribution.
The second deal with Pasteur Merieux Serum et Vaccins and Connaught
Laboratories, both subsidiaries of Institut Merieux, gives SB the US
marketing rights for an influenza vaccine designed for children. The product
is awaiting approval from the US Food and Drug Administration. SB refused to
give financial details of either agreement.
It said the deals meant all the elements were in place to provide a full
range of childhood vaccines. The group had vaccine sales of Pounds 140m last
year, according to Mr Jonathan de Pass, an analyst at Barclays de Zoette
Wedd. He said the deals in themselves were not particularly big, but
indicated SB's strategy.
Vaccines have become an increasingly important market as companies have used
biotechnology to create patentable products for which they can charge a
premium.

FT  17 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Lep pension fund has Pounds 900,000
shortfall after property deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PENSION fund of Lep Group is showing a Pounds 900,000 shortfall
following a property deal last year with the freight-forwarding and security
company.
Trustees of Lep Group's pension fund have written to members telling them of
the shortfall.
They have calculated that if the pension fund and group had been wound up in
January benefits for present employees were only 88 per cent covered.
Transfers out of the pension fund by former employees have been suspended.
Last June the trustee company agreed to pay Pounds 12.4m for Coombe Hill
House, just as Lep's problems began to emerge when off-balance sheet
property finance came on balance sheet and the company's debt rose to more
than Pounds 400m.
Profits collapsed and a standstill agreement was signed with its banks.
Coombe Hill House has now been valued at only Pounds 8.5m. Lep blames the
continued weak property market.
The deal represented a high proportion of the pension fund's Pounds 28m of
assets at a time when self investment has been criticised in the pension
industry.
Mr Paul Baines, director of Charterhouse, Lep's financial adviser, said: 'I
am sure that this was not the first case of a pension fund buying assets
from the company.'
Lep had also agreed to increase its contribution significantly in order to
eliminate the shortfall within two to three years.
The group was now proposing that Pounds 180m of its Pounds 530m debts should
be converted to equity. Details of the conversion have yet to be fixed,
although the banks were likely to end up with a substantial portion of Lep's
shares.
Mr Baines said he hoped the reconstruction would be in place by next month.

FT  17 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Volex at Pounds 3.7m as it repositions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOLEX, the specialist wiring and connection systems company, reported
pre-tax profits down from Pounds 4.16m to Pounds 3.68m for the year to March
31, a period of 'strategic repositioning of the group's products and its
markets'.
In July it sold the loss-making Volex Accessories division to Hanson for an
initial Pounds 8.8m. In January it gained access to both the data cable
assemblies business and the US market with the acquisition of Cable Products
for an initial Pounds 8.1m and maximum Pounds 14.6m. Mr Howard Poulson,
chief executive, said he was pleased with Cable's results so far.
The group also decided to change the emphasis of Volex Wiring Systems, the
wiring harness company, over the next two years away from the high volume
car production market and towards the higher margin markets of the
commercial, agricultural and specialist vehicle industries.
The company started production on a contract for John Deere, and Mr Poulson
hoped this would be a 'foothold' with the US tractors group.
Buoyed by a rise in exports to 40 per cent of sales, Pencon emerged as the
group's best performer. It also received a fillip from the government's
decision to introduce safety legislation to make compulsory in the UK the
fitting of plugs, and moulded plugs where appropriate, to electrical
appliances.
Over the year Volex turned borrowings of Pounds 5m into cash of Pounds 5.5m
and Mr Poulson said he was looking to expand the Cable Products side with an
acquisition on the west coast of the US, and to expand Pencon. Group exports
have grown from 15 per cent two years ago to 30 per cent now.
Turnover fell 16 per cent to Pounds 81.6m (Pounds 97.3m) and operating
profits were down by a little less than Pounds 1m to Pounds 3.77m. However
this was boosted by investment income of Pounds 443,000 and lower interest
charges of Pounds 131,000 (Pounds 477,000).
An extraordinary charge of Pounds 5.53m related to provisions for the
withdrawal from the car sector. Earnings dropped to 14.9p (17.9p) and the
final dividend is maintained at 10.5p for an unchanged total of 17p.

Pounds 0.31m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tight cost controls enabled LPA Industries, the USM-quoted industrial
electrical connectors and accessories group, to hold pre-tax profits at
Pounds 310,000 for the six months to March 31.
Turnover was down 7.7 per cent at Pounds 3.18m (Pounds 3.44m) and operating
profits slipped by 2.3 per cent to Pounds 335,000.
Mr Michael Rusch, chief executive, said that strict control on borrowings -
the company is negligibly geared - pressure on debtors and increasing
concentration on exports all helped counteract the 'severe trading
conditions' and produce a 'most satisfactory' result.
Mr Rusch said that customers' big projects were still few and far between,
especially in railway engineering.
The interim dividend is held at 1.65p and is payable from earnings of 2.41p
(2.31p) per share.

FT  17 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Dutch cockle restrictions leave Hazlewood
Foods flat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits at Hazlewood Foods were flat at Pounds 51.3m, against Pounds
51.2m, in the year to end March, as restrictions on Dutch cockle fishing and
a decision to sacrifice margins to boost sales volume offset gains from the
acquisition of Sutherland last summer.
The shares rose 3p to close at 150p.
Mr Peter Barr, chairman, described the year as one of consolidation and
predicted that the group was 'now poised for a period of steady earnings
growth'. The 30 UK businesses had been grouped into seven trading areas, and
a similar plan had been written for the continental European subsidiaries.
Group sales rose 17 per cent to Pounds 632.4m, although Mr John Simons,
finance director, said the underlying gain was 8 per cent, of which 2-3
percentage points were from price increases and the rest volume growth.
Operating profits rose 4.5 per cent to Pounds 60.2m, with margins down from
10.6 to 9.5 per cent.
Sutherland, acquired for Pounds 36.7m in shares, was included for seven
months and contributed profits of Pounds 3.5m, after financing costs. Its
Pounds 16.8m of debt meant group borrowings rose to Pounds 109.7m (Pounds
81.9m), adding 10 percentage points to gearing at 69 per cent. The group
more than covered its capital investment of Pounds 27.9m from internal cash
flow.
Interest charges rose from Pounds 6.3m to Pounds 8.9m, with cover down from
9.1 to 6.7 times. A reduced tax rate of 27.7 per cent (28.5 per cent) but
higher minorities of Pounds 577,000 (Pounds 447,000) left earnings per share
down 4 per cent to 16.42p (17.13p).
A final dividend of 3.9p is proposed to give a total of 6.1p (5.8p).
Mr Simons said the restriction on cockle fishing in Dutch waters cost the
group about Pounds 3m, of which Pounds 2.3m fell in the second half. The
impact of lower margins in the meat, produce and fish businesses knocked
Pounds 3.4m from profits.
Operating profits from grocery fell from Pounds 13m to Pounds 10.9m, but
ready meals profits were up to Pounds 11.8m (Pounds 10.1m) and convenience
foods, which includes most of Sutherland, from Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 5.8m.
Profits from fish fell to Pounds 4.5m (Pounds 5.4m) and from shellfish to
Pounds 7.8m (Pounds 10.6m). Produce profits rose to Pounds 4.8m (Pounds
3.2m) and non-food profits were up from Pounds 3m to Pounds 4.6m.
COMMENT
Hazlewood was one of the highly acquisitive companies of the 1980s and has
long needed the more coherent structure which is now beginning to take
shape. That said, the group must prove itself as a quality growth stock,
which will take rather longer. It is some 4 to 5 years behind Northern
Foods, the company it considered bidding for in 1988. Not surprising, then,
that its rating is well below its erstwhile target. However, a prospective
p/e, on forecasts of Pounds 55m or so, of under 9 is discounting too much.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Foreign airlines raise stakes in DHL
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LUFTHANSA, the German airline, and Japan Airlines are increasing their
stakes in DHL International, the world's largest air courier company, from 5
per cent to 25 per cent each at a time of rapid growth in the express
delivery business.
Nissho Iwai, the Japanese trading house is lifting its holding from 2.5 per
cent to 7.5 per cent, giving the three companies a majority of 57.5 per cent
in Hong Kong-based DHL International which will continue to be run
independently. The remainder will be held by the original founding managers.
The rise in the three companies' stakes came through the exercise of options
taken out when the original investment was made in December, 1990. No price
was given but a figure of about Dollars 500m (Pounds 274m) was put on the
full deal, including the likely increase to a majority, when it was
announced two years ago.
Lufthansa said the decision to increase its stake reflected the buoyancy of
the express packages and air cargo delivery market, the strength of DHL's
own results, and its favourable experience with DHL as a partner.
Mr Patrick Lupo, DHL's chairman, said group turnover this year would be
around Dollars 2.5bn, an increase of more than 20 per cent on 1991.
DHL's European revenues are forecast to reach Dollars 1bn this year, with
growth of 25 per cent in the first quarter. After the US and the UK, Japan
and Germany are DHL's two biggest markets.
Mr Lupo said there was no intention to bring in other partners or for the
present three to increase their stake further.

FT  17 JUN 92 / TML to accept Eurotunnel paper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTRACTORS building the Channel tunnel said yesterday they would be
prepared to accept shares or similar certificates as part settlement of
claims for extra payments of more than Pounds 1bn they are seeking from
Eurotunnel, the project's owner.
Transmanche Link (TML), a consortium of five British and five French
construction companies, is claiming additional payments of about Pounds 800m
at 1985 prices to cover the increased cost of fitting out the rail tunnels
and building two passenger terminals at Folkestone, Kent and Sangatte,
northern France.
The total claims made by TML rise to more than Pounds 1bn at 1985 prices if
contractors' demands for additional payments for other parts of the project
are included.
Talks between TML and Eurotunnel aimed at trying to resolve the issue
resumed last autumn. The negotiations have included the possibility that
contractors might accept some form of Eurotunnel paper in part settlement of
their claims. TML, in a statement signed by all 10 construction companies
said last night that 'in order to help Eurotunnel' it would be 'prepared to
accept payment of a limited part of the money owing to them'.
Eurotunnel stressed that TML's claims still had to be substantiated and said
that it 'was not envisaging a substantial issue to TML'. Any issue would
have to be submitted to shareholders for prior approval. The group
previously has said that any issue would form less than 10 per cent of the
group's equity. It is more likely however that Eurotunnel would want to
issue some form of convertible loan stock.
Eurotunnel, because it is in technical breach of its loan covenants, has
been forced to seek a waiver from its banks to allow it to draw down further
funds to enable construction to continue.
The breach has been caused by the increased cost of building the project,
which since 1987 has risen from Pounds 4.8bn to more than Pounds 8bn, and
lower revenues expected in the first year of operation due to a delay in
receiving sufficient rolling stock to operate a full service.
The banks, in return for granting a waiver, have been putting pressure on
Eurotunnel and TML to reach an early agreement on their claims. Both sides
say many details remain before agreement can be reached.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Swedish banks crisis deepens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE biggest banking crisis in Sweden for more than half a century showed
signs of deepening yesterday with further evidence of mounting credit losses
and deteriorating financial results.
The country's commercial banks and financial institutions are being hit by
the difficulties caused by troubled loans to property and finance companies
during the last decade.
Senior banking analysts in Stockholm believe that it could be three years
before stability is restored to the banking system. All four leading banks
are undergoing, or seeking ways of, strengthening their underlying financial
bases.
In an attempt to end uncertainties and volatility in its earnings, Gota
Bank, the country's fourth largest bank, announced yesterday it was being
supported through a SKr13.5bn (Pounds 1.2bn) financial insurance plan for
the next five years covering its entire loan portfolio for losses and unpaid
interest.
The bank said that the size of the premiums payable will amount to between
SKr8bn to SKr10bn spread over the period to 1996.
As a result of the scheme Gota's credit losses for the first four months of
the year were SKr210m and not SKr1.147bn although this still left the Gota
group with an operating deficit of SKr638m.
The breadth of the banking crisis was also illustrated by results from other
banks.
Foreningsbank announced a SKr175m operating loss for the first four months.
This was a 43 per cent improvement on the same period of 1991, but credit
losses totalled SKr926m and the bank said the outlook was so uncertain it
could not give any forecast for the whole of 1992.
Svenska Handelsbanken, Sweden's third largest commercial bank with a
reputation for prudence, announced a 35 per cent drop in its profits for the
first four months to SKr664m due to credit losses that totalled SKr1.559bn
for the same period, a 47 per cent jump on the first four months of 1991.
These results follow rapidly on last weeks' announcement of the first-ever
financial operating loss of SKr600m for the first four months by
Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, the country's largest commercial bank, and
the troubles at state-controlled Nordbanken, which announced a SKr1.97bn
loss for the first four months.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Chink in the armour of US regulation: Moves towards a global
market in equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Globalisation is a rather tarnished concept. So what should be made of
proposals which could allow non-US investment companies - such as UK unit
trusts - to sell their shares more freely to American investors, as long as
US mutual funds obtain similar access overseas?
The question is topical because of a recent report by the Securities and
Exchange Commission, the US securities industry watchdog. This 540-page
document had its genesis two years ago, when the SEC decided to review some
50-year-old legislation governing its investment management industry.
Proposals in the report are sweeping, stretching beyond the
'internationalisation' issue. The document suggests, for example, that
restrictions on the sales fees which US investors can be charged by the
nation's Dollars 1,300bn (Pounds 722bn) mutual fund industry should be
largely abandoned.
It recommends that funds specifically for sophisticated investors should be
freed from onerous registration requirements. And it advocates allowing
funds' shares to be sold, European-style, by advertisement, ditching the
requirement that investors see a full prospectus.
The aim of reforms such as these is twofold: to streamline regulation,
hopefully stimulating innovation; and to introduce more competition.
The main suggestions on globalisation are: Foreign investment companies
should be permitted to sell shares in the US without having to meet all
provisions of the Investment Company Act, provided they are subject to
regulation in their home country which provides 'substantially equivalent'
protection for investors. Their entry into the US should also be 'in the
public interest'.
The SEC should be authorised to enter bilateral agreements with other
regulatory organisations to facilitate this.
The SEC should support tax changes to help US investment companies compete
abroad.
The SEC should restrict its supervision of 'foreign advisers' who register
to do business in the US. It should not regulate a registered foreign
adviser's dealings with clients outside the US.
At first glance, the proposals seem commonsense. The 1940 Investment Company
Act bars a foreign investment company from making a public offering of its
shares in the US unless the SEC believes it can enforce compliance with all
provisions of the act (in this case, it grants a 'section 7(d) order').
Since the act prohibits practices which are commonplace in Europe this means
a foreign fund wishing to sell shares to US investors must structure itself
and operate like a US investment company. As the report notes, no foreign
investment company has obtained a 7(d) order for almost two decades.
Equally, a foreign investment adviser, who registers with the SEC to sell
services in the US, will find all his activities - in the US and outside -
become subject to the 1940 Investment Advisers Act. A non-US adviser can
discover that legitimate business in his home country proves illegal under
US rules. To get around this problem, foreign advisers set up 'independent'
subsidiaries, registered in the US, to advise US clients. Such arrangements
can prove cumbersome.
However, whether the SEC staff proposals present a practical answer to these
problems is another matter.
For a start, it is uncertain how speedily changes in the US could be
implemented - even assuming that higher authorities at the SEC are
supportive. Giving foreign companies the right to sell shares in the US
without effectively turning them into US operations would require
legislative changes, for example.
The domestic impetus behind such a change seems questionable. The Investment
Company Institute, which represents the US fund management industry and has
been talking informally to counterparts in Europe about increased
reciprocity, has been only lukewarm.
Ironically, political elements within the SEC may be more enthusiastic than
the industry. 'This time round, the SEC is quite proud of the US investment
industry,' says Mr Pierre de St Phalle, a partner with Davis Polk &amp;
Wardwell, the US law firm. 'So I think they're keen to push the reciprocity
idea.'
Obstacles to sales reciprocity do not end with federal regulation. There is
a series of diverse state rules, known as the 'blue sky laws'. As the SEC
report notes: 'This second layer of registration is arguably more burdensome
for a foreign investment company . . . since (it) must also satisfy
applicable regulatory requirements in its home country.'
Conversely, it is unclear how much advantage US funds would gain in Europe,
even if satisfactory bilateral agreements were secured. After all, they can
already register a fund in Luxembourg - but are still hampered by the
marketing demands of different European countries and tax disadvantages.
More fundamentally, it is questionable how great the 'cross-border' demand
really is. Big institutional investors are showing a greater appetite for
globally diversified portfolios - although on the US side, interest has
increased from low levels.
But even if this is indicative of investor demand generally, it may be met
by a growth in locally registered funds which concentrate on holding foreign
issues, The number of US-registered open-ended international equity funds,
for example, rose from approximately two dozen in 1985, to 145 at
end-December.
Still, if increased reciprocity for mutual fund sales is a subject on which
the fund management industry - on both sides of the Atlantic - is cool,
other elements of the SEC report enjoy a warmer response. The suggestion,
for example, that regulation of non-US advisers should be restricted is seen
by some UK fund managers as having real practical value.
Also, the suggestion that an unlimited number of 'qualified purchasers'  -
that is, sophisticated investors - should be allowed to hold shares in a
non-US fund where these are sold by private placement, wins some plaudits.
The limit is currently 100 US shareholders.
But globalisation, it seems, can wait.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TML's confirmation that it will consider Eurotunnel shares as part of a
claims settlement suggests this idea may well feature in any final deal. The
trouble is that the UK members of the Anglo-French building consortium
desperately want cash. Eurotunnel shareholders must hope that Sir Alastair
Morton can persuade them not to dump any new holdings in the market, given
the effect this would have on the already fragile share price.

FT  17 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Swedish banks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's announcements from Gota and Svenska Handelsbanken are a rude
reminder of how intractable the crisis in Swedish banking has become. Unlike
SEBanken, Sweden's largest bank, Handelsbanken is still in profit. But
non-performing loans virtually doubled in the first four months. Gota has
insured its loan portfolio with Trygg-Hansa, its main shareholder. US banks
have insured developing country loans in the past, but Gota is paying a high
premium to protect itself against losses. That smacks of more than just
financial engineering. At least depositor confidence should improve now the
insurance is in place.
Eventually Swedish bank profits should rebound as loan loss provisions
abate. That point is still a long way off. Sweden's banking crisis is not as
acute as that facing Finland or Norway, but the repercussions have now hit
even well-managed banks like Handelsbanken. Worries about currency stability
prevent Sweden from applying the normal palliative of lower interest rates.
The banks themselves are hardly optimistic. Sharply higher provisions for
the first four months suggests they do not expect much respite this year, if
any at all.

FT  17 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: National Power
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is no denying National Power's confidence. In part, the mood reflects
the increasing likelihood that the government will sell its remaining 40 per
cent stake in the two electricity generators once British Coal has been
privatised. More generally, the company has much to be confident about.
Yesterday's 10 per cent dividend increase was a curt response to PowerGen's
larger increase last week. While National Power's Pounds 101m of extra
provisions looked unnecessary in the short term, the company was admirably
forthcoming about its desire to protect future profits. It is not just that
several thousand more jobs are to be cut over the next two years. National
Power is also accelerating its plant closure programme, which means higher
depreciation charges than anticipated at privatisation.
Put back the provisions, and pre-tax profits grew by more than twice the
stated 18 per cent. Equally, PowerGen's figures contained one-off income and
Pounds 127m of provisions, without which profits growth would have been a
similar 40 per cent. The main difference is in the underlying operating
performance, where, by most measures, National Power was the more efficient.
It has plenty of scope to restore the parity of its dividend in future.

FT  17 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: UK buy-outs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Anglian and Taunton Cider can obviously be accused of returning to market
with indecent haste, respectively within 18 and 13 months of being purchased
by their managers. But the speed with which these two companies have been
readied for flotation surely says something for the success of the
management buy-out phenomenon. A more interesting question for investors -
given that these two, MFI and Kenwood Appliances currently make up a highly
unusual MBO quartet - is whether such companies can retain sufficient
motivation to provide attractive stock market returns.
The large quantity of debt taken on by many MBOs is often seen as hampering
access to capital - but as the MFI team will testify the balance sheet
structure provides a powerful incentive for operating efficiency. Taunton's
interest costs jumped from just Pounds 190,000 in the year before its
buy-out to almost Pounds 10m last year - a burden which no doubt helped spur
a full 2.8 percentage point improvement in margins. Relieved of some of the
pressure by new capital from investors  - and personally enriched in the
process - is there not a temptation for management to sit back and relax?
A glance at the unweighted performance of the 27 MBOs floated since 1988 -
and still retain their listings - suggests otherwise. On average, they have
outpaced the market by 17 per cent, with the five biggest collectively
outperforming the All-Share by 57 per cent. Perhaps this should be no
surprise. MBO teams that survive the ordeal are likely to be sharper than
many run-of-the-mill public company boards, while the advisers generally
make sure they and their employees have a continuing stake in the business.
The buy-out process, it seems, creates a momentum of its own.

FT  17 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: PSBR in perspective
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It would be a comfort if May's Pounds 3.1bn PSBR was a sign that worries
over government finances had been overdone. The figure is significantly
lower than the market expected. Unfortunately, it has been compressed by
distortions relating particularly to the timing of transfer payments to
local government. The underlying picture remains depressing. Income tax and
social security contributions are barely changed on a year ago, while
corporation tax receipts have fallen by two thirds to Pounds 150m. If that
trend continues, the government could well be on course to exceed its
full-year target of Pounds 28bn.
The only consolation is that this prospect is now largely accepted by the
gilts market, especially after its correction following Denmark's Maastricht
referendum. Indeed, the slippage in prices since then probably owes as much
to the end of post-election euphoria as to concern about currency union.
During that time gilts have out-performed French Treasury issues, but,
unlike the UK, France is to hold a referendum on Maastricht.
Certainly the market took yesterday's Bank of England auction announcement
in its stride. At Pounds 2.75bn, the total on offer is slightly above
expectations, which in turn suggests the Bank believes that demand has
returned at the longer end of the maturity spectrum. All the same, there
will be some nail-biting in Threadneedle Street until the Irish vote is
counted.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Letter: 'Decade of choice' for retirement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms SALLY GREENGROSS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was most heartened to read Diane Summers' report ('Support For
Flexible Pension Age', June 15) that the majority of managers favour a
flexible retirement age - and a larger pension the later people retire.
Age Concern England has long been in favour of a flexible 'decade of
retirement' giving individuals the choice as to when they retire. People
should be able to choose whether to continue to work or draw a pension over
a given age range, for example, 60 to 70.
Both men and women should be able to draw an adequate pension at 60,
otherwise the choice to retire at this age with enough to live on will only
be accessible to those with substantial private pensions or investment
income.
Although there would be considerable cost involved in providing full
pensions to both sexes at 60, Age Concern England believes this is an option
the government should give full and detailed attention to before any final
decision is made about pension ages. It is time for a 'decade of choice' not
restrictions.

Sir, I was very glad to see you addressing the government's proposals on
London Transport in your leader, 'A better way for buses', but I do wish you
had considered the visual effects of deregulation in the capital.
Take a walk or a drive along Park Lane and you will see that the carriage
way bordering Hyde Park from Hyde Park Corner to Marble Arch has become a
permanent parking strip for coaches and buses. This world-famous road in the
heart of our capital is now blighted for the benefit of our beloved
entrepreneurs, uncontrolled and unregulated. With the likely conversion of
County Hall into a tourist and leisure centre in mind it may not be too
fanciful to imagine a funfair going up in St James's Park and hotdog stands
outside Buckingham Palace.
What a fall this has been from capital of an empire to an increasingly
grubby tourist centre.

Sir, I would like to add to your excellent editorial, 'A better way for
buses' (June 5).
Passenger miles have indeed declined as people use their own transport in
preference to deregulated buses, but not everyone has that choice. As the
bus network decays so more and more of those least able to fend for
themselves - the poor, the old, the disabled - become isolated and
imprisoned in the homes. Some measure of mobility is achieved in shire
counties by providing low-cost bus routes on the back of home-to-school or
social service runs, but this life line for the disadvantaged is not
mentioned by the government in its advice to the Commission on Local
Government reorganisation; it must be regarded as under threat.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Letter: Monetary union and the political dimension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN STEVENS MEP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leading article 'Hard questions from the BIS' (June 16), while an
admirable summary of the bank's annual report, does not convey its true
import for the issue of European Monetary Union.
This is that the BIS view of the fundamental importance of the political
dimension in achieving a single currency - notably with regard to the
commitment of the proposed central bank to monetary stability and the
enforcement of sound fiscal discipline - enhances the prospect of an inner
core European Monetary Union going ahead without Britain.
There is no question that the BIS report reflects current German thinking.
Much of the recent criticism of the Maastricht deal in the federal republic
has centred on the perceived inadequate political return Chancellor Helmut
Kohl obtained for agreeing to surrender the D-Mark. The Germans, for
example, have always been sceptical that liberalised financial markets alone
would be able to restrain member states from abusing a single currency
system through over-borrowing.
Essentially the BIS position shows how difficult it may be to convince some
continental opinion to detach European economic from political integration -
the main aim of Britain's policy ever since it joined the Community. In the
maelstrom of the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty and, even more
perhaps, if the Maastricht Treaty were to collapse, the time for hard
choices may not be long delayed.

list

<TEXT>
Sir, Having failed to obtain a single award for any one of a large number of
highly deserving engineering manufacturers over no less than a decade, may I
suggest that your headline, 'Business leaders and former MPs dominate
awards' (June 13), may be less than accurate.
Every life peer was connected with politics in some way, either appointed by
the government or a politician in his or her own right. The word 'dominate'
could not apply less to business leaders.
Even down the list of civil servants, academics and service industries
predominate. They outweigh much more deserving people.
It seems to me that the honours list, of doubtful value at any time, has far
outlived its usefulness and should be dumped. If this is not to be, then may
I suggest that the selection committee and all to do with it be removed from
the civil service. Indeed, it seems an excellent example where privatisation
might well permit it to do a much better job and perhaps survive.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Personal View: Boundaries of fair play
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Monday, the House of Commons gave a second reading to the Boundary
Commissions Bill. The Home Secretary describes it as a desirable piece of
administrative tidying up and it is not being officially opposed but some
Labour MPs consider it a shameless gerrymander intended to decide the next
general election.
Mutual agreement was behind the original rules for boundary-drawing in 1944.
But those rules have proved unsatisfactory. Mutual agreement was, to some
degree, behind their modification in 1958. But in 1948, and again in 1969,
it was the Labour party that, unilaterally, engaged in what the
Conservatives each time called a shameless gerrymandering by altering or
delaying the commissioners' recommendations.
There are four boundary commissions, one each for England, Scotland, Wales
and Northern Ireland. Since 1958 they have been required to recommend a new
set of boundaries to the House of Commons at intervals of not more than 15
years. Mr Kenneth Clarke wants to change the term to 12 years to ensure that
the current revision is complete by December 31 1994, leaving the prime
minister free to call an election at the moment when the economy is at its
most favourable in the fourth or fifth year of this parliament.
In last month's general election, successful Conservative candidates had on
average 71,084 electors in their constituencies; Labour MPs had 61,546. A
revision of boundaries that aims to equalise constituency size will
necessarily cost Labour several seats. Labour city centres get depopulated;
Conservative suburbs grow. Despite some whistling in the wind by Mr Roy
Hattersley and Walworth Road, it seems certain that Labour will lose between
10 and 20 seats - making a difference of between 20 and 40 to the majority
in parliament. It is easy to see why the Conservatives are eager for the
change and why some people are eager to obstruct it. When a government has
an overall majority of 21 (or less after by-elections) a straight addition
of 30 or so will look like a welcome bonus when the dissolution comes.
There is an administrative case for reforming the current arrangements quite
apart from the partisan one. The existing procedures are cumbersome. The
1983 redistribution took more than seven years to complete: the new
boundaries that came into force in June 1983 were based on registration
figures compiled in October 1975. The delay produced anomalies in
constituency size. In Australia in 1984, it took only seven months to redraw
the political map, turning 125 constituencies into 148 with full judicial
hearing for any objections to the changes. But in the UK, boundary
commissioners have been unpaid and the High Court judge at their head is
only allowed one day every six weeks to attend to the work. The commissions
have been seriously understaffed. Appeals can be farcical. Everyone involved
knows that they are in effect a political charade in which no one may utter
the key phrase 'party advantage'.
The rules binding the commissioners contain at least three anomalies. First
they are told to make constituency electorates 'as equal as practicable'
while they are also told to respect natural communities 'as far as
practicable'. There is no guidance on how far from the quota (currently
69,281 for England) they may diverge in order to make a constituency
coterminous with a local authority - but they have (perhaps rightly) already
decided to keep the Isle of Wight (with 102,000 or 1.4 times the quota) a
single undivided seat. Until now they have respected London Borough
boundaries but with Kingston at 1.3 quotas and Kensington and Chelsea at
1.2, they seem likely for the first time to treat Greater London as a single
unit. As a single unit, it is entitled to 71 seats whereas if the 32
boroughs are treated as separate, inviolable units, London is entitled to
77. London now has 84 seats - will it lose 13 or only seven?
Every redistribution necessarily increases the size of the House of Commons
 -it has drifted from 625 in 1950 to 650 in 1983. It is likely to be more
than 660 in 1995.
There is also the possibility of litigation, reasonable or vexatious. Late
in 1982, three different Labour-inspired lawsuits delayed the last
redistribution by three months. If the House of Lords had been willing to
consider a final appeal, the 1983 general election would probably have had
to be delayed or to have taken place on the old boundaries. Since 1983 there
has been a general leap in the use of judicial review; the number of cases
accepted has tripled. It is difficult to change the rules in midstream - by
now the commissioners have already done a quarter of their work. But unless
the rules are changed, the commissioners may meet Mr Clarke's new deadline
of December 31 1994 only to find that the courts stop him from presenting
their recommendations to parliament until too late for Mr Major's preferred
election date - perhaps even until the next parliament.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Indigestion in the body politic: Germany is trying to
reconcile affluence and sacrifice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arriving in Frankfurt, Germany, there is little to suggest that much is
amiss in Europe's biggest industrial democracy.
The taxi from the airport is a top-of-the-range BMW 7 series. Poking above
the modern skyscrapers that gave the city its nickname of 'Mainhattan' is a
pencil-shaped building taller than London's Canary Wharf that is nearly
fully let. Department stores lure shoppers with ground-floor displays of
gold jewellery and French perfumes rather than racks of modestly priced
clothing as in previous years.
But Germany is experiencing problems. The recent wage conflict, which
ballooned into an 11-day strike of public-service workers, upset the
nation's social consensus and damaged its image abroad. The coalition in
Bonn is in disarray. The Bundesbank's latest monthly report, published
yesterday, shows how unification is much more difficult and costly than
expected.
Germany has become a land of mixed fortunes. Huge transfer payments from
public budgets in the west to consumers in the east have fostered private
affluence and administrative despair. While supporting eastern living
standards and production, in the west they have resulted in large and
growing budget deficits and raised the question of how far Germany is
capable of dealing with its problems.
A recent visit to Frankfurt, Leipzig, Dresden and Bonn, revealed the
contrast between the west Germany of 20 years ago and today's unified
country, but it raised more questions than answers.
Germany has changed greatly and not just because of unification. Some of the
legendary discipline is still apparent, notably in the curious reluctance of
people to defy red signals at pedestrian crossings when there is no traffic.
But recent tensions, such as the public-sector strike, show how western
Germany has ceased to be a model of Stakhanovite effort and highlight its
difficulties in reconciling its affluence with the sacrifices required to
absorb the new eastern Lander.
As always, it is wrong to judge the nation by Bonn, the capital. Bonn, with
its peculiar population mix of politicians, bureaucrats, diplomats and
journalists, has ever been a hot-bed of rumour and a fertile breeding ground
for neuroses. It may be, as some long-resident observers maintain, that
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition of right-wing Christian parties and
liberal Free Democrats is near collapse after almost 10 years in office.
While unsettling, this does not yet spell gloom for the entire country.
Indeed, Mr Klaus Friedrich, a senior economist in the Frankfurt headquarters
of Dresdner Bank, maintains that foreigners rather than Germans are the ones
now falling prey to 'angst' about the state of Germany. Unification has
created tensions, and statesmanship is in short supply, he admits. But
unification, although a shock, will be successfully managed. 'It is like a
python that has swallowed a sheep. It takes time to digest,' he says.
A few hundred kilometres to the east, in Dresden - the bank's original home
 -gritty determination rather than confidence seems to be the order of the
day. 'Things are much worse than we expected,' explains Mr Josef Hoss, who
has moved from Bavaria to be head of finance in the city administration.
'But basically we should and can be optimistic. Dresden and Saxony have
economic potential despite 40 years as part of east Germany.'
But Mr Hoss and his fellow city leaders have to overcome daunting
difficulties to realise this potential. Holding up investment are 40,000
claims for restitution or compensation from former property owners in the
city and he has only 60 officials to clear the backlog. The monotonous
blocks of flats near his office are a constant reminder of the city's
sub-standard housing stock. Dresden's infrastructure is inadequate: even a
properly managed rubbish dump is lacking.
The handicaps facing the old industrial companies of eastern Germany are
also great. They have lost their markets in the former Comecon trading area,
been savaged by west German competition and obliged to pay wages approaching
western levels. Mr Hans-Jurgen Alt, general manager of the Saxon Industry
Federation and another recent arrival from the west, says his members' unit
wage costs are twice those in the west.
Nor, so far, has there been any strong inflow of private investment to
upgrade industrial productivity. The Federal Economics Ministry in Bonn
complains that corporate investment per head of population in eastern
Germany is only 60 per cent of western German levels. The big fear is that
the new Lander will eventually share the latest 'British disease' of having
a modern and efficient industrial base that is too small to sustain high
employment and wealth creation.
Infrastructure investment, by contrast, is growing strongly and per head of
population is currently 130 per cent of western levels. But financing is a
headache. Dresden met just 5 per cent of its financing needs from its own
tax base last year compared with 30 to 35 per cent in most western German
cities. The collapse of much of the city's industry meant that it gathered
only DM39m (Pounds 13.4m) in local business taxes last year. 'Normally I
should get between DM440m and DM500m from a city this size,' Mr Hoss says.
Revenues are rising slowly. But the former east Germany will depend on
transfers from the west for many years. Transfers to the whole of eastern
Germany totalled DM140bn in 1991 and could reach DM180bn in 1992. At this
rate, the east is absorbing wealth at a faster rate than is being generated
by economic growth, says Mr Ulrich Ramm, chief economist of Commerzbank. The
logical response should be belt-tightening in the west. But there is little
sign so far that this need has been recognised.
Indeed, the public-sector workers' strike showed how far Germany's powerful
trade unions are from accepting sacrifice. The counterpart to the social
peace and consensual industrial relations that characterise the outsiders'
view of Germany has been the system's capacity to deliver steadily rising
living standards. Any upset in this routine has invariably resulted in a
struggle over how to share out the national cake and the recent strike
action was no exception to this rule.
The unwillingness of west Germans to shoulder the cost of union puzzled and
hurt Mr Helmut Kohl, the chancellor. With hindsight, analysts agree that the
government was wrong to create the impression that unification would be cost
the taxpayer little or nothing.
Some pundits believe the absence so far of solidarity between west and east
reflects a more deep-seated problem of generational change, accentuated by
the hedonistic nature of western German society. According to Mr Meinhard
Miegel, the director of the Institute for Economic and Social Research, a
right-of-centre think tank in Bonn: 'You are dealing with a society in
western Germany in which ideas of patriotism have been deliberately
de-emphasised over many years. It is difficult, therefore, for the
government to play the patriotic card and tell west Germans why they must
give something up.'
But is this picture of a spoilt nation unwilling to cope with unforeseen
problems universally applicable? Will German unification act as a running
sore on the nation's polity and economy for decades to come? Or will Germany
shake off its current malaise and make a success of unification?
There are some hopeful pointers:
The new Lander are attracting a small but dedicated elite of officials and
administrators from the west. People like Messrs Alt and Hoss and Mr Rudiger
Thiele, who gave up a senior position in the federal chancellery in Bonn to
become state secretary in the Saxony economics ministry, are prepared to put
up with less comfortable surroundings and long hours of work to help rebuild
eastern Germany.
Closer analysis of recent wage settlements suggests the struggle to share
the national wealth is becoming less intense. Although high at 5.4 per cent,
the public-service workers' settlement was well below earlier demands for
double-digit pay increases. The powerful I G Metall union's 21-month deal
for 4m engineering workers was notable for including a 3 per cent wage
increase covering the final nine months.
Although companies in the east face a huge cost burden because the trade
unions insist that they must bring their wage levels up to western levels by
1994, there are signs of a more pragmatic approach at local level. Mr Thiele
cites the case of M Z Zschopau, a Dresden engineering company, where the
local I G Metall branch has agreed that its workers should accept a
temporary 10 per cent pay cut on the understanding that they will be paid
the money, if and when the company makes a profit.
In Saxony, at least, there are hopes that private investment will pick up
after a slow start. Some large plants, such as a new Volkswagen works in
Zwickau due for completion in 1994, will encourage components suppliers. The
region, unlike some other parts of the former east Germany, has a strong
industrial tradition with a well-educated and hard-working labour force.
While Saxony cannot offer low wages - unlike nearby Poland and
Czechoslovakia - it has political and economic stability.
Psychologically and financially, much will depend on the ability of the Bonn
government to cut its deficits. After two years of fiscal laxity, Mr Theo
Waigel, the finance minister, is finalising plans for an austere budget to
be announced early in July. By cutting spending sharply the government would
show leadership. But such belt-tightening can only succeed if the west
German public accepts that unification will mean lower or slower-growing
living standards for many years through wage restraint and reduced public
spending.
Meanwhile, estimates of the time needed to solve the problems of unification
grow daily. Optimists now say adjustment could take 10 years. Others,
including Mr Miegel, suggest that 20 or 25 years are necessary to bring the
new Lander up to western German standards.
Chancellor Kohl and his embattled coalition must gain general acceptance of
such unpalatable prospects before Germany's next national election in 1994.
On the evidence of a recent visit, Germany's ruling class of officials,
politicians and businessmen seems in no doubt that the country will
ultimately make a success of unification. But so far there are only limited
signs that the German public has the necessary patience to see the changes
through.

THE PEOPLE of Ireland have never held so much power. Should they, like the

it would probably fail. But this makes their choice not only more important,
but still more difficult. It is not now a choice between Ireland's being in
the European Union and remaining outside it. It is between a European Union
that might include 11 or even all 12 of the present members of the EC and
either no such union or one far narrower in its membership.
Irish voters must be as clear as possible about the implications of their
choice. What would happen to their country - and to Europe - if the current
project for European Union were to fail?
Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, has been apocalyptic. He has told
the Irish people that rejection of the treaty 'would put the whole future of
European integration at risk and would also put a serious question mark over
our place in Europe'. Similarly, he has warned that 'it is not realistic to
think that we can reject the European Union treaty and still enjoy the
benefits of full membership'.
Yet it is not obvious why this hope must be unrealistic. Why should the EC
not survive an Irish 'no'? If it does survive, why should Ireland - a member
in good standing, just like Denmark - be excluded? Mr Reynold's prophecies
of doom should not be given complete credence.
Large stake
Nevertheless, they cannot be ignored, simply because Ireland's stake is so
large. Ireland is the only poor country that benefits substantially from the
Common Agricultural Policy. It receives a total transfer of some 6 per cent
of its gross domestic product, not to mention six Irish pounds for every
pound paid to the EC.
It would appear mad for the Irish to risk such sums. But while a 'no' vote
would risk such a loss, it would not ensure it. If the EC were to survive
with Ireland still a member, but the project for union were to fail in its
current form, Ireland would still benefit from existing EC policies.
What Ireland would lose would be the planned increases, particularly in the
'cohesion fund', though the scale of those increases now looks uncertain.
But if the Maastricht Treaty is ratified, Ireland expects to receive IPounds
6bn between 1994 and 1998 from the EC's structural and cohesion funds,
compared to the IPounds 3bn it received between 1989 and 1993.
Lost transfers
Apart from the lost transfers, the other likely cost to Ireland would come
via the effect on confidence in peripheral currencies. Ireland has made a
heroic effort at economic convergence within the ERM. Consumer price
inflation is down to 3 1/2 per cent and, prior to the Danish vote, short
term interest rates were less than 0.2 percentage points and long term rates
less than a percentage point above German levels. Complete failure of the
project for economic and monetary union would probably lead to wider
differentials and higher real interest rates, even if the ERM itself were to
survive.
Smaller transfers and higher interest rates: these are the most likely
consequences of a 'no' vote. If Ireland were forced out of the EC
altogether, however, the losses would be far greater and not merely in
budgetary and monetary terms. Ireland might then lose its access to the EC
market as well.
Nevertheless, participation in Emu is itself not necessarily in Ireland's
interest. The lower interest rates that are likely would help, as would the
extra transfers. But Ireland's is a very different economy from those in the
European core and the risks of an irrevocably fixed exchange rate are large.
Without provision for substantial transfers to offset unforseen economic
shocks, participation in Emu would be a gamble.
Irish voters must recognize that a 'no' vote is likely to end concerted
moves towards European Union. For Ireland itself, the economic consequences
of such a vote would depend largely on whether it could remain part of a
still healthy EC: to be outside the EC would be a disaster; to be inside the
EC, but not in Emu, need not be as great a disaster. The prime minister
probably exaggerates how stark the choice facing the Irish people is. But of
its importance for Ireland and for Europe there can be little doubt.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Arts: Prince - Pop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It's not hard to see the appeal of Prince. His spectacular show wafts you
into the night club of your dreams. The sound system is as energising as it
is exciting; the women - and men - on stage as sensual as imagination; look
here, and a screen is firing exotic images; look there, and a dancer is
cartwheeling across the stage. The lights pulverise; the musicians pound.
At the centre of this mayhem is the lithe mannikin himself, five feet
nothing of techno-creativity, who travels to the stage by lift, encased in a
pod and accompanied by 'Thunder'. Now in yellow suit, now black, now purple,
finally in white, he orchestrates the extravaganza from the front, sometimes
playing guitar, sometimes portable keyboards. He pokes his guitar between
his male rapper's legs, or entwines his body around his two female dancers
while tearing off their clothes. He strips off to expose the most elastic
34-year-old body in the business.
It is all too frantically jolly to be decadent. Even the gilt bed that
hovers over the audience on which Prince capers with the girls during
'Insatiable' is more of a fleeting trompe d'oeil than an erotic image. There
is something Shakespearian about it all, Puck's hidden woodland frolics of A
Midsummer Night's Dream, and for once the cavernous Earl's Court did not
manage to destroy the magic.
Perhaps Prince has to keep moving because his songs hardly merit sedentary
listening. This is the world's most flashy disco, with the feet doing the
talking. The audience hardly need to be harangued into joining in. 'That one
was for lovers; this one's for whores', was Prince's main verbal
contribution, as he launched into 'Sexy Motherfucker', a song which just
about sums up his party line and which got the thousands providing the
chorus.
After his lacklustre appearance in 1990 Prince was out to prove that he has
the most melodramatic imagination in pop. On the screens you could catch his
smile as he pushed on relentlessly, never flagging, never doubting the
impact of his extravaganza. He is big enough to let the gigantic Rosie
Gaines on stage with her six octave vocal range and explosive version of 'Dr
Feelgood'.
But in the extended finale Prince bags the acclaim. There is no subtlety; no
emotion; no humanity in the performance. It hardly touches the soul, but
anyone interested in pop music as theatre should catch Prince now.
Earl's Court, until June 24. Manchester Maine Road June 26, Glasgow Parkhead
Stadium June 28.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Arts: Noriko Kawai - Piano Recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In its first incarnation in the early 1980s the signal achievement of
MusICA, and of its organiser Adrian Jack, was to identify and spotlight a
whole collection of young composers whose work fell well outside the
mainstream of contemporary music. Stylistically they belonged to a very
broad church indeed, though Mauricio Kagel had been a vital influence in the
artistic nurturing of a good many of them. The most striking talent, then as
now, was that of Gerald Barry; MusICA introduced several of his early works
and commissioned Barry's first opera The Intelligence Park, which eventually
received its premiere at the Almeida in 1990.
Noriko Kawai's recital in the New MusICA series on Sunday gave over its
first half to Barry's piano music. It was a timely reminder of what an
original and teasing musical thinker he is, and how his abstract brand of
post-modernism can take the simplest material and fashion from it the most
exhilarating and disconcerting discourse. Au milieu (1981) is like a
Clementi study run wild: scales that tumble over themselves, replicate,
accumulate and eventually colonise the whole keyboard. Swinging tripes and
trillibubkins (1986) is a delicate little study in the highest register,
hardly coming into focus before it is all over, while Sur les pointes (1981)
is one of the finest piano pieces of recent times, exploding out of a
sequence of tight metronomic chords into high flights of figuration and
unexpected nuggets of luminous melody.
Barry expects his pianists to have steely fingers and lightning reflexes, as
well as an infallible ear for keyboard colour. Noriko Kawai's performances
had evidently been scrupulously prepared; her attention to detail and
voicing was exemplary. The second half of her programme was more
conventionally demanding. Three of Adrian Jack's own pieces - Tin-Pan Tango,
with its neat synthesis of dance rhythms and cheaply scented harmony, Foray
on the Liffey and the tricksy Beginner's Fingers - as well as two items from
Dave Smith's Third Piano Concert showed her ability for lively
characterisation and bravura display. In both Guaracha and Toccantella
Smith's writing has all the glamorous rhetoric of a Liszt paraphrase; it
needs exactly that kind of larger-than-life projection.
HK Gruber's Luftschlosser cast the only shadow over this attractively
planned programme. It is a sequence of four pieces composed in 1981,
continuing in the tradition of the German piano cycle, but proves to be no
latter-day Kreisleriana: the material is unmemorable, the keyboard writing
dogged. If it recalls any composer at all it would be Hindemith at his most
didactic and utilitarian; a strange miscalculation for a composer of such
regular wit and piquancy.
Institute of Contemporary Arts; final concert June 28.

FT  17 JUN 92 / FT Law Report: SFO can compel answers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
REGINA v DIRECTOR OF THE SERIOUS FRAUD OFFICE, EX PARTE SMITH
House of Lords (Lord Templeman, Lord Bridge of Harwich, Lord Ackner, Lord
Lowry, and Lord Mustill):
June 11 1992
THE SFO can compel a person who has been charged with fraud to answer
questions and provide information for the purpose of a fraud investigation,
and is not required to caution him.
The House of Lords so held when allowing an appeal by the Director of the
Serious Fraud Office from a decision of the Divisional court of the Queen's
Bench Division that the respondent, Mr AP Smith was not obliged to answer
questions in a fraud investigation and must be cautioned first.
LORD MUSTILL said Mr Smith was the chairman and managing director of Wallace
Smith Trust Co Ltd.
On April 30 1991, he was charged with being party to carrying on the
company's business with intent to defraud creditors. On May 7, he was
admitted to bail.
In June, he was served with formal notice by the SFO that he was required to
answer questions or furnish information in matters relevant to a fraud
investigation.
The notice stated: 'Failure without reasonable excuse to comply with these
requirements is a criminal offence.'
The interview was to take place on June 26.
Mr Smith sought certiorari to quash the decision to seek to enforce
compliance.
Pursuant to section 67 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, the
Secretary of State had issued a Code of Practice for the Detention,
Treatment and Questioning of Persons by Police Officers.
By paragraph 10 of the Code, a person suspected of an offence must be
cautioned before questions were put to him: 'You do not have to say anything
unless you wish to do so, but what you say may be given in evidence.'
By paragraph 16.5, questions might not be put to a person after he had been
charged unless necessary to minimise harm to others or clear up ambiguity,
or in the interests of justice. Before they were put he must be cautioned.
By section 2(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 1987, the SFO had power to
'require' a person whose affairs were to be investigated to answer questions
or furnish information.
By section 2(8), his statement might only be used in evidence against him on
a prosecution (a) for making a false or misleading statement, or (b) for
some other offence in which he gave evidence inconsistent with the
statement.
The expression 'right to silence' did not denote a single right, but
referred to a disparate group of immunities which differed in nature,
origin, incidence and importance, and as to the extent to which they had
been encroached by statute. Distinct motives had caused those immunities to
become embedded in the law.
The first motive reflected the common view that one person should so far as
possible be entitled to tell another to mind his own business. Secondly,
there was a long history of reaction against abuse of judicial
interrogation.
Next, there was the instinct that it was contrary to fair play to put the
accused in a position in which he was exposed to punishment whatever he did
 -if he answered he might condemn himself, and if he refused he might be
punished.
Finally there was the desire to minimise the risk that an accused would be
convicted on the strength of an untrue extra-judicial confession, to which
the law gave effect by refusing to admit confessions in evidence except on
proof that they were 'voluntary'.
The Divisional Court declared that before asking questions relating to an
offence with which a person under investigation was charged, the SFO must
inform him that he was not obliged to answer, but that if he did, what was
said might only be used in evidence against him where he was charged with
making a false or misleading statement, or where the answer was inconsistent
with any evidence he might give at a later trial.
On the present appeal, counsel for Mr Smith had not pressed either of the
grounds on which the Divisional Court decided in his favour - namely that
the SFO was entitled to ask questions after charge but only after
administering a fresh caution (see ex parte Saunders (1988) 138 NLJ 143);
and that the caution would be a reasonable excuse for refusal to answer
within section 2(13) of the 1987 Act.
Counsel was right to take that course.
Either the Director was empowered to pose questions and compel an answer, or
she was not. If she was, a caution which presupposed an answer could not be
compelled would be a self-contradictory formality which Parliament could not
have intended. If she had no powers of compulsion after charge, the issuing
of another caution made no difference.
For Mr Smith it was submitted first, that on the true interpretation of the
statute, the investigation and hence the Director's compulsory powers, came
to an end when Mr Smith was charged (see A v HM Treasury (1979) 1 WLR 1056).
The Director's powers under section 2(2) and (3) were to require the person
to answer questions and furnish information or to produce documents, with
respect to 'any matter relevant to the investigation'.
Nobody could expect the police simply to cease work on the case and rely at
trial only on the material revealed up to the moment of charging.
The Director's powers of investigation were concerned with 'the affairs' of
the suspect, and those must extend beyond the matters which caused the
charge to be laid.
The second submission was that whatever the words of the Act might mean,
they must be understood as qualified by a tacit exception, preserving the
ancient right of silence.
There was a strong presumption against interpreting a statute as taking away
the right of silence, but statutory interference with the right was almost
as old as the right itself.
If Mr Smith was to succeed he must show a qualification to be implied into
section 2(2), that nothing in the Act should require the person under
investigation to furnish information with respect to any suspected offence
for which he had been charged, except to the extent permitted by the Code.
That large implication was said to be justified because Parliament must have
intended to preserve the long-standing immunity against questioning after
charge.
The argument was unconvincing.
First, the notion that the moment of charging marked a watershed in the
relationship between suspect and police was not strictly accurate since the
duty to abstain from questioning ceased as soon as the officer considered
there was sufficient evidence for a prosecution to succeed, and there might
then be an interval before the decision to charge.
Secondly, this particular im-munity was much less ancient than other rights
of silence. It appeared to reflect a practice developed in the latter part
of the 19th century, to abstain from questioning not after charge, but after
the suspect had been taken into custody.
Paragraph 16.5 of the Code was not directly linked to the ancient and
deep-rooted privilege against self-incrimination.
That privilege aimed to protect all citizens against being compelled to
condemn themselves. It was in essence a development of the law relating to
the admissibility of confessions.
Once that was recognised the reasoning in Mr Smith's argument fell away.
There was no reason to force on to section 2 an unspoken qualification with
which it had nothing to do.
As a matter of interpretation the Director's powers did not cease with
regard to the questioning of a person under investigation when he was
charged. The general provisions of the Code yielded to the particular
provision of the 1987 Act in cases to which the Act applied. Neither history
nor logic demanded that any qualification of what Parliament had clearly
enacted ought to be implied.
The appeal was allowed.
Their Lordships agreed.
For Mr Smith: Andrew Collins QC and David Hood (Garstangs).
For the SFO: Sidney Kentridge QC and Nigel Pleming QC (Treasury Solicitor).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The appointment merry-go-round at Laporte, the UK's second largest chemical
group, continues, following the departure of two directors from Solvay, the
Belgian chemicals group. The two companies recently dissolved their Interox
joint venture.
Laporte's board meets today to confirm the appointment of Errol Menke (left)
to the main board. The 38-year-old American will leave the US where he was
chief executive of the hygiene and process chemicals division and take
charge of the construction chemicals division. Menke, who joined the company
in 1982, will be based in Luton and report to David Wilbraham, the chief
operating officer.
At the same time, the board will also confirm the appointment of Ray
Knowland, president of the UK-based Chemicals Industry Association, as a
non-executive.
The appointments also follow the resignation from Laporte's board last month
of Hans Seidl, who is to become chairman of Laporte GmbH in Germany, and
chief executive of the organic chemicals division. Christopher Beasley was
appointed last month as company secretary to replace Andrew Berkeley who is
taking up private practice.
*****
Meanwhile at ICI, Paul Drechsler (right) has been appointed to the new post
of regional vice-president of Imperial Chemical Industries' international
operations in Latin America South. He also becomes president of ICI Brasil.
Drechsler was previously a senior business manager at ICI's films business.
Adrian Bromley, Drechsler's predecessor, returns to the UK as business
general manager of the chemical products operations.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Business and the Environment: Complacency breeds contempt -
The Environmental Protection Agency's inability to solve the US's pollution
problems is losing it the respect of everyone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since the day he took office as administrator of the Environmental
Protection Agency in 1989, William Reilly has been caught in the crossfire
between competing enthusiasts.
On one side are the environmentalists who see the EPA as inexcusably slow at
implementing hard-won laws to protect the nation's land, water, and air. On
the other is much of the business lobby and the anti-regulatory zealots in
the White House, ardently battling a nightmare of costly paperwork and
pollution control requirements.
International attention focused on the clash between the adversaries at the
Rio Earth Summit, where Reilly sought to save face for Bush, who is finding
his claim to be 'the environmental president' increasingly ridiculed. A
White House leak of a Reilly memo on discussions over a biodiversity treaty
killed all chances of compromise.
It was in character for Reilly to attempt a settlement in Rio where the
overwhelming sentiment was on the side of the environmentalists. In his
years as president of the Conservation Foundation and the World Wildlife
Fund, two leading conservation groups, he built a reputation as a
conciliator, and he brought to the EPA his bias towards negotiation rather
than confrontation.
It is in character for Bush to try to appeal to both sides of the debate,
wrapping himself in the flags of environmentalism and anti-regulatory
activism at the same time. In the controversy over preserving the Northern
Spotted Owl at the expense of logging jobs, he explained his position in
typical fashion: 'We want to save the little furry feathery guy and all of
that, but I don't want to see 40,000 loggers thrown out of work.'
Reilly's moderation has disappointed many environmentalists who had hoped
for a champion rather than a middleman at the EPA. They believe it is his
job to represent environmental causes in the administration's inner councils
where business interests are supported by the Energy and Commerce
Departments and Vice President Dan Quayle's Council on Competitiveness.
With 17,000 employees - about 15 per cent of whom are political appointees -
the EPA has a 22-year track record. Created by Richard Nixon in 1970 when
environmentalism was in its infancy as a political force, the agency was a
composite of federal regulatory groups welded together to attack the
degradation of the nation's resources.
Since then Congress has passed a series of far-reaching laws to protect air
and water quality, to control pesticides and toxic substances, and to clean
up wastes. However, the regulatory process which has developed to implement
the laws is appallingly complicated.
Usually on the orders of Congress - which has taken to mandating deadlines
to speed the rulemaking process along - the EPA proposes a regulation, takes
public and other agency comments, holds public hearings and proclaims a
final regulation. The rules are challengeable in court, and in the litigious
society of the US today, three-quarters of the regulations get challenged.
At the very least, the court action adds about 18 months to the process, so
that it takes the agency at least two years to create a regulation.
Jim Bovard, a former analyst for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a
conservative think tank, says the EPA creates rules which give the agency
more power over industry and the US economy than is justified. Legislation
requires thousands of pages of regulations and stacks of paperwork; an
Eastman-Kodak application for a permit to handle hazardous waste was seven
feet tall.
With the need to appear to be doing something about the economy, the White
House deregulators increasingly have been getting the upper hand in disputes
with the EPA. Last month, Bush ruled in favour of the Council on
Competitiveness to allow companies which buy 'emissions allowances' to
increase their toxic air pollution by up to 80,000 pounds a year without
notifying the public.
Rick Hind, legislative director for Greenpeace's toxics campaign, expresses
his frustration with an administration which still claims to be
environmentally conscious. 'Bush will crow about the Clean Air Act, but he
can't make up his mind. He wants to be the environmental president but he
doesn't want to protect the environment.'
Senator Max Baucus, one of the forces behind the Clean Air Act, in March
released a stinging indictment of the administration. Critical regulations
had been languishing for months at the White House along with overdue
regulations controlling 189 toxic chemicals.
'Rules that implement the pollution control requirements in the Act are
being stalled, weakened and quashed while rules that provide exemptions,
waivers or bail-outs move quickly,' the senator said.
Even the attempts Reilly makes to push the administration on environment get
little appreciation. 'Reilly was brought in to put a pretty face on the
agency, but lately the EPA has been getting even worse than during the
Reagan years,' Hind says.
Somewhere in a corner of EPA is William Sanjour, a 'whistle blower' who has
served the agency for 20 years and has been isolated by his superiors for
calling attention to the agency's failings. The administrator, he says, is
invariably a 'team player' who 'can make all the speeches he wants about
cutting down Brazilian forests and environmental ethics, but he must not do
anything to make waves.'
Sanjour says employees who like to see 'concrete results' do not last long
at EPA. 'When it comes to drafting and implementing rules for environmental
protection, getting results means making enemies of powerful and influential
people,' he said. 'No, they don't usually get fired, but they don't get
advanced either, and their responsibilities are transferred to other people
and they usually leave the agency in disgust.
'The kind of people who get ahead are those clever ones who can be terribly
busy while they procrastinate, obfuscate and can consistently come up with
sufficiently plausible reasons for not accomplishing anything.'
Sanjour talks about one deadline for action after another missed with little
notice. Enforcement cases against influential polluters are started, not by
the EPA, but by a combination of environmental organisations, the media or
local citizens, he said. It often takes years of badgering before the agency
will act. When fines are ultimately imposed, they are less than the polluter
earned by breaking the law.
Another agency critic, Jerry Taylor, director of natural resource studies at
the libertarian Cato Institute, insists that the EPA 'wildly misspends its
resources' and is entirely driven by politics. 'It pursues issues that get
them on page one,' he said. 'If there is a public outcry about something, it
jumps and solves the problem whether the science is good or not.'
The agency's own independent science advisory board issued a report saying
that its most pressing concerns are given the least amount of attention
while the most unimportant are given the most, Taylor said.
The EPA itself admits to a 'mixed' record of accomplishments, but its
critics say the most noteworthy gains have come on the heels of court
rulings which required it to act. Although the car and human populations
have grown, the air has become cleaner. Substantial progress has been made
in phasing out sulphur dioxide emissions, but emissions of nitrogen oxides
have grown. Hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions have dropped by 28 per
cent and 38 per cent respectively, but 110 urban areas failed to meet the
national ozone standards set for 1989.
While many waterways have been cleaned through wastewater treatment and
controls on industrial plants, toxic chemicals are a continuing problem.
Fish have returned to some lakes and rivers, but they are disappearing from
others. Population pressures are increasing the sources of pollution and at
the same time leading to increased demand for clean water.
Polluters are now considered not only harmful and irresponsible but
criminal, and enforcement has improved. The EPA is now focusing on
prevention of pollution; efforts are being made to redesign manufacturing
processes, substitute harmful materials for less dangerous ones and recycle
wastes.
'Most people in the environmental community would say the EPA is not strong
enough,' says Blake Early, director of the pollution and toxics programme at
the Sierra Club. 'But relative to other environmental agencies around the
world, the EPA is probably doing a reasonable job.'

Leading US companies are paying greater attention to environmental matters
through executive-level appointments, according to a survey by Arthur D
Little, the international consultants.
Almost half of the top industrial corporations in the US have
vice-presidents in charge of environmental affairs, the survey shows, with
sectors like electronics and forestry - until recently perceived as low risk
in terms of the environment - seeing the greatest increase.
Arthur D Little looked at the top 100 companies in the Fortune 500 index and
found that 49 had environmental vice-presidents in 1991, up from 38 the
previous year. Of the top 50 corporations, 31 had executives directly
responsible for environmental affairs compared with 25 in 1990.
The US forest products industry, facing increasing public pressure
concerning issues like deforestation and recycling, saw the greatest
increase; all but one of the seven leading forestry products companies in
the top 100 had such executives last year compared with only half of such
companies in 1990.
Stephen Poltorzycki, director of Arthur D Little's environmental health and
safety practice, said that public and government scrutiny of industry was
expanding from the oil and chemical sectors. 'Only recently have
controversies over deforestation, paper recycling and dioxins used in the
paper-making process elevated environmental affairs in the minds of some
companies in the forest products sector.'
The electronics sector had been similarly affected by scrutiny of its use of
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). 'Despite the fact that major CFC-manufacturing
companies have made strides in developing CFC substitutes for the
electronics industry, public pressure has caused companies to take very
visible steps in their efforts to be environmentally responsible.'
Chemical and oil companies in the US have been well represented by
environmental affairs executives for the past few years, with six of the
eight chemical companies in the top 100 having vice-presidents in charge of
environmental affairs.

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Do good personnel policies contribute to corporate profitability? Can human
resource management specialists add value in the same way that their
colleagues in production, sales or finance do?
This is the Holy Grail of personnel management and researchers from
Lancaster University and the University of Wales claim to have found it.
Looking at the performance of 60 UK manufacturing companies (mainly in
engineering and electronics) over 10 years, the researchers found that those
with more sophisticated human resource management systems had better return
on capital.
'Before this research, many companies were believed to benefit from good
human resource policies but it was difficult to assess the impact,' said
Steve Fox of Lancaster University Management School.
Now, for the first time, claims Fox, an 'association' between policy and
profit has been established.
The researchers took five personnel functions - recruitment and selection,
management education, performance appraisal, reward and remuneration and
company career planning - and looked at four measures of how they were
practiced.
The four measures were: how systematically were they conducted; how well
integrated with each other; how well integrated with corporate strategy and
how meritocratically applied.
They found that financially successful companies fared above average on all
four measures. A particularly strong relationship was found between
financial success and the integration of personnel policies with corporate
strategy.
Is this really a first? Fox says there have been many individual company
case studies but no studies that look so systematically at so many
companies.
More fundamentally, is the whole project based on a tautology? Well-run
companies are generally more successful than badly-run companies and
well-run companies are likely to have well-run human resource management
policies too.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Jobs: Why big companies are short of new ideas - The double
set of mufflers that stop senior executives' eardrums from hearing any
surprises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHO precisely first coined the phrase, no one the Jobs column has ever met
could identify. But whoever it was deserves an honoured place in
dictionaries of quotations.
For, of all the multitudinous maxims uttered these past 2,500 years on how
to survive in an organisational setting, none is more cogent than the phrase
in question. It states: Never surprise a vice-president]
While transatlantic in idiom - it was apparently coined by somebody in
American Telephone and Telegraph - the phrase clearly has universal force.
Moreover, the inadvisability of springing surprises applies not only to
bosses as high as vice-president or the equivalent, but to many if not most
ranked lower down.
So in an attempt to convey the wider scope of the message I've reformulated
it in more general terms as one of the Laws of Organisational Stupidity,
calling it after Professor Iain Mangham of Bath University's management
school who introduced me to the original in the 1970s. In the wider version,
which goes under the name Mangham's Muffler, it says: When communicating to
superiors, new news is bad news.
Since first hearing of the rule, I've seen it borne out too often for its
workings to be any longer a surprise to me. The explanation seems to be that
aspiring bosses have a psychological need not only to possess the power to
tell others what to do, but to feel they hold it by natural right. Hence
they tend to believe deep down that they are endowed with such superior
faculties that they are sure to learn of anything worth knowing before it
could ever occur to anyone of lesser status.
What has surprised me even after all these years, however, is the strength
with which the topmost rankers defend themselves against the possibility of
being forced to recognise otherwise.
That revelation comes as a result of my discussion two weeks ago of the
problem senior executives' secretaries pose for the growing numbers of
displaced managers who now have little chance of re-employment unless they
can win the ear of someone empowered to hire them. In the hope of helping to
put unused skills back to work, I passed on a couple of hints from a
consultant in New York on how to bypass the secretarial gatekeepers. One
such hint was to dodge round their blocking question - What's it about,
please? - by misplacing the word 'not' in your answer.
To illustrate: if you're out of work after a time in Germany and aim to
persuade some chief who's a total stranger to hire you as a representative
there, the reply to the gatekeeper might be: 'We've met before but not for
some time. I've been working in Germany, and there's a business opportunity
I know he would be interested in.' Then, on getting through to the chief and
being asked how you know each other, you say: 'Sorry? I didn't say we did.
What I said was we've not met before. But for some time I've been working in
Germany . . .'
Readers' responses, often vehement as well as extensive, have come from
several angles. For example, half a dozen outplacement consultants and four
of the executive-selection variety have accused me of advocating the
seriously dishonest practice of approaching employers with bogus
propositions. That's a bit steep. The article a fortnight ago expressly
stated: '. . . it is of course imperative to have done your homework on the
target company and executive, and the idea you're proposing, as well as
ensuring that every checkable fact you voice is true.'
In other words, any proposals made must be genuine. Even so, given the
numbers unemployed and the barriers in the way of their recovery, I see no
cardinal sin in practising mild deception to get honest proposals a serious
hearing. Nor am I alone in doing so. In the circumstances, even the stern
philosopher Hobbes would have forgiven it.
On reflection, however, I agree that the reproving out-placers are right to
say that 'networking' is a more promising as well as less deceitful method.
It is defined by one of them as: 'making new contacts via referrals from
existing contacts and genuinely asking for advice and NOT for a job. The aim
of a network meeting is referral to more contacts. Keeping the network
'alive' over a period of weeks results in a whole series of people you do
not now know positively thinking of you when they might hear of a job.'
Nevertheless my conversion to networking is not because of its philosophical
merits, but strictly on practical grounds. The reason lies in the dozen
responses from readers who actually work in the aforesaid gatekeeping
capacity. For their letters have persuaded me that such dodges as I passed
on just wouldn't wash with the consummate professionals who work as senior
secretaries.
Hence my belated realisation that the stopping power of senior managers'
mufflers is greater than I had previously supposed. They are equipped with
not one, but two of them: the classical Mangham sort worn by the chiefs
themselves, and an outlying filter represented by their secretaries. As one
of same typically remarks:
'I can say with hand on heart that no-one will get through to my boss on the
telephone if they will not explain to me exactly why they wish to speak to
him - and, only then, provided he tells me he wishes to take the call.'
The only hope of penetrating to the chief, several of the gatekeepers say,
is essentially akin to networking. In the words of the same correspondent,
it is 'waking up to the fact that few top executives will take calls unless
they are very thoroughly screened and perceived to be mutually constructive,
and en-listing the secretary's help and advice as to how to get their
message across or who would be the right person to speak to about their
idea/application. At this level, the secretary would certainly be one of the
best people to have on your side when chasing those elusive job openings.'
To which I can only nod in agreement. But that is not to say the better
pay-off of networking augurs well for the economic future. For it is a
method that clearly best serves folk good at favourably impressing
influential others - which need not be, and often isn't, the same as having
something productive to offer a company. Indeed networking was summed up in
a maxim long before 'Never surprise a vice-president': to wit, It's not what
you know, but who you know.'
Still, that being the case, it may help to explain why so many big companies
at least, have so few good new ideas.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: GMB poll cheer for Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNIONS have re-established their credibility as representatives of
Labour voters, according to the GMB general workers' union after analysis of
polling around the April general election.
Figures supplied to the union by the Mori polling organisation showed that
Labour took a 15 per cent lead over the Tories among trade unionists in a
25,000 sample. Labour's share was 46 per cent against 31 per cent for the
Tories.
The statistics will be used by trade unions to rebut accusations that they
did not deliver Labour votes from among their members, and to defend links
with the party.
According to Mori, Labour's vote among trade unionists increased on 1987 by
4 per cent. The Liberal Democrats lost a similar percentage and the Tories
picked up 1 per cent.
It was the best result for Labour among trade unionists since 1979,
according to the analysis. However, a 'terrifying gender gap' was detected
among voters aged 18-24. Young male union members swung to Labour by 6.5 per
cent between 1987 and 1992 but support from young women members fell 14 per
cent.
Among all trade unionists there was a strong swing to Labour of 2.5 per cent
in the last three days of the election campaign, when other voters were
moving against Labour.
In the GMB's ballot for the Labour leadership, Mr John Smith - who is
sponsored by the union - polled 110,177 against Mr Bryan Gould's 30,267. For
the deputy leadership, Mrs Margaret Beckett polled 74,771 against Mr John
Prescott's 37,270 and Mr Gould's 28,158.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Link to influential Senator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROBERT MAXWELL used former Senator John Tower, the influential Republican,
to seek US government assistance in 1988 for an aborted attempt to acquire
15 insolvent Texas savings-and-loans institutions, according to a former US
bank regulatory official.
Tower, who died in an air crash last year, was a paid consultant to Maxwell
and served on the board of Macmillan, the publisher owned by Maxwell
Communication Corporation (MCC).
In August 1988 Senator Tower went to see Mr Danny Wall, then chairman of the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the now-defunct agency that previously
regulated the US savings-and-loan industry.
The former Texan Senator met Mr Wall to argue on behalf of a bid by Maxwell
for a group of 15 failing savings-and-loan institutions that were later
declared inolvent, sold as a single package and renamed the Bluebonnet
Savings Bank.
According to documents obtained by the Financial Times, the Maxwell proposal
asked the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation to grant Maxwell 50
per cent of an estimated Dollars 86.3m of expected tax benefits.
A Congressional investigator claimed at the weekend that 'Maxwell hired
Tower to try and grease the savings-and-loan deal' because of his political
influence. Mr Wall, who resigned in March 1990, said he saw 'nothing
nefarious' in Tower's approach.
After leaving the Senate in 1985, Tower had a series of business ties to
Maxwell, for whom he acted as a paid consultant.
In April 1989 Tower was named by Maxwell to the board of directors of
Macmillan. Maxwell also paid the former senator to serve as chairman of two
Macmillan subsidiaries - Pergamon Brassey International Defence
Publications, a publisher, and the Armed Forces Journal, a monthly magazine.
Mr David Shaffer, the Macmillan chairman who was asked by a New York
bankruptcy court to manage MCC's US assets after MCC filed last December for
protection from creditors under US bankruptcy law, said Tower reported to
him 'and was a very important conduit to the defence industry who brought in
a lot of advertising'.
Mr Shaffer, who declined to say how much Tower was paid by Macmillan, noted
that Tower 'never attended any Macmillan board meetings while he was on the
board'.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Government to support Delors'
reappointment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, IVO DAWNAY and PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT indicated yesterday that it will agree to the temporary
reappointment of Mr Jacques Delors as European Commission president in order
to boost the chances of a more acceptable candidate winning in two years'
time.
Mr John Major told MPs that 'no firm decision' had been taken by the UK.
Downing Street officials pointed out that there might be tactical advantages
in backing an extension of Mr Delors' term of office until 1995.
The prime minister wants to be in the best position to ensure a candidate
more attuned to his views - such as Mr Rudd Lubbers, the Dutch prime
minister, or Sir Leon Brittan, the UK commissioner - when the choice of
president is made again in two years' time. Presidents appointed to serve
from January 1995 will have five-year terms rather than the present two.
Such tactics may help appease Tory Euro-sceptics who have complained about
the reappointment of Mr Delors. Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the
Treasury, last night publicly backed the prime minister's line on pushing
forward with the Maastricht treaty. Mr Portillo's attendance at a meeting of
Euro-sceptics had fuelled rumours of a cabinet split.
It is unclear to what extent Mr Major will be able to win the support of
other EC leaders for a deal over the presidency at the Lisbon summit later
this month.
Mr Major again emphasised that one of Britain's priorities during its EC
presidency from July 1 would be to 'clarify speedily the practical
application of subsidiarity' - the principle by which decisions are taken by
the lowest appropriate level of government.
That may include an addendum to the Maastricht treaty.
Meanwhile, Labour's European strategy appeared to be shifting when Mr Neil
Kinnock reopened the option of his party's backing a British referendum. His
comments will encourage Tories who have been seeking a referendum.
In Lisbon yesterday, he said: 'It would be foolish to exclude the
possibility of a referendum at some stage on ratification and on Britain's
role in the Community, especially in the circumstances following the Danish
referendum.'

FT  17 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Clash over water pricing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AVERAGE household water payment has increased by more than 47 per cent -
or three times the rate of inflation - since water companies were
privatised, Labour claimed yesterday, urging the government to give greater
priority to consumers' interests.
Ms Ann Taylor, shadow environment spokesman, attacked the government for
treating water as a marketable commodity rather than a 'vital natural
resource'.
The actual price increases compared with government predictions that water
prices would rise by between 7.5 and 12.5 per cent by the end of the
century, she said, opening an Opposition debate on water since
privatisation.
The Labour motion expressed alarm at the 'record profits, record dividends
and record salaries and perks of top management in the water companies',
especially at a time when households were facing record bills.
Mr David Maclean, environment minister, ruled out intervention to curb the
increased charges, and accused Labour of 'not having the nous to realise
that there is no investment without profits'.
Privatisation had overcome the handicap of severe under investment over 20
to 30 years, he said, praising the privatised companies for their Pounds
28bn investment programme. 'Transferring the water industry to the private
sector has given the industry the freedom to invest and to manage its
investment programme in the most efficient and economical way.'
Conservative anxiety about the rising charges was none the less underlined
when Mr Patrick Nicholls, the MP for Teignbridge, said they were set to
increase by well in excess of 15 per cent in the south-west over the next
five years and 'for the foreseeable future'.
A 'unique remedy' involving central funding might well be required, he
suggested.

THE SCOTTISH Conservative party dismissed six staff at its central office on

Ms Alice Luce, who ran the Tory media campaign north of the border and had

The Scottish Conservative Party last night described the shake-up as part of

HEALTH SECRETARY Mrs Virginia Bottomley last night defended government
proposals to cut dentists' fees by 7 per cent and rejected privatisation
claims in the Commons. Mr Peter Hain, Labour MP for Neath, told her at
question time: 'By increasing charges to patients and cutting fees to

people cannot actually find an National Health dentist in their part of the
country.
'Instead of playing Mary Poppins, you have become the Cruella de Ville of
the National Health Service,' he protested.
Mrs Bottomley replied: 'The proposals that we've brought forward in fact
would result in a reduction in the charges to patients.'

<TEXT>
A BREAKTHROUGH in the eight-year dispute between the government and trade
unions over union membership restrictions at the Government Communications
Headquarters (GCHQ), was claimed yesterday by the Trades Union Congress.
The TUC said the government had responded to pressure from the International
Labour Organisation and was reopening talks with Civil Service unions.
The ILO has been critical of the government's ban on membership of national
trade unions at GCHQ.
The government has argued since 1984 that membership of a national trade
union is incompatible with security - GCHQ staff are permitted to belong
only to a staff association.
The Department of Employment denied yesterday that there had been any change
in the government's stance.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Church withholds Pounds 1m aid for cities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHURCH Commissioners have been forced by recessionary pressures to
withhold a Pounds 1m grant that was to have been made to the Church of
England's inner-cities charity, and to tell churchgoers they must contribute
more to clergy stipends.
The commissioners, who handle the church's main investments, saw investment
income grow by only 1 per cent to Pounds 167m last year. They expect little
further growth in the near future, while costs are predicted to rise
substantially, and speak in their annual report yesterday of a 'period of
sharp adjustment' ahead.
The charity, the Church Urban Fund, was set up in 1988 as a main
recommendation of Faith in the City, the church's influential report on
urban troubles. Its initial target was to raise Pounds 18m from churchgoers
in the dioceses and Pounds 5m from industry, with the commissioners
contributing a regular Pounds 1m a year.
Successful early fund-raising has made the fund one of Britain's 50 largest
charities. But the commissioners say they were unable to give their Pounds
1m grant last year 'in the light of the difficult economic outlook'.
The announcement of the decision comes a week after a lecture in which the
archbishop of Canterbury, Dr George Carey, spoke of the importance of
charities in a 'society suffering from shallow materialism and spiritual
bewilderment'. The commissioners still provide administrative support for
the fund.
Financial pressures, the commissioners say, mean they will have to fund a
smaller proportion of clergy stipends in future. Providing pensions for the
clergy and contributing to their pay consumes 85 per cent of the
commissioners' investment income.
Last year's Church of England pay bill was Pounds 145m, of which the
commissioners met 45 per cent. The commissioners say their support might
drop to about 30 per cent by 1995.
Since the recession is affecting the investments of individual dioceses as
much as the commissioners' funds, the report recognises that the only
solution will be for churchgoers to increase their giving. A typical church
member contributes about Pounds 3 a week.
The commissioners acknowledge that their property investments - a third of
total holdings last year - have been proportionately much larger than those
of most financial institutions. They say that served the church well in the
1980s, but that property investment has now been affected by stagnant or
falling rents.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Cumbria road benefits outlined
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Pounds 195m cost of upgrading the A590, A595 and A66 trunk roads in
Cumbria to dual-carriageway standard would be more than recouped by the
government, according to a consultants' report considered yesterday by
Cumbria county and district councillors.
The report says the expense would be more than offset by the benefits in
retaining employment and attracting inward investment.
An accelerated roads programme for remote West Cumbria and
Barrow-in-Furness, suffering from heavy job losses and poor communications,
might mean those areas together having 4,000 more jobs by the year 2000,
consultants Segal Quince Wicksteed estimate. Aggregate savings in state
benefits due to consequent reduced unemployment and increased tax revenue
would amount to about Pounds 180m by the year 2000 and between Pounds 215m
and nearly Pounds 300m over 30 years, they say.
Those projected savings are additional to the normal economic benefits of
road schemes. Mr David Cole, county highways and transportation director,
told yesterday's meeting those should themselves exceed the Pounds 195m
upgrading cost.
The report, commissioned by the county council, Furness Enterprise and West
Cumbria Development Agency, is the latest phase in a campaign to persuade
the government that Cumbria's transport infrastructure needs urgent
investment.
About 10,000 jobs are being shed from submarine builders VSEL in Barrow and
the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing site, and unemployment as high as 25 per
cent is predicted in the area.
The meeting agreed to send the report to all relevant government departments
and to press Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, for a meeting.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Computer fraud loophole blocked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LOOPHOLE in the law on computer fraud was closed by the Court of Appeal
yesterday.
Lord Taylor, the Lord Chief Justice, sitting with Mr Justice Macpherson and
Mr Justice Turner, overturned a judge's ruling last year that interfering
with a computer by operating the keyboard directly could not count as
computer fraud, because the Computer Misuse Act was directed at 'hacking' -
breaking into a computer network using another computer.
The act provides for jail terms of up to five years, unlimited fines or
both.
Lord Taylor said that if a person who gained direct access to computer data
could not be convicted it would lead to a 'surprising and unlikely' gap in
the act.
The case arose out of the acquittal of a man accused of computer fraud at
Snaresbrook Crown Court last year. Purchasing key cutting equipment from a
former employer, he awarded himself a 70 per cent discount by keying in the
necessary instructions on a sales assistant's computer while the assistant
was in the stockroom.
Although the appeal judges overturned the trial judge's ruling, the man's
acquittal stands.
The court had been asked by Sir Nicholas Lyell QC, the attorney general, to
give an opinion on the Crown Court's ruling because he believed it had
implications that could emasculate the act.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LIQUIDITY position of large British companies continued to improve in
the first quarter of this year, according to figures released yesterday by
the Central Statistical Office.
The CSO reported that the liquidity ratio for all large UK industrial and
commercial companies increased to an estimated 132 per cent by the end of
the first quarter of this year from 126 per cent at the end of last year,
indicating that companies are now more able to lay their hands on short-term
funds than before.
The ratio, which measures current assets maturing in less than a year as a
share of liabilities that have to be repaid in less than a year, was higher
at the end of December than at any time since the late 1970s except for
immediately after the October 1987 crash.
The liquidity ratio for large manufacturing companies rose to 123 per cent
at the end of March from 119 per cent at the end of last year, while that of
non-manufacturing companies, including oil companies, rose to 145 per cent
from 135 per cent.
The CSO bases its estimates in part on a survey of 650 large companies.

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP rebound in housing starts and a solid increase in industrial
production were yesterday seen as encouraging signs that the US economic
recovery will be sustained through the summer.
Industrial output rose 0.6 per cent in May, to register its fourth
consecutive monthly increase. Housing starts jumped 11 per cent, making good
much of an erratic 17 per cent decline in April.
'The recovery is on track and gaining momentum, but still remains about
half-speed relative to previous upturns,' said Mr David Littmann, senior
economist at Manufacturers National Corp, a Detroit bank. The main factor
driving the recovery was the Federal Reserve's 'very stimulative' monetary
policy.
Doubts about the recovery's momentum had been raised by reports in the past
10 days showing weaker-than-expected retail sales and employment last month.
The mixed pattern of statistics, however, is characteristic of a sluggish
economic recovery, in which different sectors advance at differing speeds.
Housing starts are running at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.23m,
roughly in line with the average rate for the first quarter. In the first
five months of this year, starts were 28 per cent higher than in the same
period last year.
The housing recovery was broadly based, affecting all types of residential
structures and all regions. Building permits, a guide to future trends,
dropped slightly last month.
The rise in industrial output last month was led by increased production of
cars, light trucks and other durable consumer goods. Production is now
running 2.2 per cent higher than in May last year.
Separate figures yesterday indicated that the US current account deficit
fell to Dollars 5.3bn (Pounds 2.9bn) in the first quarter, against Dollars
7.2bn in the final three months of last year. The improvement reflected
lower oil prices, higher receipts from tourism and increased earnings on
overseas assets.

MEXICO has reacted furiously to a US Supreme Court ruling that the
kidnapping of a Mexican murder suspect was legal, and suspended all US Drug
Enforcement Agency activity on its territory. It will also seek to
re-negotiate its extradition treaty with Washington, writes Damian Fraser in
Mexico City.
Mexico's Foreign Relations Ministry said the ruling was 'invalid and
unacceptable'. It 'transgresses essential principles of international law',
it added. The Mexican government called the kidnapping a criminal act.
The US Supreme Court ruled on Monday that Dr Humberto Alvarez Machain,
indicted for the torture and murder of a DEA agent in 1985, need not be
returned to Mexico as his kidnapping and spiriting away to the US did not
break any US law. The decision to repatriate Dr Alvarez was a question for
the executive branch, the court said. The ruling overturned an appeal court
decision that the abduction was illegal.
The Supreme Court decision puts the Bush administration in an awkward
position. While it supports the right to seize suspects abroad for trial in
the US, it has also called for increased international co-operation in the
war on drugs.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Yeltsin predicts agreement on nuclear arms cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin predicted yesterday that he and US President
George Bush would reach agreement on proposed radical reductions in
long-range nuclear arms during their two-day summit meeting in Washington.
'When the presidents take charge of something you can be sure it will be
handled in the most efficient way,' Mr Yeltsin told reporters before a
working lunch with Mr James Baker, secretary of state. 'That means we will
reach an agreement,' he said.
Mr Baker and Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, have been
working in recent days on final details of a fresh arms accord aimed at cuts
in long-range missiles, bombers and submarines which go far beyond
reductions required under the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (Start).
Mr Bush yesterday welcomed Mr Yeltsin to the White House for 'a new kind of
summit: not a meeting between two powers struggling for global supremacy but
between two partners striving to build a democratic peace'.
Mr Yeltsin made it clear that in asking for US economic support he did not
wish to be treated as a supplicant.
'We have not come to ask your country to solve our problems for us. We have
brought along ideas and proposals,' he said.
'We have things to offer to the American farmer, to the American
industrialist and to the American banker.'
White House officials hope Mr Yeltsin's visit will give a boost to their
efforts to win congressional backing for a Russian aid bill, and Mr Bush
used his official welcoming speech to urge Congress to act on the bill.
Democratic leaders in Congress say, however, that the principal obstacle to
bringing the bill forward has been insufficient support from members of the
president's own Republican party.
But the issues set to dominate the agenda for the meeting between the two
leaders - nuclear disarmament, US aid to help smooth Russia's economic
transformation, trade and investment co-operation, - were initially
overshadowed yesterday by the possibility that some US prisoners of war
might still be alive in Russia.
Mr Yeltsin raised the possibility during his flight to Washington on Monday.
He struck a chord in the US, which remains committed to bringing the
physical remains of its war dead home. Opinion polls show an overwhelming
majority of the public believes that US servicemen listed as missing in
action during the Vietnam war are still held captive.
Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov, spokesman for Mr Yeltsin, said newly opened KGB
files showed a total of 2,800 Americans had been held in the Soviet Union
after the two world wars and the Korean and Vietnam conflicts.
'Many were interned, many were held in prisons. . . it is not excluded that
some might be still living,' he said.
Mr Yeltsin's motive in reopening the prisoner of war issue may be in part to
move beyond the political and economic issues on the summit agenda, and to
use his visit to kindle popular enthusiasm in the US for his reform
programme - and, in the process, for US financial aid.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Public's distrust of militarism is rekindled: Likely
consequences of the hard-fought passage of the UN peacekeeping bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TORTUOUS passage of the United Nations peacekeeping bill through the
Japanese Diet, finally accomplished on Monday, is a measure of the
difficulties the country faces in defining for itself a role in the world.
Opposition parties won little credit for reducing the Diet to a farce in
their efforts to block the legislation. They were roundly criticised by
Japanese newspapers for undermining the principles of parliamentary
democracy by abusing Diet procedures.
Yet the opposition antics reflect the serious concerns many Japanese have
about the bill which would permit the government to send Japanese troops on
United Nations peacekeeping missions.
If the issue had been put to a referendum, the government would almost
certainly have lost. Opinion polls indicated that more than half the
population are opposed to any bill which would allow the armed forces to
serve overseas.
A senior cabinet official acknowledged the extent of this hostility at a
recent press conference when he told journalists: 'I hope you are more
impartial (in judging the bill) than the Japanese people.'
To outsiders it might seem bizarre that Japanese are so sensitive about the
bill. After all, the legislation looks so innocuous - it authorises the
government to despatch up to 2,000 people on UN missions, but only if they
serve in non-combatant support roles, carry nothing more than small arms and
withdraw at the first sign of trouble.
However, many Japanese have invested the legislation with much wider
meanings. They see in it an attempt to revise the country's pacifist
constitution and a way of reviving the power of the military in Japan.
They also dislike the fact that the bill has been foisted upon them by an
internationalist elite - led by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs - seeking to
increase Japan's role in global affairs.
Peace Net News, a magazine run by opponents of the bill, has argued that the
passing of the legislation could lead to a revision of the constitution and
even 'to moves to introduce a system similar to compulsory military
service'.
The bill's supporters argue that such views have no basis in fact. They
point to the fact that almost the whole international community has welcomed
the bill. Even Japan's Asian neighbours, which would be the first to feel
threatened by a revival of Japanese militarism, have been very reserved in
expressing doubts about the legislation.
The conservatively inclined Yomiuri newspaper said in an editorial yesterday
that people would be reassured when they saw the peacekeeping bill in
operation. Japanese would realise that isolationism in the modern world was
tantamount to egoism. 'To maintain order in international society, we have
to think of the need of sharing risks.' But the arguments do not sway the
bill's opponents. They are haunted by Japan's inability to fully come to
terms with its aggression during the second world war. 'The difficulties
(over the bill) stem from the war,' says Professor Akihiko Tanaka, an expert
in politics at Tokyo University. 'People do not trust the military.'
Unlike Germany, Japan has never made a full and frank admission of its
responsibility for invading Korea and China or for starting the Pacific War.
While the late Emperor Hirohito and his son Emperor Akihito have apologised
for various acts of aggression, as have government ministers, their words
have often been undermined by subsequent backtracking by other political
figures.
Japanese people have been kept in ignorance of basic information which are
not included in school textbooks - such as the fact that the allies
considered - and later rejected - trying Emperor Hirohito for war crimes.
Instead, the belief grew that responsibility for the war rested entirely
with a smallish group of military officers, who were eliminated during the
post-war occupation.
In these circumstances, it is understandable that many people are hostile to
any talk of expanding the military's role today - even in UN peacekeeping
operations.
But the fact that such hostility is understandable greatly complicates
Japan's political future. If the the country's leaders cannot convince
people of the merits of serving under the UN flag, there is little prospect
that they can even begin to consider more sensitive issues - such as the
possibility of a regional role for Japan's defence forces.
Such a possibility is admittedly very remote as long as the US remains
committed to policing the western Pacific. Neither in the US nor in Japan is
there much serious talk about revising the bilateral security pact which
binds the two countries together and keeps American troops in bases in
Japan.
But it is not difficult to imagine incidents in which US and Japanese
interests might differ. Would the US necessarily protect Japan's sea lanes
if they were blockaded somewhere in south-east Asian waters? If civil war in
an Asian country forced Japan to evacuate its nationals, would American
troops protect such a rescue mission?
These are small examples. On a bigger scale, both the US and Japan have
protested to North Korea about its nuclear development programme. If
Pyongyang did acquire such weapons, it would be quite reasonable to expect
at least some government officials in Tokyo to consider whether Japan might
respond by developing nuclear arms of its own.
Such incidents, and possible Japanese responses, could generate profound
ructions in Japan. It is worth remembering that the event which most
disturbed Japan's political stability since the war was the signing of the
US-Japan security pact in 1960. The demonstrations in Tokyo were so serious
that President Eisenhower cancelled a planned visit to Japan for fear for
his safety.
Acutely aware of popular resentment of the peacekeeping bill, the government
yesterday announced a publicity campaign to explain its purposes. Ministers
will have their work cut out.
Japan will send a delegation to Cambodia to study the military situation
there following the passage of the peacekeeping law, Reuter reports from
Tokyo. Mr Masamichi Hanabusa, a foreign ministry spokesman, said no date had
been set for the mission. Tokyo news reports said the team would leave
within the next month to lay the groundwork for sending Japanese defence
force personnel in September to join UN peacekeeping efforts.

<TEXT>
A SERIOUS shortage of electric power in the Philippines is expected to
reduce economic growth this year, according to businessmen and economists.
Mr Jose Pardo, president of the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry
(PCCI), told the Financial Times that growth this year, earlier estimated at
about 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent, could now be 'at the most 2 per cent'
because of the power shortage. 'The 3 per cent growth is definitely out,' Mr
Pardo said.
The policy-making National Economic and Development Authority last week also
cut the top range of its growth target this year from 3 per cent to 2.5 per
cent, because of power disruptions.
The state-owned National Power Corporation (Napocor) has over the past four
months been unable to meet demand for electricity in the main island of
Luzon, including metropolitan Manila. Since October last year, Napocor has
had to ration electricity to users in Mindanao island.
Napocor's plants are mostly old and prone to break down when operating at
peak periods. Most of its hydrothermal plants, furthermore, are out of
commission because of widespread drought.
Intermittent power cuts lasted for 10 to 12 hours at their worst levels last
month. This led to disruptions throughout industry with many factories in
metropolitan Manila asking workers to report in the evenings when industrial
areas get their electricity 'rations'.

NEW ZEALAND is facing a growing electricity crisis as South Island lakes
which normally supply 60 per cent of the country's power dry up.
Many industrial plants are being forced to cut production, and New
Zealanders have been warned they may soon have to work a four-day week to
conserve dwindling power.
One of the biggest users, Comalco, owner of the big Bluff aluminium plant,
has already cut electricity consumption drastically, and is likely to get
compensation from the government. Comalco is considering the expensive
option of closing a third of its capacity.
Electricorp, the national power utility, has been forced to bring two
thermal stations, one coal and the other oil-fired, back into production. At
one such station the state-owned corporation had to rehire workers whom it
had made redundant less than three weeks before.
Domestic customers are already having their power cut for several hours a
day, with the electricity system stretched to the limit as North Island gas,
hydroelectricity, and geothermal generating stations are run at full
capacity to try to replace the South Island's shortfall.
Mr Jim Bolger, the prime minister, has castigated Electricorp for not
preparing the public for the crisis, which he says is doing immense damage
by cutting industrial output as the economy is struggling to emerge from
recession. At present legislation charges state-owned corporations with
maximising revenues.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Japan likely to cut economic growth forecast: Last year's
growth rate of 3.5 per cent would be welcomed by most other industrialised
countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese government's Economic Planning Agency yesterday indicated it
might be forced to cut its 3.5 per cent economic growth target for the year
to next March, in view of the continued sluggishness of the economy.
The agency's admission, which accompanied the release of economic data for
the first quarter of 1992, could pave the way for increasingly urgent
discussions among policymakers about possible government measures to revive
the flagging economy.
A senior EPA official said: 'Until now we have said we can achieve 3.5 per
cent. Now we are saying 'It may be hard to achieve 3.5 per cent, though not
impossible.' It is too early to tell.'
Agency officials said the issue of possible government action was 'very
delicate.'
The EPA, Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Japan insist it is still too
early to consider boosting the economy through further interest rate cut and
increased public works spending. But they are under pressure to act from
politicians and from the US, which fears a sluggish Japanese economy could
constrain growth elsewhere in the industrialised world.
The report the agency published yesterday showed the economy grew in terms
of real GNP by 1.1 per cent in the first quarter compared with the previous
quarter - an annualised growth rate of 4.3 per cent.
However, the EPA estimated that 0.4 percentage points of the growth in the
quarter were accounted for by the fact that the leap year had added an extra
day of economic activity.
The figures are consistent with a slow braking of growth, with sluggishness
spreading throughout the economy.
Compared with the same period in 1991, the economy grew by 2.3 per cent  -
the lowest rate since 1986 and the fourth quarterly decline in succession.
Capital investment, the engine of growth in the late 1980s, fell 0.9 per
cent compared with the same quarter in 1991, the first year-on-year decline
since 1983.
For the fiscal year to the end of March the economy grew 3.5 per cent,
little short of the 3.7 per cent government target and a rate that would be
welcomed by officials and businessmen in most other industrialised
countries.
Nevertheless, Mr Takeshi Noda, the EPA's director general, said that in view
of the leap year the figures for the January-March quarter looked better
than they actually were.

THE newly-appointed Thai government yesterday urged the Khmer Rouge, the
left-wing Cambodian guerrilla group, to co-operate with a United Nations
peace plan for Cambodia, following reports of renewed fighting this week in
the north of the country.
Mr Arsa Sarasin, Thai foreign minister, met Mr Khieu Samphan, the nominal
Khmer Rouge leader, in Bangkok and said he asked him to soften his stand for
the sake of Cambodia. 'I told him, 'don't miss the boat',' said Mr Arsa.
Western governments and the UN have asked Thailand and China, the main
supporters of the Khmer Rouge, to press the organisation to adhere to the
peace plan following its refusal to co-operate with the second phase, which
provides for the cantonment and disarming of the four factions, starting
last Saturday.
Qian Qichen, the Chinese foreign minister, said during a visit to New
Zealand yesterday that it was too early to write off the Cambodian peace
process because the issue was 'very complicated'.
Cambodian government forces are reported to have launched a
counter-offensive against Khmer Rouge guerrillas in the central province of
Kompong Thom on Monday. Mr Yasushi Akashi, head of UN operations in
Cambodia, blamed the Khmer Rouge and said government troops had the right to
defend themselves.
The fighting will obstruct Mr Akashi's efforts to raise some Dollars 600m
(Pounds 324m) for Cambodia's rehabilitation at an aid conference in Japan.
Before leaving Cambodia for the Tokyo meeting, Mr Akashi described the
ceasefire violations as 'pretty serious' and said the Khmer Rouge appeared
to have returned to the offensive in northern Cambodia.
Yesterday Mr Khieu Samphan reiterated the Khmer Rouge view that it was
impossible to co-operate fully with the UN until it confirmed there were no
Vietnamese troops left in Cambodia and until it gave more power to the
Supreme National Council at the expense of the Vietnamese-installed
caretaker government.

<TEXT>
MR Fidel Ramos, who helped topple a dictator and defeat six coup attempts,
has won the Philippine presidential election after a convoluted vote count,
Reuter reports from Manila.
The Philippine Congress still has to proclaim the winner of the May 11
elections, but the official tally of election returns showed the
64-year-old, West Point-trained general winning with 5.34m votes. In second
place was Mrs Miriam Defensor Santiago, a fiery anti-corruption crusader,
with 4.47m votes; businessman Mr Eduardo Cojuangco was in third place with
4.1m.
The results of the official tally came more than five weeks after the
election. The delay was caused by complex rules designed to thwart
widespread cheating that took place during the presidency of Mr Ferdinand
Marcos.
Both houses of Congress, meeting in special session, are expected to
proclaim the successor to President Corazon Aquino either by the end of this
week or early next week. Mrs Aquino steps down on June 30 after a six-year
term.
Mr Ramos, a former defence secretary and armed forces chief, secured less
than a quarter of the vote in a seven-cornered battle for the presidency. He
edged out Mrs Santiago, a former cabinet minister who has vowed to launch
nationwide protests against the result, alleging vote-rigging.
Mr Ramos was supported by Mrs Aquino. He had helped her to power in a 1986
popular revolt which ousted Mr Marcos, and kept her in office through six
coup attempts.
Aware that he was elected by the smallest percentage in the country's
history, Mr Ramos has already sought the support of opponents.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIAT, the Turin-based automotive group, yesterday agreed to go ahead with a
joint venture in Algeria to build a Dollars 350m (Pounds 192.3m) car plant
with Saada, the Algerian state vehicle concern.
The agreement, signed in Algiers, envisages a plant with a 30,000-unit
annual capacity at Tiaret in west Algeria. The project has been under
discussion since 1989 but has been dogged by arguments over size, credits
and most recently political uncertainties.
The decision marks a significant overseas commitment by Fiat and reinforces
the Italian government's aim of replacing France as Algeria's main trading
partner. It is also a significant gesture of foreign investor confidence in
Algeria's military-backed government.
Yesterday's agreement envisages the creation of a joint company with L82bn
(Pounds 37.2m) of capital, 36 per cent held by Fiat and 64 per cent by
Saada. Fiat has the option to raise its stake to an eventual 49 per cent.
The plant is planned to be operational within three years and in the
meantime Fiat has the right to import into Algeria up to 12,000 cars a year.
Part of the production - of a model based on the Fiat U - will be exported
to North African and African markets.
Fiat said yesterday the project was intended to be integrated into its
overall car production plans. However, it has prospered thanks to some
L170bn of soft credits made available to Algeria to finance the plant. The
Italian government has also agreed to extend Dollars 7.2bn worth of export
credit guarantees to Algeria, largely linked to the development of gas
supplies. The Algerian government has undertaken to provide the
infrastructure. Tiaret, on a plateau some 300km from the coast, has been
regarded by some auto industry experts as a highly unsuitable greenfield
site.

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR trade officials from 40-50 countries will today try to nudge forward
the negotiations on reductions in tariffs and other trade barriers in the
Uruguay Round of global trade talks.
These negotiations, a key component of the overall liberalisation package,
ground to a halt in March along with the rest of the Round following the
failure of the US and the European Community to settle their differences
over farm trade.
This in turn has prevented the US and the EC from agreeing tariff cuts on
farm and industrial goods between themselves, an accord which would set the
pattern for the rest of the 108 countries taking part in the Round.
Mutual concessions by the world's biggest traders have to be extended to all
under the non-discriminatory 'most favoured nation' principle of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt).
Smaller countries are impatient and frustrated by the transatlantic
stalemate.
They hope to press the US and EC to reveal enough about the likely outcome
of their tariff negotiations to enable the country-by-country talks to
recommence.
However, US and EC trade officials say they do not expect much progress
because neither side wants to 'assume' concessions that are still to be
fought over.
One official talked of 'sacred cows' which leaders remain unwilling to
slaughter.
For example, the EC is refusing to concede 'zero-for-zero' tariff deals in
several industrial sectors until it has a commitment from Washington to cut
high US tariffs on textiles. The US does not wish to make concessions on
textile tariffs without some idea of what the EC offer on farm goods will
eventually look like.
Despite the pessimism, both sides have sent top-level officials to Geneva,
including Mr Hugo Paeman, the EC's chief trade negotiator, and Mr Warren
Lavorel, his US counterpart.
They are expected to hold talks tomorrow with opposite numbers from Japan
and Canada.
Negotiations have also restarted in the Swiss city on commitments by
individual Gatt members to liberalise trade in services, though officials
said these were expected to be fairly technical and low-key.

FT  17 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Turkey pushes to bolster Russian
connection - A string of trade and debt deals have put bilateral ties on a
firmer footing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A HUGE poster draped from the roof of a hotel greeted the Turkish prime
minster as his cavalcade swept through Moscow recently. Hosgeldeniz Baba, it
said - Welcome Baba, as Mr Suleyman Demirel is affectionately known at home.
Mr Demirel's visit to Russia served to underline the importance of Russian
trade ties with Turkey despite the focus of public attention on Ankara's
future role in central Asia and its tentative economic links with the Turkic
republics of the region.
It also bolstered the position for 40 Turkish companies doing construction
work in Russia. Mr Demirel and Russian officials ironed out a number of key
problems on the current natural gas protocol, which has been the main
catalyst for a dramatic rise in bilateral trade in the past few years.
'We're not the Red Cross,' said the head of one of Turkey's leading
contracting companies, worried that attachment to the Turks of Central Asia
was distracting Ankara from what they see as its main task to win contracts
in Russia, where it has a track record. Mr Demirel caused some consternation
in banking circles in Ankara last month, when he promised more than Dollars
1bn (Pounds 500m) in credits to the Turkic republics during a visit through
the region. However, officials have since clarified that this is little more
than insurance cover for those Turkish companies game enough to venture into
these markets. Turkey's best bet in Central Asia remains those deals based
on barter arrangements in a region rich in natural resources but without the
banking infrastructure and the creditworthiness to warrant extending loans.
The extended Russian gas deal - under which Russia agreed to repay its
Dollars 35m debt to Turkey - could well provide the model.
In 1990, Turkey's trade with the Soviet Union was worth Dollars 1.7bn on the
back of 1984 trade protocol under which Turkey imports Soviet gas in part
exchange for Turkish goods and services. Business collapsed with the break
up of the Soviet Union.
Turkey's Eximbank, which helped finance Turkish contractors in the region,
and has extended more than Dollars 1bn worth of credits to the Soviet Union
in the past four years, has frozen all new lines.
For the Turkish contractor who decided to build a hospital in Yalta, the
visit will have had little impact. Like a number of contracts financed on
the back of this six-year-old Soviet-Turkish trade protocol, the hospital
has been left half completed.
Mr Demirel's Moscow visit completed a string of high-level exchanges.
According to Turkish officials, the breakthrough came during Mr Demirel's
meeting with Mr Yegor Gaidar when the Russian first deputy prime minister
gave assurances that Russia would settle a Dollars 35m outstanding debt.
Mr Erdogan Hurbas, head of agreements at the Turkish treasury, says that
Russia will repay over the next three months, and what's more in hard
currency. It will interesting to see how western banks react to such a move,
given that Russia is in default of the Dollars 60bn it owes to western
finance houses. Turkey argues this is a contractual obligation under an
international accord.
Between 1987 and 1990 Turkish Soviet trade more than trebled to Dollars
1.8bn. Turkey is facing a projected energy shortage and is certainly in
desperate need of the Siberian gas which today provides energy for industry
and households and has done much to reduce pollution in cities like Ankara.
But Mr Demirel's projection that trade would increase five-fold over the
next few years may prove optimistic.
Moreover, Russia is also demanding a new price structure, with the price set
according to a central European benchmark as opposed to the Mediterranean
price.
Turkey scored another success in Moscow when the Russians agreed that the
proceeds from the gas agreement - about Dollars 270m in 1991 - should in
future be paid by Botas, Turkey's pipeline company, direct to the Turkish
Eximbank, and not the Vnescheconombank as before.
Under the current agreement, Botas pays hard currency upfront, according to
its projected monthly gas needs. Under the old terms, 70 per cent is
dedicated to the purchase of Turkish goods and services and the remainder is
a free currency portion to service Eximbank's credits.
As a result of this week's talks, the Eximbank says it will unblock its
credit lines to Russia from this month.

<TEXT>
MOSCOW has offered to set up joint ventures in India to manufacture and
export tanks and aircraft to Third World countries, a Russian embassy
spokesman said, Reuter reports from New Delhi.
'Arms sales are a very important means of hard currency for Russia and India
has been a durable defence partner with tested manufacturing capability,' Mr
Vladimir Grachev said.
Mr Grachev said that under the offer India, currently manufacturing tanks
and MiG-21, MiG-23 and MiG-27 jet fighters under licence from the former
Soviet Union, could become a fully fledged partner in a joint venture with
Moscow.
He said India, a key non-communist political ally of the former Soviet
Union, continued to have strong defence ties with Moscow. An Indian defence
ministry spokesman said that he had no knowledge of the offer and would not
say whether one would be considered. Two months ago, Russia extended a
Dollars 830m defence credit to India.
'It's not an easy time for us to give credits, but India has always been the
special exception,' Mr Grachev said.
He said Russia saw a lucrative market for its arms in developing countries.
'A little updated version of MiG-21s would sell like hotdogs.'
Russia has also agreed to sell India rocket engines for its space programme,
which had its first important success last month when an Indian-made rocket
took an Indian-made satellite into orbit.

NEITHER the US nor Russia appears optimistic about an early resolution of
the problems in the former republics of Yugoslavia.
President Boris Yeltsin's spokesman said on Monday night before his summit
with President Bush that 'If we see there is a broad international consensus
to stop the conflict, we will go along with it.'
Mr Bush emphasised US willingness 'to help in a humanitarian sense'. But he
rejected comparisons with the Gulf War, in which, he said, only the US was
in the position to take the international lead. 'Here the EC took the lead
and I hope we'll stay shoulder-to-shoulder with them until this problem is
solved.'
However, Mr Ralph Johnson, the State Department undersecretary for European
and Canadian affairs, said recently that he doubted that much of a European
consensus existed beyond the short term.
On Monday, Mr Bush himself was bluntly warned by President Sali Berisha of
Albania of the threat to fragile regional stability posed by Serbian
territorial ambitions.

FT  17 JUN 92 / Spectre of falling Balkan dominoes haunts Europe: Serbia's
neighbours fear war could spill over into the rest of the region and beyond
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, the US assistant secretary of state, made a
whistle-stop tour to Moscow and the Balkans last month, one thing was
uppermost in his mind. He wanted to make sure that Bulgaria, Romania,
Albania, and Russia would back any sanctions that the United Nations was
soon to impose on Serbia, and its tiny ally Montenegro.
All these countries have now come out in support of the sanctions, not only
in the belief that relations with the US would strengthen as a result. They
fear civil war may engulf Serbia and want some guarantees that the US and
the international community will prevent it from spilling over into the
entire Balkan region. US diplomats have said they cannot provide such
guarantees.
The fear of civil war in Serbia is now openly discussed among all the
opposition parties in Belgrade. Such a war could involve supporters of the
ultra-nationalist, armed Serbian Radical party, led by Mr Vojislav Seselj,
who regard Serbia's nationalist president Slobodan Milosevic as having
reneged on his commitment to create a Greater Serbia. It could also involve
humiliated members of the Yugoslav army, thousands of whom have been forced
by UN agreements - to which Mr Milosevic was a party - to withdraw to Serbia
from the republics of Croatia, Bosnia-Hercegovina and Macedonia.
A Serbian civil war could also be sparked off by rising social discontent as
sanctions, which are already biting, further erode living standards.
Above all, unrest could be triggered in the Serbian-controlled southern
province of Kosovo, where the 2m-strong ethnic Albanian population, denied
any rights since 1990, when Belgrade forcibly incorporated the province into
Serbia, could be provoked into rebelling.
Western diplomats believe it would be difficult to contain a war in Serbia.
If fighting broke out in Kosovo, neighbouring Albania could become involved
through helping the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. This would play into the
hands of Serb extreme nationalists, who have always argued that Albania
harboured territorial ambitions there.
The ethnic Albanians in neighbouring Macedonia, who make up 20 per cent of
the population, might be tempted to lend support to Kosovo. This would cause
instability in the small, independent but still unrecognised republic
because nationalists in Bulgaria, and Greece, could be tempted to revive
historical claims on Macedonia.
'That is why the European Community should have recognised Macedonia last
January,' a western diplomat said. 'The longer we put it off, the greater
the chance of unrest in Macedonia, and in the region.'
A war in Serbia would also mean that the 50,000-strong Moslem population in
the Sandzak, south-west of Serbia, might also attempt to rebel against
Belgrade's proxy Montenegrin reservists in the region.
'We still must not ignore the impact of what Turkey and the other Moslem
states in the Middle East would do. They are disgusted and shocked by the
way in which the Moslems in Bosnia have been slaughtered by Serb
irregulars,' another diplomat said.
Further north, in the Serbian-controlled province of Vojvodina, the
350,000-strong ethnic Hungarian minority is already campaigning for more
ethnic and cultural rights in the region. A war in Serbia could radicalise
them even further, raising the prospect of unrest on Hungary's borders.
Moreover, UN officials and western diplomats believe a civil war in Serbia
could allow Croatian President Franjo Tudjman to start a new offensive in
Slavonia, in eastern Croatia, where UN peace-keeping forces are deployed.
Mr Jozsef Antall, Hungarian prime minister, fears that a civil war in
Serbia, and recent developments in Czechoslovakia, could quickly open up the
whole question of central Europe's post-war borders.
For instance, Hungarian diplomats believe that if Mr Vaclav Klaus, the new
prime minister of Czechoslovakia, finds it impossible to reach an agreement
on retaining the Czech and Slovak federation with Mr Vladimir Meciar, head
of the nationalist Slovak Democratic party, the status of the 600,000 ethnic
Hungarians in an independent Slovakia could be undermined.
The Hungarians in Slovakia have always wanted the retention of the
federation. For them, the Czech lands act as a counterweight to Slovak
nationalists. Without the federation, they believe Slovakia will become more
nationalist and intolerant of ethnic rights for themselves, as well as for
the small Ruthene and Ukrainian minorities.
Already, Mr Miklos Duray, who was elected to the federal parliament and who
is head of Co-existence, a party that groups ethnic Hungarians and Poles in
Slovakia, is calling for greater autonomy for Hungarians.
Hungarian diplomats privately argue that any discrimination towards the
ethnic Hungarians in Slovakia would radicalise a wing of Hungary's ruling
Hungarian Democratic Forum.
'The last thing Budapest wants is the development of a political situation
in Slovakia in which the ethnic Hungarians will be pushed into seeking
protection from, or unification with, Hungary,' a Hungarian diplomat said.
'This would play into the hands of the nationalists in Romania, who would
then say Budapest wanted to annex Transylvania (where over 2m ethnic
Hungarians live). The whole region would be thrown into instability,' he
said. 'That is why a war in Serbia would be so dangerous.'

<TEXT>
UNITED Nations officials are expected to start demilitarising Sarajevo
airport and its surroundings today provided the ceasefire enforced since
Monday continues to hold.
Once the area has been demilitarised, UN officials are hoping a 1,000 strong
Canadian battalion can be deployed by Sunday to take control of the airport.
This could then pave the way for airlifting food and medical supplies to the
Bosnian capital of Sarajevo which has been besieged by Serb irregulars for
the past ten weeks. Sarajevo radio reported the city was generally calm
though snipers continued to intimidate the population. Two foreign
journalists were wounded, one critically.
There are fears the ceasefire could break down following an agreement
between Croatian president Franjo Tudjman, and Bosnian president Alija
Izetbegovic on Monday.
The presidents agreed to recognise each other's republics, exchange
ambassadors, and seek military cooperation in the 'armed struggle' against
the Serbs.'
Mr Izetbegovic said he was seeking military co-operation with Croatia
'because we are fighting against the same aggressor - the Serbs.'
UN secretary general Boutros Boutros Ghali yesterday confirmed that forces
from Croatia were fighting in Bosnia-Hercegovina, and appealed to Zagreb to
withdraw them.
The forces, grouped under the Croatian Defence Council (CDC), now control
large parts of northern Bosnia, and western Hercegovina, eastern Bosnia,
where thousands of Serbs have been forced to flee into neighbouring
Montenegro.
Western diplomats said that Serb irregulars and Serbia's proxy army in
Bosnia, led by Mr Radovan Karadzic and General Ratko Mladic, will now have
to decide whether to abide by the ceasefire.
Mr Izetbegovic yesterday said the Moslems would never again sit with 'Serb
terrorists' at the European Community- sponsored peace conference on
Yugoslavia, which is expected to resume once Sarajevo airport is reopened.

<TEXT>
A GOVERNMENT crisis was averted yesterday after Sweden's Centre party, part
of the ruling coalition, decided to uphold its support for the country's EC
membership bid despite strong opposition among party members and supporters.
Mr Carl Bildt, the prime minister, had warned the party that it would have
to leave the government if it took an anti-EC stance. Sweden's moves towards
EC membership have been upset recently by growing public opposition.
Yesterday the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development warned
the government that its huge budget deficit and an uncertain economic future
threatened its market reforms and the country's integration into the
European Community.
The OECD annual survey said: 'Sweden's public finances will remain seriously
unbalanced if no further rationalisation measures are taken.' It estimates
that the increase cost of health care and education as well as tax reforms
will drive up the budget deficit to around 4.8 per cent of gross national
product next year.
'It means the budget deficit will go over the 3 per cent limit of GNP which
the EC has set for future participation in an economic union.'
The OECD welcomed the successful effort to reduce inflation and uphold the
value of the krona and industry's increasing competitiveness.
'The Swedish economy is going through a difficult phase of adjustment after
the overheating in the late 1980s', argues the report. 'Although the
short-term outlook for growth and employment is not particularly bright,
there are grounds for optimism looking beyond the near term.'

GERMAN and British competition officials yesterday called for the European
Commission to establish an independent cartel office to reduce the risk of
sensitive competition decisions being distorted by political considerations.
Sir Sydney Lipworth, chairman of the British Monopolies and Mergers
Commission (MMC), said the Brussels competition directorate should split its
investigative and prosecution functions as a first step towards establishing
an independent tribunal.
Such a panel would take decisions on pure competition grounds, Sir Sydney
told a Brussels seminar of the new pro-Community think-tank, European Policy
Forum. Commissioners would be able to overrule the tribunal in exceptional
cases.

THE break-up of the Czechoslovak federation appears imminent as Czech and
Slovak leaders meet again today to discuss the future of the country,
officials close to Czech negotiators said yesterday.
'We are convinced that a separation is unavoidable. The Movement for a
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) has clearly told us that it wants an independent
Slovakia regardless of economic difficulties,' they said. The nationalist
HZDS, led by Mr Vladimir Meciar, won 37 per cent of the vote in the Slovak
republic in the general election this month.
Mr Meciar will meet Mr Vaclav Klaus, the newly-elected Czech leader, in
Prague today for a third round of post-electoral negotiations. The talks
will be aimed at forming a minimal federal government which, the officials
said, would be charged with arranging the orderly liquidation of the
74-year-old federation.
Previous meetings have failed, with Mr Klaus categorically rejecting Slovak
demands for 'an economic and defence union of two sovereign states'.
The officials said that such a union was an attempt by Slovaks to build the
future institutions of an independent republic with federal subsidies. 'They
want a financial and economic umbrella under which they will erode the
federation,' they said.
They added that the Czech side would refuse to finance the federal budget
under such circumstances and that the federation could come to a de facto
end by the close of the year.
Both Mr Klaus and the Mr Vaclav Havel, the Czechoslovak president, have
stated that Mr Meciar's demand for a sovereign and internationally
recognised Slovakia are incompatible with the requirements of a common
state.
Negotiations are due to continue today and on Friday in Prague. But the
officials said that the two sides could even fail to form an interim federal
government as they disagreed on how to share power within it.

THE Bank of Italy squeezed the financial markets further yesterday by
raising the rate for repurchase agreements with the banks to 14.21 per cent.
In the two weeks since Danish voters rejected the Maastricht Treaty in a
referendum, the Italian authorities have been obliged to make a series of
selective upward adjustments to interest rates and intervene to bolster the
lira. Rates on repurchase agreements, instruments of short term liquidity,
have risen by nearly two percentage points.
Yesterday the lira was being traded at 756.8 to the D-Mark only marginally
down from Monday's record 757.1. Nevertheless, the lira continued to be
under pressure. Economists predicted it would remain weak so long as Italy
continued be without both a government and credible measures to curb the
public sector deficit.
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro is now in his second week of consultations
with political leaders on choosing a new prime minister to form a
government. Every formula so far tested has encountered serious obstacles
Nevertheless, Mr Scalfaro has said he wants a speedy solution. There were
suggestions yesterday he might opt for a 'new generation' Christian Democrat
on the understanding that he looked for a support base broader than the
outgoing coalition with the Socialists, Social Democrats and Liberals.

FT  17 JUN 92 / French warning to media buyers
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH competition authorities have taken fresh action against the
discount-buying muscle of media purchasing agencies, in a move likely to be
welcomed by media owners across Europe.
The Competition Council, France's anti-trust agency, has written to 40 media
and publicity groups warning that they may be illicitly distorting fair
competition on more than 90 counts.
It is concerned about the way France's advertising market has come to be
dominated by media buying agencies, whose purpose is to use their volume
power to get cheaper space for their advertising agency customers.
The top four - Carat, PMS, TMP and Eurocom - together account for almost 80
per cent of French media buying. They are keen to repeat the French model
elsewhere in Europe, to the anxiety of many media owners who have seen their
advertising margins dwindle or vanish during the recession.
The council alleges that Carat, Europe's largest media buyer, has forced
media owners into 'economic dependence', according to a French press report
confirmed officially yesterday. Media buyers generally conceal from
customers the rates paid for space bought on their behalf, adds the council.
Discounts must be made clear to all, it argues.
The government has already signalled its anxiety about the growing strength
of media buyers when last year it told Eurocom and Carat - which had formed
an alliance two years previously - that they could not work together in
France. This latest step was triggered by an inquiry by the Finance
Ministry's competition division.
The companies concerned will in the next few months have the chance to
respond to the council. It has the power to enforce changes in the way they
operate and to levy fines. A decision is expected this autumn.

INVESTMENT confidence was tested again in the UK stock market yesterday as
the new trading account opened against a gloomy international and domestic
backcloth. However, there was little selling pressure and the FT-SE 100
Index rebounded comfortably from a new resistance level, with traders
sounding unperturbed by the day's loss of 10.1 on the index, which closed at
2,593.6.
Nevertheless, turnover remained very thin as the season for holidays and
sporting highlights began to attract attention. Many share prices were
hardly tested and the second half of the session saw substantial recoveries
in some areas when marketmaking houses picked up cheap stocks. Fisons, for
example, weathered a fresh selling bout to trim significantly the early
loss.
Seaq-reported volume was slow to advance during the morning and the final
total of 359.5m shares compared poorly with Friday's 497.7m. Stock index
futures played a less forceful role as Friday's expiry deadline for the
FT-SE June futures contract drew near.
The market trod a somewhat erratic path in early trading, opening about 15
Footsie points off but soon steadying almost to its overnight level. The
lack of support then made itself felt and the index gave ground to reach the
day's low of 2,577.8, off nearly 26 points.
In addition to worries over results from leading UK companies, which upset
the market last week, investors were discouraged by developments on the
wider economic scale.
An upward revision of the UK trade deficit for the first quarter of the year
did nothing to soothe worries about the domestic economy. Hopes for another
cut in UK base rates were not helped by warnings from the Bundesbank
president that he saw no room for a reduction in German rates at present,
nor from the Bank for International Settlement's rejection of suggestions
that other European Community countries might undercut German rates.
However, the stock market successfully withstood the assault on the Footsie
2,580 mark, which is regarded as an important defence line. After seeing the
2,650 and then the 2,600 levels swept aside, traders were clearly relieved
to see yesterday's rally.
Very modest buying, mostly from within the market community rather than from
genuine investors, proved enough to take the index ahead steadily in spite
of a poor opening to the new Wall Street session. When the Dow Average
turned from an initial loss of 10 points to a net gain of 3.5 in UK trading
hours, London closed in good form.
The head of a leading Japanese house said: 'There was no serious selling,
and we could respond strongly to any positive news.'
Several of the recent share price casualties turned in better performances
yesterday. Midland Bank steadied as arbitrage activity finally died away,
leaving the market to await formal completion of the merger with Hongkong
and Shanghai Banking. Pressure on oil shares also eased, leaving BP only
pence lower on the day and Shell edging ahead as buyers came in at the
close.

FT  16 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow recoups early losses in
subdued trade

Wall Street
ALTHOUGH US share prices recovered from early losses incurred in the wake of
Friday's bad news from Monsanto, stock market sentiment remained subdued all
day, leaving major indices little changed at the end of trading, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed a slight 0.54 up at 3,354.90. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 0.53 at 410.29, while the American SE composite
was down 2.54 at 388.78 and the Nasdaq composite 0.51 easier at 569.01.
Turnover on the New York SE was very light at 164m shares.
Overnight weakness in foreign markets, particularly in Tokyo where the
Nikkei average tumbled 2.5 per cent, plus the Wall Street market's failure
to hold on to Friday's early 30-point Dow gain, set the tone for a weak
start to trading yesterday. By the end of the first half-hour, the Dow was
down more than 16 points, but there was sufficient demand to bring the index
back to its opening level by noon.
The early losses were linked to the decline of Monsanto shares, which
plunged Dollars 5 1/4 to Dollars 53 3/4 in turnover of 2.5m as investors
reacted to Friday's late warning from the chemical company that its
second-quarter earnings would be between 20 and 30 per cent below analysts'
estimates that ranged from Dollars 1.60 to Dollars 1.80 a share.
Such was the backlog of sellers that trading in Monsanto was delayed at the
start until the order imbalance had been rectified.
Leading tobacco issues were unsettled by news that Federal prosecutors are
conducting a criminal probe into whether the big cigarette makers had misled
the public about the health dangers of smoking. Philip Morris retreated
Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 73, RJR Nabisco lost Dollars 1/4 early on but
finished steady at Dollars 9 1/2 , and American Brands dipped Dollars  3/8
to Dollars 47.
Browning-Ferris put on Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 21 after Kidder Peabody, the
broking house, upgraded its rating on the stock from a 'hold' to a 'buy',
citing the benefits of the recent equity offering and predicting a return to
earnings growth not seen since 1990.
Barr Laboratories plummeted Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 6 on news that the US
Food and Drug Administration is seeking court approval to prevent the
company from manufacturing or selling drugs. The court hearing is scheduled
for June 24.
Utilicorp dropped Dollars 4 to Dollars 23 7/8 on stating that it would take
a second-quarter 21 cents a share charge following the discovery that some
of its funds had been misappropriated.
On the Nasdaq market, Century Medicorp rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 11 1/2
after the company said it would meet analysts' estimates of Dollars 1.13 a
share for the year ending June 30. Also higher was Chipcom, up Dollars 2 1/2
at Dollars 22 1/2 on a Prudential Securities upgrade.
Canada
TORONTO showed some recovery from an early slide to end on a mixed note
after slow trading. The TSE 300 composite index was finally 1.8 up at
3,409.8, while declines held a slight edge over rises by 263 to 259. Volume
was 23.2m shares.
Gulf Canada plunged CDollars 3 1/8 to CDollars 6 3/4 . The company reported
that first test results from its Indonesian gas properties were 'very
discouraging'.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Vote fears keep D-Mark strong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE D-MARK held on to most of its recent gains against other European
currencies on the foreign exchange markets yesterday, supported by fears
over European Union, writes James Blitz.
With two days to go to Ireland's referendum on European political and
economic union, the markets remain slightly jittery about the possibility
that European union is on the rocks. Although the opinion polls show that
the Irish people will vote 'Yes' to the Maastricht Treaty on Thursday, the
markets are still putting their faith in the D-Mark, which they perceive to
be the strongest currency in the European Monetary System (EMS).
The German currency made new headway against sterling, partly helped by an
upward revision of Britain's first-quarter current account deficit to Pounds
2.64bn from an estimated Pounds 2.17bn. The pound closed  1/4 pfennig down
at DM2.9175. Sterling will be tested further in a big week of UK indicators:
May's retail sales figures are due out tomorrow and May's unemployment
number is scheduled for Thursday.
The French franc and Spanish peseta improved only slightly against the
D-Mark to FFr3.367 and Pta62.85 from previous closes of FFr3.370 and
Pta62.88 respectively.
The Italian lira would have lost ground to the D-Mark had it not been for
yet more intervention by the Bank of Italy. The Bank sold 4m ecu at the
midday currency fixing as the lira was set at a fresh 1992 low against the
D-Mark of L757.19. At least one London bank reported that the Bank of Italy
had intervened in the market to prop up its currency at around L757. The
lira finished at L756.7 to the D-Mark from a previous close of L757.2.
Conversely, the German currency lost much ground to the one other currency
in Europe that is seen as a safe haven in times of European trouble: the
Swiss franc. The D-Mark ended at a four-month low against the 'Swissie',
although traders were divided over exactly why.
The Swiss currency may have been boosted by a small rise in short-term
interest rates in the Swiss franc market or by a general feeling that it was
undervalued. It ended the day up at SFr0.90 to the D-Mark from a previous
close of SFr0.9040.
The dollar was mostly sidelined, with no important indicators out of the US.
It moved mainly in a narrow range between DM1.5700 and DM1.5664, and at its
weak point touched a four-month low against the D-Mark in European trading.
It ended more than  1/2 pfennig down from Friday's close, at DM1.5715. In
New York yesterday the dollar finished at DM1.5708.
The US currency will be tested by today's figures for May US housing starts,
which weakened sharply last month.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Money Markets: Cash expensive
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORT RATES in the sterling cash market were firmer yesterday as dealers
took the whole day to remove the large shortage forecast by the Bank of
England.
As expected, the Bank forecast a shortage of Pounds 1bn at the start of what
is expected to be an expensive week for money. Many of the Bank's previous
repurchase agreements are due to expire this week. The shortage in
forthcoming days could add up to around Pounds 7bn.
To help remove yesterday's shortage, the Bank invited the discount houses to
tender bills in the early round. They also offered to purchase bills in the
longer dated Bands 3 and 4 at 9 21/32 per cent and 9 19/32 per cent
respectively.
At first, dealers waited to see whether the Bank would offer to buy these
bills at slightly lower rates: only Pounds 16m of Band-3 bank bills and
Pounds 29m of Band-4 bills were purchased. On top of this, Pounds 33m of
Band-1 bank bills and Pounds 74m of Band-2 bank bills were purchased at the
now established rate of 9 7/8 per cent.
As midday approached, dealers realised that the Bank would stick to these
dealing rates throughout the day. At the established rates, the Bank
purchased Pounds 70m of Band-1 treasury bills, Pounds 72m of Band-1 bank
bills, Pounds 20m of Band-2 bank bills, Pounds 237m of Band-3 bank bills,
Pounds 1m of Band-4 LA bills, and Pounds 161m of Band-4 bank bills. In the
afternoon, the shortage was revised to around Pounds 800m. The Bank bought
Pounds 37m of Band-1 bank bills and Pounds 13m of Band-2 bank bills. The
Bank also provided late assistance of around Pounds 70m.
The Bank was clearly not trying to signal a change in base rate policy by
dealing in longer-dated bills at these softer rates. Indeed, 3-month
sterling libor closed around 10 per cent. But one discount house dealer said
the Bank made life much easier by trading in Bands 3 and 4, which are long
dated, rather than alleviating the shortages with repurchase agreements that
would be expected to mature within a month. This way, the Bank pushes the
next cycle of shortages further out.
Period rates reflected the tone of trading. The overnight ended up at 10 3/4
per cent from 7 1/2 per cent on Friday night. The one-week rate finished at
10 5/16 per cent from 9 1/2 per cent, and the one-month rate at 10 1/16 per
cent from 9 15/16 per cent.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Government Bonds: Maastricht worries upset European markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNCERTAINTY over the prospects for economic and monetary union continued to
upset the European government bond markets yesterday, with high-yielding
markets seeing the worst falls.
Some dealers are waiting for Ireland's referendum on the Maastricht Treaty
on Thursday, which is expected to yield a vote in favour of ratification.
Since Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht Treaty, investors have flocked
to the safety of the D-Mark bloc. However, German government bonds ended
lower yesterday as poor inflation data proved a disappointment to the
market.
The cost of living in the former West Germany rose by a revised 0.4 per cent
in May, giving a year-on-year rise of 4.6 per cent. Preliminary figures had
suggested a month-on-month rise of 0.3 per cent. The Liffe bund futures
contract opened at 88.20 and slipped to 88.06 in the early afternoon, ending
at around 88.07.
THE UK government bond market fell back by nearly half a point due to the
combination of funding worries, poor trade figures, and the general decline
in the European bond markets.
The Bank of England is due to announce details of its next gilt auction
today. It has already indicated that it will sell between Pounds 2bn and
Pounds 3bn of stock in the 2007-2012 maturity range, but today's
announcement will contain the exact amount and maturity of the auction
issue.
With the forthcoming auction already overhanging the market, some dealers
were taken by surprise when the Bank announced on Friday that a Pounds 500m
tranche of the 4 1/8 per cent index-linked stock due 2030 would be available
for sale with effect from today.
'Most of the focus at the moment is on new issuance and funding,' said one
trader, adding that the market will be waiting for the release today of the
Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) figures for May.
Traders said that against the background of supply worries, yesterday's
trade figures did not help market sentiment.
The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 fell over half a point from
116 7/16 to 115 27/32 by late afternoon.
THE JAPANESE government bond market opened on a firm note yesterday after
Friday's US inflation figures raised hopes that the Federal Reserve might
ease short-term interest rates.
Dealers said the combination of a firmer US Treasury bond market and a
stronger yen helped to buoy the Japanese bond market, which closed slightly
higher on the day.
Most investor interest focused on short-dated rather than the
longer-maturity bond issues. The benchmark No 129 issue opened with a yield
of 5.48 per cent, moved to 5.495 per cent and closed at the highest level of
the day yielding 5.475 per cent. Volumes were relatively light with only
Y244bn traded in the No 129 bond.
US TREASURY prices were little changed yesterday in very quiet trading.
By late afternoon the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/32 at 101
21/32 , yielding 7.848 per cent, while the two-year note was unchanged at
100 3/16 , yielding 5.005 per cent.
The market appears to have given up almost all hope of another interest rate
cut after the Federal Reserve's decision last week not to ease monetary
policy in the wake of disappointing retail sales data and good inflation
numbers. The likelihood that rates will stay where they are, coupled with
the absence of important economic data, explained the lethargic session
yester-day.
The only news out yesterday was 10-day auto sales for early June. The
figures, showing that the annual rate rose during the period from between
6.2m and 6.3m units to 6.5m units, drew no reaction from investors.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French government plans to sell 22.9m Total shares, representing a 12.4
per cent stake in the oil company, by July 10, if market conditions permit,
Reuter reports from Paris.
According to the Finance Ministry, the sale will be spilt into three
tranches, a French tranche of about 8m shares, a public placement in the US
of about 7.4m shares, and an international placement of about 7.5m shares.
It will also exchange four Total investment certificates for three ordinary
shares, as announced on May 15, the ministry added. The offer represents 6.5
per cent of Total's capital, it said.
General plans for both operations were announced in May. As announced, the
operation will cut the government's stake in Total to 15 from 34 per cent.
The government will then have only two representatives on Total's board
instead of four.
The state will still have some exceptional rights over Total relating to
protection of national interests and will be able to veto the nomination of
the company's chairman, but it will no longer be able to veto the choice of
board members and directors.
Subscriptions to the public offer in France will be open for three days
according to a schedule which will be given at a later date, the ministry
said.
The other two tranches will run according to the same schedule, it added.
Total shares shed FFr5.30 to close at FFr250.70 yesterday.
In a separate statement, Total said the exchange of shares for certificates
would involve 12.1m Total shares.
The US offer of 7.4m shares is equivalent to about 14.8m American Depositary
Shares, it added.
The state will also sell shares representing 7.7 per cent of Total to
state-owned financial institutions, it said.
Insurers Assurances Generales de France and Groupement des Assurances
Nationales already own 2.3 per cent of Total.

FT  16 JUN 92 / International Company News: Electrolux seeking further
acquisitions in eastern Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELECTROLUX, the largest European white goods maker, is finding it difficult
to make acquisitions in eastern Europe because of the poor condition of
potential target companies, according to Mr Lennart Ribohn, senior executive
vice-president.
The Swedish-based multinational is looking for further acquisitions in
eastern Europe following its takeover last year of Lehel, Hungary's largest
white goods producer. Although Electrolux has started talks with other
companies, Mr Ribohn said it had not yet found one suitable.
The big western white goods companies are keen to expand in eastern Europe
because of the latent market potential in countries such as Hungary and
Czechoslovakia, but also as a possible source for low-end products or
components. In May, Whirlpool, the world's largest white goods group,
finalised an important joint venture agreement with Tatramat, the
Czechoslovakian washing machine manufacturer.
Mr Ribohn said Electrolux had established holding companies in Poland,
Russia and the Baltic states as channels for imported western white goods.
However, economic conditions in some eastern countries since the collapse of
communism restricted their ability to receive imports.
He said that since the takeover of Lehel, with which Electrolux has had a
long-standing relationship, exports from the Hungarian company had
increased.
He suggested that Electrolux could consider a green field expansion in
eastern Europe if it could not find suitable acquisition targets and when
market conditions improved.
The Electrolux executive was speaking at Zanussi's new L250bn (Dollars
209.4m) washing machine factory at Porcia, near Venice. The factory is a key
weapon in Electrolux and its Zanussi subsidiary's battle with Whirlpool for
supremacy in the European white goods market.
Mr Gian Mario Rossignolo, Zanussi chairman, said Zanussi lifted sales last
year by 10.3 per cent to L2,424bn and claimed increased market share in
Europe and in Italy. Zanussi's cash-flow grew 22.3 per cent to L187bn and
investments rose 15.3 per cent to L122bn.
Both Whirlpool and Electrolux have been spending heavily on marketing and
advertising in Europe over the past year, despite flat market conditions
overall.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Chicago Board of Trade says the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,
the futures industry regulator, will permit it to lift speculative position
limits on three of the exchange's most important financial contracts.
The rule change aims to accommodate large traders, particularly managed
futures funds.
Position limits are caps on the trading positions held by non-commercial
participants in a market.
They have traditionally been used to prevent price manipulations or excess
volatility.
The CBOT's limits on trading the 30-year US Treasury bond, and five and
10-year Treasury notes will be removed. Position limits on the related
option contracts will remain in effect.
The CFTC's move follows its approval at the start of the year of eliminating
positions limits on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's largest currency
futures and its Eurodollar contract.
The CBOT is also proposing to the CFTC that its member firms be allowed to
provide average prices and order quantities for large customers, when an
order or series of orders representing multiple accounts is executed.
Again, the rule change is designed to respond to managed fund traders.

BANK of Tokyo is to mount a rescue operation, including capital and staff
injections, for Dainana Securities, the loss-making broker, Reuter reports
from Tokyo.
Mr Yoshiaki Ara, a former BoT official and currently managing director of
Sanyo Securities, is to become president of Dainana.
Under the plan, Dainana will increase its capital - presently Y2bn (Dollars
15.78m) - through an issue of shares to a third party.
Dainana wants the Bank of Tokyo to send staff to the brokerage and accept
new shares.
The broker, in which Bank of Tokyo is already a shareholder, posted a
current loss of Y2.31bn for the year ended March 1992.
Industry sources said Bank of Tokyo's support for Dainana was unlikely to
turn into an acquisition or a merger, although Japan is moving to allow
banks to buy a financially-troubled brokerage house in line with reforms of
its domestic financial system.
Ministry of Finance sources said it would accept a merger between a bank and
an ailing brokerage house case by case after Japan lowered barriers between
the banking and securities industry, which is expected in 1993.
Lake, an unlisted Osaka-based consumer credit company, reported a parent net
loss of Y71.9bn in the year to end-March 1992, against a Y10.5bn profit a
year earlier.

FT  16 JUN 92 / International Company News: Glass group reflects on the
future - Plans to privatise a Czechoslovak enterprise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALONG with thousands of other business managers who have presented
privatisation projects to the Czechoslovakia government in recent months, Mr
Karl Ludvik, the general manager of Preciosa, has put together a plan for
the future ownership of the state-owned company he has headed for eight
years.
But while other managers grew weary jet-setting around the world to find a
foreign investor, Mr Ludvik has stayed in his office in Jablonec, a run-down
industrial town near the Polish border. He did not need to move. Since it
was created in 1948 when various workshops were grouped together, Preciosa
has accumulated large profits from the assortment of glass (jewellery,
chandeliers) it sells to 70 countries worldwide.
Mr Ludvik says he intends to keep the company in Czechoslovak hands. His
words echo those of the government who, eager to reassure a public worrying
that the best of Czechoslovakia is being sold to foreigners, decided that
traditional Bohemian enterprises, such as the breweries, crystals and
porcelain makers, would be privatised locally.
Mr Ludvik says his factory is anchored in the Bohemian glass-cutting
tradition. In common with many Czechoslovak managers, he believes he does
not need a foreign partner. 'We have enough financial resources for our own
development. It doesn't mean that we want to lock ourselves in our own house
and be closed to foreign opportunities. We are interested in obtaining
financing from abroad. But we don't want our capital to be even partially in
foreign hands.'
Mr Ludvik is not alone in Czechoslovakia. Foreign investors attempting to
form joint-ventures with profitable local enterprises say they often face
closed doors. 'Many managers just think they can do it all on their own,'
says Mr William Harter, from Proctor &amp; Gamble who last year bought a local
detergent company. 'Foreign investors are often not taking enough time to
explain to their partners why they may be needed.'
But there are other reasons why some managers are less than willing to forge
joint-ventures with foreign partners. In the two years since the overhaul of
the communist regime, many managers have taken advantage of the existing
legislative vacuum. Often, for example, they have been plundering the
state-owned companies they manage by transferring orders and profits to
personal private companies.
Today, as privatisation projects are hastily approved by government
officials, they hope to continue benefitting personally from the change.
Such attempts have stirred a bitter controversy both in the public and
within governmental circles in Czechoslovakia. Officially, government
members have declared their intention to prevent managers from receiving
large portions of their enterprises' shares. But there have been a number of
notable instances of managers influencing officials.
Mr Ludvik is confident his privatisation project will be approved, despite
the fact it would give 30 per cent of Preciosa to employees, of which the
bulk would be owned by a few 'keepers of the know-how', as he calls them.
'Our aim is not to loose these people whose skills have been passed on from
generations to generations' he says. Instead, the enterprises will be owned
by some employees, municipalities and local banks. Eager to get a share of
the pie, banks have been vying to be included in Preciosa's privatisation
project, offering as a bait loans which are twice cheaper than the market
rate.
In common with many other managers in the country, Mr Ludvik intends to
avoid the distribution of part of Preciosa's capital to the public under the
government mass-privatisation programme. According to the eastern Europe
scheme, over 3,000 enterprises will be distributed to the public in the form
of vouchers which are expected to be converted into shares by the end of the
year. 'We are afraid of vouchers and we have good reasons to be' Mr Ludvik
says. 'Some investment funds will be buying the future shares and sell them
to foreign companies. We don't want our capital to be even partially in
foreign hands.'
But government officials are not all lured by the patriotic intentions of
managers. 'In most cases, when managers say their companies will stay in
Czechoslovak hands, they intend to launch management buy-outs,' says Ms Eva
Klvacova who works at the Czechoslovak privatisation ministry.

FT  16 JUN 92 / International Company News: McDonnell Douglas set to delay
launch of jumbo jet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
McDONNELL Douglas, the financially-stretched US aerospace group, appears to
have virtually abandoned hope of launching its much-trumpeted MD-12 jumbo
jet in 1992 because of a lack of orders.
The blow comes on top of McDonnell Douglas's continuing difficulties in
attracting Asian investment to the project, which is widely regarded as
crucial to the company's future in commercial aviation.
The company is also engaged in a substantial round of job cuts at its
commercial aircraft division in southern California as it grapples with a
deteriorating market for commercial jets.
McDonnell Douglas had hoped to launch the MD-12 programme before the end of
1992. However, a company spokesman acknowledged yesterday the financial
difficulties facing the world's airlines meant that 'it may not happen this
year'.
He insisted that many airlines had responded 'very positively' to the new
aircraft but acknowledged that none had placed orders for it. 'We're going
to wait for the market,' he said. 'We're ready to launch it when they are
ready.'
The MD-12 would challenge Boeing's 747-400 at the top end of the market. In
a bold move last April to take the commercial initiative, McDonnell Douglas
scrapped earlier plans for a three-engine aircraft in favour of a
four-engined one with two passenger levels. This aircraft could eventually
be stretched into a super-jumbo, carrying more than 600 passengers, which
would make it the largest on the market.
Analysts say that if the company fails to get the MD-12 into production it
will be doomed to inexorable decline in the commercial aircraft business,
because it offers a much narrower range of products than Boeing or Airbus
Industrie of Europe.
It cannot afford the development costs of the MD-12, which are estimated at
more than Dollars 5bn, and to fund the jet it has been discussing selling up
to 49 per cent of its commercial aviation business to Asian and European
investors, notably Taiwan Aerospace, which last year reached a tentative
agreement to buy a 40 per cent stake.
However, the Taiwan company, under pressure from hostile legislators, has
grown more wary of a deal and is concerned about the uncertain commercial
potential of the new aircraft.
McDonnell Douglas yesterday faced problems on another front when a Pentagon
report, leaked to the press, alleged that senior government officials had
rushed through the approval of new versions of the company's F/A-18 fighter
without a proper evaluation.
The report is ammunition for Congressional critics of the F/A-18 seeking to
slow or halt the programme.
McDonnell Douglas shares reacted to the flurry of bad news by dropping
Dollars 1 1/2 in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange, to stand at
Dollars 38 1/4 at close of trade.

FT  16 JUN 92 / International Company News: Barr accuses FDA of making
untrue claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARR Laboratories, the New York-based generic pharmaceuticals company,
yesterday attacked the US Food and Drug Administration for seeking an
interim injunction to stop it marketing medicines.
The company said allegations filed by the FDA at a New York court last
Friday were untrue or misrepresentative. FDA inspectors visiting Barr's
manufacturing sites last year said the company's manufacturing practices
were not up to standard. A court hearing at White Plains, New York, has been
set for June 24.
Barr's attack on the FDA follows a long-running feud with the organisation.
The company says it has more than 80 drug applications outstanding and not
one has been given approval since 1989.
In April, Barr won a battle with Imperial Chemical Industries of the UK over
the US patent for Nolvadex, ICI's best-selling cancer drug. Barr said then
it planned to distribute Nolvadex within 12 months.
Barr is also challenging the validity of Wellcome's patent for Retrovir, the
drug used to treat patients with the Aids virus, HIV.
Barr stopped marketing certain medicines in an attempt to placate the FDA in
April. The company has since announced it planned to reduce its workforce of
530 by about 25 per cent.

<TEXT>
SHARES of Gulf Canada Resources, the energy group controlled by ailing
property developer Olympia &amp; York, lost almost one-third of their value
yesterday after the company reported poor results from an Indonesian natural
gas well.
Gulf's share price tumbled CDollars 3 1/8 in heavy trading yesterday to
close at CDollars 6 3/4 . It reached a peak of CDollars 10.88 earlier this
year.
The company's shares drew a flurry of excitement earlier this year when
initial tests on the Kuala Langsa well in North Sumatra raised hopes of a
vast gas deposit.
The well is close to the huge Arun gas field, which is a leading supplier of
liquefied natural gas to Japan. Japanese National Petroleum has a 50 per
cent stake in the Gulf Canada property.
Gulf said yesterday that test results now pointed to an unexpectedly high
proportion of carbon dioxide and a low level of hydrocarbons.
A Gulf Canada spokesman said further tests would be conducted before a
decision was taken whether to develop the Kuala Langsa field.
O&amp;Y's problems have thrown a cloud over Gulf's future ownership. The
developer, whose Canadian assets are under court protection, pledged its
Gulf shares as partial security for a USDollars 2.5bn 'jumbo' loan which it
negotiated with an international banking syndicate in 1989.
In a move to conserve resources, Gulf withdrew earlier this year as a
participant in the CDollars 5bn (USDollars 4.1bn) Hibernia oil project off
Newfoundland. Other participants in the Hibernia venture, led by Mobil Oil
Canada, are searching for a replacement.
Local reports have suggested that Hyundai, the South Korean conglomerate,
may be among those interested in taking Gulf's place in the Hibernia
consortium.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ICL, the UK-based computer manufacturer in which Fujitsu of Japan has a
majority stake, and Hughes STX, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hughes
Aircraft, are joining forces to offer large customers security products to
protect their computer networks against intruders, such as hackers.
The companies said yesterday that they had concluded a agreement to jointly
market security systems based on technologies they have developed for the
defence market.
The market for data security products is reckoned to be worth about Dollars
5bn at present and growing at over 20 per cent a year.
The industrial logic of the joint venture is that both companies have long
experience of developing systems to protect military computer networks
against hackers, spies and other unauthorised intruders.
Mr Andrew Roberts, director of ICL's mid-range systems division, said: 'We
have technology and products which were originally developed for the British
government defence market.
'The agreement with Hughes enables us to make them available to the American
defence community. Hughes will assist us in tailoring them for the
commercial market in North America.'
ICL, with a turnover last year of Dollars 3.3bn, is looking for new ways to
penetrate North American markets. In co-operation with its Japanese parent
it is already a leading supplier of point of sale systems.
Hughes, with revenues of about Dollars 8bn, specialises in information
security and systems integration for government and commercial customers.
Its range of products includes masking devices which can make computers
invisible to electro-magnetic eavesdropping.
The threat to commercial networks has grown as companies have developed
networks with a few hundred to many thousands of terminals powered by
computers from several different manufacturers.
The two companies are hoping to generate revenues of Dollars 100m in annual
sales within four years.

The South Carolina-based company's statement follows its disclosure on June

parties related to S&amp;J Perfume.
The company said the relationship had not previously been disclosed to the
public or the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
It revealed that the SEC had begun an informal investigation of the company
and added that it was co-operating fully with the SEC, but did not have any
knowledge that any improprieties had occurred.
Ross said it had received many inquiries from the investment community on
the possible direct or indirect equity stake held by the S&amp;J.
It maintained that it did not yet know the exact nature of any such
relationship between the company and its principal supplier, or if any
members of the company's board or senior management may have had previous
knowledge of this undisclosed relationship.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREAT WESTERN Resources, the oil and gas company which is in legal dispute
with its once-largest coal customer, has announced the criminal indictment
of a former employee.
Mr Clyde Goins, former president of Great Western Coal, is alleged to have
taken a Dollars 1m bribe to encourage the Dollars 8.5m purchase by Great
Western of the Burning Star Coal Company in 1988.
Mr Goins left GWR in September 1991.
The company said yesterday that it did not believe the indictment would have
any material effect on the bankruptcy proceedings of its coal subsidiaries
or the litigation with the public utility, South Carolina Public Services
Authority.
'If the allegations are correct,' a statement said, 'GWR and its coal
subsidiaries would have been victims of the alleged conspiracy and GWR will
deal with this in an appropriate manner.'
SCPSA had charged GWR's coal division, Mr Goins, and Mr Joe Norman, a former
employee of the utility, with conspiracy, fraud and unfair trade practices.
In a separate case, SCPSA is also disputing in court the validity of certain
coal contracts with GWR, which once represented more than 50 per cent of the
natural resource company's revenue. The US utility is withholding some
Dollars 33m in coal payments.
However, it was announced recently that the two companies have begun talks
with a view to settling out of court.

FT  16 JUN 92 / UK Company News: BET looking for a change of identity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BET, the business services company which reported a sharp fall in profits
yesterday, is going through a fundamental change of culture.
After five years in which the previous management made 170 acquisitions and
very little was spared on capital expenditure, Mr John Clark, chief
executive, is trying to turn what was, in effect, a financial holding
company into an operating company.
Unfortunately, the climate in which he is trying to perform this alchemy is
less than propitious. After a tough year in which it had to cut its total
dividend from 13.25p to 6.5p, barely covered by earnings, the economy is
unlikely to give very much help.
'While considerable progress has been made at BET . . . more work will be
needed over the next two years to . . . reposition BET as a dynamic growth
company,' Mr Clark said yesterday.
Operationally, BET's problems appear to be greatest in the UK where 57 per
cent of sales are derived. Operating profits fell to Pounds 70.8m (Pounds
185.4m), although on lower sales after the disposal of Biffa, the waste
management company.
Within the UK, plant services was badly hit by the recession which undercut
margins and volume and led to a halving of operating profits to Pounds
31.6m. Textile services fell from Pounds 84.5m to Pounds 52.8m, again with
most of the fall in the UK. Cleaning services fell marginally to Pounds 24m
as did security services to Pounds 15.3m while distribution services
performed well to fall only 4 per cent to Pounds 32.8m after a disposal.
BET's 'other' services, which include the personnel and joinery businesses,
fell from operating profits of Pounds 18m to a loss of Pounds 1.1m.
During the year Mr Clark said the company had focused on generating cash. It
had cut its cost base by Pounds 62m, shedding 20,000 staff, at a one-off
cost of Pounds 75m which was covered by previously established provisions.
'The importance of cash flow has been stamped on the culture of the company
during the year,' Mr Clark said. 'We have to get productivity gains to
offset inflation in order to retain as much as possible of that Pounds 62m.'
Mr Clark said BET would be cash generative over the next year and strongly
positive in the second half before taking into account the proceeds of
disposals.
During the year BET also sold 10 small under-performing companies, utilising
Pounds 8m of the Pounds 90m provision set up for the purpose at the interim
stage. Mr Clark expected more than Pounds 100m as proceeds of the sale of
other companies to be sold.
As part of the management and financial restructuring, BET has cut the
number of profit centres from 170, with an average sales level of Pounds
30m, to 110.
After little more than a year at the helm of BET, Mr Clark dismissed the
idea that business service companies were recession resistant, one of the
late 1980 theories that once held water.
'Until you have been through a full cycle you do not know if the business is
recession resistant,' he said.

Del Monte in US

<TEXT>
THE ADMINISTRATORS of Polly Peck International, the fruit and electronics
group which collapsed in October 1990, confirmed yesterday that they have
given up plans to float PPI Del Monte on the US stock exchange.
Instead the fresh fruit operation, purchased by Polly Peck in September 1989
for Dollars 875m (Pounds 557m), will be sold Several fruit distribution
companies confirmed yesterday that they may bid.
Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank is advising the Polly Peck
administrators on the sale.
The decision to sell PPI Del Monte ends almost two years of plans to float
the company on the US stock exchange and represents a serious blow to hopes
that Polly Peck creditors will be offered even the 20 per cent of their
money back which was being discussed a year ago.
PPI Del Monte was considered the only asset of the group capable of raising
a substantial amount of money.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte which handles the corporate finance side of the
administration yesterday said that the decision to go for a private sale
rather than a float reflected disappointing conditions in the international
banana market early this year.
Del Monte Foods International, which is itself preparing for a flotation, is
not connected with PPI Del Monte.

HAYTER BROCKBANK, the rapidly growing Lloyd's agency group which trades in
London on a matched bargain basis, is set for substantial expansion in 1993,
according to Mr Mark Brockbank, group managing underwriter.
Mr Brockbank made the prediction, as Hayter reported that all four of its
syndicates had made profits in the 1989 year.
Lloyd's is expected to make a loss equivalent to Pounds 2bn, or nearly 20
per cent of its capital base, when it reports its global results later this
month.
By contrast Hayter syndicates 253, 588, 861 and 929 all reported profits
ranging from 2.69 per cent to 8.95 per cent of premium income.
The group's capacity (the amount of premium income it can accept according
to Lloyd's rules) increased by 40 per cent for the 1992 year of account and
now stands at Pounds 245m.

FT  16 JUN 92 / E Midlands increases 41%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EAST Midlands Electricity, the first regional electricity company to
announce results for the year to March 31 1992, yesterday reported a 41 per
cent increase in historic cost pre-tax profits to Pounds 150m.
This was close to the 40 per cent average increase expected for the regional
companies, and coincided with a warning from Offer, the electricity industry
watchdog, that it would be watching the companies closely.
East Midlands earnings per share also rose 41 per cent to 50.1p, and the
dividend was up 13.7 per cent at 17.1p.
Turnover rose 16 per cent to Pounds 1.54bn, and operating profit was up 38
per cent at Pounds 157.5m. Nearly Pounds 150m of this was earned in the core
distribution business. The main reason for the high profit level, which was
anticipated by the City, was that prices to consumers rose 11 per cent in
April 1991.
The main surprise in the results was a Pounds 4.6m profit in the electricity
supply business, which is responsible for the bulk purchase and sale of
electricity. This was in spite of a sharp increase in 'uplift', a charge the
business pays to the pool, or electricity wholesale market, and it inspired
City confidence in the company's purchasing strategy. Before uplift, the
supply business made nearly Pounds 20m.
Meanwhile, costs throughout the company fell Pounds 5m, as 231 jobs were
lost over the year. The energy services businesses, acquired for Pounds 40m
during the year, did better than expected, making a modest operating profit
but a loss after financing costs.
The new generating business, which invests in power stations, made a Pounds
0.4m loss while the retail division made a small Pounds 1.3m operating
profit compared with Pounds 0.5m last year.
The outlook for the coming year is for modest growth in the main business.
Unit sales are likely to rise more than 1 per cent but below this year's 1.9
per cent. Costs will continue to fall, and the company has set aside Pounds
5.9m in provisions for further job losses. The energy services businesses
are expected to move into profit.
Analysts forecast pre-tax profits in a Pounds 160m-Pounds 175m range, giving
earnings per share of 55.0p to 59.0p. Dividends, Mr John Harris, chairman,
suggested, would be progressive, but were unlikely to increase as sharply as
this year. Analysts' dividend forecasts fall between 18.7p and 19.3p.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Waiting for the volume to increase: Shifts in technology in
the consumer electronics industry could see European manufacturers gain
advantage over their Japanese rivals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jacques D'Elfant, senior managing director of Philips consumer
electronics, last month gathered the staff of his newly estab-lished
European marketing, sales and service organisation in a sprawling warehouse
in Acht, Holland.
Surrounded by stacks of audio equipment Mr D'Elfant delivered a stark
message to his team on how the Dutch electronics group planned to regain the
initiative in the European market from its Japanese competitors.
'We are not fighting against the Japanese but against Frenchmen, Germans and
others who sell Japanese products,' he said. 'We know where we want to go so
we can start on this right away.'
A similar rallying call is being heard at other European consumer
electronics manufacturers as they brace themselves for another joyless year
in 1992.
Manufacturers expect the European consumer electronics market to be flat in
1992, following a meagre 1 per cent growth in sales last year from Ecu25.2bn
(Pounds 17.7bn) to Ecu25.4bn in 15 western European countries, according to
BIS Strategic Decisions, the high-technology consult-ancy.
Hopes that a recovery in leading European markets would lift demand for
colour TVs and hi-fi sets, after a virtual standstill in 1991, have been
replaced by a recognition that any pick-up in consumer activity this year
will, at best, be slow.
In the past few years, Europe's indigenous manufacturers have been battered
in their own markets by the onslaught of Far Eastern competitors.
Japanese manufacturers, in particular, have dominated important markets such
as for VCRs, CD players and camcorders and have eaten into the European
groups' market share of products, such as TVs, where the Europeans have
traditionally dominated.
Yet in spite of the gloomy near-term outlook, the European consumer
electronics industry is optimistic. The growing feeling is that the industry
is at a turning point which could work to the advantage of European
manufacturers.
While Japanese manufacturers are also suffering from the downturn in their
own market, shifts in technology, such as from analogue to digital and the
move to high-definition TV, could give European manufacturers a chance to
regain the initiative over Japanese competitors, at least in their own
markets.
'This kind of technology shift is always a major opportunity,' says Mr Jorma
Ollila, president of Nokia, the Finnish electronics group.
Wide-screen TV, and eventually high-definition TV, are seen to provide such
an opportunity. By the year 2000, one market study suggests that half the
retail value of colour TVs will be made up of wide-screen TVs.
The attraction of wide-screen TV to European manufacturers is that it is a
value-added product at the higher end of the market, offering larger profit
margins. Europe's top three manufacturers have launched wide-screen TV sets,
while Japanese manufacturers have yet to do so in Europe.
Meanwhile, with digital music cassettes, Philips has stolen a lead over Sony
(which has a competing format, MiniDisc) in its pre-launch publicity and in
signing up record companies to produce music on its own format.
In spite of recent setbacks, Europe's consumer electronics manufacturers
have been sustained by a pride in their ability to maintain a leading role
at least in the European market.
'Unlike the United States, Europe has never thrown in the towel in this
segment,' Thomson Consumer Electronics, the French state-owned company, says
in a report.
Philips and Thomson are still first and second in Europe in revenue terms
and the third and fourth largest consumer electronics groups in the world.
Nokia is the second-largest manufacturer of mobile phones after Motorola of
the US.
In colour television sales, Philips and Thomson still top the European
rankings followed by Grundig, the German group in which Philips has a large
stake, and Nokia. Sony, the Japanese group, is fourth, according to BIS.
European manufacturers also show greater confidence that they have
identified their weaknesses and introduced changes to strengthen their
position.
As profits have suffered recently, European manufacturers have been putting
their houses in order. Philips launched Project Centurion, its wide-ranging
internal restructuring programme.
Thomson took a restructuring provision of FFr1.5bn (Pounds 148.3m) last
year. Nokia, which depends on consumer electronics for 33 per cent of sales,
took a FM391m (Pounds 9.2m) provision largely to cover the costs of an
efficiency boosting programme in its consumer electronics business this
year.
'We are now in good shape, we have a very good product range, and are well
placed to compete with other manufacturers,' says Philips.
Although the industry practice of blaming difficulties on the Japanese has
not entirely died out, there is a greater willingness to address its own
weaknesses. For example, European manufacturers have been strengthening
their distribution, marketing, sales and services in recognition that
technology alone will not bring profits.
In the short-term, the benefits of the manufacturers' restructuring will be
substantial, particularly for Philips, says Mr Andrew Haskins, industry
analyst at James Capel.
Nokia, meanwhile, has forged ahead with its mobile phone activities and
recently won large contracts to supply the US and Japanese markets.
But in the long-term, a question mark remains over whether the Europeans
will be able to sustain any improvements in profitability that may come from
restructuring and a pick-up in demand.
They have ploughed vast sums into new products and into shaping up for the
recovery, which should bring at least short-term benefits, but the test for
European manufacturers may merely have been postponed.

FT  16 JUN 92 / County NatWest break-up begins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COUNTY NatWest, the ill-fated investment banking arm of National
Westminster, is to be broken up and its operations submerged within the
NatWest group, it emerged yesterday.
The move spells the end of NatWest's dream at the time of Big Bang six years
ago to create a free-standing, full-service investment bank. However,
NatWest said that County's operations would continue under the umbrella of
NatWest Markets, provided they could generate adequate profits.
The bank will decide before the year-end whether to keep parts of the
business in separate legal entities, or whether to bring it all on to
NatWest's own balance sheet.
Mr Derek Wanless, NatWest chief executive, said that the enlarged NatWest
Markets division would bring together all of the group's services for large
companies and institutional investment clients. The division will also
oversee lending to the group's 800 largest corporate customers around the
world.
By centralising all financial markets operations, NatWest hopes to make
considerable savings on back office activities. Mr Wanless said no decision
had yet been made on how many of the 1,500 back office staff would lose
their jobs, but he hoped the new division would expand and eventually create
new jobs.
NatWest Markets was set up in January this year. It is backed by Pounds 3bn
of the group's capital and employs 5,000 people. NatWest plans to promote
its branding strongly in the financial markets, while County will be reduced
to a secondary branding on some of its products. A decision will be made
over the next six months on whether to retain County as a brand name for
parts of NatWest's operations.
County's equities division, which has been the cause of its poor
performance, is to be run as a separate unit alongside NatWest's treasury
division.
Besides saving on costs, this will enable the group to make better use of
County's equity research unit, said Mr Martin Owen, who has been appointed
head of the enlarged markets division.
Other parts of County will remain under the direct control of Mr John Drury,
who will now report straight to Mr Owen.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Lotus axes loss-making Elan with 350 job cuts: Production of
sports car to end after just 2 1/2 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GROUP LOTUS, the UK sports car maker, is to cease production of its main
product, the Lotus Elan, in the face of heavy losses less than 2 1/2 years
after the car was launched.
The withdrawal from the small two-seater sports car market is expected to
lead to about 350 redundancies at the 507-strong Lotus Cars division
assembly plant at Hethel, Norfolk.
The company, which was acquired for Pounds 22.7m in 1986 by General Motors
of the US, blamed the failure of the Elan on 'the extraordinary combination
of adverse economic factors hitting our segment in key markets'.
However, the car's launch was delayed; it was priced well above its main
rivals, such as the Mazda MX-5; and the company never succeeded in producing
it at an acceptable cost.
It has also been hit hard by disappointing sales in the US, which accounted
for only 21 per cent of the 2,200 sales last year, compared with Lotus'
hopes for sales of more than 1,000.
Mr Adrian Palmer, managing director of Lotus Cars, said the Elan, which
sells in the UK for Pounds 20,135 to Pounds 22,720, was losing 'a great deal
of money' for each unit sold. Group Lotus has reported mounting losses in
recent years - from Pounds 2.1m in 1988 to Pounds 12.7m in 1990.
The early demise of the Elan, which was supposed to repeat the success of
the first Elan of the 1960s designed by Lotus founder Colin Chapman, will
make it one of the most short-lived new cars launched on the world market in
recent years.
Development of the car, which won a prestigious British Design Award last
year, was the cornerstone of the company's Pounds 54m five-year capital
spending programme to 1992 which included Pounds 32m to Pounds 34m for the
car operations with a new production plant for the Elan. The company said it
would seek a buyer for the Elan production line.
The car was supposed to help to quintuple Lotus car production to around
5,000 next year from a modest 788 in 1987, with Elan output rising to 3,000
annaully. Output peaked last year at 2,238 (including 2,060 Elans) but will
now fall back to a few hundred.
Mr Palmer said the company intended to concentrate its efforts on the much
more expensive Esprit, launched in 1976, which sells for Pounds 36,030 to
Pounds 47,790 and which Lotus intends to develop as 'a showcase technology
car'. 'The vast sums this car (the Elan) is losing mean I cannot invest in
the Esprit, which is a profitable car for us,' he said.
Lotus still had a successful engineering consultancy and the company would
have 'a satellite operation building a number of cars a year', he said.
The worldwide dealer network would have to shrink, but Mr Palmer said the
company would seek to continue to sell cars in all its markets.
GM was forced to pump Pounds 13m of new capital into the company last year
to bolster its subsidiary's sagging balance sheet, and the Group Lotus
finances have since deteriorated further.
Group Lotus expanded over-ambitiously for the launch of the new Elan in 1990
and then had to contract sharply in the face of recession and the car's
failure to meet sales targets.
Group Lotus said its engineering consultancy and its Millbrook,
Bedfordshire, proving-ground operations - with a combined workforce of 790 -
would not be affected. There is no formal connection between Group Lotus and
Team Lotus, the Formula One Grand Prix racing team.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Yeltsin appoints reformer as prime minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR YEGOR GAIDAR, who has led the reform process in Russia for the past six
months, was named prime minister yesterday in a surprise move underlining
President Boris Yeltsin's continued support for radical economic reform.
The announcement, made just before Mr Yeltsin flew to the US for talks on
arms cuts and economic aid, demonstrates the Russian president's concern to
reassure foreign governments and international financial institutions about
the pace of reform.
On his arrival in Washington, Mr Yeltsin promised 'a meaningful practical
dialogue' with the US. In contrast to the cool US attitude to Mr Yeltsin a
few years ago, President George Bush lavished praise on him in a TV
interview, describing him as a good and courageous man.
Government sources in Moscow, many of whom were unaware of Mr Gaidar's
appointment, said it had not been discussed at a cabinet meeting on
Thursday.
Mr Gaidar has established credibility with the International Monetary Fund
and with the main foreign governments as a consistent proponent of reform.
Yesterday's announcement buttresses his position.
Mr Yevgeny Yasin, the government's plenipotentiary to the Russian
parliament, said: 'It is obvious this appointment was considered to be a
higher priority, because of its international implications, than the
concerns of industry about the reform programme and the government's
management of the economy.'
Mr Yeltsin said only last week that a new prime minister would not be
appointed for some months and that he would continue to head the government
as well as be president.
Mr Gaidar's appointment still has to be approved by the Russian parliament,
where opinion is divided. Mr Yasin said it would be 'hard to get' a majority
for Mr Gaidar, while Mr Sergei Filativ, the parliament's deputy chairman,
welcomed the move.
In any event, it is unlikely to be settled before parliament breaks for
summer at the beginning of July. This would give Mr Gaidar more than two
months in which to establish his authority.
Mr Gennady Shipitko, a presidential spokesman, said that the post was a
'permanent one' and signified Mr Yeltsin's 'trust in the course of reforms
carried out by the Gaidar team'.
President Bush said he expected his summit meeting with Mr Yeltsin to go
well because of a 'comfortable personal chemistry' he had established with
the Russian leader.
But Mr James Baker, secretary of state, warned that the US and Russia had
still not settled their differences on a new agreement to cut nuclear
weapons. 'We have four or five problems, at least two of which are
extraordinarily difficult,' Mr Baker said.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Watchdog pledges curbs on excessive electricity profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 12 regional electricity companies of England and Wales will not be
allowed to make big profits at the expense of customers, the Office of
Electricity Regulation (Offer) said yesterday.
In a statement timed to coincide with the start of the companies' results
season, Prof Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, said consumers
were concerned by the average 40 per cent rise in profits expected from the
companies.
Miss Penny Boys, deputy director of Offer, said the statement aimed to
anticipate media criticism of these profits and reassure customers.
That did not deter Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's energy spokesman, from
criticising the 41 per cent rise in profits announced yesterday by East
Midlands Electricity. 'Never in the field of public utilities have so many
made such enormous profits for doing so little,' he said.
City analysts said Offer's statement simply reiterated its belief that the
companies must not reward shareholders at the expense of customers.
'There's nothing in it that causes me concern,' said Mr John Harris,
chairman and chief executive of East Midlands Electricity.
Mr Ken Harvey, chairman of Norweb, the regional company reporting results
tomorrow, said: 'Our price increases have been below the rate of inflation
for the last four to five years.'
Prof Littlechild sought to reassure customers that he would ensure the
companies were not making too much money, and were providing a good service.
But he also noted that the companies' large profits this year were due to a
technical blip. Electricity prices increased by about 11 per cent last year
as the companies compensated for undercharging in the previous year. They
had underestimated inflation, one of the factors in the formula governing
price rises.
These big increases will not be repeated next year, since prices rose by
about 2 per cent this April, the regulator said.
Miss Boys said Offer was likely to tighten the price formulae when it
reviews them in 1994 and 1995. It is also likely to include in the formulae
a historical inflation adjustment, rather than a forecast. This would help
to eliminate the swings in profits that occur when prices are to compensate
for inaccurate inflation forecasts.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Politics raises passions in riverbank rumpus: The
competition to develop London's County Hall is focusing on Whitehall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON and ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ever since Mr Ken Livingstone, the Greater London Council's last leader,
preached defiance at the Thatcher government from its roof, London's County
Hall has been a source of fierce controversy. It is now as acute as ever.
The Thames-side buildings are in the hands of a Japanese developer, but they
are keenly sought by the London School of Economics. The LSE wants to swap
them for its cramped site off Aldwych, and is pulling out all the stops to
get them.
The School has strong backing, and not just from a broad range of London
luminaries. A cross-party Commons motion to be tabled today calls on Mr
Michael Howard, the environment secretary, to delay the sale 'whilst full
and detailed consideration' is given to the LSE's proposal.
Its success will probably turn on the moods of two individuals, Prime
Minister John Major and Mr Takashi Shirayama, the Anglophile whose Shirayama
Shokusan company bought County Hall earlier this year. Mr Major returns from
the Earth Summit to find rumours swirling about his imminent intervention in
the deal, while Mr Shirayama, is increasingly frustrated by the political
controversy that came with the buildings.
The LSE's campaign against the Japanese purchase echoes painfully in Mr
Shirayama's ears. The chirpy 45-year-old Osaka businessman has a certain
sympathy for the institution, but not for its argument that the site's fate
should be determined by non-financial considerations. Of particular concern
to Mr Shirayama are the persistent whispers that he is another
got-rich-quick Japanese speculator who may not have the resources to develop
the site. He wants it to be known that he is an eighth-generation Shirayama,
that his family's wealth resides in extensive land holdings in the Osaka
area, that he is of modest taste and does not regard County Hall as anything
more than a sound business venture.
'I am not obsessed by money, but the County Hall project should be
commercially viable and the LSE proposal is not. We have chosen British
architects who will make a realistic plan, and we are very aware of the
concerns about the building's heritage,' said Mr Shirayama, who admires
Arnold Toynbee and Shakespeare.
Professing a deep love of things British and American is not, however,
enough to ward off the LSE, which argues that County Hall is a public
building which should be employed for more vital national purposes than the
hotel, shops, convention space, sports club and disco complex that Mr
Shirayama has in mind.
Dr John Ashworth, the LSE's ebullient director, has spent the last 18 months
campaigning to move the School, Britain's foremost social science
university. He is not solely concerned with raising the LSE's profile and
prestige: the extra space available at County Hall would, he says, make an
ideal base for outside bodies to rent for applied research - embracing
everything from City analysts to highly specialised research institutes. The
net cost of the LSE scheme - after refurbishment and disposal of the
School's present site - is set at around Pounds 60m.
'There could be no more appropriate use for County Hall,' says Dr Ashworth.
'All we are asking is for the government to take a broad view of the issue -
and not to determine the future of this prize national asset on the basis of
a one-off financial gain.'
The vision is appealing but it has yet to inspire a change of mind at the
London Residuary Body (LRB), the quango charged with disposing of the assets
of the Greater London Council and the Inner London Education Authority,
which occupied County Hall until its abolition in 1990.
In purely financial terms, the Shirayama offer - estimated at a net Pounds
50m to Pounds 60m - is too good for the LRB to refuse. The LRB is legally
obliged to obtain the best price possible in its asset sales, unless
otherwise directed by the environment secretary. But the deal, signed in
March, is not yet done, as the contract has an escape clause that allows the
government to change its mind before the year is out, subject to a penalty
fee which rises the later it is invoked.
In the House of Lords last week a government spokesman pledged to 'weigh
very carefully' the LSE's case. Ministers are reportedly divided on the
matter. Mr Michael Heseltine's departure from the environment department is
a plus for the LSE: Mr Michael Howard is thought to be more open-minded,
with positive enthusiasm for the LSE from sections of the employment and
education departments. The Treasury, though, is none too keen on the
projected cost of transferring the LSE, and the climate surrounding public
spending claims by ministries could hardly be more hostile. The environment
department's current line is that responsibility remains with the LRB - and
that it will unpick the Japanese deal only after the LRB asks it to do so.
Given the divisions in the cabinet, Mr Major's personal intervention will be
needed to get the LSE across the Thames. The prime minister's scepticism
about the value of academic qualifications is renowned; but the LSE is
convinced he can be won over.
In any event, a review of the decision would involve a closer look at Mr
Shirayama. This may, however, prove difficult. His insistence on privacy has
meant that he is little known outside Osaka, even though he came 20th on the
list of individual Japanese taxpayers last year, having given over Y1.1bn
(Pounds 4.7m) to the government.
There are no accurate estimates of his total wealth. He claims ownership of
70,000 tsubo (about 231,000 square metres) in the Osaka area, and has the
McDonald's franchise in the region, oil and liquor distribution businesses,
and a chain of sports clubs.
Under his guidance, Shirayama Shokusan has ventured abroad, buying a Madrid
hotel, the Villa Magna, for Pounds 48m in 1989 and investing Dollars 70m in
a Pacific resort near Guam. These investments were the first overseas
ventures by the company since the pre-war period, when some of the family
fortune was lost in Manchurian industrial projects.
The financial basis of the company seems, however, to be secure. In Japan,
Mr Shirayama escaped the worst effects of the recent sharp falls in Japanese
asset prices by selling his Tokyo stock investments four years ago. His
disposal were prompted by a Bank of Japan report warning of the dangers of
rapid appreciation in real estate and share prices. 'I was influenced by
that report. Now I keep all of my money in the bank. I am not interested in
buying stocks again,' Mr Shirayama said.
An official at the Osaka Chamber of Commerce who has attended meetings with
Mr Shirayama said that he has a reputation as a modest and likeable
individual: 'He is regarded as a very clean businessman. He's not one of
these gang types or someone who made a lot of money from speculation. He's
very solid.'
Mr Shirayama remains confident about County Hall's commercial prospects, in
spite of the property problems down river at Canary Wharf. But he is
concerned by the gathering political clouds over his purchase. 'I want
nothing to do with the politics,' he pleads.
No such disclaimer issues from Dr Ashworth, who recognises that politics,
and politics alone, will determine County Hall's future.

Whatever official dates John Major may have to keep as prime minister, he is

Inhabitants of the Castilian village of Candeleda have no doubt that he will

The recipient of this miraculous piece of news is reliably reported to be

GPA's complaint to the European Commission that the membership rules of the
FT-SE 100 Index discriminate against Irish companies raises the intriguing
possibility of a head-on confrontation between past and present competition
commissioners.
Peter Sutherland, Brussels' competition watchdog until 1988, is now a
non-executive director of the aircraft leasing company and chairman of AIB
Group, another Irish company piqued by the FT-SE 100 steering committee's
policy. And if that is not enough EC competition clout to be going on with,
Sutherland's 'chef de cabinet' in Brussels, Richard O'Toole, also now works
for GPA as its official Irish mouthpiece.
Sir Leon Brittan, the current commissioner, has nothing but praise for
Sutherland's work in Brussels, but if he decides to take sides against his
predecessor he may find himself accused of 'trying to defend the
indefensible'. That was the charge Sutherland levelled at Peter Jones, the
index steering committee's chairman, in a letter to the FT in April.

Offers are already landing on Slobodan Milosevic's desk just in case the
Serbian president could be persuaded to step down.
US congresswoman Helen Bentley saw the president in Belgrade recently and
suggested he could become head of a US-Belgrade bank. He could perhaps even
move to the US if he was getting a bit fed up with his policies which led to
war in Croatia, and later in Bosnia. The president, we hear, has refused.
But stranger things have happened.
After all, back in the early 1980s, Milosevic ran Beobanka, the Belgrade
bank, and had lots of friends in the US, including deputy secretary of
state, Lawrence Eagleburger, and Brent Scowcroft. Both, incidentally, served
time in the US embassy in Belgrade. Maybe that helps explain why the US was
slow to come down hard on Milosevic.

A strong sense of deja vu at the Stock Exchange. Chief executive Peter
Rawlins spoke yesterday of the 'very considerable progress' made in the past
12 months on building Taurus (the new settlement system) and developing new
market trading mechanisms.
This time last year he said much the same. Indeed, it seemed then that
Taurus would have been launched by now, and the new market would have been
created. To the outside world, not much has changed.
Will Rawlins still be there, making optimistic projections, next year? With
the Exchange's redevelopment plans seemingly endlessly stalled, it gets
increasingly difficult to find people willing to back him. Rawlins has
always said that he needs to run fast to keep ahead of the arrows aimed at
his back. The pace is getting faster all the time.

Journalists are not the only craftsmen sharpening knives ahead of the US

The dolls are a version of the 'Randy Indian', a souvenir which tickled the

saucy memento - which give a whole new meaning to the term 'pop-up' - got
more mileage in the US press than the rest of his Latin American tour.
'I am getting several orders from delegates to the Democratic convention,'
says Steve Anderson, a US businessman living in Chile. 'But I think they
will also be popular among Republican delegates in the Pat Buchanan camp.'
Despite recent allegations about the Democratic front-runner's past,
Anderson has no intention of marketing a Bill Clinton version; he is working

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The speed with which portfolios and titles are changing hands at the top of
National Westminster Bank is such that no one should be surprised that
Martin Owen, the man from the Salvation Army with a PhD in business
administration, should beat NatWest veteran Roger Byatt for the plum job of
running NatWest Markets. NatWest chairman Lord Alexander seems determined to
give his forty-somethings their head and long service in the bank seems more
of a liability than an asset these days.
Owen, who has done everything from setting up and selling his own financial
services business to supervising dodgy banks in the Isle of Man, certainly
has a much broader range of experience than the typical NatWest banker. Even
so, the pace of his promotion since joining NatWest is unusual. It is the
sort of appointment that Midland Bank used to make when it was struggling to
find its feet a few years ago. Owen may well turn out to be an excellent
choice but one wonders what sort of signal his appointment is sending to
anyone in NatWest who is approaching 50 and has not been mentioned in
dispatches recently.

FT  16 JUN 92 / The right to sue Mr Rat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Andrew Toad has every right to publish extracts from Mr Andrew
Rattlesnake's book about Princess Diana. Mr Rupert Rat breaks no law when he
profits from the croakings and slitherings of his employees. They are all
exercising - I nearly said exploiting - the freedom of the press. They have
every right to do so.
The law should not be changed to prevent this. The First Amendment to the
constitution of the United States is a model for us all. I would go further.
Sooner or later Britain's parliament must pass a Freedom of Information Act.
Mr John Major's strategy, which is to release almost as much information as
would such an act, while maintaining control over the process, is likely to
turn out to be an inadequate substitute. The Civil Service will almost
certainly make it so.
What is required right now, however, is a law to protect individual privacy.
As it says in Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights:
'Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home
and his correspondence.' The new law should not prevent publication. That
would be censorship. It should, however, enable any citizen who is treated
as the princess has been to sue, sue and sue again - and, with luck, to win
the kind of damages that would have Messrs Toad, Rattlesnake and Rat crying
all the way from the bank. The US courts have established the tort of
intrusion into an individual's privacy. Canada, France, Germany, Denmark and
the Netherlands have privacy laws. Parliament should set the ball rolling in
Britain's courts.
The minister in charge of deciding whether it will do so is Mr David Mellor,
the secretary for the national heritage. When he was a junior minister at
the home office a couple of years ago he said that the press was drinking in
'last-chance saloon'. His implication was plain. The excesses of the
tabloids had to cease, or parliament would curb them. After the Calcutt
committee on privacy reported in June 1990, everything was put on hold while
the newspapers tried self-regulation. What has transpired has been more like
self-abuse.
Yet Mr Mellor faces a delicate problem of balance. People have been upset by
the tales told about Princess Diana. If false, they are libellous. If true,
they are unacceptably intrusive. Against that there is the government's debt
to the Tory tabloids for their support during the recent general election.
Messrs Cockroach, Scorpion, Weasel and Viper were indefatigable in their
efforts to misrepresent Labour policy. Can these distinguished gentlemen,
some of them knights, now be denied their reward? May they not continue to
enjoy the unfettered right to tear the heart out of any individual, high or
low, in the name of a spurious public interest? Mr Mellor, who has not
always been written up to his own complete satisfaction, will doubtless
deliberate with care before advising the prime minister.
He should think thrice before accepting the Calcutt recommendation that
media intrusion into private property without consent, and for the purpose
of obtaining personal information, should become a criminal offence. It
might create martyrs for the wrong cause. Sir Louis Blom-Cooper QC,
Justinian of the FT, favours a tort of 'unwarranted invasion of privacy',
subject to a public interest defence. The courts could build on that. Mr
Mellor should also consider the rifle-shot strategy propounded by Mr
Geoffrey Robertson QC, a media expert. Specific documents, such as hospital
records or stolen documents containing intimate personal details, would be
protected. Following the US precedent you could sue doorsteppers armed with
cameras and notebooks for 'watching and besetting' your home.
It may be that none of this would help the princess. If the royal refusal to
go to court were to persist, the law of privacy that I favour would not
protect them. If the Prince of Wales or his wife did sue under such an act
they would come up against a public interest defence, which a jury might
accept.
I have no knowledge of whether the princess has tried her utmost to prevent
her friends from spreading information about her, or whether she has
acquiesced in their co-operation with the author. If she has acquiesced,
Messrs Toad and Rattlesnake would have nothing to fear from a privacy law.
Yet I believe that even royals should have a chance to sue the socks off any
Brute of The Beast who unjustifiably intrudes upon their private lives.
Iago, who would have made an excellent tabloid editor, tells us that the
theft of one's good name is the greatest of all. The law of libel prevents
such an outrage if the allegations are untrue. But purveyors of true
intimate personal details break into the lives of their victims and steal
their privacy. Only a genuine public interest can excuse such behaviour. The
law should enable juries to determine where the public interest lies.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
When President Boris Yeltsin and President George Bush meet in Washington
today for their first formal summit, their talks will be a far cry from the
tense, superpower summitry of the Cold war.
Mr Mikhail Gorbachev used to come to Washington to give up his malign
inheritance - arms, imperial control and domestic oppression. Now, Mr
Yeltsin, the closest there is to his successor, comes to ask for aid to
build a foundation for a free Russia. 'I do not come to Washington with hand
stretched out,' he told the Izvestia newspaper last week: but in fact, he
must.
There is little that Mr Bush can do to fulfil Mr Yeltsin's expectations in
the economic arena, but the meeting may provide a useful dress rehearsal for
the summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations in Munich next
month. Ironically, the most visible achievement of the summit may be that
the two leaders will agree on further cuts - perhaps radical ones - in their
respective arsenals of strategic nuclear weapons, a more traditional focus
for Cold war meetings.
The evaporation of superpower hostility, however, has robbed disarmament of
some of its urgency. Economic relations have replaced security at the heart
of this summit, and both presidents need to demonstrate that they have
formed a new partnership capable of addressing the formidable challenge of
integrating the former Soviet republics into the global economy.
Mr Yeltsin needs western support to make the shift to a market economy and
for political stability. Mr Bush, for his part, needs to demonstrate in the
field of foreign affairs the leadership which few believe he has shown on
the domestic stage. Opinion polls show that foreign affairs are still Mr
Bush's strongest suit with voters and represent one of his best hopes for
turning his lacklustre re-election campaign.
Neither side, however, can boast that it has lived up to the bargain sealed
only a few months ago, when Russia seemed embarked on a headlong rush to
capitalism and democracy, with a Dollars 24bn package of western aid to ease
the transition.
Mr Yeltsin, hindered by the Russian parliament, has made slow progress at
putting together and implementing economic reforms. He has also disappointed
the west by his hesitancy over dismantling the Soviet war machine.
Mr Bush has found it no easier to get his own legislature to do his will.
Many congressmen are embarrassed by their failure to act on Mr Bush's
Russian aid bill, and Mr Bush shares in that embarrassment because so far
his efforts on its behalf have been lukewarm.
Mr Yeltsin's shopping list for the summit has already been advertised. He
wants access as soon as possible to the Dollars 24bn package put together by
the G7 and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) - and beyond that, as he
told Izvestia, to the private investment which he hopes will come once a
programme to execute reforms has been agreed with the IMF. He wants a
five-year moratorium on Russia's hard currency debt of more than Dollars
80bn, more than Dollars 60bn owed to western countries. He wants an end to
the rules which prohibit certain high-technology exports to Russia.
While Mr Yeltsin will make these demands in Washington, his real audience is
the G7 leaders in Munich. They alone can unlock the Dollars 24bn package.
But the summit does give Mr Yeltsin the chance to convince doubters in the
west that Russia is worth supporting now. Foreign leaders feel unsure, not
because they have ceased to believe that the cause of political and economic
reform in the former Soviet Union is of the first importance - but because
they worry that there is insufficient preparation for funds to be used
properly.
Mr Yeltsin last week explained that the introduction of ministers with
industrial backgrounds into the government did not mean that the reform
effort under Mr Yegor Gaidar, now prime minister, was blunted; that his
refusal to free oil prices as the IMF had wished was a decision taken to
preserve social peace; and that 'I will not allow deviations from reforms .
. . I do not give in to pressure.'
He, has, though, some more explaining to do. The privatisation programme has
been delayed and has, in any case, been tiny; nor has a privatisation code
been approved although Mr Yeltsin last week said that he would 'bring a
surprise to the US'.
The Russian parliament, however, continues to thwart the president and to
stall on privatisation. Last week it also indicated it would seek to pass a
law cutting value added tax - the main source of government revenue - from
28 per cent to 14 per cent, and on some items, to 7 per cent. There is as
yet no firm inter-republican agreement on currency and interest rates, which
means that Russia is printing a currency - the rouble - for all the other 14
former Soviet states, with only limited control over it.
Mr Yeltsin remains a reformer. But, although he is unchallenged by any
serious contender, he is not surrounded by people of a like mind. He must
placate an industrial lobby of growing power and frustration if he wants to
keep production going and avoid strikes. He cannot alienate his military,
and he cannot wholly ignore his parliament. He has, for much of this year,
used his popularity to support a government which raised prices, but has
drawn back from pushing on with reform which would also raise unemployment.
But the Russian parliament has little incentive to implement reforms so long
as the US fails to pass the legislation for its own share of the G7 package.
The grandly titled Freedom Support Act is a repackaged hodgepodge of
legislation, most of which had been already proposed by the Bush
administration in different forms. It includes the repeal of restrictions on
trade with the Soviet Union and measures to expand contact between the US
and Russia through organisations such as the Peace Corps. Its core, however,
is a renewed attempt to win congressional approval for the US's Dollars 12bn
share of a Dollars 60bn capital increase for the IMF. This increase is not
in itself directly linked to Russia but, without it, the IMF will soon run
short of money to carry out its plans both in Russia and elsewhere.
When the act was launched in April there seemed to be a groundswell of
feeling in Congress that aid for Russia was important enough for members to
swallow their traditional reluctance to vote on foreign aid in an election
year.
The Los Angeles riots may have slammed shut this window of opportunity by
shifting political attention back to domestic issues, and some congressmen
blame Mr Bush for not pushing it open again. Wherever blame lies, Mr James
Billington, the librarian of Congress and an expert on Russian history,
calls the US response to the crisis in Russia 'hesitant in tone, trivial in
content, humiliating in impact'.
According to this analysis the US is treating Russia merely as an economic
supplicant, like other developing countries, rather than as a still potent
superpower. In spite of its floundering reform programme and the apparent
quenching of its military ambitions it retains a mighty nuclear arsenal and
an entrenched military establishment which continues to wield influence.
Russian troops are still engaged beyond their frontiers in sporadic
hostilities with the Moldovan forces in the TransDnestr areas, and show no
signs of being withdrawn, in spite of Mr Yeltsin's promise that they would
be. Nor is there any agreement to pull Russian troops out of the Baltic
states - though, again, Mr Yeltsin has promised Mr Vytautas Landsbergis, the
Lithuanian president, that they would come out soon.
The west has made little public complaint over the lack of withdrawal so
far: but it cannot remain indifferent to the continued stationing of Russian
forces on foreign territory against the wishes of the host country.
Mr Yeltsin has stressed that the army is under his control. He says it is
'close to us' and that 'another coup like that of August is impossible'. The
possibility of a rebellious military has not appeared to US and Russian arms
negotiators to be sufficiently imminent to lend any urgency to cutting their
nuclear arsenals beyond the levels agreed last year in the Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty (Start).
Mr Bush has proposed cuts that would bring each side down to 4,700 warheads
and eliminate intercontinental ballistic missiles with multiple warheads, or
Mirved ICBMs. The US administration views these weapons as destabilising,
because of the tempting target they make for an opponent considering a first
nuclear strike, and the parallel temptation for their owner to launch them
quickly to pre-empt just such a strike.
The problem for Mr Yeltsin is that Mirved ICBMs such as the 10-warhead SS-18
make up about 60 per cent of his nuclear force. Mr Jack Mendelsohn, deputy
director of the Arms Control Association, a Washington group which studies
disarmament issues, says that the elimination of these weapons would leave
Russia short of the 4,700 warhead force Mr Bush has proposed.
Mr Yeltsin, therefore, wants a reciprocal reduction in the US's
submarine-launched Trident missiles, carrying 3,456 warheads after Start.
American conservatives, such as Mr Douglas Seay of the Heritage Foundation,
a Washington-based think tank, argue that the Russian demand is based on an
outdated insistence on nuclear parity. 'The US is not a threat to Russia and
does not need to be defended against, any more than Britain or Japan need to
protect themselves against America,' he said last week.
Both sides seem anxious for an arms agreement but, however significant, this
would be the icing on the summit. Its centre will be the political embrace
between the two presidents, whose personal relationship has until now been
frosty, and the economic partnership they could build between their
countries.
Mr Bush has the opportunity to don the statesman's mantle and demonstrate
his own and his country's leadership in the task of anchoring Russia to the
international community.
Mr Yeltsin, though he hates the role, must play the junior partner. In
Washington, and again in Munich, he must convince his western counterparts
that he is serious about reform, if he wants his demands to be met.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Arts: Monumental Moore in Paris - Sculpture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We have come to the point with Henry Moore at which - save for the emergence
of a lost or unknown early work, some discovery in the documentation, or
some revelation in the personal or professional life - we no longer look
forward to any real surprises. The work is known, the oeuvre complete. But
that is not to say that its further study and display are beside the point.
Indeed its fresh and frequent presentation is, if anything, now more to the
point than ever, for the insights and ideas that follow upon each new
selection and circumstance.
The last big Moore exhibition in France was the full retrospective held in
Paris in 1977 , at the Orangerie and along the formal terraces of the
Tuileries Gardens. Now comes a quite different exercise: where before rather
more than 200 works were shown, with the greater portion indoors, now we are
offered a mere 27 in an exhibition conceived entirely for the open air.
Where before the few works shown out-of-doors were set out en serie along
the high, formal terraces beside the Orangerie, in sensible acceptance of
the local opportunity, now we have a display considered closely from the
start for the matching of each particular work to its proper place.
The gardens of the Chateau de Bagatelle, tucked away on the far side of the
Bois de Boulogne, are one of the true Parisian's best-kept secrets, awkward
of access save by car or taxi. They are well worth the trouble, even should
you suffer the thunder and lightning that marked my own first visit last
week. Indeed the drama of the storm was no small bonus, once the rain had
stopped, with the skies still black and yet the trees and lawns bright in
the evening sun that threw each sculpture in turn into a sharp and high
relief.
The Bagatelle itself presents an intriguing mixture of French and British
taste in garden design and architecture, the chateau an enchanting pavilion
put up in 64 days by Beranger for the Comte d'Artois, sister-in-law of Marie
Antoinette, the park and gardens laid out in their present form largely by a
later owner, Sir Richard Wallace of the Wallace Collection in London. On the
one hand are formal terraces, and parterres and rose gardens, on the other
the park, with its wide lawns, its trees and pools and sudden vistas, a
landscape natural yet controlled, so very much in the English manner.
Mixture yes, but hardly conflict, and while the rose garden, spectacular as
it is, may be a shade too ordered in its profusion for English eyes, and the
one part into which Moore does not intrude, for the rest he is perfectly at
home. The Family Group of 1949 and the earliest work in the show, closes off
one end of the central walk of the sunken garden, the high wall to one side
a cascade of clematis. At once the smallest and yet as truly monumental as
any work being shown, it could hardly have been enthroned more
sympathetically. The essential adaptability of Moore's work - here an
enclosed and intimate monumentality - is not least of the points it makes.
The unspoken theme of the show is indeed that quality of the monument, most
clearly evident in the later bronzes, when Moore was at last able to amplify
the work to whatever size he wanted. It was always his belief that true
scale was inherent, that any sculpture would work at any size if it was
properly resolved within itself. And so it is that the show is limited to
the bronzes of Moore's mature career, from that Family Group, still on a
directly human scale, to the massive pieces of his extreme old age, made
under his direction but the tiny original maquette his only direct
engagement.
They are set out for the most part so that each should be seen alone,
without distraction or immediate cross-reference to a neighbour, with the
visitor led naturally on by the glimpse of another, just caught through a
gap in the bushes or away through the trees. And that placement is so
beautifully judged that there is no sense of intrusion, even by the largest
piece in the middle of a lawn, the installation so cleverly done by the
carriers, Momart, that it might almost have all been there for ever.
The odd and unexpected effect is that Moore gives quite as much back as he
receives, his work informing and celebrating the gardens as they, too,
celebrate it. There is no conflict, and it seems even a little hard that
after only a summer the show must come down. The City of Paris, the
Bagatelle, the British Council and the Henry Moore Foundation are all to be
congratulated for so imaginative a collaboration and so special a treat.
Meanwhile, back in Paris, Henry Moore Intime may be quite separate an
exhibition, but is, even so, a natural and happy pendant. Moore's daughter,
Mary, has contrived an extraordinary documentary display not simply of his
remarkable personal collection, that ranges from ancient Egypt and the
pre-Columbian to Rodin and Cezanne, Degas and Seurat, but also of the
furniture of his domestic life, his books in their bookcases, his trophies
and souvenirs, chairs and tables, all set up as it was at home. Done with an
admirable discretion, it is a touching act of filial piety and a still
potent evocation of a personal presence.

Alsthom; Shell France; British Steel; British Airways; ICI en France;

FT  16 JUN 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Danger of building on
false premises - Planning applications can be costly and time consuming.
Charles Batchelor looks at how to avoid the pitfalls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Robinsons Plastics, a southern company,* had been quite happily working from
its premises for more than a decade.
Part of the building which it used for office space was officially
designated as being for residential use but this had never bothered the
local planning authority.
It was only when a spate of accidents, not involving the company's vehicles,
made parking an issue with local residents that questions were raised about
where the company parked its vans.
In the course of the controversy, it became publicly known that the company
did not have planning permission for its offices and the balloon went up.
The company applied for a change from residential to office use. Planning
officials agreed but the local council's planning committee turned the
application down because, it said, there was not enough parking space. The
company, which has turnover of about Pounds 2m, is now appealing against the
decision.
'Unless it is overturned, we will have no choice but to relocate,' says the
general manager. But the cost of moving and the possible disruption would
have a serious impact on the business.
Robinsons Plastics is not alone in finding Britain's planning system costly
and confusing.
'Small businesses feel they don't have the opportunity to put their case
across properly,' says David Harrop for the Forum of Private Business. 'The
planners do not always understand the needs of small business.'
Not only do smaller firms lack the resources of large companies, they rarely
have the chance to build up any experience of dealing with planners.
'The small company only considers planning issues in times of crisis, when
they need to expand or to move,' says Rory Joyce for the Royal Institution
of Chartered Surveyors.
'Often, the first time they know they have done something which needs
planning permission is when they are faced with an enforcement action,
compelling them to put something right,' he says.
Small businesses also feel themselves to be victims of a planning system
which is tilted in favour of larger, wealthier companies.
'Large supermarkets can afford to come back with revised applications which
the local authority cannot afford to oppose,' says Bill Franklin, chairman
of the Sheffield chamber of trade.
'This is cheque book planning which is changing the character of our city
centres.'
If a large supermarket opens near a parade of smaller shops, there is little
the small retailer can do apart business rates, says Stephen Alambritis,
lobbyist for the Federation of Small Businesses.
If a landlord owns a large swathe of the shopping area, the retailer may be
able to argue for a clause in his lease excluding other shops in the same
sector from setting up nearby.
This clash of interests between small retailers and the large out-of-town
superstores has been the focus of much small firms' discontent about the
planning system in recent years. Signs that there is now a large oversupply
of out-of-town retailing space is, however, now leading to a swing back in
favour of the smaller outlets.
Another source of conflict has been the position of people running a
business from home.
'The rules are not particularly clear and different local authorities take
differing views,' says Martin Anscombe, chairman of the legislation and
local government committee of the National Chamber of Trade.
Hairdressing, dress-making and music teaching normally present no problems,
provided they do not lead to a large increase in traffic or the number of
people calling, but other businesses may cause problems.
So what can small businesses do to improve their influence in the planning
process? Planning specialists suggest they:
Join a local business organisation such as chamber of trade or commerce
which can lobby for small traders' interests and spread the financial burden
of opposing planning applications and fighting appeals, suggests Anscombe.
Study the workings of the planning process. The Department of the
Environment publishes a Step by Step Guide to Planning Permission for Small
Businesses** and a revised version to take account of the latest
developments is planned shortly.
Call in a professional: a surveyor or an architect with experience of
planning procedures. A surveyor will be less well equipped to design a
building than an architect if that is what is required but both sets of
professionals should be well versed in the intricacies of the planning
process.
Fees will normally be charged on a time-basis and will rise with the
seniority of the person handling the case.
There will also be a fee to pay to the local authority to make a planning
submission, rising from Pounds 55 for domestic extensions to Pounds 5,520
for a large building development.
If a planning application goes to appeal, then costs can rise sharply
because legal advice will probably be needed.
Despite the widespread belief among small businesses that the planning
system is both archaic and hostile to their interests, it is undergoing
considerable change. An important thrust of these efforts is to make the
system more responsive to small firms.
A revised set of guidelines for planning officers on how to deal with
industry, commerce and small businesses is being prepared by the Department
of Environment.
In a draft of its revised Policy Guidance Note Number Four, the department
urges special consideration for small businesses because uncertainty may
'threaten their growth or existence'.
Instead of refusing an application outright, councils should impose
conditions if appropriate.
Speculative builders who frequently build premises used by small firms
should not be discriminated against simply because they do not know who the
future occupants of the premises will be, it urges.
The deregulation unit of the Department of Trade and Industry has been
studying the mass of regulations affecting business which are policed by
local authorities.
It will later this month announce details of a partnership programme aimed
at streamlining procedures in the areas of planning, trading standards and
health and safety.
A Confederation of British Industry (CBI) task force has been set up to
investigate how to improve the planning system. It will present its report
to the CBI annual conference in November.
Finally, local authorities across the country are drawing up development
plans which will set down guidelines for the way their areas will evolve
over the next decade. The aim of these plans is to give councils greater
strategic control over developments.
A potential weakness of these plans is that they will rapidly become out of
date and they may be used by local authorities to refuse developments which
are not specifically mentioned in the plan, says Marco Torquati, senior
policy executive at the Association of British Chambers of Commerce.
But provided that business takes a part in the shaping of the plan and knows
what policies the local authority is pursuing, the plans should provide more
certainty for businesses.
Planning issues can be complex and, because they frequently involve the
reconciliation of conflicting demands, highly charged. But with careful
preparation and, where necessary, the use of professional advice, much of
the mystery can be removed.

A DISCUSSION WITH YOUR PLANNING OFFICER CAN SAVE TIME AND TROUBLE
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
You should:
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Describe your proposals and show him your plans
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ask for his assessment of whether there seems a reasonable chance of
  getting permission and, if not, what alternative approach he would
  advise
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ask his advice on site problems such as roads, footpaths, power cables,
  watercourses, sewers, telephone lines or toxic chemicals
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Discuss possible problems such as noise and traffic and the extent to
  which the council might impose conditions on their approval. Ask
  yourself if these will affect the viability of your proposed
  development
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ask whether site notices or advertisement of your proposals will be
  necessary
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Find out the timetable for future committee meetings. Getting your
  application in a day or two earlier might gain you three or four weeks
  if it means your proposals get onto the agenda of an earlier committee
  meeting

The British venture capital industry produces voluminous statistics about
its activities but has not until now published the numbers that most
interest its investors: those which show the returns on its investments.
Faced with increasing pressure from the institutions which have had to
accept disappointing returns, the British Venture Capital Association is to
carry out a pilot study to gather performance statistics.
The association will gather information on individual investments by six
members to see whether a pattern emerges from investments made in a
particular year or type of deal. It may also look at the returns from
investments by industry.
The data will not be used to compare the performance of different venture
capital funds however, a prospect which worries many venture capitalists.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Conservatives rest on election
laurels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER two months of dispassionate analysis, the Tory party came to the
spectacular conclusion yesterday that its general election victory was 'a
ringing endorsement of its principles and policies', Ralph Atkins writes.
The official party version of events leading up to April 9 lays to rest any
suggestion that the Conservative victory might have been a lucky escape - or
even the product of Labour's shortcomings.
Campaign managers, who at the time faced a barrage of complaints about
lacklustre tactics and sweeping mid-campaign strategy, have been vindicated.
'I don't think there is any criticism in it,' said a party spokesman.
The Conservative research department, which compiled the paper, is prepared,
however, to offer lessons aplenty to Labour. Indeed its criticism of the
Opposition's 'damaging and discredited' economic policies and identity with
'narrow and shrinking' political interests dominates the report - from the
shadow Budget at the beginning of the campaign to Mr Neil Kinnock's
'ungracious speech' after the results.
'Labour's position is grave,' the report adds helpfully.
In contrast, Mr John Major has a 'winning style'.
When accused of perhaps a slight bias, Tory party officials confirmed the
report was but one of many campaign 'feed-back' studies prepared by senior
Tories. The others will not, however, be published.

BRITAIN will earmark Pounds 100m for environmental spending over a number of

He admitted, however, that the timescale over which the money would be made
available was indefinite and depended on when the fund - used by the World
Bank and the United Nations to help developing countries to finance
'environmentally friendly' projects - required it.
Reporting back on his return from the Earth Summit in Rio, Mr Major said it
was a 'milestone' while acknowledging that the results had not gone 'as far
as some would wish'.
He said that Britain itself could have 'gone further' on climate change than
the convention provides. Without the intervention of his ministerial
colleagues, however, 'there might not have been a climate convention to
sign'.
He said he had proposed an 'action plan' to other heads of government.
Mr Roy Hattersley, Labour deputy leader, asked Mr Major to use Britain's
'special relationship' with the US to urge President George Bush to sign the
biodiversity agreement.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: MPs stage boundary bill revolt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT 20 Labour back-benchers staged a revolt last night by joining Liberal
Democrat MPs in voting against the bill seeking to ensure that changes in
the boundaries of constituencies are implemented before the next general
election, Ivor Owen writes.
Mr Roy Hattersley, Labour's deputy leader, rejected allegations that the
Boundary Comissions Bill would enable the Tory party to secure between 10
and 20 extra seats. He said it would be wrong to vote against the second
reading.
Labour leaders abstained when the bill was given a second reading by a
government majority of 246 (290-44).
One of the most vociferous of the Labour rebels, Mr Tony Banks, MP for
Newham North West, said the measure should be called the 'Save The Tory
Party at the Next Election Bill'.
Mr Hattersley said he did not believe the bill would damage the Labour party
in the way suggested.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, said the bill set a deadline of December
31 1994 for the completion of reviews of the 651 constituencies by the
Boundary Commission.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Kinnock quits contest for European
job
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NEIL KINNOCK, the Labour leader, last night withdrew from the contest for
the presidency of the European Communities' Confederation of Socialist
Parties because of a possible conflict with his party's stance on the
Maastricht treaty.
He withdrew after consultations in Lisbon with other socialists had pointed
to difficulties he would face if the confederation backed the treaty but
Labour chose to vote against it in the Commons.
The decision is another personal setback for Mr Kinnock, who is soon to
stand down as Labour leader. He is looking for a role in Labour politics
after his general election defeat, but felt obliged to withdraw from the
European confederation election even though there were no other candidates
for the post. He urged postponing the contest until the autumn.
Mr Kinnock said that, following the Danish referendum's rejection of the
Maastricht treaty, it was 'reasonable' for the Labour party to try to change
the treaty.
'This might involve the Labour party in delaying or opposing the Tory
version of the Maastricht Treaty,' he said in Lisbon.
'The possibility that Labour might oppose the Tory version of the treaty
could mean an inconsistency between my duties as president of the
confederation and my duties as leader of the Labour party and subsequently
as a Labour MP.'

FT  16 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour party 'dream ticket' rises
in value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS MARGARET BECKETT, front-running candidate for Labour's deputy
leadership, may win the post in the first ballot of the July 18 election,
many of her opponents now concede.
Yesterday the shadow chief secretary's office released results from 11
constituency parties indicating the 'dream ticket' - with Mr John Smith, as
leader - as the outcome.
But the claims provoked a vituperative response from Mr Bryan Gould, shadow
environment secretary and candidate for the posts of both leader and deputy.
Speaking in East Ham, Mr Gould clearly targeted Mrs Beckett and Mr John
Prescott, his rivals for the deputy leadership, for failing to help open up
the debate on Labour's future.
'A premature election, a ridiculous electoral college and campaigns that
have done their best to avoid a political debate have done the Labour party
no service at all,' he said. He added: 'Candidates have put more effort into
claims of how well they are doing and rubbishing how well other candidates
are doing than into giving reasons why they should be elected.'
The post-mortem into the general election defeat, due at a special meeting
of the national executive on Thursday, had become 'a personalised game of
hunt the scapegoat' instead of looking at why Labour lost by a huge 7 per
cent deficit.
Supporters of Mr Gould claimed the speech was deliberately intended to fire
up the leadership campaign and provoke a wider debate on the party's future.
However, it is certain to raise serious doubts as to whether Mr Gould can
now expect an important portfolio from Mr Smith when he forms his shadow
cabinet.
One Labour MP close to the Gould camp has privately admitted that there
seems little chance that Labour's environment spokesman will pass the first
hurdle and force Mrs Beckett to a second ballot.
At the GMB general union's annual conference in Blackpool yesterday, Mr
Smith reiterated his backing for a fundamental review of links with the
unions underpinned by one-person, one-vote principles. He also indicated
support for a longer timetable on reform than many Labour activists
envisaged.
The review would to begin in earnest after the leadership elections on July
18 with final recommendations to go to the party's conference in the autumn
of next year.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: PM stresses Maastricht gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR will today emphasise his support for the Maastricht accord in
an attempt to restore the government's grip on recalcitrant Conservative
MPs.
Downing Street signalled yesterday that the prime minister is also ready to
defy his party's Euro-sceptics by acquiescing at the Lisbon summit in the
reappointment of Mr Jacques Delors as Commission president.
Mr Major voiced his intense irritation with Tory divisions over Europe at a
lunch yesterday with new Tory MPs.
Expressing dismay at the internal battles that have erupted since the Danish
referendum, he reaffirmed his view that the deal he had secured at
Maastricht had begun to reverse the trend towards EC centralisation.
That message was underlined by Downing Street aides. They said Mr Major
would tell the Commons today that the accords on political and monetary
union were 'good for Britain and good for Europe'.
Privately, some ministers said yesterday that many in government would not
be unhappy if Maastricht unravelled because of rejection in, say, the Irish
or French referendums. But they insisted that, with the British presidency
of the EC starting in two weeks, Mr Major could not be seen as attempting to
wreck the accord.
Ministers believe that a repudiation of Maastricht would fatally undermine
the government's chance to put the enlargement of the Community and
completion of the single market at the centre of the Brussels agenda.
That stance is likely to infuriate Tory Euro-sceptics who used Mr Major's
visit to Rio to rally opposition to Maastricht. Yesterday the European
Reform Group broadened its assault by blaming sterling's place in the
exchange rate mechanism for the depth of the recession. Mr Major intends to
allow the threatened revolt to 'blow itself out' by delaying the bill to
ratify the legislation until Denmark makes its position clearer.
Downing Street aides insisted that the Mr Major had yet to take a formal
decision on the extension of Mr Delors' tenure. But they pointed out that
there was no other credible candidate likely to be less 'federal' in
instinct. It was also suggested that an extension would provide the
opportunity for Mr Ruud Lubbers - the Dutch prime minister and a favoured
British candidate for the presidency - to take over in 1995.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Refugee's return averts rift with Bonn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, European Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SUDANESE refugee at the centre of a tussle over European asylum procedures
has been discreetly sent back to Germany by the British authorities,
defusing a potential source of strain in UK-German relations.
The Home Office confirmed that Mr Ahmed Gazmalhaliq Abdulla, whose tortuous
journey from Sudan and then around Europe has brought wide attention, was
sent back to Germany on May 12.
This was after Mr Abdulla's lawyers, who claimed he risked persecution in
Germany, failed to win permission for a court appeal to allow him to seek
asylum in Britain.
Mr Abdulla, who had spent almost a year in an asylum-seekers' hostel in
Germany, travelled to Britain at the end of last year after his hostel had
been attacked several times by rightwing extremists during violence against
immigrants in Germany last autumn.
UK authorities rejected Mr Abdulla's asylum request, but in January the Home
Office gave him temporary approval to remain in Britain while lawyers
prepared a case to back his claim that he would be under threat in Germany.
By appearing to support the notion that immigrants faced the danger of
racial persecution in Germany, the UK's decision raised controversy in
Britain and Germany. The Home Office said the case had been 'blown up out of
all proportion'.
If Britain had given the refugee a permanent home it would almost certainly
have affected political relations between London and Bonn, and could have
led to similar departures of immigrants from Germany to the UK. This seems
to have accounted for the government's rapid action to send Mr Abdulla back.
His lawyers claim that the decision was taken in spite of only patchy
evidence that violence against foreigners is abating in Germany.
The number of cases, which totalled 2,427 last year, amounted to 809 in the
first four months of this year. This was down by more than half from the
final four months of last year, when there was a bulge in the number of
cases recorded. But it was still four times the number of cases for the
first four months of 1991.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Hopes rise for Ulster talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FLURRY of activity by diplomats, politicians and civil servants yesterday
followed what may prove to have been a breakthrough in Northern Ireland's
politics.
Preparations are under way for a meeting that will bring Unionists face to
face with the government of the Irish Republic for the first time since
partition in the 1920s. Plans are being laid for the UK and the republic to
start work on a replacement for the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement.
However, the worth of a deal struck by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland
secretary, with local politicians just before midnight on Friday is not yet
clear. Officials in London and Dublin have kept tight control on information
with no details of any meetings being released.
Perhaps the biggest clue yesterday was an air of optimism among government
officials in London and Dublin, and no sign of a breach in the participants'
vow of silence.
For seven weeks Unionists and nationalists have been discussing proposals
for devolution in Northern Ireland. This was Strand One. Little progress has
been made but the agreement struck before talks began was that 'within
weeks' negotiations would turn to Strand Two, when the republic would enter
to discuss relations between north and south.
Sir Patrick could have suspended the talks or forced a move to Strand Two
with Strand One in disarray. Lengthy deliberations followed.
Unionists, particularly the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic
Unionist party, said Strand One had to be completed. The nationalist Social
Democratic and Labour party argued that the 'totality of relationships' in
Northern Ireland had to be addressed and that a move to Strand Two would
help to solve Strand One.
Sir Patrick's answer was a complex compromise. Strand Two is not about to
start, but the proposed independent chairman - Sir Ninian Stephen, former
governor-general of Australia - will convene a meeting this week in London,
probably on Wednesday, to discuss a possible agenda for Strand Two. Junior
representatives of the two governments and the main political parties will
attend.
Meanwhile, the British and Irish governments will meet, according to the
official statement, 'to give preliminary consideration to the issues likely
to arise' in the third and final strand - on Anglo-Irish relations,
principally the 1985 pact.
With the duration of the talks limited - the cut-off point is a meeting of
the Anglo-Irish conference at the end of next month - excessive time-wasting
has been avoided, and discussions will continue. Sir Patrick may regard that
as a breakthrough in itself.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Move to defuse row at business school
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VIGOROUS efforts are being made to defuse the row over the future of
Manchester Business School that led its advisory council and Professor Tom
Cannon, the school's director, to resign last month.
The 14 industrialists on the council complained of high-handed treatment by
Manchester University, which has now redefined the school's role and decided
to abolish the council. The business school is a graduate and post-doctoral
research institution and is part of the university.
The government has refused to intervene formally, but Sir Ron Dearing,
chairman of the Universities' Funding Council, has asked Sir Dennis Landau,
former chairman of the business school's council, to state his terms for
resuming office. It seems likely that the government has asked Sir Ron to
use his influence.
Sir Dennis, chief executive of the Co-operative Wholesale Society, says he
will reconsider only if asked to do so by Prof Martin Harris, who will
become vice-chancellor of the university in August.
Mr Chris Kenyon, chairman of the governing council for the entire
university, says the university authorities had believed that Prof Cannon
and the business school's council wanted greater autonomy for the school. He
says the university council cannot see why the 14 felt they had to resign.
Sir Dennis says the 14 would have stayed if the words 'after consultation'
had been added to a new university ordinance, giving the business school
council a statutory right to a say in its own affairs, such as disposal of
assets.
Mr Kenyon says that if a compromise involving just two words was on offer,
no one on the university side realised it.
The university plans to federate the business school with the mainly
undergraduate University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology
(Umist) and the university's department of accounting.
Sir Dennis doubts that this will work. He and his fellow former councillors
are concerned that it might devalue the Master of Business Administration
degree. MBA students fear that a change in the balance between the course's
vocational and academic content could dilute their marketability as doers
rather than thinkers.
The Franks Report on management education - which led to the setting up of
business schools in Manchester and London nearly 30 years ago - recognised
the tension between the academic and the vocational as a case for autonomy.
The Manchester school council relied on a written definition of its
quasi-autonomous position, approved by the university some years ago. Mr
Kenyon last week accused Prof Cannon of leading the school's council astray
over the extent of its autonomy. Prof Cannon says the written definition
made the position quite clear.
It is this confusion Prof Harris has to resolve. Ironically, a search is
already under way for yet more industrialists to serve on a new business
school body, which the university says will function as an executive board.
Favourite for chairman is Prof Sir Roland Smith, chairman of Umist's
fundraising committee and former chairman of British Aerospace.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OFFICE of Fair Trading confirmed yesterday that it was investigating a
complaint about the sale of tickets for the Wimbledon tennis championships.
Mr Mike Burton, a former England rugby player who runs a corporate
hospitality company, complained to the European Commission that the All
England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club was operating a cartel and artificially
forcing up the prices of debenture tickets for the Wimbledon finals, while
banning the resale of other tickets.
Debenture holders are guaranteed the most sought-after tickets, those for
the men's singles final in the centre court. The tickets have a face value
of Pounds 46, but Mr Burton claims that the All England Club has bought
tickets for up to Pounds 700 and resold them to corporate hospitality
companies for as much as Pounds 890.
The club introduced anti-touting measures - including banning resale or
transfer of ordinary tickets - for last year's season. Mr Burton
subsequently issued a writ against the club for allegedly breaching
competition law, but later withdrew his application for an injunction.
The OFT said it had been passed a copy of the complaint to the European
Commission and would make inquiries. The All England Club yesterday made no
comment on Mr Burton's allegations.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Courts Charter, which is due to be discussed at the prime minister's
six-monthly seminar on the Citizens' Charter on Friday, is not likely to be
ready for publication before the end of the summer.
The Lord Chancellor's department, which with the Crown Prosecution Service
is responsible for drawing up the new charter guaranteeing standards of
service and facilities for court users, said yesterday it was still at an
early draft stage.
The Lord Chancellor's Department is one of only a handful of government
departments which has yet to publish information about standards of public
service in its area as part of the charter initiative.
The Justice Charter for Scotland, which sets out the standards of service
which all users of the Scottish justice system can expect and what will be
done if services do not come up to standard, was published as early as last
November.
The English charter is likely to be modelled on the Scottish version. It
sets standards of service for the police, courts, prosecuting authorities
and prison service and describes the action being taken to improve the
quality of services.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Stock market looks at plans for new capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Stock Exchange is considering plans to raise new capital, probably from
continental European brokers and investors, it said yesterday.
Mr Peter Rawlins, chief executive, said that the exchange wanted to spread
the costs of financing the development of new technology more widely. The
brokers and marketmakers who own the exchange are under financial pressure
and are finding it difficult to pass on the costs of the exchange to their
customers.
Also, Mr Rawlins said, they are concerned that they are being forced to pay
for developments which one day will benefit other users of the market.
In the past year the exchange has spent Pounds 25m on Taurus, its
long-delayed settlement system, bringing total spending so far to nearly
Pounds 50m. It also plans an overhaul of the systems that support trading.
The Stock Exchange said it had yet to develop any firm proposals on how it
could raise more capital. However, it seems unlikely that it would attempt
to sell shares to investors with no direct interest in the exchange. With
its declared aim of remaining a non-profit institution, it cannot pay a
market rate of return.
One exchange executive said: 'The scope for profit-making is not great in
the UK market. There are so many legal and regulatory matters that would get
in the way.'
The alternative would be to tempt securities brokers and others on the
Continent to join the exchange. However, since it operates an electronic
market, the exchange cannot sell seats to brokers to raise cash.
The exchange's operating costs fell from Pounds 182m to Pounds 171m during
the year, largely as a result of staff reductions. Its income climbed by
Pounds 9.5m to Pounds 194m, reflecting increases in settlement income as
trading volumes climbed.
After a review of its properties, the exchange lowered the valuation of for
its headquarters building in the City by Pounds 20m to Pounds 90m.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Venture financing recovers slowly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE VENTURE capital market in the west Midlands is slowly recovering, but
most finance is directed at corporate restructuring, particularly management
buy-outs, fund managers have reported.
Mr Alan Lewis, regional director of County NatWest Ventures, said higher
demand for development capital as companies sought equity to finance
expansion out of recession - a trend expected since the general election -
had not taken place to any marked degree. That indicated 'the recovery is a
slow and painful process at best'.
3i, the UK's largest venture capital group, has seen its activity decline
since the pre-election period, although it is committing more funds to
management buyouts.
Mr Chris Rowlands, Birmingham director of 3i, said this meant 'our activity
is very strong, but it is not an accurate reflection of underlying economic
activity'. Only 10 per cent of a Pounds 20m fund set up by 3i last August
for small inner-city businesses in the west Midlands had been taken up. Most
of the management buyouts were deals of up to Pounds 10m.

companies are angered by NRA moves to restrict access to supplies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WATER companies in England and Wales were angered yesterday by a warning
from the National Rivers Authority that they might be banned from taking
water from some rivers if they failed to make voluntary reductions.
The move could herald a series of confrontations between the authority, the
water industry's environmental regulator, and the companies over the scale
of water abstraction. If a ban is enforced the companies are likely to
demand compensation for loss of supplies, which could amount to millions of
pounds.
The threat of a ban follows frustration in the authority at the lack of
voluntary agreements to curb water abstraction from 40 rivers where low
levels of flow have been made worse by the drought.
The authority's main target - because of the chronic shortage of water in
parts of the River Darent in Kent - is Thames Water, the biggest of the 10
companies privatised 2 1/2 years ago. Thames has been given until September
1 to commit itself to varying its abstraction licences for the Darent to 70
per cent of the 90m litres a day it is now allowed to take. The authority
plans to take action itself to vary the licences if Thames fails to do so.
Thames Water's Utilities offshoot said it was surprised by criticism of its
strategy over the Darent, as for the past two years it had voluntarily
reduced its abstraction to 70 per cent of its entitlement.
'We have a very strong commitment to the river and the environment, but we
also have a legal commitment to our customers,' it said.
As part of a continuing programme, the authority is seeking agreement by
April next year for Thames to introduce a further reduction of 15m litres a
day from the Darent by the end of 1995. This in turn could lead to even
greater reductions later to restore the river's flow.
Lord Crickhowell, chairman of the authority, said at a London news
conference: 'I want no shilly-shallying over this issue. I want a commitment
from Thames that they will make a definitive effort to reduce abstraction .
. . if agreement on timetables cannot be reached, the NRA will act
unilaterally to vary abstraction licences downwards or revoke them
completely.'
Lord Crickhowell said that in setting timetables account would be taken of
the need for the companies to find alternative supplies. One possibility
would be for companies to take firmer action against leakages, which on
average involved 25 per cent of supplies.
Negotiations are under way between the authority and other water companies,
including Wessex and Southern, to seek agreement on voluntarily reducing
abstractions from low-level rivers.
Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure group, welcomed the
authority's crackdown. It added that the government should intervene to
prevent financial difficulties for the authority if water companies had to
be paid large sums in compensation for loss of supplies.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Warning issued on software taxation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES that write their own software could find their tax position under
attack from the Inland Revenue, Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, chairman of the Stock
Exchange, warned yesterday.
The exchange itself is being challenged by the Revenue over its practice of
writing off all the costs of software development in the year they are
incurred. Last year that amounted to Pounds 25m, all of it spent on Taurus,
the planned new settlement system.
The Revenue has challenged the exchange, arguing that software development
costs are a form of capital spending. As such, these costs should only be
eligible for capital allowances, which amount to 25 per cent of the spending
in the first year.
If applied to all companies that generate their own software, the rule could
prevent companies claiming immediate tax relief on significant costs.
The Computer Services Association, a trade association, estimates that
companies spend Pounds 3bn to Pounds 4bn a year on developing software for
their own use.
Sir Andrew warned that the ruling would be particularly costly for financial
institutions, which spend large sums on software development.
'This will have quite an effect on the level of investment in the City as a
whole,' he said.
According to Mr John Barnsley, head of tax at Price Waterhouse, the
accountancy firm, companies have, however, increasingly been switching to
capitalising their software development spending, rather than writing it off
in the year it is incurred,
The escalating cost of developing computer systems, and the impact of the
recession in reducing profits, means that many companies are reluctant to
write off their development costs in the year in which they are incurred.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Lloyd's ready to share premises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S of London is prepared to allow insurance companies to share its
premises, paving the way for growing links between it and the conventional
market.
Discussions have taken place between Mr Dick Hazell, deputy chairman of
Lloyd's, and Anglo American, an independent London-based insurer, about a
possible move. Anglo-American said no decision had been taken. Mr Hazell
said he hoped to attract other insurance companies.
In a separate development it has emerged that final figures for the 1989
losses of syndicates managed by the Gooda Walker agency may not be available
until next week. The Gooda losses, which stem from spiral reinsurance - in
which syndicates and insurers reinsure each other's large-scale catastrophe
exposure - could amount to more than Pounds 500m. That would be about a
quarter of the market's overall loss of about Pounds 2bn which Lloyd's will
announce at its annual meeting on June 24.
The premises talks take place as a Lloyd's committee starts detailed
examination of how corporate limited liability capital can be provided to
Lloyd's syndicates, where Names - the individuals whose assets provide the
market's capital - have unlimited liability for insurance losses.
Lloyd's is also keen to increase rental income following a fall in the
number of syndicates at the market. More than 120 have either closed or
merged in the past 18 months, leaving one of the four underwriting floors
vacant and another under-occupied.
The Baltic Exchange, the marine cargo market whose headquarters were
destroyed by an IRA bomb attack in April, is temporarily occu-pying part of
this floor at Lloyd's.
Insurance companies rented offices at Lloyd's previous headquarters in Lime
Street. A case brought by 91 members of Lloyd's of London against Lloyd's
syndicates has been dismissed by a US District Court Judge.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US LAWYERS acting for Mirror Group Newspapers yesterday filed a claim in New
York seeking the recovery of Dollars 86m (Pounds 47m) of funds that were
allegedly transferred last year from London into US accounts held by the
Daily News, the New York newspaper owned by Robert Maxwell.
The claim, filed in the New York bankruptcy court, charges that the Daily
News aided and abetted Maxwell in the breach of fiduciary duties to MGN. It
states that the Dollars 86m of funds was borrowed by MGN, on Maxwell's
orders, from the London branch of a US bank.
Mr John Campi, for the Daily News, last night denied any wrongdoing by
officials of the New York tabloid. 'We did not use the money for Daily News
purposes,' he said.
A New York executive with personal knowledge of the transactions said,
however, that during October last year the funds arrived in the Daily News
accounts and within a week were all transferred to banks and other
recipients both in the US and elsewhere. The orders detailing where the
money was to be paid came from London.
The US executive said that most of the transfers occurred in the week of
October 19 last year, and were supervised personally by Maxwell. It is
believed that at least some of the money was used to pay debts to US
investment banks.
The claim was made in the bankruptcy court because the Daily News filed for
protection from its creditors last December under Chapter 11 of US
bankruptcy law.
According to the lawyers, the deadline for claims to be filed in the New
York bankruptcy court expired at the close of business yesterday.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Union to reject 'beauty contests'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GMB general workers' union is to become the first large union to refuse
to take part in 'beauty contests' in which employers decide which
organisation should represent their workers.
The decision at yesterday's annual GMB conference reflects growing
dissatisfaction among unions with a system many believe is undemocratic and
leaves victorious unions relatively powerless. It will lead other large
unions, particularly the TGWU general union, to consider their participation
in future contests.
The decision will also further strengthen the hand of the Amalgamated
Engineering and Electrical Union which, through its two wings, has been by
far the most successful union in recent years at winning contests.
Beauty contests are often used by overseas companies, particularly Japanese
ones, when they set up plants in the UK and want only one union to represent
workers. The system was strongly criticised at last year's annual conference
of the Trades Union Congress.
The decision comes in a week when a study of the Nissan car plant in
Sunderland claims that the role of the AEEU, which won a beauty contest
there in the 1980s, is merely that of an onlooker.
Membership of the union at the plant is less than 50 per cent of the
workforce, although penetration among blue-collar workers is significantly
higher.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Unexpected lifeline for Maxwell victims: John Willman sees
some hope for pensioners if they can pierce government secrecy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS that intelligence information suggested the dishonesty of Robert
Maxwell before his empire collapsed offers the Maxwell pensioners another
lifeline in their campaign for government compensation.
Their chances of persuading the government to accept full responsibility for
bailing out the Maxwell pension funds will be enhanced if it can be shown
that government departments failed to act on information which revealed
Maxwell's questionable activities.
The pensioners' problem will be to establish that such information was in
the government's hands.
The response of the Maxwell Pensioners Action Group to yesterday's FT
revelations was to call for a judicial inquiry to examine the affair and
identify the failings of the system. The pensioners' best chance of
compensation probably lies with Mr William Reid, the parliamentary
commissioner known as the ombudsman. The 1989 report of his predecessor, Sir
Anthony Barrowclough, unlocked government funds for 18,000 investors who
lost money when the Barlow Clowes group collapsed.
Sir Anthony found the Department of Trade and Industry guilty of
'significant maladministration'. He criticised 'the lack of a sufficiently
rigorous and inquiring approach', including the inadequacy of the regulatory
machinery before April 1988 when the Financial Services Act was introduced.
Announcing the payment in the Commons, Lord Ridley, then trade and industry
secretary, justified compensation by the 'number of unusual features which
taken together distinguish this case from other business failures'. Lord
Ridley, then Mr Nicholas Ridley, added: 'It is also true that a large number
of investors, many of them elderly, have suffered hardship'.
There are clear similarities with the present case in the age of many
Maxwell pensioners and the hardship they will suffer without compensation.
But the pensioners will need to work hard to establish a case the ombudsman
can consider, because the looting of the Maxwell pension funds took place
after the introduction of the 1988 Financial Services Act.
That act switched responsibility for policing the pension funds from the DTI
to the Securities and Investments Board (SIB) and the Investment Management
Regulatory Organisation (Imro), both of which are excluded from the
jurisdiction of the ombudsman. As the current ombudsman pointed out 10 days
ago, he cannot launch an investigation without evidence of an administrative
fault by a government department.
One such fault might be that the powers delegated by the DTI to SIB and Imro
did not adequately protect the interests of pension fund managers. To
establish a case for the ombudsman to investigate, pensioners would need to
show that representations had been made when the powers were delegated and
that they were ignored or brushed aside.
An ombudsman's investigation might also be triggered if it could be shown
that the government had had information about Mr Maxwell's questionable
activities - from the intelligence services, for example - and failed to
pass it on to the regulatory authorities.
It would be hard to prove either of these faults without access to documents
in government files. Yet under the UK's secretive system of government, they
are not open to public inspection.
Hence the Maxwell pensioners' call for a judicial inquiry into the affair.
In spite of the prime minister's commitment to more open government, the
only way to cast more light on the proceedings of government in cases such
as this is to appoint a judge or a privy councillor to examine all relevant
papers.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Spies turn their gaze to world of big business / A look at
the growth of routine industrial surveillance work by MI5 and MI6
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDONERS watching the completion of the costly riverside headquarters
buildings for MI5 and MI6, the organisations which lie at the hub of
Britain's intelligence services, may be forgiven for asking exactly what the
tenants will find to do.
The end of the Cold war and Mr John Major's pledge to unravel Britain's
secretive society might be seen as good reasons to scale down the state's
intelligence-gathering networks.
But this week's claims that a number of large British and foreign companies
have been the subject of routine surveillance throws light on an aspect of
the security services' work which is thought to be growing.
Although the old, politically based framework for securing information
remains intact, the intelligence services are believed to be taking
increasing advantage of the growing globalisation of business.
Multinational companies, often operating in highly sensitive defence-related
industries, can provide an alternative vehicle for monitoring and gathering
information.
They may offer a conduit for useful information on the transfer of sensitive
technology and on arms sales, as well as on more general economic
intelligence.
Among the companies identified in yesterday's Financial Times as having come
under scrutiny by the security forces, GEC Marconi is one of the most
obvious targets.
From its secluded, low-profile headquarters in Stanmore, north London, the
company is at the forefront in developing highly sophisticated, defence
related products. Some of its electronic systems are assumed to be deployed
by the security services.
A senior executive of Lonrho, the international trading group, said he was
'not surprised' it had been mentioned as a target. He claimed Mr Tiny
Rowland, the company's chief executive, had been considered 'offside' by the
authorities in the late 1980s, although he believed relationships had
improved since Mr Major had become prime minister.
Rolls-Royce, another name mentioned, is heavily engaged in defence work and
has associates closely involved in the nuclear industry. General Motors of
the US, which is also identified, owns Hughes Aircraft, one of the largest
missile manufacturers in the US.
Spying between rival companies is well-established. ICL, the computer
manufacturer, issued warnings to staff more than 20 years ago about the
dangers of industrial spies. Staff were told not to throw scrap paper in
waste paper baskets or to leave ribbons in typewriters.
The concept of govern-ment-approved intelligence- gathering in the corporate
sector is not new. There have been some suggestions that as far back as 1967
some British companies were under official surveillance on the in-structions
of senior ministers.
Intelligence services are thought to maintain a watch on international
businessmen with high-level government contacts - a description which fitted
Robert Maxwell perfectly.
The intelligence services' ability to collect information does not rely on a
late-night rummage in wastepaper baskets. One expert in the corporate
intelligence sector says private operators occasionally come across evidence
of MI5 - known in the business as Box 500 - or MI6 activities.
These are invariably identifiable because of the deployment of highly
sophisticated electronic intelligence-gathering equipment, unavailable to
most specialists. Sometimes the contact is more direct.
Most telecommunications equipment in the modern office, including computers,
telephones, telex and fax machines can be intercepted, or in some cases
monitored from outside a building by reconstructing data from 'leaking'
radiation emissions.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Margaret Reid: distinguished journalist - Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MARGARET REID, the distinguished financial journalist, has died suddenly at
the age of 67. She had an unusual background for such a career. An Oxford
graduate, she spent some 10 years in the Treasury, where she became a
principal - an experience which helped to shape an intellectual rigour and a
discreet approach to her task which were to be among the hallmarks of her
time as a journalist.
She was fortunate to develop her writing skills under the guidance of Mr Ian
Richardson, city editor of the Birmingham Post, someone with great
experience of the City and industry. She really came into her own when she
joined the Financial Times as a financial reporter in the 1970s, where she
was at the forefront of the newspaper's coverage of the secondary banking
crisis.
This drama played perfectly to her strengths: technical and complex, enacted
to a considerable degree behind the closed doors of City banking parlours,
requiring judgment and a cool head from those whose job it was to report and
to analyse. Senior City figures were prepared to talk to her in the
knowledge that she would never betray a confidence. She never speculated or
over-dramatised a story: her judgment could always could be relied on at a
time when banking structures were in such chronic disrepair that any false
alarms could have had serious consequences.
She also developed a strong news sense. Colleagues remember the excitement
when she was the first to report on the fact that one of the leading finance
houses, hitherto regarded as rock-solid, had been forced into the 'lifeboat'
organised by the Bank of England.
Margaret Reid capitalised on this experience by taking a year as journalist
research fellow at Nuffield College, Oxford, where she wrote The Secondary
Banking Crisis 1973-75. This remains perhaps the most readable and
comprehensive book on the subject.
In 1980, she became finance editor of Investors Chronicle. She covered the
turmoil leading up to and following Big Bang on the Stock Exchange, and
again showed her broad understanding of City affairs in her book on the
subject - All-change in the City: The Revolution in Britain's Financial
Sector - which was published in 1988.
In recent years she worked as a freelance. Her most recent book, Conversion
to PLC, describing Abbey National's move from building society to bank, was
published last year. In the latter part of her life, she found great
personal happiness in her marriage to Mr Howard Whitten.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Navy to scrap tactical nuclear weapons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN and ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN is to scrap its seaborne tactical nuclear weapons, Mr Malcolm
Rifkind, defence secretary, said yesterday. Royal Navy ships and
carrier-borne aircraft and Royal Air Force maritime patrol aircraft will no
longer carry bombs and nuclear depth charges.
Britain's strategic nuclear deterrent of Polaris submarines, and their
replacement, the Tridents, that are due to enter service in the mid 1990s,
are not affected.
The RAF keeps its nuclear bombs on Tornado aircraft. Plans for a successor
to the existing bomb are unaffected by yesterday's decision.
The announcement comes on the eve of a visit by Mr Boris Yeltsin, the
Russian president, to Washington to discuss arms reductions as well as
economic aid. Mr Rifkind said the timing of the announcement was not related
to Mr Yeltsin's visit.
Before the break-up of the Soviet Union, Moscow periodically demanded that
British and French strategic nuclear weapons be included in any further
reductions in nuclear arms by the US and the Soviet Union. These demands
were rejected repeatedly by the British and French governments.
The two governments argued that they would allow their strategic nuclear
forces to become part of an east-west arms deal only when the US and the
Soviet Union had sharply reduced their own nuclear weapon stocks.
Less has been heard of this matter since the break-up of the Soviet Union,
which has been succeeded by Russia as the main nuclear power in the
Commonwealth of Independent States. But there can be little doubt that
yesterday's announcement by the government can only help London to resist
any further demands of this nature by the Russians.
The move means that the government has announced reductions in the UK's
non-strategic nuclear defences of more than half since last September. 'This
is a further indication that we live in a changed world,' said Mr Rifkind.
He said the cuts were not part of any treaty obligation. 'It is a decision
that we ourselves have taken.'
The cuts affect more than the weapons. Training of crews and detailed
certification of equipment will end. The UK-built weapons will be returned
to the Atomic Weapons Establishment near Aldermaston in Berkshire and
dismantled. Those built in the US and deployed by the RAF will be returned
to the US.
Some of the weapons, carried on Lynx and Sea King helicopters, have not been
deployed since last autumn, when Mr Tom King, Mr Rifkind's predecessor, said
they would no longer be on Royal Navy ships 'in normal circumstances'.
The US-built bombs, which are deployed on RAF Nimrod surveillance aircraft,
were not part of that announcement.
Scrapping the seaborne weapons is unlikely to result in short-term cost
savings because of the increased workload in dismantling the weapons.
The decision follows a rethink by Nato last autumn on the balance of nuclear
and conventional forces. At the time, it announced cuts in nuclear forces
including the withdrawal of US nuclear depth charges from Nato maritime
patrol aircraft.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Payments deficit revised up to Pounds 2.64bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S current account balance of payments deficit was much higher than
previously estimated in the six months to the end of March because of a
disappointing performance on the so-called invisible trade account.
The Central Statistical Office yesterday revised upwards this year's
first-quarter current account deficit to Pounds 2.64bn from an estimated
Pounds 2.17bn, while the deficit for the final quarter of last year is now
put at Pounds 1.42bn - more than twice the Pounds 642m figure published in
May.
The revisions mean last year's shortfall on the current account, which gives
the UK's balance of trade in goods and invisibles such as services, dividend
payments and certain transfer payments, was Pounds 5.2bn compared with
Pounds 4.4bn previously. Nonetheless, last year's annual current account
deficit remains the smallest since 1987 and was less than a third of the
1990 deficit, which the CSO also revised upwards yesterday to Pounds 16.08bn
from Pounds 15.45bn.
CSO officials said the worse-than-expected deficit in the latest six months
mainly reflected a sharp increase in UK transfers to the European Community
in the first quarter of this year, and a large downward revision by a
British company of earnings attributed to a foreign subsidiary in the final
quarter of last year. Officials disclosed that the company had wrongly
booked Pounds 400m as earnings from investments abroad in the final quarter.
Britain's surplus on invisible trade was just Pounds 430m in the first
quarter, or less than half earlier estimates of Pounds 900m. The Treasury
blamed the figures on one-off factors. The figures unsettled sterling and
contributed to a subdued mood in the equities and gilts markets.
The figures also disclosed a large net capital outflow of Pounds 9.94bn from
Britain in the first quarter compared with a net inflow of Pounds 11.74bn in
the previous quarter. The outflow mainly reflected a large outflow from UK
banking transactions. Direct UK investment overseas rose to Pounds 2.51bn
from Pounds 300m, while foreign direct investment in Britain also rose to
Pounds 4.38bn from Pounds 1.91bn.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Executive loses appeal over disqualification
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FORMER company chairman who was jailed last year for insider dealing has
failed to overturn an order disqualifying him from acting as a company
director for 10 years, Raymond Hughes writes.
Mr Ivor Goodman, former chairman of Unigroup, the quoted Leeds-based timber
and clothing company, is the only person prosecuted for insider dealing in
the UK who has served a jail term for the offence. He pleaded guilty last
year at St Albans Crown Court to an offence under the Company Securities
(Insider Dealing) Act.
He was sentenced to 18 months, of which nine months were suspended.
Yesterday he challenged the disqualification order imposed on him as part of
his sentence. Dismissing his appeal, Lord Justice Staughton said in the
Court of Appeal that the offence was 'a monstrous and scandalous example of
insider trading'.
The Department of Trade and Industry alleged at the trial that Mr Goodman
had disposed of his shares in Unigroup just before the company announced
worse-than-expected results in 1987. The sale took place a few days before
the Stock Exchange suspended the company's shares at its own request. The
sale was later set aside after civil proceedings.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Treasury moves to sell off debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SECURITIES houses are being invited by the Treasury to bid for Pounds 5bn of
government debt that remains with privatised industries.
One securities house said yesterday that several City institutions had been
asked to look at ways of repackaging parcels of debt owed to the government,
mainly by British Telecommunications and the electricity distributors.
The transfer of the debts - incurred in the run-up to privatisation - would
release to the Treasury revenue that would otherwise have been repaid over
almost 20 years.
The revenue injection would count as negative government spending and
therefore cut the size of the public sector borrowing requirement.
The Treasury would not confirm that it had plans to sell debt, but officials
said it would be possible to sell the rights to it and to raise a lump sum.
'We would simply need to find somebody who would be prepared to buy the
rights to receive the debt,' said a Treasury official. 'Most of the debt is
potentially marketable, but some of it isn't'
BT still has to pay off just under Pounds 2.2bn, while the electricity
distribution companies owe about Pounds 1.2bn. Further smaller stocks of
debt from the generating companies, the Scottish electricity companies and
National Television Licensing brings the total still owed to the Treasury to
just over Pounds 5bn.
The debt, which is in the form of debentures and loan stock, was to be
repaid over a number of years. For example, British Gas made its last
repayment of Pounds 350m in April.
The debt should be relatively easy to buy and sell, but its transfer to bond
markets might make it harder for the privatised companies to raise capital
subsequently in a market where there is only a finite demand for sterling
bonds.

and bankers alike, pouring money into some of the newest, shakiest and
nastiest governments. It was a fantasy world that led him to fraud

ON MAY 19 1983, the Moscow streets were clear of snow after the long winter.
Inside the Kremlin some of the most powerful men in the Soviet Union sat
signing a document marked 'secret'.
One by one, the general secretaries of the Central Committee - second in
rank only to Soviet leader Yuri Andropov - solemnly scrawled their names on
the closely-typed sheet of paper. They included Mikhail Gorbachev, then
responsible for the party's agriculture policy, Konstantin Chernenko, who
later succeeded Andropov as leader, and Nikolai Ryzhkov, later prime
minister of the Soviet Union.
The paper declared that the Communist party had granted an honorary
doctorate from Moscow State University to Robert Maxwell for his distinction
as a 'well-known specialist in the field of economics who actively campaigns
for the strengthening of friendship and mutual understanding between the
Soviet and English peoples'.
Maxwell conned the world's presidents as well as the world's bankers. He
tricked them all into believing his delusion: that he had created an empire
controlling billions of dollars, entitling him to meet heads of state on
equal terms. His global network of television stations, newspapers, books
and electronic databases linked by the latest telecommunications was his
calling card to the world's leaders.
Prestige not profit appears to have been the driving force behind a lot of
Maxwell's business deals. Many that he made with huge enthusiasm gave him
the front page headlines he craved, but yielded little financial return. His
attempt to conquer the US, the richest country in the world - spending
Dollars 3bn in 1988 taking over publishing houses  - was the step that
eventually brought his empire crashing.
His wooing of world statesmen also intensified that year. The host of tiny
exotic projects that followed drained away time and money when his empire
needed it most. For the next three years his Gulfstream aircraft, restocked
each day with champagne and caviar, scarcely spent a week in the same city.
In his search for attention he courted some of the newest, shakiest and
nastiest governments with promises of investment. Even though he delivered
on only a fraction of these, he still poured tens of millions of pounds into
these governments' favourite projects.
The closeness of his links with some foreign ministers has led to
suggestions that Maxwell was a spy. He died amid a flurry of allegations
that he was an agent for Mossad, the Israeli secret service. This followed
older rumours of links with the KGB. These claims remain to be proven. What
is certain is that the services he performed for some governments, notably
the old, hardline communist regimes, were highly questionable.
Previously secret Communist party archives, declassified specially for the
Financial Times, say that Maxwell regularly briefed Kremlin leaders on
events in the west - including Andropov when he was head of the KGB before
he became Soviet leader in 1982. Our investigations have also uncovered a
pattern of favours he performed for Israeli and Bulgarian ministers.
The picture that emerges from Maxwell's ceaseless foreign travel supports
overwhelmingly the view of Maxwell company directors that he lost his
judgment up to three years before he died.
Near the end of his life, leaning out from the window of his penthouse
overlooking the Old City of Jerusalem, he said: 'This is the only place I
really feel at home.' Israel returned that sentiment: more than other
countries it was willing to believe in him.
Understanding the fraud means understanding Maxwell's fantasy. The part of
Czechoslovakia in which he was born was annexed by the Soviet Union in the
Second World War. His family had been annihilated, so he set about creating
his own country, one that would reach every corner of the world.
Maxwell could find something he enjoyed - and wanted to own - in any
culture. His aides say he would also visit anywhere which promised a state
reception. 'He loved the aura of the great man flying in, everyone running
around,' says a former Daily Mirror executive.
Maxwell hired some of the most distinguished products of the Foreign Office
to act as his empire's ambassadors. These included Peter Jay, former
ambassador to the US and Sir John Morgan, former ambassador to Mexico. One
of the Mirror's former editors says: 'Peter Jay or Sir John Morgan would lay
everything on at diplomatic level and we would take off: we'd have
chauffeur-driven cars all the way; in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, the
British ambassador would usually come to meet us.'
One of Maxwell's greatest pleasures was being able to boast that he could
telephone direct the president of the Soviet Union. The secret files made
available to the FT portray him going to great lengths to display his
sympathy for Soviet concerns: a westerner who could be trusted by the Soviet
leadership.
Maxwell's involvement probably Brezhnev, when he began publishing the stodgy
works and hagiographies of hardline Soviet and eastern European leaders.
Maxwell - who to the day of his death described himself as a socialist -
warmed to the new-world rhetoric and authoritarianism of these leaders.
One Kremlin file notes a conversation between Maxwell and the Soviet
ambassador in London in 1985 when Maxwell had pronounced that Thatcher and
the Conservatives 'could hardly' retain power after the next general
election.
Anxious to impress the Kremlin with his left-wing bona fides, Maxwell also
told the ambassador: 'Many leading articles in the Mirror group newspapers
are agreed with the leader of the Labour party, Neil Kinnock.'
Victims of Maxwell's broken promises in the Soviet Union speak of him as an
opportunist who used the lure of potential business projects to win Soviet
attention.
According to the Kremlin documents, on March 22, 1988, Maxwell was received
by Alexander Yakovlev - Gorbachev's key aide and the godfather of
perestroika - to discuss the publication of Moscow News in English. The
project was given the green light.
On October 19 1990, Maxwell finally met Gorbachev - a high point of
pleasure. The very next day Maxwell executives announced they were cutting
off money from the joint Maxwell-Soviet publication. The reason given was
the Persian Gulf crisis - but more likely, Maxwell's ambition had been the
presidential meeting, not the newspaper, and he then wanted to flex his
muscles in front of Gorbachev.
The Soviets found his word was not his bond - as did many others.
Visiting Carlos Menem, Argentina's president, in Buenos Aires on October 20
1989, Maxwell was received like a foreign dignitary with a reception in the
Gold Salon of the Foreign Ministry. No British subject had been treated that
way by Argentina since the end of the Falklands War. But Argentina was
emerging from a debt and inflation crisis and was desperate to bring in
foreign capital.
Maxwell said he wanted to buy all the papermaking plants in Argentina,
rescue the near-bankrupt evening newspaper La Razon, and buy a stake in
Canal 2, one of the TV stations. The president's office issued a statement
several weeks later saying that the Mirror Group had invested Dollars
300,000 in La Razon and claiming that more investments would follow.
However, La Razon closed within months, and Maxwell put no more money into
Argentina because of his anger at its regulations against foreign control of
its television companies.
Just weeks before his death, in a vitriolic letter to Julio Mera Figueroa,
former interior minister, Maxwell declared he would never return to
Argentina. Some estimates suggest he spent up to Dollars 6m in the whole
Argentine adventure.
Above all else, Maxwell hated being left out. Some time after Nelson
Mandela, the black South African leader, was released from jail he came to
the UK and was invited to a black tie dinner at the Commonwealth Institute.
Robert Maxwell was not invited. He phoned the organisers and demanded to be
among the guests. When he heard nothing he turned up on the doorstep in a
dinner jacket and demanded to be admitted. Once in, he barged his way to the
top table and sat down next to Mandela, from where he dominated the
conversation all evening.
The smaller the country, the more desperate for investment, the fewer the
regulations and the more naive the government, the warmer the welcome he
received - at least initially. In tiny, near-bankrupt Bulgaria he found a
country small enough to let him act like a king.
His first 'investment' was in 1982: Pounds 5,000 in the Lyudmila Zhivkova
Foundation, a charity set up to promote principles of 'truth, beauty and
education'. It was named after the daughter of the communist dictator Todor
Zhivkov, whose government has been widely accused of killing dissident
Georgi Markov with a poisoned-tipped umbrella in 1978. Michael Tachev, since
1987 the secretary general of the foundation, which has been renamed St
Cyril &amp; Methodius, shrugs when asked about Maxwell's original motives. 'Even
the Mafia invest in charity to safeguard their souls,' he says.
When Zhivkov was deposed in November 1989 by a 'socialist' government - the
communists under a new name - Maxwell 'seemed like Santa Claus and was
accepted by everyone', says Tachev. The new prime minister, Andrei Lukanov,
gave Maxwell the use of two villas in a compound of luxurious diplomatic
chalets near Sofia. When Maxwell and his entourage left he would often leave
the phone bill to be paid by the British embassy.
He scattered nearly half a million pounds on impulsive projects: a school to
teach Bulgarian businessmen western methods; a few thousand invested in
Balkan Films, producers of the cartoons Cuddles &amp; Orvill; and more to help
the charity diversify into book printing. He gave Slavia, Bulgaria's oldest
football team, Dollars 100,000 and a set of shirts emblazoned MAXWELL. He
arranged it all through the Politburo. The team manager remembers: 'I
suddenly got a call one day from the Politburo saying: 'Come and get these
shirts - they're cluttering up our corridors.''
Most of his plans came to nothing, neither his hopes for a new Bulgarian
bank, nor the scheme in April 1990 for a joint venture with Colgate
Palmolive to revolutionise the Bulgarian toothpaste industry. 'The
toothpaste we would have appreciated,' says a spokesman for the British
embassy.
In April 1990, Maxwell took Bulgarian government officials and Richard
Thomas, the British ambassador, in his Gulfstream jet to survey former
Communist mansions he was considering buying. He wanted to found
Hollywood-on-the-Black-Sea, a film set and a resort where stars would sit
drinking cocktails. 'He was thinking of people like Rod Stewart,' says one
Maxwell aide.
The party measured the depth of the harbour near Perla to see if the Lady
Ghislaine, Maxwell's yacht, could moor there. When the medieval city
Velikaturnova was pointed out to him Maxwell said: 'I'll have that one too.'
At one point on the jet Thomas became concerned because Maxwell was
threatening to fly to another country. The worried envoy pointed out that
protocol forbade him from leaving the country without state permission.
Maxwell refused to promise that the aircraft would stay in Bulgarian
airspace. Nor did he promise that it would return to Sofia, so the
ambassadorial Jaguar had to trace the Gulfstream's path, eventually rescuing
the hapless envoy by the Black Sea.
Maxwell performed at least one service that Bulgaria needed: supplying hard
currency after March 1990 when Lukanov suspended payments on the country's
Dollars 11bn debt and foreign capital was cut off. In mid-1990 Maxwell lent
Pounds 2.1m worth of Swiss francs - a significant sum at that point in
Bulgaria - to the Economic Bank, one of Bulgaria's first private banks.
He also proposed to manage overseas currency reserves of around Pounds 50m
for the Bulgarian central bank. Peter Jay, who negotiated the deal, denies
any discomfort at dealing with the hard-line Bulgarian government. 'This,
not being the Foreign Office, one wasn't provided with briefs of who these
men were,' he says. Jay did not think they were doing anything that the
Foreign Office would not do. 'Ambassadors have meetings with perfectly
dreadful people. One might have a private desire to punch them on the nose,
but etiquette prevents it.'
Did Maxwell's favours go further than that? Prominent members of the United
Democratic Front, the coalition which threw out the communists in October
1990, are convinced that former ministers smuggled hard currency out to
western bank accounts in the months before their government fell; and some
think Maxwell helped them. But the present government, in spite of its
interest, has not so far identified instances of these payments, let alone
proof of Maxwell's aid.
Lukanov, who made frequent, discreet visits to Headington Hill Hall,
Maxwell's Oxfordshire mansion - the last in August 1991 - dismisses the
claims. 'For me he was an outstanding character.'
Indeed, two weeks before the country's first free elections in June 1990,
Maxwell jointly sponsored a Sofia pop concert for 30,000 people with the
Communist party. It was taken as his endorsement of them. He wanted to get
Samantha Fox, the topless model turned pop singer who was performing in a
rival concert, to appear. But the plan came to nothing.
At a party to celebrate his 67th birthday a few days later in Oxford, he was
given a T-shirt reading King of Bulgaria and a paste crown, and was crowned
King of Bulgaria. One of his executives remembers: 'His smile was ear to
ear.'
But even Bulgaria eventually turned against Maxwell - and he later found
other doors closing on him. In France in 1987 he spent FFr750m on buying 12
per cent of TF1, the leading French TV channel, and some Pounds 10m on a
stake in the Grande Arche of La Defense, the prestigious office development
outside Paris. He contributed Pounds 100,000 to the Champs Elysees
bicentennial July 14 parade, which gave him entry to the ministerial
reception, where he spoke to President Francois Mitterand for five minutes.
But he never received the recognition he felt he deserved. When, in early
1991, he was again blocked by restrictions on foreign ownership of media, he
started selling his TF1 stake at a loss.
Administrators of his empire, now trying to salvage money for its creditors,
have found that most of his eastern European investments have been worth
little more than souvenirs - the corporate equivalent of a glass paperweight
with a miniature Kremlin inside.
Maxwell turned finally to Israel. 'Israel was like an island, where he knew
he would be loved, admired, and taken care of,' says Tommy Lapid, editorial
writer on Ma'ariv - the Hebrew-language newspaper - and one of Maxwell's
closest Israeli friends. Israel was Maxwell's greatest foreign success, both
financially and politically - but also the country to which he felt closest.
However, the country now has to explain why it gave him a funeral on the
Mount of Olives, with orations by cabinet ministers. Lapid says: 'Israel has
the same choice as everyone else involved in this. Either we knew, and so we
were crooks, or we didn't know, and we were fools.'
Maxwell's courtship with Israel was sudden. A cousin by marriage, Dov
Yudkovsky, led him to Ya'acov Ne'eman, a prominent Tel Aviv lawyer.
Ne'eman's firm, Herzog, Fox, Ne'eman, is chaired by Israel's president Chaim
Herzog.
Ne'eman led Maxwell to his first Israeli deal: paying Dollars 6.5m in August
1988 for a 26 per cent stake in Ma'ariv which was in acute need of cash.
From then on Maxwell visited Israel three or four times a year, staying in
Room 522 of the King David Hotel, a two-floored penthouse with gold-tapped
jacuzzi. The hotel built a pad for his helicopter on the roof. He bought a
string of businesses. Tel Aviv cars in 1989 carried bumper stickers reading
'Robert Maxwell - Buy Me.'
Ma'ariv launched him to political as well as commercial prominence in
Israel. 'We - and Ne'eman - introduced him to everyone,' says Ido
Dissentchik, Ma'ariv's editor until Maxwell sacked him in 1991.
Maxwell rapidly became friends with three politicians spanning the Israeli
political spectrum: the liberal Shimon Peres, then finance minister of the
Labour party-led government; Ehud Olmert, one of the right-wing Likud
party's rising stars and currently minister of health; and the extreme
right-winger Arik Sharon, then minister of industry and trade.
He was particularly close to the hawkish Sharon. The two huge men would meet
every time Maxwell came to Tel Aviv. Maxwell would often make the short
flight south to Sharon's farm. Our investigations have also revealed that,
in early 1990, at Sharon's request, Maxwell secretly loaned Dollars 1m to a
group of extremist Jewish settlers to help them take over a large building
in the heart of the Christian Quarter of Jerusalem's Old City.
'The money was transferred within two hours after a call from Arik Sharon,'
recalls Ehud Olmert, another cabinet minister. 'It was all paid back later.'
Teddy Kollek, the mayor of Jerusalem with whom Maxwell also frequently met,
denounced the action as a threat to peace, saying the damage done to fragile
communal relations 'will take years to repair'.
Does this depth of influence throughout Israeli society point to connections
with Mossad? Olmert is vehement it does not, and a senior adviser to the
Ministry of Defence, who asked not to be quoted, is strongly of the same
opinion. They, and Ma'ariv directors, point out that Maxwell's unreliability
and love of publicity made him an improbable spy.
Maxwell entirely failed to win over the prime minister Yitzhak Shamir,
himself a former Mossad agent. The two met several times - but the cautious
and secretive Shamir loathed Maxwell's boasting and indiscretion.
The extent of Maxwell's influence can be explained instead by his promises
of money at a time when Israel was anxious for outside investment, and
partly by Israeli naivety.
A former aide to Peres says: 'When someone of his status in the world
mentions Ronald Reagan, Gorbachev, Margaret Thatcher, it affects people. The
size of his presence in a room, the way he spoke, created the impression
that you should take notice of this guy because he could really do something
for the economy.'
However, he repeatedly misunderstood Israeli sensitivities. At a Ma'ariv
board meeting Maxwell picked up the phone to clinch a deal with the German
supplier of printing equipment. Showing off to his executives, he concluded
'and give them a discount for the Holocaust'. Dissentchik says: 'I told him:
'I am going to kill you if you don't take that back.' And he said 'Did I
really say that?' He hadn't noticed.'
Yet many still feel warmly about him. Lapid argues: 'He epitomised a great
deal of what we admire: a Jew who survived the Holocaust, who made it.'
Three months before Maxwell died, Lapid went with him to Jerusalem's
Holocaust museum. 'I held him when he was shaking, crying. It is an
automatic bond'.
The funeral remains an embarrassment. Dissentchik argues: 'This was not the
state funeral it seemed. There isn't such a thing in Israel, it's too new
and too informal. The president, Herzog, went because he was president of
Ne'eman's law firm, and he didn't go to the graveside, just to the memorial
service in the centre of town. Sharon, Olmert and Peres went as friends.
Shamir went, reluctantly.' Lapid adds: 'It came out of the drama of the
situation. He wouldn't have got it if he had died after a long illness.'
Peres will not discuss it, saying he finds the episode too painful. But a
former aides says: 'Peres now feels he was made a fool of, that his judgment
of character is dented. The funeral was clearly a terrible mistake. It is
part of the price Israel pays for an absence of tradition. It will never
happen again.'
WHAT THEY SAID WHEN HE DIED
'Mr and Mrs Maxwell were great supporters of charity and were often
present at receptions to raise money for purposes from hospitals, to
children and the arts. Mr Maxwell had wide contacts throughout eastern
Europe and kept me informed about what was happening in those countries
and what their leaders were thinking.'
Margaret Thatcher
'He was a charismatic figure who supported the European cause. In this
he was a tower of strength.'
Edward Heath
'Robert Maxwell brought the most tremendous flair, zest, and enthusiasm
to everything he did.'
Lord Callaghan
'Mr Maxwell's ebullient character was a unique part of our national
scene.'
Paddy Ashdown
'His tragic disappearance robs Britain of one of our most colourful and
energetic figures. He was a man of action. He was truly larger than life
and the world will be poorer for his absence.'
Douglas Hurd
'He was a steadfast supporter of the Labour party and a man with genuine
committment to the advancement of the British people. I valued his
personal friendship and the fact that, even when our judgement diverged,
he was always willing to sustain his enthusiasm for the Labour cause.'
Neil Kinnock
'I can't believe that even the sea could overcome him. It is impossible
to compare him with anybody. He was so above comparison.'
Shimon Peres
'He was a great character who will be missed. I am sure he would not
want us to grieve at his loss but marvel at a quite extraordinary life,
lived to the full. No-one should doubt his interest in peace and his
loyalty to friends.'
John Major
'I knew him, especially in recent times, as a person who invested money
in Israel and who put his wide contacts on the international arena at
Israel's service.'
Yitzhak Shamir
'The world famous publisher and personal friend. . .contributed greatly
to the improvement of relations between nations in the important
business of mass media management and publishing.'
Mikhail Gorbachev

THE US government has filed the biggest lawsuit to date against the officers
and associates of a failed savings and loan institution - a Dollars 1.5bn
(Pounds 820m) legal action charging former officials of the Arizona-based
Western Savings and Loan with civil fraud and racketeering, writes Alan
Friedman in New York.
The lawsuit was filed at the weekend by the Resolution Trust Corporation
(RTC), the federal agency responsible for disposing of assets of failed
savings and loan groups. The RTC, in an attempt to recover damages, has over
the past year filed more than 100 claims against former savings and loan
officials across the US.
Among those named in the lawsuit is Mr John Driggs, Western's former
chairman and the scion of a prominent Arizona family that founded the group
in 1929.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Collor confronts reality after summit triumph
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Fernando Collor of Brazil flew back to Braslia and harsh reality
yesterday after two weeks of presiding over the world's largest-ever
gathering of heads of state.
Widely praised for his government's handling of the Earth Summit in Rio de
Janeiro, Mr Collor returned to the capital to face mounting economic and
political problems.
He did not have a good start. The stock market fell 8 per cent yesterday
morning on a new wave of corruption allegations involving Mr Collor,
although it regained some ground later in the day to close 6 per cent down.
The charges came in an interview published on Sunday with Mr Luis Octavio da
Motta Veiga, a former head of Petrobras, the state oil company.
Mr Motta Veiga made detailed allegations of the power wielded in the
government by the president's friends, and said he had been dismissed
because he refused to allow them to influence appointments or the award of
contracts.
He said he thought the Collor government 'will not escape cleanly' from a
parliamentary inquiry under way into alleged extortion by Mr Paulo Cesar
Farias, Mr Collor's campaign treasurer and close friend.
The inquiry, which began on the first day of the Earth Summit, was prompted
by allegations against Mr Farias and Mr Collor by the president's younger
brother Pedro, and has only been kept off the front pages for the last two
weeks by the conference.
This is not Mr Collor's only problem. Inflation is rising again, last month
reaching 22.5 per cent, and an expected turnround in growth has not come.
Businessmen are once more increasing prices rapidly, fearing another price
freeze.
One of the most pressing concerns is a possible collapse of the country's
accord with the International Monetary Fund. Having failed to meet
first-quarter targets in April, Mr Marcilio Marques Moreira, the economy
minister, admits those of the second period may also be missed because of
continuing high inflation and interest rates which are resulting in an
explosion in domestic debt.
The accord, signed in January, had been based on inflation falling to 2 per
cent a month by December. However, after a meeting with Mr Michel Camdessus,
IMF managing director, Mr Moreira said he was confident the accord would not
collapse because 'the IMF is happy with the thrust of our economic policy.'

FT  16 JUN 92 / Ghost of Dukakis slain by Massachusetts tax-cutter: A
Republican governor who calls himself a 'filthy supply sider'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STUFFED armadillo adorns a mantelpiece in the office of Mr William Weld,
governor of Massachusetts.
It is an appropriate, if unintended, symbol of the thick skin the Republican
Mr Weld has required in the 17 months since he became governor and began to
make radical changes in the way the traditionally Democratic state is run.
Through deep cuts in welfare programmes and the civil service, Mr Weld has
succeeded in bringing Massachusett's run-away budget under control - to the
point where he is now trying to push through the legislature modest tax cuts
in a state formerly known as 'Taxachusetts'. This contrasts with the tax
increases many states have been pushing through to cope with a recessionary
shortfall in revenues.
He has also put Massachusetts at the forefront of America's fledgling
'entrepreneurial government' movement, which seeks to make the bureaucracy
more efficient through the use of business techniques and the privatisation
of services.
All this has made Mr Weld plenty of enemies. Church leaders have accused him
of showing a 'callous disregard for the poorest'. Democratic politicians
have attacked his proposed tax cuts as irresponsible financial legerdemain.
The state's teachers, upset about budget cuts, threatened to strike.
But the opinion polls show Mr Weld remains solidly popular with the
electorate.
That is hardly surprising, given that he was elected on a wave of revulsion
against high taxes, politics-as-usual and the Democratic machine of Mr
Michael Dukakis, the former governor and 1988 Democratic presidential
candidate .
Mr Dukakis enjoyed great popularity in the mid-1980s as the state economy
outpaced the national average, thanks to a boom in the defence and computer
industries, which in turn fed a speculative property bubble.
But the bubble burst and New England plunged into a severe recession, which
took with it some 10 per cent of the region's jobs and nearly 100 of its
banks. The much-vaunted 'Massachusetts miracle' turned to dust, and Mr
Dukakis's reputation with it.
Mr Weld, a Harvard and Oxford educated lawyer from a wealthy New England
family, likes to characterise himself as a 'filthy supply sider' - a
follower of the tax-cutting economic theories popularised by former
President Ronald Reagan.
Yet his blend of policies defies traditional conservative/liberal labelling:
on some social issues he is well to the left of Republican orthodoxy, for
example favouring abortion rights and strong controls on environmental
pollution. At the same time he is tough on crime, wanting to restore the
death penalty and impose much tighter prisoner parole guidelines.
Some analysts argue that all this makes the 46-year-old governor an example
of a new type of politician - drawn from, and appealing to, the 'baby boom'
generation - who cuts across traditional ideologies.
Certainly, some of the 'entrepreneurial government' ideas he is pursuing are
also being tried by Democratic governors, including Mr Bill Clinton, the
party's likely presidential nominee, in Arkansas. Mr Weld, however, is
taking these ideas further than most other states, with initiatives which
include:
Slimming the bureaucracy and improving its efficiency by reducing
bottlenecks, for example by speeding up the issuing of permits for hazardous
waste disposal. He is also trying to bring rocketing medical aid costs under
control, one of the most difficult tasks facing any state government.
In his 1993 budget he is also trying to shift the focus of debate from
'inputs' - how much money each department receives - to 'outputs' or just
what services they will provide with the funds. For example, one target for
the Registry of Motor Vehicles is to cut the average wait for a driving
licence to 25 minutes.
Contracting out to the private sector services previously performed by
government agencies. For example, he has closed or consolidated nine
under-used hospitals and put their patients in private-sector care. He has
put the maintenance of part of the highway system out to bidding and wants
to privatise the processing of child support cheques.
He is considering selling off two large state assets to private owners -
Boston's Logan Airport and the Massachusetts Turnpike. Studies have
suggested the former could be worth Dollars 786m (Pounds 431.8m) and the
latter Dollars 944m. However, selling either would involve some serious
administrative difficulties, and it is not clear that the governor has the
political will to pursue this.
For one thing, his first priority is to form a regional authority which
would develop coherent transport policies. For another, he insists: 'I don't
have any bias in favour of privatisation. I dont want to privatise anything
unless it works, unless we're going to get a more efficient operation.
'You bear the burden of proving citizens are going to get a superior service
for the same price, or same service at a lower price.'
Critics point out that his budget balancing has been helped by the first
stirrings of a regional economic revival, as well as by the tax increases
pushed through by the Dukakis regime.
Consumer confidence in New England is up, the unemployment rate is edging
down, and the slightly better mood was underlined recently when one of the
region's largest financial institutions, Bank of Boston, pledged to ease a
credit crunch by making Dollars 3bn available for new business loans.
Not everything has gone Mr Weld's way. Under pressure from the
Democratic-controlled legislature, which has been surprisingly accommodating
to most of his proposals, he has shelved some of his most draconian welfare
measures and done an apparent about-face on cuts in education spending.
Critics also argue that his reforms are less substantive than his reputation
suggests, and point out that Massachusetts remains one of the highest
welfare spending states in the US.
But a year and a half is too short a time in which to pass judgment on the
changes Mr Weld is attempting. As he says: 'Entrepreneurial government is a
crap game that keeps on rolling.'

FT  16 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Air France discounts US fares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIR FRANCE fell into line with other European Airlines yesterday by cutting
fares on transatlantic flights originating in the US. But Mr Bernard Attali,
Air France chairman, said the price war was 'worrisome', and warned airline
profits would be damaged.
Air France is offering discounts of up to 35 per cent in line with fares
introduced last week by most airlines operating across the US. Mr Attali
said the fare-cutting was the inevitable result of US airlines' increasing
their summer capacity 30 per cent. The fare war was 'to the detriment of the
results of all companies'. Discounts are for dearer tickets and aimed at
business travellers. Airline passenger numbers have recovered this year from
a 1991 depressed by recession and the Gulf war. But they are barely higher
than in 1990; the improvement largely results from a rise in leisure
travellers buying cheap tickets.
A row has been simmering between France and the US over the growing market
share taken by US carriers of flights between the two countries. Under an
accord earlier this year, US carriers can raise their capacity to France 30
per cent this summer, but below the 45 per cent the US sought and above the
15 per cent France wanted. Mr Attali said he would like a new pact to match
capacity and the number of airlines flying more closely to market growth.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Foreign policy to the fore as Bush raises his TV profile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE political stalemate in Washington can be ended by the election of a
Republican congress and president, according to President George Bush.
This unsurprising advice was delivered in the course of Mr Bush's gentle
introduction to one-on-one television, an afternoon Cable News Network
interview mostly devoted, at the president's request, to foreign policy
issues.
The president declined to answer the one question about Mr Ross Perot, the
prospective independent candidate, repeating that he would wait until after
the Republican convention in August before taking the opposition on
directly.
But when asked if the best way to get things done in Washington was to have
a Democratic majority in congress working with Mr Bill Clinton, he recalled
the history of the Carter administration as demonstrating the fallacy of the
proposition.
He insisted the opposition of entrenched Democrats had made it harder to get
his own ideas and policies on education, the environment, inner cities and
crime enacted. In this 'crazy' election year, he said, a new Republican
majority was conceivable.
Mr Bush said he might appear on some of the more popular talk shows, but
said it would be 'beneath presidential dignity' to invite all and sundry to
call the White House on a toll-free number.
Mr Clinton did two more hours on a breakfast-time show yesterday, repeating
his criticism of a black singer who, in his view, was exacerbating racial
disharmony. Meanwhile, Mr Perot, temporarily forsaking his chosen talk show
genre, was embarking on a conventional speech-making cross-country tour.

missile rules

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEW US regulations intended to tighten controls on exports of missile
technology have targeted Brazil along with other countries whose missile
development programmes have traditionally aroused US scrutiny, such as Iran
and North Korea.
Several Brazilian missile and satellite launch projects have been included
on a new list subject to special licensing requirements. Ms Joan McEntee,
acting Commerce Department under-secretary for export administration, said
that the list would be used for export licensing, but 'should not be viewed
as a sanction against foreign countries'.
However, the inclusion of Brazil follows President George Bush's return from
Rio de Janeiro, where he took part in the Earth Summit.
US exporters will require individual validated licences for shipments to
Brazil's Sonda III, Sonda IV, SS-300, SS-1000, MB/EE Series Missile and VLS
Space Launch Vehicle. Other countries with missile projects on the list are
China, India, Pakistan, and South Africa, as well as Iran and North Korea
with their Scud projects.
The list also includes the entire Middle East, without naming individual
countries or projects. Commerce Department officials said this was because
concern about the area was more regional. But in the past this device has
been used to avoid offending Israel and Egypt, the US's main allies in the
region.

<TEXT>
SUN ALLIANCE, the UK's biggest insurance company, is to strengthen its ties
with the People's Insurance Company of China, as part of efforts to raise
its profile in the fast-growing Far East insurance markets.
Representatives of the two companies yesterday signed an 'understanding'
intended to pave the way for a formal co-operation agreement by October of
this year.
Mr Tony Barron, director of Sun Alliance (Overseas), said the accord was 'a
long-term strategic move'. The group, with an existing Hong Kong subsidiary,
eventually hopes to insure business directly in the potentially huge Chinese
market.
Sun Alliance has provided training facilities for PICC and will provide
technical and other support for PICC's operations in China and the UK, where
the China Insurance Office provides a service to the Chinese community.
Worldwide co-operation is likely to extend to underwriting and specialist
services, and the exchange of technical and market information.
The British group has marked the Far East, Europe and North America as areas
for expansion. In Asia, it has forged links with Lucky Insurance Company in
South Korea and Taisho in Japan. In Europe, it has signed an agreement with
Helvetia of Switzerland. It also has less formalised links with Vesta group
in Norway and Atlantica in Sweden.
Reuter reports from Taipei: Taiwan will try to establish air links with 19
countries over the next five years, Mr Eugene Chien, the country's
communications minister, said yesterday.
'Our airlines will fly to 45 destinations and more than 40 foreign airlines
will fly to our country in five years' time,' Mr Chien told a meeting of
senior government officials.
At present, Taiwan's three international airlines fly to 26 destinations and
24 foreign airlines have landing rights on the island.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LI GUIXIAN, governor of the People's Bank of China, today opens a
representative office in London, the central bank's first outside China,
writes Alexander Nicoll.
The office is a sign of a more outward-looking approach from the Chinese
authorities as they proceed with 'open door' economic reforms.
The Bank of China, a state-owned commercial bank, already has a London
operation and opens a new building in the City this week.
As well as being an observation point for European economic developments,
the central bank's office could be useful in the management of China's
rapidly growing foreign exchange reserves, which exceed Dollars 42bn (Pounds
22.7bn).
As part of the reforms, the People's Bank was officially designated the
central bank in 1984. It oversees the banking system, which is still in
great need of restructuring, partly because much lending is directed to
loss-making state-owned industries at subsidised interest rates.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Economy slows enough to fall off its cycle: Fears that the
lengthening downturn is more serious than just a cyclical matter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCK MARKET investors have delivered a damning judgment on the current
state of the Japanese economy.
On Friday, the Nikkei index fell 325 points after the publication of the
Bank of Japan's latest report on economic trends, which showed business
confidence at its lowest level for five years. Yesterday, the Nikkei tumbled
a further 430 points to 16,953, below the psychologically important 17,000
level.
The economy is entering a critical period, as a slowdown which started early
in 1991 reaches and exceeds 15-18 months, the average duration of post-war
downturns.
The stock market's latest plunge will increase the calls for government
action to halt the slide. Businessmen, led by Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, the
chairman of the Keidanren, the employers' federation, want to see further
cuts in interest rates and an increase in spending on public works. So do
financiers, concerned about the debilitating impact of slow economic growth
on share and land prices. So do the US and the EC which are convinced that
the slow down in Japan's domestic economy is fuelling a rapid expansion in
the country's trade surplus.
Pressure from all these quarters will come to a head in the next few weeks
as Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, prepares for the summit
of the Group of Seven leading industrialised countries in Munich early next
month and for parliamentary elections in Japan at the end of July.
The government and the Bank of Japan insist there are no plans for new
economy-boosting measures to follow the interest rate cuts and public works
programme announced in April. But there is a growing belief in Tokyo that
the authorities are preparing for action.
The government's official view is that the economy is going through nothing
more serious than a cyclical slowdown, albeit one that is particularly
severe. The Economic Planning Agency believes a recovery will start in the
autumn and stands by a forecast of economic growth of 3.5 per cent for the
current financial year ending March 1993.
But private sector economists believe the target is unattainable. Many have
cut their forecasts to 2 per cent and below. For the US or Europe, this
figure would be quite acceptable for an economy moving through the bottom of
the economic cycle. However, Japanese officials and businessmen, accustomed
to high-speed growth, regard anything below 3 per cent as a recession.
The economic data offers plenty of evidence in support of those calling for
immediate government action. But it is not conclusive - there is enough
positive data to give the authorities good grounds for waiting a little
longer.
Last week's Bank of Japan report was on the face of it gloomy - it showed
the index of confidence among manufacturers plunged from minus-5 per cent in
February to minus-24 per cent in May. For non-manufacturers the index fell
from 17 per cent to 1 per cent. The report also forecast a 2.1 per cent
decline in capital investment in the financial year, including an 8.9 per
cent fall in investment in manufacturing.
But the survey also found the odd chink of light - including hints of a
recovery in business sentiment in the autumn. Government officials were
quick to seize on this point as possible indication of a pick-up in the
economy later this year. The EPA said: 'There is a bottoming-out of
sentiment. Businessmen don't see things getting any worse.'
Government officials will also take comfort from a report to be published
today which is expected to show GNP expanded by an annualised rate of around
4 per cent in the first quarter of 1992. This is much better than had been
expected a few months ago - an indication that authorities have been right
in emphasising the resilience of the Japanese economy.
However, GNP data from the first quarter is a better guide to the past than
to the future. Growth in the second quarter is likely to have been much
slower.
For example, there is no sign of a recovery in machinery orders, an
indicator of likely future trends in capital investment. The latest figure,
for April, showed a 20.9 per cent decline from the same month in 1991.
Similarly, despite steep cuts in industrial production, companies are
failing to reduce their inventories of unsold goods as fast as they planned.
There is good news from some corners of the economy - notably a modest
recovery in housebuilding - but it is outweighed by the bad.
Furthermore, a mountain of debt from the 1980s overshadows the economy.
Figures published yesterday show how the burden of servicing loans taken out
for speculative stock and property investments in the 1980s is driving more
and more companies into bankruptcy. Banks and financial institutions,
dragged down with estimated bad and doubtful debts of more than Y40,000bn,
(Pounds 172bn) could find it hard to finance new loans in future.
It is in this context that the debate over possible action to boost the
economy is gathering pace. The Bank of Japan's position is that it is still
monitoring the effect of the last cut in the official discount rate in
April, when it was reduced by 0.75 percentage points to 3.75 per cent. For
its part, the ministry of finance is resisting calls for extra measures to
follow the package announced in April when some public works spending
planned for the second half of the fiscal year was brought forward to the
first six months.
However, finance ministry officials acknowledge that some extra spending
will be needed to fill the gap created in the public works programme in the
second half of the year. The question is how much. Officials opposed to
increases in public borrowing argue that as little as Y1,000bn extra should
be spent. At the other extreme, leading politicians in the ruling Liberal
Democratic party want a supplementary budget of Y7,000bn to Y8,000bn.
Given that the financial year is less than three months old, the authorities
may be tempted to wait in the hope of an autumn recovery.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Israelis ponder limited choice as poll nears: Despite the
election, there is rapport between Rabin and Shamir
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Israel goes to the polls a week today, they will face a choice for
prime minister between two men whose combined age is not far off 150, who
have little natural affinity for the business of politics and whose
respective parties harbour significant dissent over their leadership.
One party - Labour - has made its septuagenarian, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the main
focus of its campaign to unseat the ruling Likud party which it accuses of
squandering a priceless opportunity for Israel through a foot-dragging
approach to the Middle East peace negotiations launched last October in
Madrid.
Likud has by contrast given the lowest possible profile to Mr Yitzhak
Shamir, party leader since 1983, prime minister since 1987 and now 76 years
of age, in its effort to extend a 15-year run in government.
Tonight Mr Rabin and Mr Shamir meet in their only television debate of the
campaign. It will afford voters the opportunity to judge whether the two
offer genuinely divergent paths for the country or whether their own
preferred outcome to the election would be a coalition with each other.
When Labour chose Mr Rabin to replace Mr Shimon Peres as its leader in
February, it looked like a case of 'back to the future' for the party. Mr
Rabin had been party leader and prime minister more than 15 years
previously.
He did not shine as prime minister and resigned over a minor financial
scandal when his wife was revealed to hold illegal bank accounts in the US.
He is a plodding orator who, like Mr Shamir, looks distinctly uncomfortable
on the campaign trail. With a week to go to polling, he is already flushed
and exhausted, his voice cracked and nagged by a smoker's cough. Both he and
the prime minister must be glad that election broadcast rules forbid news
coverage of their rallies and speeches.
But Mr Rabin is trading on his genuine popularity as a former military hero
and uncompromising defence minister. As the Labour party has hammered home
over this month's 25th anniversary celebrations, he was chief of staff
during the 1967 Six Day War. His whole election pitch is based on winning
over Likud voters who traditionally regard Labour as too soft on security
issues and ace talks.
Mr Rabin undoubtedly differs sharply from Mr Shamir in his belief that
Israel must give up some of the occupied territories captured in 1967 in
exchange for peace. But in his campaign, this is hardly mentioned.
In the town of Shelomi near the Lebanese border recently, Mr Rabin was
hosted at a 'house call' by a family of former Likud supporters who are now
backing Labour. Mr Rabin spent most of his address to a 150-strong crowd
implying that it was he, not Mr Shamir and his colleagues in the Likud, who
was more in the tradition of Mr Menachem Begin, the hardline Likud prime
minister and darling of the party who died earlier this year.
'It is the Likud that has deserted you, not you that are deserting the Likud
when you vote for us,' said Mr Rabin.
The Likud rebuttal is that, far from stamping his authority on Labour, Mr
Rabin's leadership is a front behind which the party's 'doves' are hiding.
Supporters of a more radical approach to the peace process than Mr Rabin
occupy a string of top positions in the party. A vote for Rabin, goes the
Likud message in their nightly television broadcasts, is a vote for
capitulation to the PLO.
Likud's problem is the lack of a figurehead to rise above its chronic
internal squabbles and overcome an image of corruption and economic
incompetence born of having been so long in office. Nobody accuses Mr Shamir
of being anything but a tough man of principle. But he lacks utterly the
charisma of Mr Begin that Likud needs to inspire its increasingly cynical
supporters.
At Shamir rallies, when typically the prime minister he shakes a few hands
then disappears by helicopter as fast as he can, pictures of Mr Begin are
more prominent than his own, particularly among the majority Sephardim
(Oriental Jews) who form such a vital segment of Likud support.
'The Sephardim looked for a father figure and found him in Begin. Shamir is
a leader, but he's not a father figure,' says Mr Shaul Amor, a senior Likud
MP and mayor of the largely Sephardi Galilee town of Migdal Haemek.
Mr Amor thinks Labour will have the edge over Likud next week. If the gap is
as much as eight seats, as the polls have suggested, Mr Rabin will be in a
powerful position. But Mr Amor doubts a swing sufficient to allow Mr Rabin
to form a majority coalition with Labour's small-party allies. Equally, he
doubts Mr Shamir could form a workable coalition with extreme right-wing
parties opposed to the peace talks which, he says, 'the majority of Likud
voters really, really want.'
He therefore attaches great significance to the rapport that exists between
Mr Rabin and Mr Shamir. It was they who together formulated the 1989
Likud-Labour peace plan designed to set a process in motion without
compromising their different ideologies. 'Shamir and Rabin always got
along,' says Mr Amor. 'I assume there is going to be a Rabin-Shamir
government.'

MILLIONS of South Africans will stay away from work today to mark the
anniversary of the 1976 Soweto uprising and to observe the start of an
African National Congress campaign of mass action aimed at breaking a
deadlock in constitutional talks.
The ANC believes that the government is stalling in negotiations at the
Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa), the national negotiating
forum, and that mass action is necessary to force it to quicken the process.
Codesa failed last month to agree on the the details of a
constitution-making body. Although this subject was yesterday returned to at
Codesa, no breakthrough was expected until progress had been made in
bilateral meetings between the government and the ANC.
The mass action has been widely denounced by the ANC's political opponents,
particularly the government.

   BEIRUT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAST two western hostages in Lebanon - the Germans Heinrich Struebig and
Thomas Kemptner - were freed last night after being held for three years.
Their release closed a ten-year chapter in Lebanese history when few
foreigners ventured into the once cosmopolitan country for fear of being
kidnapped.
The continued detention of Mr Struebig, 51 and Mr Kemptner, 30, deprived
Lebanon of hundreds of millions of dollars in German and European Community
reconstruction aid in recent months.
The Beirut office of the Iranian news agency, Irna, said the two aid workers
were handed over to representatives of the German and Lebanese governments.
Lebanese officials said later the men were remaining under tight security at
a secret location in Beirut before being handed over to senior German envoys
at an official ceremony today.
Sources involved in the long negotiations said the German government refused
to pay ransom for the hostages or even discuss the possibility of liberating
Mohammed and Abbas Hamadi, the two Shia Moslem Lebanese brothers whose
freedom was demanded by the kidnappers. The men are in jail in Germany for
murder and kidnapping.
In recent months, the governments of Lebanon, Iran and Syria put unrelenting
pressure on Mr Abdul-Hadi Hamadi, security chief of the pro-Iranian
Hizbollah militia, who was responsible for the Germans' abduction. He is a
brother of Mohammed and Abbas Hamadi.
Last night's release marked the first time that the Lebanese government was
directly involved in the liberation of western hostages. Lebanon desperately
needs reconstruction aid blocked by Germany pending the release, and
President Elias Hrawi's government in February established a special
commission to work for the Germans' freedom.
A Lebanese delegation went to Tehran to win Iranian support and Mr Ali Akbar
Velayati, the Iranian foreign minister, made his first official visit to
Beirut last week. His meetings with government and Hizbollah officials are
believed to have been decisive in final arrangements for the Germans'
release.
Iran - whose principal western trade partner is Germany - sought to
eliminate an impediment in trade relations and achieve greater acceptance in
the west.
Like Lebanon and Iran, Syria stood to gain a degree of rehabilitation in
western eyes by helping to end the hostage saga.
Mr Giandomenico Picco, the United Nations envoy who engineered the
liberation of nine British and American hostages last year, also assisted in
the negotiations, shuttling between New York, Bonn and the Middle East.
Mr Picco arrived in Damascus at the weekend to deal with a last minute
hitch. The kidnappers had wanted to release one hostage now, the other
later.
Security sources in Lebanon claimed the Germans, unlike other hostages, had
sympathised with their captors' motives.

FT  16 JUN 92 / BIS Annual Report: More regulation of world finance urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BASLE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HIGH DEBTS and weak property prices in much of the developed world will
hamper a return to strong global growth, Mr Bengt Dennis, chairman of the
Bank for International Settlements, said yesterday. Speaking at the annual
meeting in Basle of the central bankers' bank, he said governments had been
too lax in easing credit restrictions in the 1980s and would have to step up
efforts to regulate the wave of new financial activities triggered by
liberalisation.
Much of the tone of Mr Dennis's comments was backed up in the annual report
of the BIS, also released yesterday, but it gave a somewhat brighter view of
economic prospects in the industrial nations.
'Grounds for optimism' existed partly because of signs of revival in the US
and strong growth in much of the developing world, including Latin America
and east Asia.
The report voices doubts, however, about whether the economies of European
Community nations can move close enough to make economic and monetary union
feasible, without unacceptably large fiscal transfers or high unemployment.
Efforts to establish European economic and monetary union by the end of the
century may run into technical difficulties, it says.
Reflecting the views of BIS officials rather than those of the 32 central
banks which own the organisation, the report sparked friction with some bank
governors with a series of comments about prospects for Emu.
The report, written before the Danish referendum on the Maastricht treaty,
said many European governments 'were not unhappy about the lack of public
debate in their countries prior to the Maastricht summit and did little or
nothing to stimulate it'. It added: 'Having managed to spring the programme
on a largely unprepared public they are now faced with debate and dissention
very late in the day.'
The BIS report also spelt out some of the difficulties for the banking
sector due to bad debts and weak economies in much of the developed world.
It said international banking assets, as measured by cross-border and local
foreign currency claims, fell last year by Dollars 102bn - thought to be the
first decline since the 1940s.

FT  16 JUN 92 / BIS Annual Report: Cross-border securities show a double
appeal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BASLE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INCREASED globalisation of financial markets and extra demands on fund
managers to squeeze out profits forced a doubling last year in cross-border
securities investments in the industrialised world.
According to the BIS annual report, total cross-border transfers of funds
into investments such as equities and bonds last year totalled Dollars
388.7bn (Pounds 213.5bn) - roughly equivalent to Spain's GDP.
This was more than double the relatively modest Dollars 159.1bn recorded in
1990, and well up on the Dollars 186bn which was the average for the years
between 1985 and 1989.
Last year's jump in investments, most of which were made by large banks and
other financial groups, reflects an increased demand among fund managers to
scout out the best opportunities for increasing profits on investments - a
trend to which the poor state of the economy in many industrial countries
last year may have contributed.
It also reflects last year's problems in the banking sector which led to a
large amount of funds being withdrawn from banks and placed in equities and
bonds. The large increase in transfers may also have been assisted by last
year's roller-coaster movement of the dollar against other leading
currencies.
The behaviour of the US currency - which appreciated heavily in the first
six months of 1991 before falling back later on - may have encouraged a
greater amount of switching in and out of dollar-denominated securities.
Though the Japanese stock market last year performed relatively poorly,
foreign investors placed a record Dollars 47bn in Japanese equities after
being net sellers to the tune of Dollars 13bn the previous year.
The US Federal Reserve and the German Bundesbank conducted an unusual swap
arrangement last year under which the Fed sold Dollars 5.5bn-worth of
D-Marks to the German central bank in an attempt to reduce the US's
rapidly-growing foreign currency reserves. According to the BIS's annual
report, the manoeuvre was behind a net Dollars 5.6bn fall last year in the
US's reserves to Dollars 66.7bn. Last year, the Fed also arranged a similar
deal with the Bank Of Japan under which it sold about Dollars 3bn-worth of
yen in a further bid to cut its reserves.
Taiwan's foreign currency reserves (up by Dollars 10bn to Dollars 82.4bn
last year) have become the world's largest single stock of such assets.
In second place are the foreign currency reserves of Japan (Dollars 72.0bn),
the BIS says. Others in the top eight rank as follows: US (Dollars 66.7bn),
Spain (Dollars 65.8bn), Germany (Dollars 63.0bn), Italy (Dollars 48.7bn),
China (Dollars 43.7bn) and UK (Dollars 41.9bn).

FT  16 JUN 92 / BIS Annual Report: E Europe pressed to cut public spending
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GOVERNMENTS in eastern Europe should sharply reduce public spending and
reform their tax systems if they are to improve on the 'dismal and
disappointing' performances of their economies since the fall of communism,
according to the BIS.
The bank says that after a collapse in output last year in several of the
nations of the former communist bloc, prospects of a return to growth are
poor. The region faces dangers of prolonged high unemployment and 'reform
fatigue'.
Many of the nations continue to suffer high inflation, delays in privatising
state-owned enterprises, large government deficits and poorly developed
taxation systems and financial markets.
Reforms in much of the region should be aimed at reducing the size of the
public sector relative to gross domestic product. Subsidies to inefficient
enterprises should be cut, leaving room for an increase in public
investment.
Failure to reduce state spending in this way could lead to the need to
impose punitive tax rates, which would further reduce growth prospects, the
BIS says.
Weaknesses in the present tax systems include their emphasis on taxing
profits of mainly state-owned enterprises, rather than taking a proportion
of the incomes of households.
Also, the levels at which the tax systems claw revenues from economic
activity are mostly established with reference to prices set by the state
rather than those determined by the market.
Shifting the burden of taxation from the state-owned enterprises requires
'an extension of the tax administration to cover households and private
enterprises, including the adoption of an unambiguous definition of profits
and accounting rules for depreciation and deduction of interest payments'.
It says that of the nations in the region, only Hungary has attempted to
introduce a system of value added tax directed at taxing goods with
reference to market prices.

</HEADLINE>

   BASLE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MULTINATIONAL companies shifted emphasis in their investment strategies last
year away from the industrial world and towards developing nations, the BIS
annual report says.
Latin America was one large beneficiary of the diversion in spending power,
which was due partly to the fragility of the economies in many developed
nations and to the increased interest by many large companies in building up
operations in the non-industrialised world.
Meanwhile, Japanese overseas investment, especially in the US, was sharply
curtailed. The BIS says this reflects both the weak state of the US economy
and the relatively poor returns by Japanese companies on their capital
spending in North America.
Eastern Europe also saw a large increase in foreign investment, although
from a small base.
Total foreign investment, which is mainly by western-based multinational
companies, reached an estimated Dollars 177.3bn last year, about a fifth
down on the Dollars 222.4bn in 1990.
In terms of the direction of investment, spending in the industrial
countries came to Dollars 115.2bn, 23 per cent down from Dollars 148.7bn in
1990. Investment in the developing nations came to Dollars 42.7bn, 38 per
cent up on the Dollars 30.9bn recorded in the previous year.
Of total foreign investment, the share which ended up in the industrial
world went down to 73 per cent from 83 per cent in 1990, while the share in
the developing countries increased to 27 per cent from 17 per cent.
Spending in Latin America rose to Dollars 12bn from Dollars 7.8bn, largely
due to liberalisation in trade policies, greater openness to foreign
involvement and more stable macroeconomic policies.
Investment in Asia also showed a steady increase to Dollars 25.7bn from
Dollars 19.9bn. As well as reflecting the activities of western-based
multinational companies, much of this spending came from funds supplied by
companies in high-income Asian countries such as Taiwan and South Korea,
which flowed into lower income nations including China, Indonesia, Malaysia
and Thailand.
Investment by overseas businesses in eastern Europe reached Dollars 2.3bn in
1991, after just Dollars 500m the year before.

THE BIS proposes a special clearing system as a last resort to prevent a
breakdown in trade among the republics of the Commonwealth of Independent
States,
It says the west needs to provide external finance while Russia and the
other republics make the transition to market economies. The most valuable
help, however, would be to allow the CIS free access to western markets.
Although the CIS's struggle to adjust is the most striking new feature of
the world economic landscape, the BIS says its debt does not seriously
threaten the financial system.
The rouble could be used to finance trade if it were stabilised and made
convertible, but plans by some republics to introduce their own currencies
risk eroding the rouble area.

FT  16 JUN 92 / BIS Annual Report: Warning on financial markets - Costs of
liberalisation 'underestimated by developed world'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BASLE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE developed world has underestimated the costs of liberalising its
financial markets, the BIS annual report says. Governments must take steps
to tackle the problems triggered by liberalisation, for example supervision
of financial groups which are outside the regulatory framework.
Also, authorities should try to develop new systems of crisis management
which might be needed to tackle unexpected events such as stock market
crashes whose impact may be heightened by looser regulation.
According to the bank, the looser shackles covering financial and banking
activities in many nations offer 'major opportunities but also commensurate
risks'. Not enough has been done to tackle these last areas.
A particular problem is the surge in volume of money transferred among
financial groups across national borders. As a result, the banks involved in
these transfers 'now incur unprecedented . . . liquidity and credit
exposures, potentially on a larger scale than the exposures traditionally
captured in their balance sheets and often less closely monitored and
controlled.'
The bank says fluctuations in the market price of assets is an important
source of potential shocks to the financial system, which can take the form
of events such as the 1987 stockmarket crash.
The BIS said that many potential problems in financial markets had stemmed
from 'the growing complexity of organisational structures typified by the
emergence of national and international financial conglomerates'.
Such organisations were often difficult for individual authorities in a
single country to monitor efficiently - in which case greater pooling of
information on supervisory activities should be agreed by governments.
According to the BIS, the recent BCCI scandal represents one example where
'banking industry financial globalisation has allowed ample scope for the
creation of opaque corporate structures.' It adds: 'Under these conditions
the evaluation of risks . . . becomes considerably more difficult.'
Governments need to co-ordinate their supervisory activities by, for
instance, setting up schemes to share out potential financial losses. Also,
individual institutions should build into their own operations a greater
awareness of the risks triggered by deregulation.
The report said that greater safeguards on supervision should focus on four
areas:
Prudential regulation and supervision of individual institutions such as
through guidelines on capital standards.
New checks on the design of large and complicated financial systems such as
payment and settlement networks, with a view to reducing the chances of
large sums of money being put at risk by events such as a reduction in the
market price of financial instruments.
Crisis management techniques under which authorities might be able to
intervene to reduce the effects of events such as stock market crashes.
Achieving the right balance between government involvement and instituting
discipline in markets to minimise financial risks.

THE BANK'S generally negative view about prospects for economic and monetary
union yesterday drew fire from some central bank governors. The comments
about Emu were contained in sections of the BIS's annual report - which was
drafted under the supervision of Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, BIS general
manager, and Mr Horst Bockelmann, economic adviser.
The report's caustic views on Emu - coming at a delicate period when the
entire project is uncertain due to the Danish referendum result - were seen
by some governors as unhelpful in terms of adding to public scepticism about
the scheme.
Mr Wim Duisenberg (above, left), governor of the Dutch central bank, said:
'I don't agree with this part of the report.' He remained hopeful that the
difficulties over Emu could be overcome and the project would go ahead as
planned.
Mr Erik Hoffmeyer (above, right), Danish governor and chairman of the
committee of EC central bank governors, said he found the negative views of
the BIS officials 'surprising'.
Mr Alfons Verplaetse, governor of the Belgian central bank, said he 'did not
want to minimise the problems' over Emu but was confident of the project's
success.

FT  16 JUN 92 / BIS Annual Report: Emu faces testing time on technical and
political fronts
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BASLE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EFFORTS to establish European economic and monetary union by the end of the
century are likely to run into technical difficulties, according the BIS.
In its report the bank voices doubts about whether EC economies can move
close enough to make Emu feasible, without unacceptably large fiscal
transfers or high unemployment.
In remarks written before the Danish rejection of the Maastricht treaty
earlier this month, the bank says the goal of a single monetary policy for
Europe could be hindered by a lack of political consensus across the
continent.
Another problem is the rapid pace of financial deregulation since the 1980s.
This could over the next few years lead to large transfers of money across
national borders in response to economic shocks, so making the goal of
fixing exchange rates ahead of a monetary union more difficult.
The sceptical comments underline uncertainty about Emu which, after the
Danish decision, appears increasingly unlikely to become established as
planned by 1999. The report says efforts to engineer a convergence in
inflation and interest rates across Europe - a necessary condition for union
 -could lead to 'large adjustment problems'.
While not all Community nations would necessarily have to enter Emu at the
same time, attempts to ensure that a large enough number of nations met the
convergence criteria 'could render exchange rate and, perhaps, budgetary
policy in some countries too rigid in the next few years'.
The creation of high unemployment and low growth in countries which
attempted to bring down inflation to German-style levels could trigger
demands for richer nations to transfer money to the poorer ones, in the form
of social security payments or schemes to boost industrial development.
But 'achieving political consensus to release the necessary resources will
not be easy'.
In a passage indicating that large fiscal transfers of this kind could
damage competitiveness and lead to higher taxes, the bank warns that
experience in Europe with agricultural and industrial subsidies and support
for people on low incomes 'may not seem encouraging'.
As for the operation of the proposed European central bank, the report says
'(pan-European) monetary policy decisions may be difficult to agree upon and
defend, particularly as levels of structural unemployment will continue to
differ from country to country'.
It also warns that any tendency for equalisation of wage levels that ignores
productivity differences 'could have unwelcome unemployment implications'.

FT  16 JUN 92 / BIS Annual Report: Industrialised nations rebuked on trade
policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BASLE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RESTRICTIVE trade policies by many industrialised nations are damaging the
prospects for world growth, the BIS says in its annual report.
In a strongly worded rebuke, it hints that the industrialised world has been
hypocritical in encouraging trade reforms by developing nations, while at
the same time clamping down on access to its own markets.
The bank says many developed countries have protectionist trade policies
particularly in farm products, semi-finished manufactured goods, clothing
and textiles.
In remarks which will add to concern about the stalled Uruguay round of
world trade talks, the bank says the trade policies of many industrialised
nations 'have in many ways become more restrictive in recent years'. It
adds: 'The awakening of so much of the developing world to the benefits of
free trade places a special responsibility on the countries in the
industrialised world to open their markets.'
The report criticises the trend in recent years towards 'managed' trade
agreements by groups of industrialised countries, often on a bilateral
basis. These include agreements covering exports of Japanese goods such as
cars and semiconductors into the US and European Community.
'Such measures restrict consumer choice, inflate costs and raise prices,'
the bank says. 'By allowing some enterprises to be quite relaxed about their
own inefficiencies, a vital force for greater productivity in the medium
term is considerably weakened.' The accords also 'do little to promote
domestic output and employment as a whole, as measures that protect one
industry inevitably hurt others'.
The report also singles out restrictive policies over agricultural trade
which 'insulate domestic markets from the influence of world prices' and
lead to production inefficiencies.
According to the bank, the policies of the developed nations have been at
variance with the efforts by many developing countries to move to free-trade
policies, through measures such as more competitive exchange rates, greater
openness to foreign investment and elimination of import tariffs.
In the past five years, 51 developing nations have announced unilateral
measures to open up trade, which the bank says have been 'often far
reaching'. These reforms 'will only bear fruit' if markets in the industrial
countries themselves become more open.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE prospect of European Community recognition of Macedonia inched nearer
yesterday, as the latter held its first direct talks with Greece to resolve
their months-long impasse over nomenclature.
Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, foreign minister of Portugal which holds the EC
presidency, reported that 'positive aspects' had emerged from separate talks
he held on Sunday with prime minister Constantine Mitzotakis of Greece, and
Macedonia's foreign minister, Dr Denko Maleski.
The Portuguese presidency has floated a four-point plan to ease Greek fears
that recognising Macedonia under that name would stir separatism in northern
Greece.
This involves EC guarantees of the two countries' border, an exchange of
notes between Athens and Skopje disclaiming the existence of a Slav minority
in Greece, EC aid for Macedonia, and a commitment by Macedonia to clarify
that its constitution implies no territorial claim on Greece.
After Dr Maleski met Mr Mitzotakis' deputy foreign minister yesterday,
Portuguese officials said Greece and Macedonia were happy with the four
points, but still stuck over the latter's name.
Belgium suggested that for a time Macedonia use one name at home and another
abroad.
President Kiro Gligorov sent a letter to yesterday's meeting of EC foreign
ministers complaining of the Community's failure to grant his state
recognition nearly six months after it said it met the test of independent
statehood.
He asked if there had to be war in Macedonia as in other former Yugoslav
republics for it to be recognised.
Seeking to avoid the eruption of another flashpoint in Kosovo, the Serbian
province with a large Albanian population, EC ministers cautioned all
parties to exercise restraint. This is both a warning to Serb leaders not to
repress the ethnic Albanian population in Kosovo, and to neighbouring
Albania not to intervene and so bring an international dimension to the the
Yugoslav civil war.

<TEXT>
DAILY industrial production in east Germany rose 10.5 per cent in March. The
increase, attributable mainly to a 22.5 per cent surge from the construction
industry, was the first significant month-on-month rise since last November.
Manufacturing industry also enjoyed a 12 per cent increase. However, the
economics ministry said the figures were heavily influenced by seasonal
factors.
Aggregate industrial output for February and March together is was still 3.8
per cent below the same two months in 1991. The investment goods sector fell
7.3 per cent while consumer goods manufacturing rose 10.5 per cent during
the two months.
Mining and energy output fell sharply by 40 per cent and 17 per cent
respectively.
Meanwhile, west German consumer prices increased by a revised 0.4 per cent
in May, bringing the year-on-year rate to 4.6 per cent, according to the
federal statistics office.
The main upwards pressure came from a 7.2 per cent rise in the so-called
'car drivers' index' - an aggregate calculation covering the costs of owning
and running a private car.
The retail price index was 3.3 per cent up on the year, but rents and the
cost of services and repairs showed above average increases of 5.1 per cent
and 5.6 per cent.

CANADIAN troops could take control of Sarajevo airport by the end of the
week if the fragile ceasefire, which came into force yesterday morning,
continues to hold.
But a United Nations official who forged the ceasefire agreement between the
Bosnian presidency and Serb irregulars yesterday said: 'Anything could go
wrong.
'We are relying on the good will of all sides to enforce the ceasefire. This
is a real cliffhanger,' he added.
Yesterday, French airport security officials who are working with the UN in
Sarajevo, again visited the airport. They said it was not badly damaged by
Serb irregulars who have blockaded the airport for the past 10 weeks, and
have prevented food and medical supplies reaching Sarajevo.
UN officials want to use the ceasefire to start de-militarising the airport,
and its surrounding areas.
If the ceasefire holds, UN secretary general Boutros Boutros Ghali will
early this week recommend that the security council deploy 1,000 Canadian
troops equipped with 80 armoured personnel carriers, to take over the
airport.
Yesterday, the city's inhabitants emerged from their cellars into the
pouring rain, but few have high hopes in any lasting ceasefire.
'I do not believe in it. The Serb irregulars are already sniping,' said Mr
Kemal Kurpasic, editor of Oslobedjne, the Bosnia daily newspaper. 'If they
keep sniping, the Territorial Defence might be forced to respond,' he added.
As he spoke by telephone from his apartment, a bullet ripped through his
kitchen wall. 'You see what I mean. This is a very fragile ceasefire,' said
Mr Kurpasic.
Mr Zlatan Cabaravdiz, a journalist at Sarajevo radio, said both sides were
weighting up the advantages in maintaining the ceasefire.
'We have seen ceasefires come and go,' he said. 'With this one, the Serb
irregulars can re-group, and withdraw to the hills surrounding the city.
They can shell and divide the city at any time. What would you expect the
Territorial Defence to do then? Do you expect them to withdraw from the
positions they already hold in Sarajevo?' he asked.
Mr Kurpasic and western diplomats said the Serb irregulars, and Serbia's
proxy army in Bosnia were using the ceasefire and international attention on
Sarajevo as 'a smokescreen.'
'There are awful things happening in other towns and cities which are being
besieged and where the killing never stops,' Mr Kurpasic said.
Yesterday, western diplomats said Croat forces from Croatia were
consolidating their own positions in Derventa, north of Bosnia, and in
Mostar, east of the republic, despite repeated requests by the UN to
Croatian president Franjo Tudjman to withdraw his forces from Bosnia.
In Belgrade, the Serbian capital, about 10,000 students staged a peaceful
demonstration against Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic, who has not been
seen, or heard, for several days.
Yesterday, Mr Dobrica Cosic, an ultra Serb nationalist, was elected the
president of the new Yugoslavia, in a move likely to give the nationalists
far greater say, and power, over the coming weeks.

BRITAIN and Ireland will, from 1994, scrap quarantine on the small number of
cats and dogs sold into those countries, replacing it with a system of
highly complicated rabies checks.
Mr John Gummer, the UK agriculture minister, described the agreement, made
with his EC counterparts yesterday, as 'a very major advance' on other
schemes proposed by Brussels.
In its plan to create the single EC market from next year on, the European
Commission is seeking the abolition of border controls on animals, as well
as people and goods.
The new system relies on a distinction between pets travelling with their
owners, and those imported by traders.
The former category would remain subject to quarantine, Mr Gummer stressed.

FT  16 JUN 92 / European industry agrees to back HDTV

TELEVISION broadcasters, satellite operators and equipment makers have
agreed to act together to promote wide-screen high-definition television
(HDTV) in the European Community - provided EC member states fund the
proposals.
A declaration of intent was approved yesterday by nearly 40 companies and
professional associations from across Europe.
The declaration falls short of the legally-binding document which the
European Commission originally hoped the industry would sign, but it should
be followed up by bilateral contracts between the companies and the
Commission, granting funding to individual projects.
The success or failure of the whole programme now depends on the willingness
of EC member states to approve the Commission's Ecu850m (Pounds 596.7m) HDTV
'action plan' - or at least a large enough part to satisfy the companies.
The action plan itself is dependent on funding being made available for HDTV
as part of the new overall EC budget proposals, which have already been
attacked by a majority of finance ministers.
A Commission official said last night that the declaration by the companies
might encourage some of the more sceptical EC members to back the action
plan. 'This is an important political signal on the part of industry that
it's ready to play the game,' he said.
Under the so-called memorandum of understanding approved yesterday,
broadcasters have said they will prepare an operational project for the
launch of an advanced wide-screen satellite or cable television service,
using the D2-Mac transmission standards laid out in the directive agreed by
member states last December. D2-Mac is an intermediate standard which should
lead in the end to full HDTV.
Manufacturers have committed themselves to producing sufficient quantities
of D2-Mac wide-screen sets.
The industry groups, which have been bickering about HDTV strategy for some
years now, have also agreed to form a consortium to promote the principles
laid out in the memorandum.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Unholy alliance of the heart robs Ukraine of its head:
Nationalists back the old communists where independence is the deal and
policy the price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE statue of Lenin which once presided over the Ukrainian parliament has
been replaced by a huge blue and yellow Ukrainian flag. In government
offices the hammer and sickle have given way to the trident, the Ukrainian
national crest, and portraits of Lenin have been replaced by those of Taras
Shevchenko, the national poet.
But in that parliament and those government offices, the old communist
deputies and party functionaries still dominate.
The reason is an alliance that Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president,
has forged with the nationalists who form the bulk of the organised
political opposition in Ukraine.
It is an alliance based on an unwritten deal: Mr Kravchuk and the moderate
communists he leads have backed Ukrainian independence and in return
Ukrainian nationalists have allowed the apparat to remain in power.
And economic policy is footing the bill.
'The communist nomenclatura which was in power yesterday and the day before
yesterday is still in power today,' said Mr Volodymyr Filenko, one of the
few Ukrainian members of parliament who directly criticises the government.
Mr Kravchuk has generously fulfilled his side of the bargain. Historically,
Ukrainian independence has been a losing proposition - in the past millenium
Ukraine has enjoyed only three periods of statehood, each more tenuous than
the last.
But with the cunning Mr Kravchuk at the helm Ukraine has successfully sailed
past the dangerous shoals of the Soviet Union and is moving out of reach of
Russian domination.
Mr Les Taniuk, a theatre director turned politician and one of the most
vocal critics of the nationalist-communist alliance, says many Ukrainian
nationalists take the view: 'Let us unite with the devil, with the
Bolsheviks, with anyone at all, so long as we become independent.'
Two of the three co-leaders of the strongest independent movement in Ukraine
have said that they support the president. This spring, the newly-elected
heads of the Ukrainian Republican Party, once the most radical in Ukraine,
said that their organisation should choose co-operation rather than conflict
with the government.
Mr Kravchuk, pleading the need for a strong executive able to implement
economic reform, has won extensive authority to rule by decree and has
created a network of presidential plenipotentiaries throughout Ukraine.
Nearly 80 per cent of these representatives are former communist
functionaries and they enjoy the same nearly feudal powers once exercised by
the old communist regional bosses. For example, Mr Ivan Sali, the
presidential representative in Kiev, has tried to oust western organisations
with valid leases on city property in the hope of replacing them with
higher-paying tenants.
Western officials privately acknowledge their concern about the
authoritarian turn in Ukrainian politics, which extends to Ukraine's
sycophantic mass media, but Mr Kravchuk is gambling that the west will
accept Ukraine's touted political stability as a proxy for genuine
pluralism.
Ukraine has been less successful at selling its lacklustre economic
programme abroad. On a recent visit to Kiev, Mr Larry Summers, chief
economist of the World Bank, warned Ukrainian officials that: 'There is an
understanding that reforms are necessary but that which is going on in
Ukraine today can not be called reform.'
Mr Summers found fault with almost every aspect of the government's reform
plan: the budget, seen as a cosmetic effort to please the International
Monetary Fund, setting over-ambitious targets and not establishing a
structural basis for reform; the tax scheme, according to which enterprises
can pay a wapping 60 per cent of revenue; the social welfare net, more
generous than impoverished Ukraine can afford; the price system, still not
fully liberalised; the state order, a code word for central planning which
remains the guiding force in the Ukrainian economy; and the privatisation
plan, which looks good on paper, but has not yet been implemented.
Ukrainian politicians who oppose the government's course warn that failure
to reform the economy will ultimately backfire. Their fears are borne out by
wildcat strikes throughout the Russified eastern Ukraine - which supported
independence in the belief that it would bring prosperity - and the Donbass
miners' threats to go on strike.
However, in the short term, Ukrainian communists are cushioned from public
pressure by their nation's rich black earth,which guarantees Ukrainiansa
relatively high standard of living no matter how inept their government.
Just over six months since the nationalist-communist alliance drew an
overwhelming 90 per cent yes vote in Ukraine's referendum on independence,
dissenters are emerging, with the goal of creating a real alternative to Mr
Kravchuk's government. Mr Viacheslav Chornovil, a former political prisoner
from western Ukraine, hopes to transform the republican party into a genuine
opposition party. New Ukraine is trying to unite eastern Ukrainians, ethnic
Russians and businessmen around a call for more radical economic reform.
The two groups came together last week to call for the resignation of
conservative prime minister Vitold Fokin. But their bid was defeated in a
168-154 vote in parliament which prompted Mr Volodymyr Lanovoy, deputy prime
minister and a member of New Ukraine, to threaten to resign.
But the mounting hostility between Ukraine and Russia threatens to breathe
life into the alliance which swept Mr Kravchuk into power in the first
place. As Mr Taniuk, a Chornovil supporter, warned: 'If the chauvinist line
is strengthened in Russia, that is dangerous because it will enhance
Kravchuk's authority here.'

FT  16 JUN 92 / EC ministers near breakthrough on budget deadlock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WERE signs yesterday that the deadlock over the European Community
budget could be broken as most EC governments appeared ready to accept a
compromise to spread revenue increases over a longer period than envisaged
by Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president.
Mr Delors' original plan - unveiled in February and criticised by some for
demanding too much at a time of fiscal restraint - was to raise Community
revenue progressively from next year from its current ceiling of 1.2 per
cent of Community gross national product to 1.37 per cent by 1997.
'I am not changing the Commission proposal,' Mr Delors said. But he told
foreign ministers at their meeting in Luxembourg that, for the next two
years at least, his plan to raise spending by a third over the period up to
1997 could be accommodated within the current 1.2 per cent ceiling because
forecast expenditure is below the ceiling.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, forecast that next week's Lisbon
summit would not produce 'conclusions, but rather guidelines' that would
allow Britain - which assumes the EC presidency on July 1 - to get a
budgetary deal by the end of the year.
Ministers from France and Belgium, among others, seized on Mr Delors'
apparent flexibility as a good compromise, arguing it could satisfy those
like the UK, the Netherlands and Germany, which want to avoid paying more
into Community coffers at a time of fiscal constraint at home.
They felt it could also placate members such as Spain and Ireland which want
more aid from Brussels. The question of financial support from Brussels is
expected to play a part in the referendum vote in Ireland on Thursday. Mr
David Andrews, Ireland's foreign minister, said his partners had all shown
themselves aware of Ireland's delicate position on the eve of its referendum
on the political and monetary union treaty.
His French counterpart, Mr Roland Dumas, said Ireland could expect 'a
significant contribution' from the new special cohesion fund. However, Spain
and the UK, at opposite ends of the spectrum, yesterday maintained their
tough positions, with Madrid warning against watering down the original
Delors plan.
Mr Hurd, while not addressing the question of revenue, nevertheless said the
Commission plan for a 5 per cent real annual increase in spending was
unacceptable in view of budgetary contraints facing governments at home.
'The kind of financial rigour, which used to be associated with Britain
alone, has now spread,' he said.
The Portuguese presidency has suggested rejigging the original budget plan
on the spending side. It would pay for a doubling of cohesion aid to the
EC's four poorest members by trimming the rate of increased spending
elsewhere.
The most concrete decision likely to come out of the Lisbon summit later
this month will be the renomination of Mr Delors to a further two-year term
as Commission president.
Only Britain, where Mr Delors is under fire within the governing
Conservative party, appears still to be reserving its position on Mr Delors.
Mr Hurd said yesterday that 'no assurances have been given, nor decisions
taken'.
In London, Mr John Major made clear that he saw little option but to accept
the re-appointment for two years of Mr Delors - a move likely to infuriate
the party's Euro-sceptics.
Mr Major, meanwhile, began to reassert his authority over the Conservative
party by warning potential rebels against the Maastricht Treaty that
Britain's influence would be undermined if it sought to wreck the accord.
Speaking at an informal lunch in Downing Street, the prime minister told
about 30 Tory MPs that he was dismayed by the divisions which have opened in
the party since the Danish rejection of the Maastricht accord.
After talks with his senior ministers, he confirmed that British legislation
to ratify the accords on political and economic union will be delayed until
Denmark has made its position clearer.

FT  16 JUN 92 / BT loses at least CDollars 256m on disposal of Mitel stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Telecommunications will suffer a loss of at least CDollars 256m
(Pounds 116m) on the disposal of its controlling stake in Mitel, the
troubled Canadian telephone equipment maker.
BT, which put its 51 per cent stake up for sale more than two years ago,
agreed yesterday to sell its shares to nine unidentified investment
partnerships in Canada, Bermuda and the UK represented by Schroder Ventures,
venture capital arm of Schroders, UK merchant bank.
The investors are paying BT an initial CDollars 1 a Mitel share. They will
also pay BT a third of any profit earned from the re-sale of the shares in
the next five years, to raise the total to a maximum of CDollars 1.64 a
share, or about CDollars 66m. BT will share in Mitel's profits after five
years even if the new owners do not sell their shares. The buyers are not
planning any follow-up offer to minority shareholders.
BT bought its stake in Mitel in 1985 for CDollars 8 a share, or a total of
CDollars 321m (then worth Pounds 160m). Mr Anthony Griffiths, Mitel's
chairman, yesterday estimated BT's total investment at CDollars 350-CDollars
360m, including research and development grants.
The investment was intended to be the first stage of a growing presence in
telecommunications equipment manufacturing. BT subsequently decided to
concentrate on network management, and put its Mitel shares up for sale in
early 1990.
The sale was announced after the close of trading in London, where BT shares
had ended 3p lower at 348p, but while BT's American depositary receipts were
still being traded in North America. In New York, the ADRs closed unchanged
at Dollars 64 7/8 .
Mr Barry Romeni, BT's group finance director, said yesterday: 'BT has
focused on its key mission of providing network-based services to customers
around the world. Manufacturing telecommunications equipment is not part of
this strategy and this disposal effectively ends BT's direct involvement in
manufacturing.'
Mr Griffiths said uncertainty about future ownership was the single biggest
difficulty Mitel has recently faced in the marketplace. He said BT's
involvement was originally 'very positive' but it had provided no support
for the past 2 1/2 years.
Mitel has incurred losses for six of the past eight years. In the year to
March, it lost CDollars 5.7m on revenues of CDollars 406m, although it
earned a small fourth-quarter profit. Mitel specialises in small and
mid-sized office switchboards. It has manufacturing facilities in Canada,
the US and south Wales. The UK accounted for a quarter of revenues last
year.
Mr Henry Simon, a Schroder Ventures partner, said the buyers were especially
attracted by Mitel's strong engineering expertise and the potential to
develop new products.

FT  16 JUN 92 / World News in Brief: Midnight blast off Regent Street
destroys car
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
An explosion in central London last night destroyed a Mercedes mini-cab but
no injuries were reported. Police were treating the blast - seconds before
midnight in St Alban's Street, between Regent Street and Haymarket - as the
work of the IRA.
Scotland Yard said the explosion was caused by a device similar to the 2lb
bomb used in Victoria Street, Westminster, last week.
Early today police said two men, one of them armed, hired the Mercedes and
forced its driver at gunpoint to cruise round the West End before ordering
him to stop. They ran off after telling him he had 15 minutes to get away.
The driver was believed to be raising the alarm when the bomb went off.
Police later carried out a controlled explosion on a suspect vehicle parked
in Haymarket but it proved to be a false alarm.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Major pressed on Maxwell intelligence claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH, PHILIP STEPHENS, JIMMY BURNS and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR Labour spokesmen yesterday demanded a full inquiry into the extent of
the government's knowledge of Robert Maxwell's activities before the
collapse of his business empire.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow trade secretary, wrote to Mr John Major urging
him to set up an inquiry. His letter follows yesterday's Financial Times
report that the government was in possession of intelligence information at
least two years before the death of Maxwell suggesting he had been acting
dishonestly.
Whitehall officials did not deny that Maxwell's telephone or other
activities had been monitored. But they said there was no evidence to
suggest that ministers had seen information which might have alerted them to
fraud in the Maxwell empire. Mr Major was certain that he had seen nothing
either as chancellor or prime minister.
Mr Brown said he was seeking a statement on 'who was informed, when and in
what detail, and - specifically - why no action was taken to investigate
fraud and protect pension funds'.
However, Miss Ann Widdecombe, junior social security minister, ruled out a
fresh investigation and rejected calls for another Commons debate or
government statement. 'It would be quite counter-productive to react every
day to every new twist of the Maxwell saga,' she said on Channel Four News.
Commenting specifically on the allegations in yesterday's FT, she said: 'The
government has already made very clear statements to the effect that we do
not believe that we have any responsibility for what happened.'
Mr Richard Page, Conservative co-chairman of the all-party group of MPs
campaigning on behalf of the Maxwell pensioners, said: 'If it turns out the
government knew that Maxwell was bleeding money out of the pension funds,
then the pressure on the government to provide for the pensioners becomes
almost irresistible.'
The FT yesterday quoted Mr Robin Robison, who in June 1988 became an
administrative officer for the Joint Intelligence Committee, part of the
Cabinet Office which assesses information from Britain's intelligence
services.
Last night Mr Peter Thompson, a former editor of the Sunday Mirror and
director of Mirror Group Newspapers, said that a book he co-authored in 1988
was suppressed by Maxwell partly because it had originally claimed that the
British security services had extensive files on the publisher.
The FT has confirmed separately, from a source other than Mr Robison or Mr
Thompson, that intelligence information on Maxwell's activities had been
available for some years. A full intelligence report on Maxwell was prepared
from files for the JIC at the time of his death on November 5 last year.
Mr Robison - a Quaker who was positively vetted by the security services in
1987 - claimed that in 1989 he saw intelligence information on Maxwell from
intercepted telephone conversations and faxes. The information, he said, had
been distributed to Whitehall officials including the prime minister's
office.
Senior Whitehall officials disputed that Mr Robison could have seen signals
intelligence information in autumn 1989, as he claimed. They said Mr Robison
was moved from his JIC work in June 1989 to another post in the Cabinet
Office. After that he had no further access to secret material. Downing
Street indicated that there were no plans to seek a prosecution of Mr
Robison under the Official Secrets Act.
Mr Robison said last night he resigned from the Cabinet Office at the end of
January 1990. He insisted he continued to have access to top-secret material
after June 1989.
There was no comment in Whitehall on the suggestion that intelligence
services might have been routinely collecting information on the Maxwell
empire. The government's policy is not to discuss the work of the security
services, though it is acknowledged that commercial activities do fall
within their remit.
Discussing the suppression of the book he co-authored with Mr Anthony
Delano, Mr Thompson said last night: 'Maxwell was particularly angry about a
passage which detailed the files which MI5 had on him. I have no reason to
believe that the information about the file and the dossiers was
inaccurate.'
According to Mr Thompson, Maxwell objected to a claim that a former MI5
agent saw no fewer than 37 assembled dossiers on the publisher. The book,
Maxwell: A Portrait of Power, was published in February 1988. But Maxwell's
lawyers obtained an injunction to prevent further sales and issued writs for
defamation. After an out-of-court settlement the hardback copies were
withdrawn and pulped. A paperback version published since Maxwell's death
did not include the passages in question.
In the Commons, Mr Michael Meacher, shadow social security secretary,
questioned why, if the government had such information before 1989, the
Department of Trade and Industry had nonetheless granted investment licences
to two Maxwell companies, which he later used to pillage the pension funds.
However, Miss Widdecombe said last night the crucial question was not to ask
what had happened but how to prevent a repetition of the suffering of
Maxwell pensioners.
Asked whether the government would put pressure on Liechtenstein in the
search for Maxwell funds, she said: 'The government will do what is
appropriate as and when it believes action is necessary.'

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REVISED figures showing a further widening in the UK trade gap in the first
quarter of this year joined with the poor overnight market performance in
Tokyo to dominate a volatile session in the derivatives market, writes Joel
Kibazo.
The poor showing in Tokyo caused a weak opening in stock index futures and
the June contract on the FT-SE opened just below the 2,600 level, although
at a premium to the underlying cash market. However, the covering of short
positions pushed June forward to 2,606 by about 10.15am, the high of the
day.
The revised UK quarterly current account figures sent June into decline once
again, the contract falling to 2,577 by around 2.15pm. The recovery of Wall
Street after a tentative opening helped June to regain some lost ground and
it closed at 2,593, at the same level as the underlying cash market. Fair
value has dropped to parity with cash this week. Turnover at just over 7,000
contracts was light.
Traded options volume was reasonable, reaching 35,333 contracts. The FT-SE
option traded 14,442 lots. Amstrad was the busiest stock option as Sheppards
sold the September 40 straddle - the selling of calls and puts at the same
strike price. A total of 3,320 contracts had been dealt in Amstrad by the
close.

FT  16 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Cloud over ICI shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and COLIN MILLHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A REDUCED profits forecast for ICI prompted dealers to mark down the share
price ahead of a presentation to analysts by the company on Thursday. The
stock was down 27 at one stage and closed a net 18 off at 1267p, but
turnover, at under 1m shares, was slim.
The negative sentiment came from Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank,
which cut its 1992 estimate by Pounds 50m to Pounds 890m and decreased its
1993 figure by Pounds 80m to Pounds 1.09bn.
Mr Martin Glen, Lehman's chemicals analyst, said he had been a seller of ICI
previously but was inspired to slice his forecasts because of external
factors. He saw no improvement in European chemicals demand, believed the
recent Common Agriculture Policy reforms would lead prices to fall by
between 20 and 30 per cent, and said that Tenormin, ICI's best selling drug,
was losing US market share more quickly than anticipated.
There was further pressure from speculation that US broker CJ Lawrence had
also reduced forecasts, although no-one from the house was available for
comment yesterday. Finally, some observers said Goldman Sachs was still
holding a large chunk of the 20m shares it had bought from Hanson for 1400p
apiece in early May and that stock was still overshadowing the share price.
Utility tremors
Results from the electricity sector are likely to provide continuing
ammunition for the anti-privatisation lobby, according to analysts, but the
figures should be regarded with caution and look like being in line with
expectations.
Yesterday's announcement of a 41 per cent rise in profits from East Midlands
Electricity was much as forecast and left the share price unchanged at 293p.
The market took a relaxed attitude towards the comment from Professor
Stephen Littlechild, director-general of electricity supply, that he plans
to 'set tougher standards' for the distribution companies and eliminate
sharp swings in customer prices.
Ms Liz Christie, analyst at Goldman Sachs, said such comments are not very
threatening and that the regulatory mechanism is working well, given the
terms of the government's price controls.
Norweb, down 6 at 334p, reports today and the market expects a profit rise
of 80 per cent. Although this may produce further adverse comments it was
pointed out that the company was involved in very big one-off costs last
year.
Today's figures from National Power, 2 higher at 241p, will be looked at to
see whether the profit and dividend are up to the same level as the recent
results from PowerGen, unaltered at 248p.
Vodafone weak
Plans announced yesterday by mobile phone operator Cellnet to restructure
its pricing policies and strengthen its consumer operations prompted renewed
worries that rival operator Vodafone will be forced to respond, as the two
companies gear up for the launch of personal communications network (PCN), a
cheaper but more specialised version of cellular for which the government
plans to issue licences late next year.
Although the move by Cellnet, in which BT has a 60 per cent stake and
Securicor the remainder, had been widely expected, the rekindling of the
threat of a price war upset sentiment in a weak telecoms sector. Vodafone
dropped 18 to 334p, although 3p of the fall represented dividend payment.
Turnover was a brisk 6.4m.
BT, whose shares dipped 3 to 347 1/2 p, announced after the market closed
that it had sold its controlling equity interest in Canadian telecoms group
Mitel at a loss of CDollars 120m.
Business services group BET closed a net 4 lighter at 136p after the company
reported a slump in full-year profits after exceptional charges to Pounds
18.5m from a previous Pounds 217m, and also cut the dividend.
One market observer said: 'Everyone was resigned to the dividend cut and
reasonably prepared for the fall in profits.' This may have helped the
shares partially recover from a fall sustained earlier in the session.
Turnover rose to 7.7m.
French stockbroker Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull is refusing to lighten
its gloomy view of BP. Superbear Mr John Toalster said after a long talk
with the company that he was planning to cut his profits forecast once again
in the belief that second-quarter figures would be 'pretty dreadful'.
Mr Toalster has reduced his replacement cost profits forecast by Pounds 70m
to Pounds 430m and argues that the only support for the share price is in
the firm underlying oil price. BP eased 1 1/2 to 259 1/2 p on thin volume of
3.3m shares.
Lasmo rose 5 to 199p on optimism ahead of the pricing of the sale of its
Ultramar unit's North American assets. The price is due to be set tomorrow.
Turnover of 3.6m shares was boosted by an agency cross of 1/2 m shares.
Concern about the British Aerospace dividend and worries that the company
may be forced to make provisions continued to weaken the shares, which ended
8 lower at 294p. Explaining the current mood, Mr Keith Hodgkinson at Lehman
Brothers said: 'The market is coming to a realistic position on issues such
as current trading, dividend prospects and possible provisions.'
Continued selling following the company's profits warning on Friday ensured
that Fisons was the most heavily traded stock yesterday. The stock fell 24
but then rallied to close only 7 off at 238p as dealers felt a level had
been reached.
Regional brewer JA Devenish gained 11 to 289p xd as speculation mounted that
Boddington, unsuccessful in a bid attempt last year, will soon announce a
renewed offer. Boddington eased 4 to 177p.
Discount retailer Amber Day warned that a poor second half meant annual
profits will be below analysts' expectations. The shares declined 4 to 58p
in spite of reassurances from the company that its core business is strong.
Leading leisure stocks fared poorly in a dull sector. Ladbroke held up
against a downgrade and a sell note from Paribas after a worthy annual
statement, easing just 1 1/2 to 211p. Granada, shortly to join the FT-SE 100
Index, lost 6 to 261p, Rank Organisation, dulled by recent downgrades, shed
11 to 700p, while Thorn EMI gave up 14 to 834p after a recent good run.
Critical weekend press comment stung Forte, although the shares recovered to
close 4 off at 218p.
Property shares remained under a cloud, with few features to tempt
prospective buyers. Hammerson's announcement that it had secured more
tenants for a prestigious New York office block failed to help the shares, 5
down at 363p.

FT  16 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets: Europe rocked by Maastricht fall-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was another choppy week in Europe as share prices continued to weaken in
the wake of Denmark's 'no' vote in its referendum on the Maastricht treaty.
Equities followed the bond markets down, with only Germany and the
Netherlands, among the majors, resisting the steep falls recorded by other
bourses.
Beyond Europe, where the Danish 'no' held less interest, a weak Wall Street
and a lacklustre Nikkei average, which seems unable to break out of a range
around 17,000, weighed on sentiment, leaving the FT-Actuaries World index
1.4 per cent lower on the week in local currency terms.
Within Europe, Italy, Spain, France and the UK led the others lower. Spain
and Italy stand out because of the perceived problems which both have in
meeting the convergence criteria which form part of the Maastricht treaty.
Other factors depressing sentiment in Milan included the difficulty in
resolving the deadlock over the formation of a new government, and technical
problems with the computer-linked trading system towards the end of the week
which kept volumes low.
Although the Maastricht fall-out is likely to affect European markets for
some time to come, the release of German money supply data this week may
inspire a little confidence, with some analysts forecasting a small fall in
M3.
Mexico had its own problems, with unsubstantiated rumours that Telmex
employees were about to sell their 2.9 per cent stake leading the market
down. Uncertainty remains as to what the employees will do, with reports
that each could be allocated Dollars 20,000 worth of stock presently held in
a trust fund.
Among the Asian markets, Hong Kong was a negative feature while Singapore
had a reasonably good week. Mr Michael Franklin of Kim Eng Securities in
London said steady institutional buying of blue chips in Singapore helped
the index advance.

survey from the Bank of Japan, and the Nikkei index fell below 17,000 for
the first time since April 22, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average lost 430.45, or 2.5 per cent, to 16,953.23. It opened
at the day's high of 17,339.42 and dropped to a low of 16,926.23 just before
the close on light arbitrage selling and small-lot profit-taking by dealers.
Volume plunged to 200m shares from the 764m registered on Friday, which was
the expiration day for June options and futures. Buying by institutions,
which have indicated interest in purchasing at lower levels, remained
small-scale.
A fund manager at Dai-ichi Life, describing the herd mentality of Japanese
fund managers, said: 'The cash ratio of our investments has increased, but
no-one wants to be the first in committing money.'
Declines overwhelmed advances by 884 to 113, with 141 issues unchanged. The
Topix index of all first section stocks retreated 22.89, or 1.7 per cent, to
1,305.47, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 1.00 to 1,015.17.
Further deterioration of business confidence among company managers, as
indicated in last week's tankan, left investors worried over the uncertainty
of an early economic recovery. Comments by the Bank of Japan after the
release of the tankan, denying the need for a change in monetary policy,
failed to reassure investors.
Traders stressed the need for monetary action by financial authorities. Mr
Peter Johnson at Baring Securities said: 'The market now depends on a
demonstration by the authorities of their understanding of how weak the
economy is.'
Turmoil on the political front also added to the nervousness, as opposition
members of the House of Representatives handed in their resignations in
protest of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's handling of the
government's bill to send Japanese forces on United Nations peacekeeping
missions.
Dealers and investment trusts unloaded speculative 'theme' stocks, bought
for quick profits. Meiji Milk Products, the most active issue of the day,
weakened Y22 to Y971, and Morinaga Milk Industry receded Y16 to Y874.
High-technology blue chips fell on selling by investment trusts and foreign
investors. NEC dropped Y22 to a low for the year of Y861, while Fujitsu
slipped Y13 to Y620 and Hitachi Y18 to Y765.
Investors stepped up selling of bank shares. Daiwa Securities said movements
of bank stocks were the key to fluctuations in the Nikkei index. 'The index
will fall sharply if the market sees another heavy selling of bank shares as
in April,' said a Daiwa analyst. Dai-ichi Kangyo Bank declined Y30 to Y1,260
and Mitsubishi Bank retreated Y50 to Y1,650.
In Osaka, the OSE average shed 377.30 to 19,957.42 in volume of 7.3m shares.
Roundup
KUALA LUMPUR stood out as the rest of the Pacific Rim got off to a slow
start, dampened by the fall in Tokyo.
Bombay's brokers boycotted trading because several companies refused to
transfer shares sold by Harshad Mehta, the central figure in India's latest,
and worst, financial scandal.
KUALA LUMPUR saw small-investor interest in the afternoon following steady
institutional morning buying, and the KLSE composite index ended 9.62, or
1.6 per cent, higher at 600.17.
NEW ZEALAND eased after late falls in Carter Holt Harvey and Fletcher
Challenge. Carter Holt slipped 9 cents to NZDollars 2.56 in light volume,
while Fletcher Challenge lost 6 cents to NZDollars 3.56 in moderate volume.
The NZSE-40 index closed 11.05 down at 1,532.11, in moderate turnover of
NZDollars 16.6m after NZDollars 23.1m on Friday.
Magnum Corp continued its recent rally, firming a cent to NZDollars 1.09 and
taking its rise over the last three sessions to 6.9 per cent following the
appointment of Mr James Strong as its new chief executive.
MANILA, closed for a holiday last Friday, suffered from last week's decline
of Philippine Long Distance Telephone (PLDT) on the American Stock Exchange.
The composite index finished 5.39 lower at 1,575.56.
PLDT tumbled 90 pesos to 1105 pesos. In the US, it had recovered from last
Thursday's Dollars 40 7/8 to Dollars 41 3/8 on Friday, but this still
compared with Dollars 43 1/8 on Wednesday.
BANGKOK continued to concentrate on property stocks after last week's
general surge, the SET index ending 2.68 stronger at 743.37. Bangkok Land
topped the actives list and closed Bt1 higher at Bt148.
AUSTRALIA declined in dull trading, the All Ordinaries index shedding 4.2 to
1,647.1 in turnover of ADollars 143m, after ADollars 196m. Gold shares,
however, moved forward in line with the higher bullion price. Newcrest
Mining rose 3 cents to 68 cents and Placer Pacific gained 2 cents to
ADollars 2.57.
TAIWAN finished lower in moderate trading. The weighted index lost 3.64 to
4,672.49 in turnover of TDollars 38.54bn, after Saturday's TDollars 46.33bn.
SEOUL retreated as investors took profits after two days of gains. The
composite index dipped 0.99 to 579.81 in turnover of Won382.5bn.
SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index was up 3.01 to 1,519.88, after
having kept to a tight range for most of the day.

FT  16 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Downward trend continues on
the Continent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The downward trend continued on Continental bourses yesterday, writes Our
Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT saw Schering and other chemicals fall after Fisons's London plunge
last week, while Thyssen and other steels were depressed by a view of its
steel subsidiary's prospects. Construction stocks, particularly Philipp
Holzmann, fell on a rumour of a Deutsche Bank downgrade.
Schering fell by DM13 to DM720.50, Thyssen by DM6.90 to DM239.50 and
Holzmann by DM30 to DM1,085 as the DAX index closed 8.37 lower at 1,773.90,
after a 1.97 decline to 708.23 in the FAZ at midsession. Turnover fell from
DM4.6bn to DM4.4bn.
Schering was weak earlier this month, on its own forecasts and on the
government's proposals for a two-year freeze on pharmaceuticals prices.
On Thyssen, Mr Michael Geiger of County NatWest thought that Thyssen Stahl's
weekend forecast of a mere 1991/92 breakeven might reflect the group's plans
to merge it with Thyssen Edelstahl, its speciality stainless and light alloy
steels counterpart.
Holzmann has recently produced excellent results, with cash flow up 50 per
cent, and Mr Geiger does not share reservations about its prospects, saying
that a reported fall in the growth of orders still leaves it with a huge
backlog, of improved quality at that.
There was less support for Asko, the highly-geared retailer whose
supervisory board chief, Mr Helmut Wagner, departed at the end of May. Since
then the shares have come back from DM838 to DM722, accelerating on Friday
and yesterday with falls of DM30, and DM31 respectively.
PARIS was depressed by a weak domestic bond market which fell on news that
the Bundesbank president Mr Helmut Schlesinger saw no room for a cut in
German interest rates in the near future. However, a firm start on Wall
Street helped the market recover from the day's lows, leading some brokers
to believe that the market was stabilising after its recent fall. The CAC 40
index dropped to 1,906.91 before ending at 1,918.14, down 10.15, in very
thin turnover of FFr1.5bn.
Suez was one of the day's more prominent gainers, adding FFr6 or 2 per cent
to FFr310 as two domestic brokers were seen actively buying the stock for
institutions. Dealers said the share looked attractive since it was just off
its year's low of FFr282 and was down from a year's high of FFr348.90.
Oil stocks were weaker, with Total falling FFr5.30 to FFr250.70 and Elf
losing FFr5.10 to Fr376. Schneider lost another FFr23 or 3.5 per cent to
FFr640 following last week's pessimistic earnings forecast.
MILAN was again restricted to open-outcry trading as the screen-based system
remained out of operation. Dealers estimated volume at L60-L70bn in trading
dominated by position-squaring ahead of the close of the June account today.
The Comit index fell 2.09 to 472.85.
Stet was one of the most active stocks after last Friday's pricing of its
share and warrants issue. The stock gained L36 to L1,946 and reached L1,953
after hours. Fiat was also active, on short-covering, adding L19 to L5,200.
Capital increases from Italcementi, Snia and Milano Assicurazione are due to
start tomorrow. Italcementi fell L220 to L13,400.
AMSTERDAM weakened in low volume. The CBS Tendency index shed 1.1 to 128.4.
Nedlloyd lost Fl 1.10 to Fl 55.70 with some analysts noting that a court
ruling scheduled for Thursday on the appointment of Mr Torstein Hagen to the
supervisory board was affecting sentiment.
Fokker lost Fl 1.00 or 3 per cent to Fl 33.10 as the prospect of an
announcement on talks with Dasa receded. Royal Dutch lost Fl 1.10 to Fl
157.80 and Heineken was Fl 2.30 down at Fl 161.00.
STOCKHOLM's morning rally run out of steam under the influence of weaker
foreign markets and concern about the government's stability. The
Affarsvarlden General index closed 4.60 higher at 948.10.
Hennes &amp; Mauritz, the clothing retailer, reported a 67 per cent rise in
half-year profits and the shares rose SKr9 to SKr164 in strong trade.
Handelsbanken A rose SKr3 to SKr54 on a belief that they had discounted too
much bad news ahead of the bank's four-month results today.
HELSINKI reported its lowest inflation rate since 1970, as Outokumpu moved
from loss into profit for the first four months of 1992. The Hex index rose
9.7 to 791.3 and the mining group's shares by FM1.20 to FM45. VIENNA failed
to be enlivened by the debut of Flughafen Wien. The ATX index eased 0.97 to
992.51. Flughafen Wien was fixed at Sch380, in line with last week's grey
market prices, and 13 per cent above its offer price of Sch335. BRUSSELS
traded in a narrow range with the Bel-20 index closing 6.10 down at 1,205.18
in low volume of BFr542m. OSLO fell for the 10th session as the all-share
index dropped 5.05 or 1.2 per cent to 431.73 in thin trading worth NKr130m.

UNFAVOURABLE weather, particularly in south India, continues to take a heavy
toll of India's tea crop. In the first four months of the year production
fell by 19.45m kg to 98.54m kg.
South Indian estates accounted for most of the decline, its crop being down
by 18.62m kg. Tamil Nadu, reeling under a severe drought, had produced 23.9m
kg by the end of April, compared with 35.72m kg in the corresponding period
of last year. The crop is down by 6.61m kg to 12.15m kg in Kerala and by
190,000 kg to 1.06m kg in Karnataka.
As for north India, while production in Assam valley and Cachar was up 6.25m
kg to 43.02m kg, West Bengal suffered a setback of 7.04m kg to 18.08m kg.
The crop in minor producing centres showed a decline of 42,000 kg, to
328,000 kg.
According to J Thomas, India's largest tea broking house, Sri Lanka, the
second largest producer of tea in the world, has suffered an even bigger
setback in production. The Sri Lankan crop to the end of April was 46m kg,
compared with 79.1m kg in the same period of 1991. At 56.5m kg, the Kenyan
crop has fallen by 11.5m kg.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Echo Bay sees prospects for
diamond finds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS

   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ECHO BAY Mines, a medium-sized gold producer with four mines in Canada and
the US, says some claims it controls near last November's kimberlite find in
the Northwest Territories could also contain diamond 'pipes'.
The staking rush at Lac de Gras, 200 miles north of Yellowknife, the NWT
capital, now covers 13m acres and has reached Echo Bays' Lupin gold mine and
its 17,000-acre mining lease.
More test results are expected shortly from a 160-tonne bulk sample
extracted from the Dia Met/BHP-Utah property. On May 21 the joint venture of
Canada's Dia Met Minerals and Australia's BHP group reported indications of
90 carats of diamonds with 25 per cent potentially of gem quality.
Echo Bay held exploration leases just east of the discovery, said Mr Richard
Kraus, the company's president, after the annual meeting in Montreal. Also
the winter road connecting Yellowknife and the Lupin mine crossed Lac de
Gras near the discovery.
He said diamond exploration was very expensive and if Echo Bay wanted to
explore its claims further 'it would be done with partners'.
'We are helping other companies in the logistics of diamond exploration. I
can't say more because we are in registration with a USDollars 100m
convertible preferred issue.'
Echo Bay's four mines, including Lupin, produced 734,000 troy ounces of gold
and 5.6m ounces of silver last year. In the first quarter, it posted a small
loss because of low bullion prices but the company said it expected a
gradual recovery in the gold price to Dollars 360 to Dollars 375 an ounce by
the end of the year.
This, together with the new stock issue, would bolster cash flow and enable
debt to be reduced from the present Dollars 257m.
Mr Kraus said Russian sales had peaked and Asian prosperity was creating
excellent fundamentals for gold. Far East fabricated demand, mostly for
jewellery, was now three times North America's and world mine output was not
growing.
Echo Bay has cut manpower by 15 per cent to 1,934 without affecting output.
The Lupin mill's capacity will rise 15 per cent to 2,300 tonnes a day next
year. Other improvements are coming at the Nevada mines and another mine in
Washington State. Two Alaskan properties are ready to move ahead when gold
prices improve.
Exploration is focussed on the Northwest Territories, British Columbia,
Alaska, Washington State, Nevada and the western Rockies. In addition a
senior executive is examining possibilities in the former Soviet Union.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME acts to end zinc market
squeeze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON Metal Exchange acted yesterday to end the squeeze in the zinc
market, which has taken the premium for cash metal over three-month metal to
nearly Dollars 200 a tonne in spite of record stock levels.
After an emergency board meeting, the exchange announced that its was
limiting the premium payable on spot metal to Dollars 15 a tonne per day
until June 26, then to Dollars 10 until July 8, and finally to Dollars 5
until July 15. Any market user short of zinc and unable either to deliver on
the above dates or to borrow metal (buy cash and sell forward) for the day
at or below those premiums will pay an equivalent penalty. Users with long
positions will be similarly compensated.
Mr David King, chief executive of the LME, said the board would be 'meeting
again during the course of this period to review the situation'.
The technical shortage that has forced spot prices up is thought to be
related to increasingly sophisticated use of the options markets.
In the physical market LME warehouse stocks of zinc now stand at a record
277,300 tonnes, compared with 152,000 tonnes at the beginning of the year.
The International Lead and Zinc Study Group yesterday put producer stocks at
344,000 tonnes at the end of April.
This situation angers consumers, who are encouraged by the LME to us the
market to smooth out peaks and troughs in prices. Mr Robin Bhar, consultant
to Carr Kitkat &amp; Aitken, said that the large premium for cash metal - which
was not reflecting the fundamental market position - meant that day-to-day
users of the market were unable to hedge properly.
Yesterday cash zinc closed at Dollars 1,423.50 a tonne, down Dollars 24 on
the day. The cash premium over three-month metal narrowed to Dollars 166 a
tonne from Dollars 189.
Mr Angus MacMillan, analyst with Billiton-Enthoven Metals, said that the LME
had been stuck between a rock and a hard place, and had come up with a
sensible solution which would lead to an orderly market. 'If you need to
borrow for a day and there is a party on the other side, then he might as
well lend the metal at Dollars 15 because he is not going to get any more,'
he said.
He pointed out that the zinc market was in oversupply last year, and supply
would probably outweigh demand again this year.
The LME action follows two warnings to the market earlier in the year, the
last time at the beginning of April. Mr Martin Abbott, marketing director of
the exchange, said at the time that the LME had fired 'a warning shot across
the bows of anyone who might be thinking of playing any games in the zinc
market'.

<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR SHORTAGE problems and better than expected exports have been blamed
for a sharp drop in Malaysia's palm oil stocks.
The Malaysian Palm Oil Registration and Licensing Authority (PORLA) said
that the country's palm oil stocks at the end of May stood at 456,000 tonnes
 -down more than 10 per cent from a month earlier.
Industry forecasts were for holding stocks of between 520,000 and 540,000
tonnes at the end of May. Traders were surprised at the steep fall in stocks
and said part of the reason was the absence of some labourers from the palm
oil plantations. Illegal immigrant workers, mostly Indonesians, have to
register with the Malaysian authorities by the end of this month or face
being expelled from the country.
Traders said another reason for the fall in stocks was increased exports
during May, particularly to Pakistan. PORLA estimated that Malaysia exported
467,000 tonnes of palm oil in May, compared with 409,000 tonnes in April.
Malaysia produced 6.1m tonnes of palm oil in 1991, just over half of the
total world output. Traders believe that supply shortages could push prices
up on the local market in the short term.

paper mills
</HEADLINE>

   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MOST OF British Columbia's pulp and paper industry has begun shutting down
after two unions refused a management offer made at the weekend and
mediation efforts failed.
The dispute concerns wages, removal of a statutory holiday and the
employment of non-union labour. The unions say that the managements' pay
offer did not come close to meeting their demands.
The province accounts for about 20 per cent of Canada's newsprint production
and 12 per cent of the north American total. The company's have about a
month's supply in stock but plenty of spare capacity exists in eastern
Canada.
British Columbia represents 50 per cent of Canadian northern softwood pulp
capacity and 18 per cent of north American and Scandinavian capacity. The
mills are working at more than 90 per cent of capacity now and buyer stocks
are sufficient for more than a month's paper production.
If the stoppage lasts several weeks, woodchips would pile up at the
sawmills, forcing reductions in timber production.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Colombia tries to filter out
excess coffee production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARITA KENDAL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BOGOTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SIZE of Colombia's coffee harvest - estimated at about 17m bags this
year - has become both a financial burden and a political embarrassment. So
much so that the government and Federacafe, the coffee growers' federation,
are trying to devise ways of reducing production by 1m to 1.5m bags (60 kg
each) and hope to have a scheme outlined before next week's International
Coffee Organisation meetings in London.
The whole idea of pulling up coffee trees is a role-reversal for
Federacafe's local committees, which were created to provide incentives for
growers and to improve the quality and quantity of coffee produced. Their
success, based on technical assistance, effective action against rust and
other coffee tree diseases, cheap fertiliser and constant renovation, is
reflected in today's output figures. Committees that increase coffee
production have normally been rewarded with bigger budgets.
Since the collapse of the International Coffee Agreement in July 1989
Colombia's share of the world market has grown to nearly 18 per cent, with
annual exports of some 13m bags. Local consumption absorbs another 1.5m bags
and stocks have built up to more than 9m bags.
For the National Coffee Fund, which finances the purchase of the crop at a
loss, the situation is clearly unsustainable. And for a country advocating
better management to achieve higher prices, it is uncomfortable.
Although the domestic price paid to coffee growers has dropped, it is still
high in comparison with international prices. Coffee is one of the most
profitable legal crops in Colombia with an assured market. A further
reduction in the support price would probably make little difference to the
area planted with coffee - mainly because alternative crops do not bring a
secure income.
At the top policy-making level, the government and the coffee authorities,
as well as the private exporters, are all in agreement with the plan to take
between 100,000 and 150,000 hectares (250,000-370,000 acres) out of
production. But so far neither small nor large growers have shown any
inclination to uproot their trees - in spite of the Dollars 1,500 to Dollars
1,800 per ha that has been mentioned as a possible incentive. The cost to
the coffee fund would be close to the cost of buying the extra harvest over
one year.
Colombia has about 1m ha of coffee distributed over several regions. The
eradication plan will probably affect all the main production areas and is
likely to target medium and large, rather than small, growers. Those who
accept the plan may have to sign an undertaking not to plant coffee within a
certain period. The main problem is to find alternatives for coffee farmers
 -among the possibilities are flowers, fruit, livestock and vegetables but
none have such dependable earnings.
Exporters believe there is a good chance of establishing a new agreement.
'We're seeing a new, active Brazil, this is a big change,' said Mr Diego
Pizano of Federacafe. 'The Europeans are also supporting a new pact with
quotas. There are difficulties of course but the basis could be agreed at
the London meeting.'
Colombia is arguing for a quota distribution reflecting performance during
the free market period. Depending on the global quota, this would give
Colombina exporters 11m to 12m bags - 1m less than current export volumes.
Hence the need to adopt the domestically unpopular eradication plan.

THE JAMAICAN and Russian governments are in negotiations about a dispute
over payment for bauxite ore shipped last year by the island to the former
Soviet Union.
Jamaican government officials say the ore was shipped under an agreement
with Raznoimport, a Soviet importing house based in Moscow. The contract,
for 1m tonnes of ore a year to be used in the Nicolayev refinery in the
Ukraine, is 'de facto dead although there has been no formal agreement to
terminate it,' according to Mr Carlton Davis, executive chairman of the

Mr Davis said the Jamaican government was seeking Dollars 4.5m from
Raznoimport, which is still in business, for ore which was actually
delivered. 'This does not take into account ore which was committed under
the agreement,' he said.

GOLD extended early gains to close on the London bullion market at Dollars
343 a troy ounce, up Dollars 3.15 from Friday's finish on the back of
constructive technicals after an afternoon fix of Dollars 342.70. Dealers
said that the market appeared to be building a base of support around
Dollars 342, but concern remained over producer sell orders believed to be
in place around current levels. A break through Dollars 345-Dollars 346
would signal a sharp move to Dollars 350. Comex gold futures were firmer at
midday. 'Gold is holding its gains from last week so it looks good,' said
one New York analyst. London COCOA prices closed down after speculative long
liquidation in New York ahead of July's first notice day tomorrow. There
appeared to be no sign of any major selling by producers, but the prospect
of further sales continued to weigh on sentiment. Dealers said signs of
increased flexibility from Brazil at producer talks in Ivory Coast were seen
as mildly constructive. On the LME solid buying interest helped keep TIN'S
upward momentum intact, with three-month prices hitting a new 25-month high
of Dollars 6,590 a tonne. Many expect prices to hit an upside objective of
Dollars 7,000 by the end of the month.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Egypt 'could tap desert water'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EGYPT'S WESTERN desert oases could support large-scale agriculture if vast
underground water resources were tapped, an Egyptian hydrological expert
believes.
Mr Ismail al-Ramly, a water resources consultant to the United Nations, says
that years of studying the agricultural potential of the sparsely populated
Western Desert had convinced him of the potential of the desert oases.
He estimates that the Farafra oasis some 400 km (250 miles) south-west of
Cairo offers the best prospects, with sufficient water to cultivate about
200,000 acres of land, compared with the present 10,000 acres.
Bahariya, some 100 km closer to Cairo, was also a good candidate for vastly
increased cultivation from the present about 10,000 acres to a potential of
100,000. The Siwa oasis towards the Libyan border could also support much
increased cultivated acreage, Mr Ramly says.
The Egyptian expert says that his studies have established that, contrary to
theories advanced earlier this century, Egypt's desert water resources are
'self-contained.' In other words, desert aquifers are not re-charged with
water from surrounding Libya, Chad or Sudan. Rather, he believes that the
water comes from seepage from the Nile at Qena in Upper Egypt where the
river forms a giant 'S'. This water has made its way west along 'tectonic
zones' to aquifers under what is known as the 'great sand sea' towards the
Sudanese and Libyan borders.
Mr Ramly has also identified promising areas in the northern approaches to
the Dakhla and Kharga oases, south of Farafra and Bahariya. But as yet
little detailed work has been conducted in those areas.
Investigation of Western Desert water resources has been helped by an
enhanced oil exploration programme. Data from oil drilling has enabled Mr
Ramly to build up a fairly comprehensive hydrological picture that would not
have been possible otherwise because of the cost involved.
He estimates that water resources available to Bahariya amount to about
1.8bn cu m, sufficient for 300 years of cultivation. He has yet to complete
his evaluation of Farafra.
Western desert water is of excellent quality, he says, and compares
favourably with that of the Nile.
Mr Ramly says large-scale agricultural development of the western desert
would require big investments, but he is convinced the returns would be
there.
For the Egyptian government, struggling to accommodate its growing
population within the confines of the Nile valley and delta and to reduce
its dependence on food imports, utilisation of the western desert oases may
make sense - if the tapping of deep desert aquifers is cost efficient.

FT  16 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Buyers of property bonds look
for firm foundations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SLUMP in the UK property market continues to pose awkward questions for
holders of bonds issued by property companies and developers.
The downturn is still eating into the credit quality of issuers. Last week,
IBCA, the UK credit rating agency, said it was reviewing the credit ratings
of all the UK property companies it analyses.
The review covers the long-term credit ratings of some the UK's largest
property investment companies: Land Securities, MEPC, Hammerson, British
Land, Slough Estates, Capital &amp; Counties and Brixton Estate.
Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's, the two biggest US rating agencies, have
already downgraded a number of companies in the sector. Hammerson, for
example, currently carries an A+ senior rating from IBCA, but is rated two
notches below this level by Moody's and is already under review for a
further downgrade.
However, IBCA noted that the financial strength of property investment
companies has shown an overall deterioration over the past two years. Of the
companies rated by IBCA, debt interest cover averaged 1.7 times last year,
down from 4.2 times in 1988. Average net gearing is now 60 per cent, up from
27 per cent in the same period.
Even holders of secured bonds may not be immune from the downturn. Last
week, the accounts of Regalian, the property developer, were qualified by
its auditors on the grounds that its development sites and empty properties
had no firm value.
Against this background, bond market investors are demanding tighter
covenants. Holders of debentures are particularly keen to keep track of the
assets on which bonds are secured.
Until recently, most secured bonds issued by UK property companies were not
secured on particular assets. Instead, the issuer has the option of moving
properties in and out of the pool of security at will - a feature known as
substitutability.
The issuer has an obligation to maintain a pool of security of a certain
value - usually 150 per cent of the face value of the bonds. But properties
can be swapped in and out of the security pool without informing
bondholders.
In contrast, most US property bonds are secured on a particular property or
development. The assets are often 'ring-fenced' within a special purpose
vehicle and revenue from the property goes towards servicing the debt.
This does not insulate bondholders from falling property values. But the
structure offers bondholders security of known quality.
'UK debenture holders assume they have proper security and look on their
portfolio of mortgage bonds as insulated from concerns over corporate credit
quality,' said Mr Hugh Corbett, head of corporate bond research at UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew. 'Yet the weakness of covenants means that in some cases
they are little better off than unsecured creditors.' Analysts point to
London &amp; Provincial, a property subsidiary of Randsworth Acquisition, which
went into administrative receivership in March.
In the year prior to receivership, L&amp;P substituted properties out of the
pool of assets which backed its Pounds 135m debentures, putting new assets
in place. Under the terms of the issue there was no need to tell
bondholders.
The trustee, Law &amp; Debenture Trust, said a full valuation of the security
now backing the bonds would take place before the end of June. But it is
unlikely the valuation will be sufficient to meet the bond covenants.
There are signs that holders of UK bonds are looking for similar safeguards.
Last week, Allied London properties added Pounds 25m to an existing Pounds
50m long-dated bond issue, lead-managed by Schroder Securities. The bond
covenants oblige the company to tell holders when it substitutes new
properties into the pool of security. This type of covenant is now standard
in sterling debenture issues.
Amid the gloom there is an argument that debentures with strong covenants
and ample security at current property prices now represent good value.
For example, last week's Allied London issue is backed by security valued at
1.67 times the issue amount - slightly higher than the norm in the late
1980s.
Moreover, since property valuations are now very low, the annual rental
income from the bonds covers interest payments on the bonds 1.62 times,
again higher than the usual ratio of interest cover in recent years.
Together with tighter covenants, the position of bond holders should be more
secure.
The Allied London debenture issue even carries 'environmental protection'
covenants, the first to do so: an environmental audit showed that none of
the properties in the security pool were built on a contaminated site.

FT  16 JUN 92 / International Bonds: Canadian utility prepares to launch
CDollars 750m issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HYDRO QUEBEC, the Canadian utility, was yesterday preparing to launch its
third global bond, an issue of at least CDollars 750m 30-year paper.
Syndicate officials expected the deal to be launched in the next two to
three days. Yesterday, participants in the deal were discussing the fine
details of the transaction with the issuer.
Outstanding long-dated global bonds, which can be traded in both domestic
and Eurobond markets, issued by Hydro Quebec trade on a yield spread of
85-87 basis points over government bonds.
However, the bonds trade at a premium to face value following a sharp fall
in Canadian bond yields last year. Some syndicate officials said a new issue
could be launched at a marginally narrower yield spread.
Although European investors are strong buyers of Canadian dollar bonds, the
long-dated maturity may appeal more to investors in north America. Bankers
noted that earlier long-dated global bond issues have been 'stripped' -
repackaged into series of smaller zero coupon bonds - by investment banks in
the US and Canada.
Elsewhere, the Eurodollar sector was seen as the most likely source of new
issues. The Asian Development Bank is planning a Dollars 500m 10-year issue,
via Goldman Sachs, although underwriters were not expecting the deal to
emerge this week.
Nafinsa, the Mexican state-backed financing agency, has mandated JP Morgan
to lead manage a Dollars 100m 10-year offering. Bankers expected the bonds
to be priced at around 195 basis points more than US treasury bonds.
Nafinsa's existing 10-year paper trades on a spread of around 185-190 basis
points over treasuries.
European bond markets remain disturbed by uncertainty over the ratification
of the Maastricht treaty on European monetary union. On Thursday, the Irish
electorate vote in a referendum on the treaty. A rejection of Maastricht
could cause a further sell-off, while a vote in favour could boost all
European bond markets.
The International Securities Market Association, the regulatory body for the
Eurobond market, has won agreement from the Bank of Italy that ISMA rules on
securities trading should apply to cross-border trading of Italian
government securities.
A number of Italian and non-Italian banks are in dispute over the settlement
of trades in Italian government bonds, some of which have been repudiated.
ISMA said it 'objects in the strongest possible terms to the unilateral
cancellation of transactions'.
Salomon Inc, the parent company of Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank,
has had its long-term credit rating raised by one notch to A+ by IBCA, the
UK rating agency.

CYCLE and Carriage (CCL), the Singapore car distributor, and its partner
Hotel Properties (HPL), have acquired 85 per cent of Malayan Credit (MCL), a
local family-run property company, Reuter reports from Singapore
CCL said that on the expiry of the takeover offer last Friday the two
acquiring companies had acquired 274.31m MCL shares, representing 85.31 per
cent of its issued capital.
The 85.31 per cent stake includes 24.17 per cent held by HPL prior to the
takeover. It also includes a 24.42 per cent shareholding which had belonged
to Mr Teo Soo Chew, MCL chairman, and his family members. They sold their
stake last week to Cycle.
Singapore's Teo family, which founded MCL, has had nearly total control of
the company.
CCL announced the takeover bid on April 10, offering SDollars 2.25 for every
MCL share.
At midday yesterday, CCL stood 5 cents lower at SDollars 6.60 and MCL had
risen 5 cents to SDollars 2.38.
CCL, diversifying into property and food businesses to overcome a softer car
market, has said it would place all MCL stock in excess of 85 per cent of
the issued share capital at SDollars 2.10 per share under placing agreements
with two broking houses.
Analysts said that limiting the combined CCL/HPL stake to 85 per cent would
ensure MCL's listing on the local bourse.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOSTER'S Brewing Group (FBG), the Australian brewer, yesterday rejected a
merger proposal from SA Brewing (SABH), the beverages and manufacturing
group, Reuter reports from Sydney.
Mr Nobby Clark, Foster's chairman, said: 'On balance, we do not believe that
the SABH merger proposal would be advantageous for Foster's Brewing Group
shareholders.'
Mr Clark said Foster's strategy was to become a single-purpose brewing
company and it did not believe the SA Brewing proposal offered benefits to
justify a reversal of this strategy.
'FBG believes that the non-beer businesses (of SABH) are incompatible with
the current FBG businesses and that the SABH proposal offers minimal
synergies, while exposing FBG to substantial downsides with continued
instability, costs and implementation issues,' he said.
SA Brewing announced in May a plan to merge with Foster's via a cashless
share swap, creating a company with assets of about ADollars 10.6bn
(USDollars 8bn)
Following that announcement, S&amp;P-Australian Ratings placed the credit rating
of Foster's on creditwatch. S&amp;P currently rates Foster's unsecured debt at
BB and its commercial paper at B1.
Turning to Foster's overall financial position, Mr Clark said: 'While FBG is
sound with a strong cash-flow, we recognise the benefits that would flow
from a better credit rating. Options to address this matter are being
carefully examined.'
Carlton and United Breweries (CUB), a unit of Foster's Brewing Group unit,
and Power Brewing plan to form a joint venture company to buy Power's
brewery and beer brands for about ADollars 90m, Reuter reports from
Brisbane.
Power and CUB said that the 50-50 joint venture, Queensland Breweries, would
have equal representation by Power and CUB on its board.
Power and CUB said that under the joint venture proposal Queensland
Breweries would brew beer for Power and CUB but each company would maintain
control of marketing and distributing its own brands through supply
agreements.
They said CUB would eventually relocate its Queensland production from an
inner-city site in the Queensland state capital of Brisbane to Yatala, about
40 km south of Brisbane.
Power's brewery is at Yatala. 'This will ensure that the Yatala facility
will be fully utilised,' the companies said.
The arrangement is subject to the approval of Power shareholders and the
Australian Foreign Investment Review Board.
The companies said production would continue at both sites until the
relocation and the effects of rationalisation would be subject to
discussions with all relevant parties.
Mr Mike Pelly, CUB's regional director of northern states, said: 'The Yatala
site has considerable potential for expansion to meet increasing demands for
our products in an area where the nation's biggest population growth over
the next decade or more is projected.'
Mr Bernard Power, Power Brewing chairman, said the deal ensured the
continuing strength of Power's brands.
Foster's shares ended unchanged yesterday at ADollars 2.06. Power shares,
which last traded at 85 cents, were suspended ahead of the news.

FISHER and Paykel, the New Zealand white goods manufacturer, has reported an
88.4 per cent rise in net profits to NZDollars 8m (USDollars 4.3m) from
NZDollars 4.2m a year earlier, helped by strong growth in exports.
The company reported a 50 per cent advance in sales in Australia following
the opening of a factory in Queensland. This gives it 10 per cent of the
Australian market.
Continuing slack demand in New Zealand saw an 8 per cent drop in sales there
to NZDollars 331.1m.
Total export earnings, to Australia and the US, rose 40 per cent to
NZDollars 144.3m. Operating revenue was virtually unchanged at NZDollars

Directors said demand would remain low for the rest of the year. Tax was
NZDollars 3.76m (NZDollars 2.2m). Bottom-line profit was NZDollars 6.9m
against NZDollars 4.4m) last year.
Shareholders' funds were NZDollars 225.9m compared with NZDollars 224.9m a

<TEXT>
TELECOM Corporation of New Zealand (Telecom NZ) yesterday said a continuing
price war with its rival, Clear Communications, could hit future earnings,
Reuter reports from Wellington.
'If competition for toll market share continues principally on the basis of
price, this may have an adverse effect upon future net earnings, in which
case the provision in the Kiwi Share enables the company to increase
residential prices at a faster rate,' it said.
The Kiwi Share commits Telecom NZ to maintaining free local calling and
limits how much it can hike prices.
Telecom said the extent and timing of any increases to domestic calling
rates and the effect on earnings remained uncertain.
Analysts believe that newcomer Clear grabbed 10 per cent of the
long-distance phone market in 1991-92, mainly on the basis of price. They
estimate Telecom NZ has lowered prices by 10 to 15 per cent since March 31
to match Clear's prices.
Telecom NZ said long-distance revenue fell 2 per cent in the last quarter of
the 1991-92 year as a result of lost market share and reduced prices.
Telecom NZ expects long-distance and international calling revenue to
decline in 1993. It said it sees Clear shifting its competition from price
to quality in the second phase of its attack on Telecom.

MR Steve Ross, chairman and co-chief executive of media group Time Warner,
announced he was taking a temporary leave of absence from the group to
resume treatment for prostate cancer, from which he has been suffering for a
considerable time.
Mr Ross said in a letter to Mr Gerald Levin, his co-chief executive, that he
had been advised he had not fully recuperated and must now resume treatment.
Time Warner declined to comment further on Mr Ross's cancer, or on how long
the leave of absence might last.
Mr Ross, who began his business career as a director of funeral homes, built
the Warner group into a leading film and entertainment business before
combining it with Time, the book and magazine publisher, in a highly
controversial 1989 merger.
Earlier this year, Mr Nick Nicholas, previously Mr Ross's co-chief
executive, quit the group after a series of disputes over strategy, leaving
Mr Levin as the chairman's evident heir apparent.
Mr Ross said in yesterday's letter that he was 'completely comfortable' with
Mr Levin taking over during his absence. He expressed confidence in Mr
Levin's leadership skills and said the two shared the same vision for Time
Warner. He added that he looked forward to returning to work as soon as
possible.
His absence comes as Time Warner continues a lengthy search for a European
partner to invest in part of its business.

THE MEXICAN government has sold 66 per cent of Banco Mercantil del Norte
(Banorte) for 1,776bn pesos (Dollars 567m), bringing the total proceeds from
the 16 banks privatised so far to 35,100bn pesos.
Banorte was sold to investors headed by shareholders in Grupo Maseca, a
company best known in Mexico for tortilla flour. The group bid 951 pesos per
share, valuing the bank at 4.25 times book value, and 12.62 historic
earnings.
This is roughly in line with bids for the three previous banks privatised,
which were sold at a multiple of earnings of 17.85, 16.45 and 11.13
respectively.
The next highest bid for Banorte was 1.1 per cent less than Grupo Maseca's,
an indication of the competition between bidders to acquire a bank before it
is too late.
Just two more banks remain on the block, with the last, Banco del Centro,
due to be sold on July 3.
Banorte is the largest of Mexico's five regional banks, with 125 branches in
northern Mexico. It has 16 per cent of loans in the states of Nuevo Leon,
Tamaulipas and Coahuila.
The new owners intend to increase service along the US-Mexican border and,
in due course, buy or set up a brokerage and create an integrated financial
group.

each share of Corporate Foods.
Now an independent committee of Corporate Food directors has recommended the
merger take place on the same basis, but with a cash option.
Corporate Food shareholders can now take CDollars 19.90 a share cash for
their stock.
Hillsdown will take steps to retain its 56 per cent ownership in Maple Leaf
Foods, which is has operations in the US and Europe.
BioChem Pharma, one of Canada's leading biotech companies, and Sweden's
Astra pharmaceuticals group plan a joint development of the Montreal
company's pain control compounds, based on BCH-150, now at the pre-clinical
trial stage.
The agreement includes an upfront payment, research, funding and other
payments from Astra to BioChem and provides for the potential future
development and commercialisation of compounds.

1.87bn from Dollars 1.83bn.
The company said the strength of the US dollar against foreign currencies
depressed sales in the quarter by 2.1 per cent. This was offset by a 2.3 per
cent improvement in volume in a number of brands including StarKist tuna,
baby food and ketchup.
Fourth-quarter operating income fell 16 per cent to Dollars 230.5m from
Dollars 275.5m. Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 5 per cent
to Dollars 466.3m from Dollars 443.6m.
For the full year, a pre-tax Dollars 221.5m gain on the sale of Heinz's
Hubinger subsidiary helped the company post a 12.4 per cent rise in net
income to Dollars 638.3m, or Dollars 2.40 a share, from Dollars 568m, or
Dollars 2.13, a year earlier.
Sales for the year slipped to Dollars 6.58bn from Dollars 4.65bn. Heinz
attributed the decline to the divestitures of Hubinger and Caribbean
Restaurants, another subsidiary. Volume was essentially flat in the year.
Mr Tony O'Reilly, chairman, said he was pleased that the results were on
target with earlier predictions in spite of turbulent market conditions.
'The replacement of The Hubinger Company by JLFoods took the company out of
a commodity business into a value-added food business with excellent growth
prospects,' he added. 'The acquisition has performed ahead of expectations.'
Heinz also announced the appointment of two new senior vice-presidents
yesterday. Mr David Williams, 49, will be based at Heinz's world
headquarters in Pittsburgh. Mr Williams is also the company's chief
financial officer.
Mr Luigi Ribolla, 55, will head Heinz's European operations from Milan. He
replaces Mr Paul Corddry, 56, who is retiring after 28 years with the
company.

OUTOKUMPU, the Finnish mining and metals group, made a profit of FM3m
(Dollars 700,000) for the first four months of the year compared with a
FM77m loss in the same period of 1991.
Net sales improved by 8 per cent to FM4.42bn against FM4.1bn in the
year-earlier period.
The company said the improvement reflected the devaluation of the markka
last autumn and a 'faint upturn in demand', but it added that the results
'remained unsatisfactory'.
Dr Jyrki Juusela, chief executive and chairman, said that he believed 'world
economic growth and investment activities' should 'strengthen slightly',
although there were many uncertainties about forecasting performance for the
rest of 1992.
Dr Juusela said the expected upturn would be 'quite slow'. For the year,
Outokumpu aimed to show 'a strong improvement' on the FM543m loss it made
for the whole of 1991, he added.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FORMER senior management of Nordbanken, the ailing Swedish
state-controlled bank, is criticised strongly in an inquiry into its
financial troubles, published yesterday.
The report suggests that the administration of the bank at the time of its
merger with the private PK Banken three years ago was 'almost
catastrophically bad'.
It accuses Nordbanken of an 'extraordinary and unacceptable' lack of
management during 1988 and 1989 particularly in its Stockholm headquarters
over provision of credit.
The report points to a high turnover of staff dealing with credit policy
with a large number young and inexperienced.
In spite of internal warnings calling for better credit procedures, the
bank's senior executives had never followed up the recommendations made to
them, suggested Mr Bertil Sodermark, a distinguished Swedish solicitor, who
wrote the report.
Only parts of the reports have been authorised for publication by the
Ministry of Finance.

FT  16 JUN 92 / International Company News: Continental says Pirelli should
repay dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONTINENTAL, the German tyre company, yesterday demanded that Pirelli, its
Italian rival, should repay the dividend received last year on its shares in
the Germany company.
The demand represents an intensification of hostilities between the two
companies, following Pirelli's announcement that it will be launching a
second attempt to remove shareholder voting restrictions at Continental.
This challenge will be mounted at a shareholders' meeting scheduled for July
3. The two companies spent almost 18 months trying to negotiate a merger
until talks broke down in December last year.
The German company's demand for DM8.91m (Dollars 5.53m) stems directly from
a courtroom victory it won over Pirelli last month.
Continental said yesterday that the ruling meant that Pirelli was not
entitled to collect a dividend on its shares, just as it was not entitled to
have voting rights on those shares.
Pirelli said last night that it would not pay back the dividend as it was
already challenging the legal decision on which the claim for the repayment
was based.
Continental said if Pirelli did not pay the money back it would take the
Italian company to court in an attempt to obtain it. Once the money had been
obtained, it would be paid into a dividend reserve and be available for
distribution to shareholders at some stage in the future.
The Hanover court ruled on May 29 that Pirelli's earlier attempt to overturn
voting restrictions - which limit shareholders' votes in Continental to 5
per cent no matter how big their stake - was invalid on the basis that
contrary to German company law, Pirelli had not declared it spoke for more
than 25 per cent of the German company.
At present, Pirelli owns 5 per cent and has options over a further 34 per
cent. The court ruled that Pirelli had direct control over a minimum of 25.4
per cent of Continental when it launched its first challenge in March last
year.
These hostilities come at a complicated time in the relations between the
two companies. They are still in negotiations over the sale of some of
Pirelli's non-tyre businesses which Continental would like to buy.

PHILIPP Holzmann, the German construction group, said it expected a further
improvement in operating results in 1992, Reuter reports from Frankfurt.
The company said that group construction output, which climbed by 32.2 per
cent in the first quarter to DM2.46bn (Dollars 1.52bn), would rise to more
than DM12bn for the full year after reaching DM10.96bn in 1991.
Holzmann said most of its loss-making subsidiaries should return to profits,
but it declined to provide details.
Holzmann had a net profit in 1991 of DM50.6m, up from DM16.7m in the
previous year. The company's parent company order inflow rose 13.4 per cent
to DM3.75bn in 1991, while group order inflow rose 2 per cent to DM11.04bn.
Orders in hand at the end of 1991 totalled DM10.07bn, an improvement of 5
per cent on end-1990 levels.
Group construction output in 1991 totalled DM10.96bn, an increase of 18.5
per cent.

FT  16 JUN 92 / International Company News: SMI caught in a vicious circle -
An acquisition-led expansion at the Italian metals concern has brought
surging turnover but not profits growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOCIETA Mettalurgica Italiana's (SMI) purchase of Kabelmetal, its bigger
German rival, enabled it to double sales and become Europe's biggest maker
of copper and alloy products.
Turnover at the Florence-based group surged to L3,013bn (Dollars 2.5bn) last
year thanks to the purchase of the German copper concern, formerly owned by
the MAN group. However, its profits have remained static. The Kabelmetal
deal was the latest and biggest step in SMI's L600bn expansion over the past
five years, when it transformed itself from a collection of small Italian
copper companies into a multinational with acquisitions in France, Spain
and, most recently, Germany.
Earnings, however, have not kept pace with growth. Net group profits after
minority interests amounted to just L12.2bn in 1991, less than the L12.7bn
made on turnover half as big as in 1990.
The reason for the disappointing earnings lies in the depressed state of the
construction industry in most European countries and the fact that SMI's
capital has not kept pace with its acquisition-led expansion.
SMI - led by Mr Luigi Orlando, a three-time deputy chairman of the
Confindustria employers' federation - belongs to the exclusive club of
companies which form the salotto buono - the good drawing room - of Italian
private-sector industry.
Its ownership reflects its pedigree. SMI, the main holding concern, holds 45
per cent of Europa Metalli, the chief operating arm, which, in turn,
controls the group's foreign subsidiaries. SMI itself is 47 per cent owned
by GIM, a financial holding company controlled by the Orlando family, which
features a bevy of top Italian private sector names such as Pirelli and
Mediobanca among its shareholders.
Having a small base of stable shareholders has facilitated control by the
Orlandos and the network of big Italian family-controlled companies, which
are often linked by complex cross-shareholdings. However, the lack of a wide
shareholder base is also one of the reasons why SMI's capitalisation has
failed to rise at the same rate as its growth.
The company is caught in a vicious circle. Foreign expansion has been
essential to reap economies of scale and compete with bigger public and
private-sector rivals abroad. Yet SMI's owners have been reluctant to pump
in more capital to match its growth until earnings improve. But it is the
lack of funds, and consequent heavy borrowing costs, which are among the
factors now depressing profits.
While the group's debt declined by around L50bn to L900bn last year, the
total is still on a par with total shareholders' funds. Meanwhile,
consolidated interest charges amounted to around L100bn last year,
representing over 3 per cent of sales. 'That is still too high,' admits Mr
Orlando.
The problem is not entirely of SMI's making. The price for Kabelmetal rose
unexpectedly after the German cartel office blocked MAN's original plans to
reinvest the proceeds. The delay meant MAN missed the deadline for special
tax breaks linked to its reinvestment plans, prompting it to demand a higher
price and tougher payment terms for Kabelmetal. Instead of paying L276bn
over several years, SMI had to deliver the full L410bn in cash.
Consolidation of its acquisitions is SMI's top priority, says Mr Sergio
Ceccuzzi, managing director. SMI has already divided product
responsibilities between different parts of the group. Kabelmetal, by far
the biggest single unit, has been given sole charge of material purchasing.
Research has been split between the French, German and Italian operations,
with a single manager in charge, while SMI itself has closed some factories
in Italy.
Small improvements have already been evident on the bottom line. Gross
operating earnings, although partly swollen by the inclusion of Kabelmetal,
climbed to L235bn from L106bn in 1990. Productivity improvements are also
responsible for the operating improvement. However, Mr Orlando stresses SMI
will have to do much better before turning to shareholders for more capital.
Much will depend on the market. SMI's French and Spanish arms failed to make
money last year, while its UK operations were also badly affected by the
crisis in the building trade. Meanwhile, prices for copper products remain
depressed by overcapacity and price competition.
The company hopes its bigger size will give it greater leverage over
suppliers and customers, and leave it better placed to sit out price wars in
the industry.
Hence its decision not to cut its L35 dividend for ordinary shares and L70
for savings stock this year. Explaining the decision to leave the dividend
intact, Mr Orlando stresses SMI's efficiency improvements should lead to
higher earnings this year, even without an upturn in the market.
Eventually, the group will need more capital. With its domestic shareholder
base limited, SMI is already trying to become better known abroad. In
February, it launched an Ecu100m commercial paper programme, organised by a
trio of French, Swiss and Italian banks, as its latest step to become more
familiar on foreign markets.
However, Mr Ceccuzzi has no false hopes about the role of foreign investors.
'The image of our industry is not always at its best. It's almost come to be
seen as one an industry without a future,' he admits.
'It's up to us to show we can set ourselves targets and then show results,'
adds Mr Orlando. 'Only then can we ask shareholders for more cash.'

HENNES and Mauritz, the largest Swedish clothing retailer, achieved 67 per
cent growth in profits for the first six months of the year, writes Robert
Taylor. Profits rose to SKr358.6m (Dollars 63m) from SKr214.7m in the 1991
period.
Turnover rose by 18 per cent to SKr4.340bn from SKr3.678bn, with sales
outside Sweden responsible for 53 per cent of that improvement.
The retailer's success partly stems from expansion outside Sweden,
particularly in Switzerland, Britain and Germany. This summer, it plans to
open three stores in Belgium, with a total of 15 new outlets in Europe by
the end of the year.
The company's shares have risen faster there than any other listed company.
Last year it enjoyed 87 per cent growth in profits to SKr619m.

<TEXT>
HOUSEHOLD Mortgage Corporation, the privately-owned residential mortgage
company, yesterday upstaged larger lenders by more than doubling its pre-tax
profits in the year to March 31 despite the housing market recession.
In one of the strongest performances in the housing finance industry in
1991, HMC's taxable profits for the 12 months surged from Pounds 2.21m to
Pounds 5.16m. Interest receivable rose from Pounds 228.43m to Pounds
258.66m, while other operating income was up from Pounds 4.87m to Pounds
9.45m.
Bad debt provisions remained relatively modest by the standards of other
lenders at Pounds 4.16m, though sharply up from Pounds 2.2m last time.
Operating expenses were up from Pounds 15.78m to Pounds 20.2m.
Total assets of Pounds 2bn were unchanged from last year and the customer
base was maintained at 40,000. During the year HMC increased its asset base
by purchasing mortgage books from several other lenders, including Westpac
and Boston Safe.
Mr Maxwell Packe, finance director, said the increase in profits reflected a
decision taken in the early stages of the recession by the company to
concentrate on top quality customers.
The 13 institutions which own HMC will be paid a dividend of 4.5 per cent,
totalling Pounds 1.4m.
A spokesman for the company said yesterday that HMC's long term plans
included a possible stock market flotation when the housing market had
recovered.

WINDSOR has won a contract to provide insurance for professional football's
newly-formed Premier League, positioning it to take advantage of an expected
influx of capital into the sport.
Windsor, which has acted as brokers to professional football's associations
and clubs since 1972, is already the dominant force in a market which
generated over Pounds 5m in premiums last year.
Under the terms of the deal, which is understood to be worth about Pounds
100,000, Windsor will supply personal accident and sickness covers and
liability insurances for professional footballers.
It has also been reappointed by the Football League, which will now organise
all English and Welsh clubs outside the Premier League.
The contracts will put Windsor in a prime position to win business to place
insurances to cover stadia and extra personal accident insurance purchased
by the clubs themselves.
The league's personal accident policies provide coverage of some Pounds
30,000 - for a premium of about Pounds 450 - while transfer fees for top
players in the UK frequently exceed Pounds 1m.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WELLMAN, the broadly-based engineering group, saw its pre-tax profit fall
almost Pounds 2m from Pounds 2.96m to Pounds 1.05m in the year ended March
31 1992, after reorganisation costs of Pounds 400,000.
The dividend is again 2.2p with a proposed final of 1.4p, and is just
covered by fully diluted earnings of 2.4p, compared with 6.3p.
Mr Geoffrey Iley, chairman, said all parts of the group experienced lower
activity levels.
Wellman Process and Wellman Bibby achieved higher profits although that did
not offset a significantly lower contribution from Cadogan as British
Aerospace partially withdrew work from sub-contractors.
Demand for furnace equipment remained depressed and Wellman Furnaces
suffered a loss of Pounds 240,000 before reorganisation.
The attributable profit fell from Pounds 2.17m to Pounds 262,000 after
taking into account Pounds 547,000 extraordinary charges relating to costs
of withdrawing from two low margin businesses.
Turnover slumped from Pounds 33m to Pounds 24m. Forward order book at March
31 was similar to last year, and had since been enhanced by the acquisition
of Midcast.

FT  16 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Vibroplant falls 27% to Pounds 4.5m and
sees no sign of upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JEREMY PILKINGTON, chairman of Vibroplant, the plant hire group,
yesterday warned that construction levels are likely to remain depressed for
the rest of the year as he announced a 27 per cent fall in pre-tax profits
for the year end to March.
Although turnover remain broadly static at Pounds 76.8m (Pounds 77.9m) the
stabilisation of prices at low levels across both sides of the Atlantic
resulted in pre-tax profits falling from Pounds 6.2m to Pounds 4.5m.
While the profit fall was less than in previous results Mr Pilkington
admitted to being 'very disappointed' at heavy trading losses at its
Baltimore business which was closed.
This contributed to the 39 per cent fall in US pre-tax profits to Pounds
1.2m, while sales rose 3 per cent to Pounds 38.9m (Pounds 37.6m).
In the UK turnover fell slightly to Pounds 37.9m (Pounds 40.3m) but severe
pricing pressures eroded margins and pre-tax profits fell by 21 per cent
from Pounds 4.2m to Pounds 3.3m.
Despite investing Pounds 14m in rental fleet and other assets borrowings
were reduced by Pounds 9m to Pounds 37m, representing gearing of 70 per
cent.
Borrowings fell because of cost cutting which resulted in the loss of 100
staff in both the US and UK and a fall in capital expenditure from Pounds
26m to Pounds 14m. Mr Pilkington said: 'While prices remain at these low
levels the business does not warrant new capital investment.'
An extraordinary charge of Pounds 83,000 related to the writing-off of
goodwill through the profit and loss account from a disposal which had been
taken through reserves.
Earnings per share fell from 9.84p to 6.55p. The final dividend is
maintained at 2.38p per share making an unchanged total of 3.6p.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FALL in interest payable from Pounds 924,000 to Pounds 745,000 enabled
Faupel Trading Group, the USM-quoted textile importer, to report pre-tax
profits up by 8 per cent to Pounds 1.21m in the year to March 31.
The rise from Pounds 1.12m was struck on turnover 24 per cent ahead at
Pounds 26.4m (Pounds 21.3m). Operating profits slipped from Pounds 2.04m to
Pounds 1.95m.
Mr Iain Brown, chief executive, said that demand in the textiles sector was
flat, but that Faupel's investment was in stock - mainly from China - not
plant and machinery, giving it an advantage over domestic producers.
The company also had a 'good spread of customers', such as BhS, Milletts,
Laura Ashley, Selfridges, John Lewis, Harrods, JD Williams and Empire
Stores, he said.
As for signs of any general economic upturn, Mr Brown had 'seen half a robin
on the lawn, but it flew away'.
The household textiles division accounts for turnover of about Pounds 7m.
The non-fashion garments side, which had turnover of about Pounds 16m, had a
good autumn season, though the spring season was more 'difficult'.
In April Faupel 'took the hard decision' and made a Pounds 431,000
extraordinary provision against its 19.6 per cent investment in New World
Electronic Products, the infra-red security lighting company which went into
receivership.
The directors have recommended maintaining the final dividend at 3.05p for a
same-again total of 4.9p, payable from earnings of 10.22p (9.44p) per share.

FT  16 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Amber Day downgrades forecast - Two
directors to leave board as group reports trading levels below expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMBER DAY, the discount retailer, yesterday combined a profits warning with
news of the resignation of the group's finance director and only
non-executive director, both within a year of joining the group.
The shares closed 4p lower at 58p. However, the shares - which reached 129p
last November - had already fallen 5p to 62p on Friday, ahead of a press
report on Sunday which forecast the profits downgrade and boardroom
departures.
Amber Day said yesterday the board had committed itself to splitting the
roles of Mr Philip Green, the group's controversial chairman and chief
executive.
Last year the group more than trebled pre-tax profits to Pounds 10.1m,
thanks mainly to its acquisition in 1990 of the What Everyone Wants discount
chain, operating in Scotland and the north of England.
The official statement said trading for the second half of the current year,
to August 2, had not come up to budget and full-year profits would be below
stockbrokers' current expectations. Analysts yesterday accordingly reduced
their forecasts from Pounds 14m-Pounds 15m to about Pounds 12m.
While gross margins had increased, the group said sales levels had suffered
from the sluggish retail environment and unusually poor weather conditions
in Scotland this spring. Profits would suffer from a decline in sales on a
like-for-like basis and non-recurring costs of about Pounds 500,000.
However, the group remained confident of the underlying strength of the core
discount retailing business and strong cash flow. It, therefore, intended to
recommend a final dividend for the year of 3.1p (2.4p) per share, an
increase of 14.8 per cent.
Mr Graham Coles, who joined the group as finance director last June, is
leaving to become finance director of First Leisure, the hotels and leisure
operator. Amber Day said it was currently interviewing a short list of
prospective candidates to succeed Mr Coles, who would remain until after his
successor was appointed.
Also announced was the departure of Mr Leslie Warman, a former director of
Lloyds Merchant Bank, who joined as the group's only non-executive last
July. The board said it was actively seeking a replacement.
Amber Day's shares have suffered from bear raids and a personalised
whispering campaign against Mr Green. Analysts said that, although the
combination of yesterday's announcements was unfortunate, they did not in
themselves seem to reveal any fundamental weakness in the group's business.
However, they added that sentiment in the shares was unlikely to recover
until Mr Green had demonstrated he could work - probably as chief executive
 -alongside someone with a solid track record in the City.
Mr Green was not available for comment yesterday.

FT  16 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Recession-hit Renold tumbles Pounds 3m into
the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RENOLD, the chain and gear maker, yesterday announced its first loss since
1987 as recession hit demand in its main markets of the UK, Europe and North
America.
The loss of Pounds 3m pre-tax for the 12 months to March 28 compared with a
previous profit of Pounds 2.5m. The shares fell 3p to 57p.
Mr John Allan, finance director, said the outlook remained mixed. 'February
and March showed some improvement but May has been somewhat of a
disappointment,' he said.
Turnover dropped to Pounds 121.5m (Pounds 128.9m). The company said Germany,
which accounted for 13 per cent of sales in 1991, weakened towards the end
of the year after a strong start.
There was a Pounds 1.5m (Pounds 1.7m) exceptional loss for redundancy costs,
mainly in Germany.
Total staff numbers have fallen 21 per cent since March 1990.
Interest charges rose in line with higher borrowings to Pounds 1.8m (Pounds
400,000).
Net borrowings at year-end increased to Pounds 12.8m (Pounds 10.4m), while
gearing rose from 19 per cent to 25 per cent.
Losses per share emerged at 5.6p (earnings 1.4p) The company omitted its
interim dividend but is recommending a final of 1p - shareholders received a
3.7p total previously.
A transfer from reserves of Pounds 4.4m covered losses and the dividend
bill. Shareholders' funds fell from Pounds 54.8m to Pounds 50.4m.
Capital expenditure, mainly on new machine tools, fell to to Pounds 5m
(Pounds 11.6m), but was still ahead of depreciation of Pounds 4.5m (Pounds
4m).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Southern Electric and Phillips Petroleum Company UK have agreed to enter
into a 50/50 joint venture to acquire and market gas.
Initially that will be gas released by tender from British Gas. But over
time it is expected that the joint ven-ture will market gas from other
sources, including fields in which Phillips has an in-terest.
Entry into the gas supply market is consistent with Southern Electric's
strategy to increase its non-regulated businesses and to become a leading
energy utility.

Clarke Hooper has sold a US business for Dollars 462,500 (Pounds 254,000),
the proceeds of which will be used for local capital requirements and to
reduce group indebted-ness.
The disposal is the Los Angeles based business of its US subsidiary, Joseph

incurred estimated pre-tax losses of Dollars 273,000 in 1991-92, including
losses of the Atlanta office which was closed in April.

FT  16 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Treatt shows 13% advance to Pounds 571,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits of Treatt, the USM-quoted supplier, blender and distiller of
essential oils and aromatic chemicals, advanced by 13 per cent, from Pounds
506,000 to Pounds 571,000, in the six months to March 31.
The result was struck on turnover up by Pounds 2.18m to Pounds 7.41m.
Earnings per share improved to 3.94p (3.49p) and the interim dividend is
again 1p.
Mr Norman Talbot, finance director, said RC Treatt, the principal operating
subsidiary, performed satisfactorily, with sales volumes up by 40 per cent
and net profits improving by 13 per cent.
However, about a third of the increase in turnover was of an exceptional
nature and unlikely to be repeated, he added, while the improvement in last
year's second half at the Florida Treatt operation had not been sustained in
the current year.

FT  16 JUN 92 / UK Company News: VTech held back by personal computers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
VTech Holdings, the Hong Kong-based electronics, computers and
telecommunications group which is listed in London, saw pre-tax profit drop
from Dollars 28.4m to Dollars 24.6m (Pounds 13.5m) in the year to March 31.
The outcome included Dollars 7.1m (Dollars 4.7m) exceptional credits
comprising Dollars 16.8m surplus on the sale of 35.5 per cent of its holding
in Central Point Software, less Dollars 9.7m costs involved in merging the
computer distribution operations in the US.
Mr Allan Wong, chairman, said the results were also affected by conditions
in the US personal computer market, but the diversified nature of the
group's products enabled it to weather the effects of that.
Although sales of personal computers increased, substantial losses were
incurred in the second half bringing that side of the business to break even
over the year.
Under the reorganisation it was decided to focus only on higher end personal
computer products on which improved margins could be obtained.
Turnover rose to Dollars 560.6m (Dollars 398.2m) with personal computers
accounting for 64.7 (62.1) per cent. Nearly 23 per cent came from electronic
toys and games, which had a successful year following the introduction of
new products.
Diluted earnings per share were 14.6p (14.3p). The final dividend is 4
cents, payable August 4, to make 7 cents for the year (7.2 cents included
special bonus).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Trebled first-half profits were achieved by Intercare Group, which operates
in the optical, dental and medical fields. Positive contributions came from
four acquisitions.
In the six months ended April 30 1992 turnover expanded from Pounds 5.8m to
Pounds 10.8m, and pre-tax profit surged from Pounds 452,000 to Pounds 1.4m.
Earnings per share were 4.2p (3p) and the interim dividend is stepped up to
0.6p (0.5p).
The results included SAFA for one month, Birmingham Optical for two weeks,
and Booster Electric Vehicles and Montis for the whole period. In addition,
the group achieved organic growth.
Mr Peter Cowan, chairman, said the optical side had an excellent six months,
highlighted by organic growth at Pennine and the two acquisitions.
Turnover at Pennine rose by more than 50 per cent. The acquisition of
Birmingham took the division into higher value products.
In difficult market condition A-Z Dental performed in line with expectations
and continued to trade profitably, while developing the increasing private
sector with new services and products.
Booster continued to meet expectations and had made considerable advances in
the current year, the chairman stated.

Mr David Dworkin, the chairman and chief executive of BhS who was recruited
in 1989 from Bonwit Teller, the US chain, received Pounds 240,140 in
relocation costs.
This was revealed in the annual report of Storehouse, the parent of BhS.
The exceptional compensation was in addition to his pay of Pounds 413,746,
which reflected a 12 per cent rise on the previous year.
Relocation expense related mainly to the repayment of an outstanding loan on
a house Mr Dworkin owned in the US, which was partly funded by his previous

The annual report also disclosed that Mr John Braddell, the former marketing
director, received Pounds 143,900 for loss of office.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WELPAC, the hardware and electrical goods wholesaler and distributor,
incurred a loss of Pounds 305,000 pre-tax for the year to January 31.
That compared with pre-tax profits of Pounds 13,000 for 1990-91.
However, the year under review was one of reorganisation and strategic
development and in the second six months Welpac returned profits of Pounds
53,000 before tax and exceptional items compared with losses of Pounds
248,000 in the first half.
The full year loss, struck on turnover of Pounds 9.72m (Pounds 11.42m), took
account of exceptional costs of Pounds 110,000 (nil) for redundancy and
other reorganisation.
Interest charges took Pounds 209,000 more at Pounds 541,000 but over the
second half the charge was cut from Pounds 361,000 to Pounds 180,000.
Losses per share emerged at 0.45p (earnings 0.42p). However, reflecting the
recovery shown in the second half and expectations of a 'reasonable
out-turn' for the current year the company is returning to the dividend list
via a 0.2p payment.
Year-end gearing was reduced from 126 per cent to 44.6 per cent.

FT  16 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Invesco MIM chairman denies obligation to
MGN pensioners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESCO MIM, the investment company which managed Pounds 50m of Mirror Group
Newspapers pension funds, has no moral obligation to help pensioners harmed
by the late Mr Robert Maxwell, who controlled MGN, and will not be
contributing to a government-sponsored trust intended to provide
compensation, chairman Lord Stevens of Ludgate said yesterday.
Answering questions after the company's annual general meeting, Lord Stevens
said 'My moral obligation is to shareholders.'
He said that while his company followed instructions from Bishopsgate
Investment Management, another Maxwell company, to loan pension fund
securities, all funds were returned to MIM. 'The moral obligations belong
elsewhere, not with us,' he said.
Mr Peter Lilley, Social Security Secretary, has said that companies which
had financial dealings with Mr Maxwell and had 'profited handsomely' might
feel a moral obligation to help pensioners.
A writ filed in early June by the present trustees of MGN's pension scheme
alleges that MIM and other fund managers should have been suspicious for
more than a year before Mr Maxwell's death about the stock lending they were
carrying out on BIM's behalf, and that MIM received indications that loaned
stocks were being used as loan collateral. The writ also alleges that in
order to return all loaned securities to MIM, BIM had to dip into other
pension funds.
Lord Stevens said that MIM intends to 'vigorously contest' the writ which
seeks Pounds 11.3m from his firm.
He said that MIM's suspicions about stock lending were not alerted by the
fact that loaned securities were returned in the names of others because the
Maxwell organisation was badly disorganised.
Meanwhile, the company's annual report, released yesterday, shows that Lord
Stevens' salary was cut by nearly 20 per cent in 1991, down to Pounds
354,000 from Pounds 441,000 in 1990.

FT  16 JUN 92 / UK Company News: AFGH pays out Pounds 20m in dividends
despite fall to Pounds 65m - Financial services operations help bolster
profits for Botnar-controlled motor retailing group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUTOMOTIVE Financial Group Holdings, the UK motor retailing group controlled
by Mr Octav Botnar which has lost its exclusive Nissan import and
distribution franchise, suffered a 13 per cent fall in pre-tax profits, from
Pounds 74.6m to Pounds 64.7m, in the year ended July 31 1991.
But the group remained probably the most profitable car retailer in the UK,
largely thanks to its financial services operations.
Turnover declined by 11.9 per cent from Pounds 947.5m to Pounds 835.2m. No
accounts have yet been filed for Nissan UK Holdings, the associate company.
Despite the decline in profit AFGH paid total dividends of Pounds 20m for
1990/91 after paying no dividend for the previous year.
Mr Michael Hunt, deputy chairman and assistant managing director who holds
10.63 per cent of the AFGH equity, received a dividend payment of Pounds
2.13m.
Mr Hunt was committed for trial last month to the Old Bailey on charges of
corporation tax fraud. The charges allege that the pre-tax profits of Nissan
UK had been understated by a total of Pounds 150m over a period of 17 years.
AFGH was formed in 1988 to comprise Nissan UK's car dealership and car
finance operations. Mr Botnar separated these from the Nissan vehicle import
and distribution businesses, which remained in Nissan UK Holdings.
According to the AFGH annual report the 'ultimate parent undertaking' of the
company is GF International Finance and Investments, incorporated in the
Bahamas. This entity holds 71.52 per cent of the AFGH equity.
The 'ultimate holding company' of Nissan UK Holdings is European Motor
Vehicles Corporation, incorporated in Panama, which holds a stake of 71.52
per cent. Both the Bahamas and Panama entities are controlled by the same
trustees of a settlement made by Mr Botnar in 1974.
Mr Hunt said earlier this week in the High Court, that Mr Botnar, chairman
and managing director of AFGH as well as of NUKH, retains 'the voting
control' of the trust holdings.
Mr Botnar is currently in Switzerland. He was abroad when a warrant was
issued for his arrest by the Inland Revenue at the end of January, and he
has not since returned to the UK.
The Botnar-controlled companies are being drastically restructured in the
wake of the dramatic move by Nissan Motor, the Japanese car maker, to
terminate NUK's exclusive importer/distributor franchise for Nissan vehicles
with effect from the end of 1991.
AFGH is replacing NUKH as the most important part of the Botnar-controlled
businesses in the UK, and is urgently seeking to find new franchises for its
shrinking wholly-owned AFG dealer network - which previously sold only
Nissan new vehicles - which it described 16 months ago as 'the largest
automotive retailer in Europe.'
In February 1991 AFG operated 160 new car dealerships. The AFG report says
that this was reduced to 147 at July 31 1991 and to 132 since that date.
AFG said recently that it was seeking to establish a refranchised network of
about 90 dealerships, which would still make it one of the UK's biggest
multi-franchise dealer groups.
It has already taken on franchises from Peugeot, Citroen, Renault and
Vauxhall, and Fiat Auto (UK) said last week that it expected to sign up a
number of AFG dealerships soon. It is understood that Fiat may franchise
some 18 AFG former Nissan sites.
The AFG dealership subsidiary suffered a 13.4 per cent fall in turnover to
Pounds 710m in 1990/91 from Pounds 820m a year earlier.
Pre-tax profit on ordinary activities fell by 23.8 per cent from Pounds
13.98m to Pounds 10.65m, although after-tax retained profit was boosted to
Pounds 20.2m by an extraordinary gain of Pounds 14.2m described as final
dividends received from the winding up of 'dormant subsidiary undertakings'.
According to AFGH's latest annual report the main contribution in the 12
months to July 31, 1991 came from its Automotive Financial Services
subsidiary, which achieved a pre-tax profit of Pounds 26.9m, a fall of 6.6
per cent, on a turnover down from Pounds 122m to Pounds 107m.
Mr Botnar has acted to reduce AFS's dependence on the banks through the
formation of Auto Funding, a wholly-owned subsidiary.
The AFGH report says that the financial services subsidiary had replaced 'a
significant part of its banking facilities' with medium-term funding by
securitising a large part of its hire-purchase receivables through a Pounds
220m issue of floating rate notes by Auto Funding.
The AFGH report reveals that the loss of the Nissan franchise has forced the
company largely to pull out of vehicle transporting.
It has sold the main part of the business and assets of its Car Removal
subsidiary, which had generated a pre-tax profit of Pounds 10.8m in 1990/91,
down from Pounds 13.8m a year earlier.
AFGH had an average workforce of 4,140 in 1990/91.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Surge in foreign bank loans in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN BANKS now control nearly half the commercial and industrial loan
market in the US, according to a study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York.
The study, in the New York Fed's Quarterly Review, says a recent surge in
the offshore booking of foreign bank loans to US companies gave non-US banks
45 per cent of the loan market at the end of 1991, compared with 18 per cent
in 1983.
The Fed study attributes the build-up in foreign bank corporate loans to two
main factors:
European and Japanese banks have enjoyed lower funding costs than their US
counterparts, allowing them to accept smaller spreads on loans;
Some non-US bank lenders, benefiting from their global presence at a time of
US retrenchment, have been more attractive to many US corporate treasurers
because they offer a wider range of services and knowledge of international
banking.
US banks had Dollars 428bn (Pounds 230.5bn) of total commercial and
industrial loans outstanding at the end of 1991, while foreign banks had
Dollars 348bn. Offshore-booked foreign bank loans to US companies jumped to
Dollars 152bn by the end of 1991, from Dollars 20bn in 1983, while US bank
lending booked offshore rose from Dollars 17bn to Dollars 22bn. Also between
1983 and 1991, the amount of loans by foreign banks booked in the US
increased from Dollars 66bn to Dollars 196bn. Loans by US banks booked in
the US rose from Dollars 364bn to Dollars 407bn.
The Fed points to three implications of the rapid rise in offshore credits
to US business:
The accumulation of debt by US companies was more rapid than previously
thought, and the recent drop in bank lending far less striking;
More of the corporate funding for US companies was supplied by banks, both
US and foreign, and less by the securities market than was thought;
Commercial bank lending has become a more foreign-dominated US business
sector than the US car or chemicals industries.
Mr Jim McDermott, president of New York bank analysts Keefe Bruyette, said:
'There has been a gun-shy attitude on the part of many US bankers because of
the three main loan debacles of recent years - the less developed country
problems, the energy loan portfolio losses and the commercial real estate
loan problem.'

FT  16 JUN 92 / BET profits fall sharply to Pounds 18.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BET, the business services company, yesterday reported a sharp fall in
pre-tax profits from Pounds 217m to Pounds 18.5m after writing down its
assets and substantial reorganisation provisions.
At an operating level, profits in the year to March almost halved to Pounds
146.1m as the recession continued to bite, particularly in the UK personnel,
joinery and plant hire services businesses.
The pre-tax profits fall, after a higher-than-expected exceptional charge of
Pounds 89.8m, led to a cut in the final dividend to 2.25p and to the total
payment being more than halved to 6.5p.
Earnings per share fell from 18.5p to a loss of 0.9p after payment of the
preference dividend.
Mr John Clark, chief executive, said he spent much of his first year trying
to refocus BET from a financial holding company to an operating company
after years in which acquisitions drained the company of cash.
BET also became one of the first FT-SE 100 companies to make extensive use
of new guidelines on goodwill suggested by the Accounting Standards Board.
Following the ASB's Urgent Issues Task Force guidelines, BET made a Pounds
477m extraordinary charge relating to goodwill on businesses which have been
sold or are to be sold.
Some Pounds 405.6m related to goodwill written off in respect of
under-performing businesses which are to be sold and which was written off
the balance sheet at the time of acquisition.
The charges nevertheless highlight the true scale of losses on some of the
170 businesses bought by the previous management and which the new BET team
considers do not fit in the group.
The Pounds 90m exceptional charge related to a net Pounds 21m of
reorganisation costs, following a fundamental rethink of BET's strategic
direction, and a Pounds 69m write-down of assets and deferred costs.
BET also proved strongly cash generative during the year, reducing debt from
Pounds 425m to Pounds 107m and gearing to 25 per cent excluding Dollars 500m
of auction-market preferred shares (AMPS).
This cash generation was flattered by the tight control taken on capital
expenditure which at Pounds 109m including the proceeds of disposals was
substantially less than depreciation of Pounds 179m.
BET shares fell 4p to 136p.

FT  16 JUN 92 / More regulation of world finance urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH

<DATELINE>
   BASLE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HIGH DEBTS and weak property prices in much of the developed world will
hamper a return to strong global growth, Mr Bengt Dennis, chairman of the
Bank for International Settlements, said yesterday.
Speaking at the annual meeting in Basle of the central bankers' bank, Mr
Dennis said governments had been too lax in easing credit restrictions in
the 1980s and would have to step up efforts to regulate the wave of new
financial activities triggered by liberalisation.
Much of the tone of Mr Dennis's comments was backed up in the annual report
of the BIS, also released yesterday, but it gave a somewhat brighter view of
economic prospects in the industrial nations.
'Grounds for optimism' existed partly because of signs of revival in the US
and strong growth in much of the developing world including Latin America
and east Asia.
The report voices doubts, however, about whether the economies of European
Community nations can move close enough to make economic and monetary union
feasible, without unacceptably large fiscal transfers or high unemployment.
Efforts to establish European economic and monetary union by the end of the
century may run into technical difficulties, it says.
Reflecting the views of BIS officials rather than those of the 32 central
banks which own the organisation, the report sparked friction with some bank
governors with a series of comments about prospects for Emu.
The report, written before the Danish referendum on the Maastricht treaty,
said many European governments 'were not unhappy about the lack of public
debate in their countries prior to the Maastricht summit and did little or
nothing to stimulate it'.
It added: 'Having managed to spring the programme on a largely unprepared
public they are now faced with debate and dissention very late in the day.'
The BIS report also spelt out some of the difficulties for the banking
sector due to bad debts and the weak economies in much of the developed
world.
It said international banking assets, as measured by cross-border and local
foreign currency claims, fell last year by Dollars 102bn (Pounds 56bn) which
is thought to be the first decline in this figure since the 1940s.

Yesterday's disposal of Mitel in Canada closes a painful episode for BT. The
51 per cent Mitel stake had long symbolised the misconceived strategy behind
BT's post-privatisation expansion into equipment manufacturing. As a
reminder of how much it paid, the sale will be marked by a Pounds 120m
exceptional goodwill write-off in BT's present quarter's figures, although
that will not reflect the investment's carrying cost since 1986, nor the
wasted management time. But investors in BT doubtless have more immediate
issues in mind, notably how the company will cope with the tightening grip
of its regulator.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Professor Littlechild, the electricity regulator, has always leaned towards
a long-term view of his function. So it may be that he felt pressured by his
peers into responding to the high profits of the distribution companies. No
sooner had East Midlands Electricity confirmed a 41 per cent profits
increase, than the regulator was indicating his concern for customers.
But Offer's annual report, published in March, discussed the drawbacks of
basing price controls on a forecast of inflation. Yesterday's renewed
questioning of such forecasts merely increased the likelihood that the RECs'
pricing regime will eventually be based on a lagging inflation indicator.
That seems sensible, not least because, if inflation begins rising again, it
will not be fuelled by pre-set increases in utility prices. In that
situation, the government too might see some political merit in a
retrospective approach. Customers would also have to accept the obverse;
that lower prices will lag any fall in inflation.

FT  16 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: London Stock Exchange
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A serious point of principle underlies the London Stock Exchange's
disagreement with the Inland Revenue over the treatment of expenditure on
the Taurus electronic trading system. Should such outlays, much of which
involve the salaries of people engaged in systems development, be treated as
capital spending and depreciated over time? Or should they be charged to
profit for tax purposes as they occur? The Stock Exchange favours the latter
but, in recognition of the possibility that the Revenue may determine
otherwise, it has sharply increased its tax provisions for the current year.
This raises the broad question of what actually constitutes capital spending
in an age where metal-bashing is giving way to high technology. Doubtless
the Stock Exchange, whose aim cannot be much more than break-even plus, has
an interest in charging whatever it can to profits. But Reuters says it also
follows a similar policy with this kind of expenditure. Perhaps it will need
a swift consultation with its tax advisers if the Revenue's view of Taurus
is upheld.
Nor is the approach of the Stock Exchange entirely consistent. While it
regards the Taurus spending as current for tax purposes, it shows some
sympathy with its members when they complain that they are having to pay now
to develop a service which will only bring benefits for future users. That
makes Taurus outlays sound like capital spending in spirit, if not in law.

FT  16 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: National Westminster
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
National Westminster is quick to point out that it has several reasons for
integrating the equity operations of County NatWest with its markets
division. Among them are better co-ordinated marketing and back office
efficiency gains. Additional business may be won as equity clients are
introduced to the division's foreign exchange service. The implication is
that the threat hanging over County NatWest has been lifted, even if its
name will be less prominent than before. The positive tone is confirmed by
the stress laid by the bank's top management on County's improving earnings
record and the undoubted value of its research capacity.
Nevertheless, yesterday's reorganisation still smacks more of fudge than
reprieve. County has been given a chance, but one wonders what would happen
if it continued to underperform. It will be harder for outsiders to tell
what is really going on. The promised cross-subsidisation benefits are
probably overstated. Now they are part of the strategy, it would be even
harder for management to wield the axe on County's activities. One
interpretation is thus that NatWest has not only backed away from really
tough action. It has become less likely that it will ever take it, however
inadequate the return.

FT  16 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: BET counts the cost
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's mere Pounds 18m of full year pre-tax profits from BET - down
from Pounds 322m just two years ago - is a fitting epitaph to the company's
buccaneering corporate style in the late 1980s. BET, to be sure, has been
feeling the full impact of recession. But a considerable chunk of last
year's damage - notably the Pounds 55m above-the-line hit for written-down
assets - is explained by the abandonment of accounting policies which in
sunnier times had kept earnings moving nicely ahead.
The problem, of course, was the way the balance sheet was sacrificed to the
profit and loss account. This manifested itself not just in the form of
acquisition provisions which masked outgoing expenses, but in lax cash
management which needlessly piled on the debt. BET's cash outflow from
operations between 1989 and March 1991 was almost Pounds 250m, a period in
which net debt jumped from Pounds 98m to Pounds 425m. Last year's dash for
cash was formidable by any standards, even discounting the disposals. The
case for the shares rests to some extent on the new management team being
able to keep this up. Assuming profits in the Pounds 125m-Pounds 150m range,
another low tax charge and low capital expenditure bill, this year's cash
inflow could leave the company broadly ungeared if the Auction Market
Preferred Stock is counted as equity.
With the finances under control - although spending on fixed assets cannot
be held down for ever, especially with a tougher depreciation policy - the
question is what sort of margins BET can ultimately achieve on its mix of
service businesses. If the answer is 10 per cent the shares at 133p are
certainly cheap. To get there, however, BET will have to rely mostly on cost
cutting and productivity rather than higher prices.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Letter: Yeltsin view on energy prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JEFFREY D SACHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was perplexed and disturbed by John Lloyd's article, 'Yeltsin signals
change in economic policy' (June 1). It states that Yeltsin has signalled a
'sharp change of course in Russian economic policy in the face of rising
public discontent'. The article is based largely on Yeltsin's comments to
Jacques Delors, European Commission president, about social discontent in
Russia, and on Yeltsin's objections to an immediate rise in energy prices to
world levels. John Lloyd seems to have greatly over-reacted on both points.
First, and most seriously, Delors' remarks seem to have been misconstrued.
The essence of Delors' remarks, according to the text of his news
conference, is quite different from your article's interpretation. In fact,
Delors stressed that Yeltsin remains committed to the reforms; committed to
higher energy prices; and, in fact, committed to an acceleration of the
reforms.
As for oil prices, John Lloyd should know that the International Monetary
Fund is not demanding an immediate introduction of world prices for energy,
but rather a phased increase over a period of years. Thus, Yeltsin's recent
statements about the need to raise oil prices gradually do not signal any
fundamental conflict with the IMF or a change of course of Russia's reforms.
Russia's situation is difficult enough without prominent news stories that
create an exaggerated sense of instability. I hope you accept these comments
as constructive. I regard the FT as the highest quality financial newspaper
in the world. I rely heavily upon it (and John Lloyd's reporting), and am
grateful for your consistently superb standards.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Letter: A single currency in fact if not in name
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, 'A Big Idea is still needed, in default of the Maastricht ambitions, to
hold European currencies together' (Samuel Brittan, Economic Viewpoint, June
11). The Big Idea is the single European currency. It is central to the
Maastricht Treaty. Mr Brittan is keener on the exchange rate mechanism (ERM)
than on economic and monetary union (EMU). Yet the ERM is, as Sir Alan
Walters pointed out, half-baked. Mr Brittan's ideas for developing the ERM
can be carried out only by moving through stages two and three of EMU as
agreed in the treaty by all 12 EC governments.
The convergence on price and exchange rate stability which Mr Brittan wants
can be achieved only by a mutual discipline of the kind laid down in the
treaty. As long as the ERM allows for realignments, national politicians, as
devaluers of last resort, will want to be free to use them, and fixed
exchange rates will lack credibility in the markets.
Mr Brittan's market-based approach to competing currencies will not work as
long as governments maintain laws which discriminate against foreign
currency in favour of domestic currency.
The importance of legal tender laws (in the wider sense of that term) has
not, as he claims, been exaggerated, but underestimated.
There will inevitably be a transition period in stage three of EMU when
national currencies are completely fixed, as Mr Brittan wants, and the ecu
is still a parallel currency.
We will have a single monetary policy, and thus a single currency in fact if
not in name. The Maastricht Treaty wisely does not go into detail on such
points, but it provides the framework within which they can be settled
later.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Letter: The case for proceeding with the Jubilee Line
extension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr P L RUBIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your correspondent Richard Tomkins failed to address the wider issues
in his analysis of the Jubilee Line extension ('No jubilation at the end of
the line', June 5):
The development of Docklands as a commercial centre to supplement the
existing City and West End will help to spread the load from those
established areas where the pressure on the existing services, particularly
transport, is too great.
The Jubilee Line will provide a much needed new link to the Underground
network from Waterloo and London Bridge mainline stations (north of the
river). This will improve mobility for commuters around the whole of central
London and again will spread the load and take some of the pressure off the
existing Underground interchanges north of the river.
The Jubilee Line extension will create greater accessibility to the
consistently deprived south-east and east London areas and this
accessibility will enhance the opportunity for increasing economic activity
in these areas.
A forward thinking London should wish to enhance accessibility over a much
wider area of the centre if it wants to maintain its status as one of the
premier world financial centres as well as enhancing its prospects for
increasing market share against world competition through to the next
millennium.
Far from shelving the project, the financial case for immediately proceeding
with the Jubilee Line extension is compelling.
If our forefathers had taken your correspondent's view, we would not have
today's underground network at all. Much of it was built into green fields.
Economic activity followed the newly created accessibility.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Letter: Slovak Republic needs foreign investment to halt
Czech split
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr CHRIS DOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader 'A state well worth saving' (June 9) highlighting the
present instability in the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic (CSFR)
presented the case for EC intervention. It is important to assess carefully
what form the assistance should take. Economic data reveal that encouraging
more foreign direct investment (FDI) to the Slovak Republic (SR) should
redress the imbalance in economic development since 1991 and arrest the
Slovaks' desire for separation.
The most striking difference in the economic data between the republics is
in unemployment. In May the rate was 11.3 per cent in the SR and only 2.8
per cent in the Czech Republic (CR). In 1991 investment in the CSFR fell by
33.8 per cent, and the output of the primary and secondary sectors declined.
The tertiary sector (banking, insurance, etc), however, grew significantly.
The CR has suffered far less unemployment owing to the expanding tertiary
sector, the reduction in transfers from the CR to the SR and to the bias in
FDI to the CR, which receives at least 80 per cent of the total.
A study on the relationship between the two republics by Ales Capek of the
Institute of Economics, Prague, shows that economic conditions for the two
republics in 1991 had no marked differences, except that the CR transferred
large sums to the SR. The closeness of the CR to west European markets gives
it an advantage in attracting FDI and cushioning transition costs.
If the EC wishes to encourage stability and preserve the CSFR, then it
should act very quickly to provide strong incentives for European companies
to invest in the SR.

economics, Cambridge, and the Centre for Applied Economic Research and

   From Mrs CHRISTINE CATON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I agree with Michael Proudlock's observations regarding the banks'
recent doctrinaire policy of calling in investigatory accountants to examine
customers' affairs.
A City firm was invited to investigate the accounts of one of our firm's
client companies. The report was favourable in terms of the business and
future prospects. It was recommended that the bank continued to support the
business.
However, the bank has not eased its position for running the account. It has
only agreed to finance the cost of the investigatory accountants' fee by
adding it to the overdraft. The attitude is still in my opinion one of
intransigence, doubt, continual harrassment and interference.
Venture capital and working capital finance should be provided from sources
away from the major clearing banks so that small businesses may have access
to them. A new market would develop whereby new relationships could be built
up, and reasonable profits made by providing a real service to small
businesses. When will such entrants be forthcoming?

FT  16 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Packaging mess
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community produces an annual 50m tonnes of waste from the
packaging of consumer and industrial goods. It is an environmental mess in
voters' own backyards. Unfortunately, individual governments around Europe
are tackling the problem in counter-productive ways.
The EC's attempts to decide harmonised rules and targets for disposal of
packing refuse have become badly bogged down. A planned directive on
packaging waste has gone through four preliminary drafts in the past 18
months. But the Commission will now probably wait until after the summer
break before formalising a final proposal. The measure will not pass into
national law before 1995 at the earliest.
A viable packaging directive is badly needed to accompany next year's single
market. Proliferating national regulations and systems, unless checked,
could become not only a symbol of lack of common policies on the
environment, but also a serious impediment to trade.
The packaging impasse underscores the difficulties of bridging gaps among
richer and poorer states. Common rules must be acceptable both to the
'green' north and to less environmentally-conscious Mediterranean states.
The Commission aims to reduce sharply volumes for final disposal by
increasing the proportion of packaging re-used in industrial processes,
either by recycling, or through material or energy recovery (for instance,
incineration).
The Commission wants countries to recover or recycle 90 per cent of all
packing waste output over 10 years, compared with the present average of 18
per cent. Ambitious objectives like this are needed if industry is to
provide the necessary technological solutions, but the EC must take care
lest it sets across-the-board targets which, for difficult products like
plastics, cannot be met.
Germany has led the way in the greening of packaging laws by tightening
industry's obligations to take back and re-use packing material. Other
countries have also introduced tough national schemes.
A packaging free-for-all causes three sets of problems. First, if countries
introduce rules banning or restricting, say, beer in non-returnable bottles,
this amounts to a restriction on trade - discriminating against both
importers and companies from different regions of the same country. Second,
targets and collection systems may be uneconomic. Surplus waste collected in
one country can spill into other countries, depressing material prices and
hampering recycling schemes. Third, poorly-thought out recycling networks
can produce an overall negative environmental impact when all the energy and
pollution costs are taken into account.
The EC must seek to marry principles of environmental soundness with
measures which do not fragment and distort markets. Its packaging strategy
must rely on economic incentives as far as possible. Above all, governments
must show the political will to knit together the present regulatory
patchwork into a cohesive whole.
Speedy action to break the packaging logjam would be a welcome sign that -
whatever the clouds over the Maastrict process - the Community can maintain
momentum in a vital area of its business.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Hard questions from the BIS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AS BEFITS an organisation controlled by central bankers, the Bank for
International Settlements is normally not an aggressive international
watchdog. But this year's annual report barks loudly. Doubts about the
European Community's plans for economic and monetary union have, for
example, dismayed a few of the central bankers present at the BIS annual
meeting. But Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, the BIS general manager, and the staff
are to be congratulated on their honesty. Otherwise, what is the point of
such reports?
Emu is not the only topic on which the report has controversial things to
say. In a subtle discussion of financial problems, it insists that 'the
benefits of deregulation and financial innovation are worth striving for.
They are not, however, a free good and the costs of attaining them were
underestimated.'
The BIS report points to a long string of financial disasters: the
developing country debt crisis; the collapse of the US savings and loans
institutions; the global stock market crash of 1987; and the excessive
lending both for highly leveraged transactions and for real estate. 'The
changes in the financial environment helped to make such collective errors
of judgment more likely,' it concludes, 'and their implications more serious
and widespread internationally.'
This dismal performance poses at least four challenges to the authorities:
to improve prudential regulation; to create system-wide checks and balances;
to improve crisis management; and to reconsider the boundary between market
discipline, on the one hand, and government involvement, on the other.
Greater market discipline is needed to deal with the vagaries of a financial
system unduly underpinned by the state. But shifting the balance is, notes
the report, 'no easy task'.
The BIS is still more outspoken on trade policies. 'Most industrial
countries have in recent years strayed further from the free trade ideals
they profess to uphold while many developing countries have taken decisive
measures to open their economies.' This has, indeed, been one of the most
deeply depressing features of the world economy. The BIS is entirely right,
even if repetition of this truth can be boring.
Where the BIS cannot be boring is on Emu, the topic of the moment. The BIS
evidently feels that EC governments deserve the egg on their faces. 'Having
managed to spring the programme on a largely unprepared public', it remarks,
governments 'are now faced with debate and dissension very late in the day'.
The BIS staff evidently believes that such debate and dissension are
deserved. The report notes that members of the ERM have already given
priority to their exchange rate objectives 'even though this meant accepting
tighter policies than were considered desirable on domestic grounds'. Would
Emu solve the problems? Not necessarily.
The report casts doubt on the assumption that a currency union would achieve
price stability, noting, instead, that the objective 'is inherently
vulnerable to any faltering of the political consensus in support of it'. It
points to exchange rate policy as Emu's Achilles' heel. It warns that the
agreement to link convergence criteria with a rigid timetable suggests 'some
risk that political considerations could play a role in the application of
standards'. The report also fears that efforts to meet those standards
'could render exchange rate and, perhaps, budgetary policy in some countries
too rigid in the next few years'.
Moreover, 'the possibility that large shocks with asymmetric effects will
occur in future cannot be ruled out. Conceivably, financial pressures on
exchange rates could increase as the effect of recent liberalisation of
exchange rates is felt more fully.' The BIS points to the regional problems
of existing currency unions and to the case for larger fiscal transfers than
seem likely. As if all this were not enough, it also worries about premature
pressures for real wage equalisation.
This watchdog is barking loudly. Government may be inclined to shrug its
shoulders. Given the source of the warning, it should think carefully before
doing so.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT should think again about its declared intention to allow a
Japanese developer to purchase London's County Hall, and instead support the
bid by the London School of Economics to inherit the building.
The nationality of the developer is irrelevant. It is a straightforward
matter of public interest. County Hall is London's foremost vacant public
building; the LSE is the country's foremost social science university and
among London's most prestigious public institutions, in urgent need of
improved accommodation - and with a very strong claim to a commanding
location in the capital. Its plans for County Hall have other features which
justify a prime-site venue, notably a national 'social science park' and a
relocated civil service college. County Hall might also make an appropriate
base for ministers and others too grand to move to Canary Wharf, but soon to
be homeless with the demolition of the Marsham Street complex.
There is, of course, a price to be paid - about Pounds 120m in income
foregone and conversion costs. That is a modest sum. It may be no sum at all
taking into account the LSE's future needs and the yields to be gained from
giving it greater national prominence.

Four new series start tonight. Borderlands (8.00 C4) is about six regions of
Europe affected by economic and political changes, starting with Catalonia
in north eastern Spain. As in so many regions on the periphery of larger,
more powerful states, the language, culture and history of Catalonia were
long suppressed.
Firm Friends (9.00 ITV) is a four-part drama in which Billie Whitelaw plays
a suburban housewife who sets up in the catering business with her Asian
cleaning lady. Madhur Jaffrey who plays this part is, of course, known at
least as well for her cookery books as for her acting.
Town Hall (9.50 BBC2) is an eight-part documentary series about the ins and
outs of local government, made by Malcolm Hirst and producer/cameraman
Charles Stewart who specialise in fly-on-the-wall work. The series was made
in the Labour controlled London borough of Lewisham.
Seven Up - Japan (10.40 ITV) extends the idea used so successfully by
Granada in Britain of filming a group of children at seven year intervals to
see how their lives progress. Similar long terms sequences made in Germany
and South Africa follow.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Arts: Old and new at Aldeburgh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The opening weekend of the 45th Aldeburgh Festival showed that the artistic
uncertainties of the post-Britten and post-Pears years are now safely in the
past. Old and new themes are being examined, old and new heroes celebrated,
side by side, freshly, interestingly, boldly: place, performance, style and
content combine to make each event, and each juxtaposition, a properly and
unrepeatably festive one.
Inevitably, Aldeburgh audiences have still to be persuaded that the new is
as much worth the ticket price as the old. Friday's London Sinfonietta
concert of new or new-ish music conducted by Oliver Knussen (one of the
festival's two current artistic directors) was sparsely attended, whereas
Saturday's concert performance of The Beggar's Opera in Britten's 1948
re-working was a sell-out.
The festive excitement of the two seemed to me in inverse proportion to
their popular success. Britten's Beggar's Opera is no mere orchestral
enlargement of Gay but a thoroughgoing re-invention. The scoring for small
ensemble, full of echt-Britten sound-devices such as trickling harp, keening
oboe and ironically portentous timpani, is only the start. Though almost all
of the original numbers are included, their settings are refracted through
Britten's strongly personal compositional glass.
The artful complexities of added counterpoint ('I must stop myself
'canonising' too much', Britten is quoted in the programme as advising
himself - an instruction he then proceeded to ignore) and the enrichments
for chorus take the version far from its ballad-opera origins. Separated by
time from the performing exigencies that gave Britten's labours their
special slant and purpose, the revival served most usefully as a reminder of
Britten the immensely practical theatre-musician, whose knack of pace and
timing, of getting the most out of a particular group of singers and players
was unrivalled in the 20th century.
As in the parallel cases of Wagner's re-working of Gluck's Iphigenie en
Aulide and Strauss's of Idomeneo, the end-product tells us, finally, more
about Britten than Gay. As a Beggar's Opera in its own right I found this
sadly lacking in earthy simplicity and scabrous slanginess. The salt and
sweat of the play, the uproarious mixture of vulgarity and social criticism,
are smoothed away in the very abundance of Britten's compositional
felicities; the result, though by no means as touristy a Beggar's Opera as
Frederick Austin's edition, or Guy Woolfenden's for Scottish Opera a decade
ago, is worryingly coy.
Or so it seemed in a jolly but unfocused (insufficiently rehearsed?) concert
performance conducted by Steuart Bedford, and given by a glamorous cast -
Philip Langridge as Macheath, Ann Murray, Yvonne Kenny, Robert Lloyd, John
Rawnsley, Nuala Willis - who sang with glamorous tone but who tended to put
across the words with far too little punch and point. The use of the actor
Declan Mulholland as Beggar-Narrator was undermined by memory-lapses; in
character and delivery, though, he alone appeared to stray in from the 'real
world' of the piece.
The Knussen-Sinfonietta concert - it was the conductor's 40th birthday, and
began with a hilarious unannounced re-scoring of Stravinsky's Happy Birthday
 -was a dazzling affair. Knussen's own Songs without Words for eight
instruments were receiving their first European hearing: four small,
magically lyrical ruminations in each of which a single instrumental voice
(most notably the english horn of the fourth) sings out above its
economically picturesque accompaniment. The influence of Ravel's Mallarme
settings is clear, and fertile. Colin Matthews's bracing, boundingly
inventive Suns Dance and Poul Ruders's over-ambitious but wildly
exhilarating Four Compositions (1980) were the other highlights.
Sviatoslav Richter, an Aldeburgh hero, returned to the Maltings after a long
absence to give the opening piano recital. His introspective Haydn in the
first half showed faint signs of un-Richter-like physical caution;
thereafter, Chopin, Skryabin and an incomparably luxuriant, spacious, deeply
resonant Debussy Ile joyeuse banished them with magnificent ease. The choice
of Sunday-afternoon pianist proved the adventurousness of Aldeburgh's
programme-planning. Pedja Muzijevic, a young Yugoslavian resident in
America, is a virtuoso with formidable fingers and a musician with fiercely
original ideas about the music he plays.
At present he cannot resist underlining his insights - Haydn G major sonata
(H XVI: 6) in the first part and Schubert's A major Sonata (D959) in the
second were particularly subjected to affectionate pushes and pulls of
phrasing. But a pianist with too many ideas is always infinitely preferable
to one with too few.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Arts: Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau/Kathleen Battle - Song
recitals in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN and DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While Julia Varady is winning superlatives at Covent Garden, there is a
bonus to be had from the soprano's presence here in London. Where the wife
goes, there is always a chance that the husband will follow and Dietrich
Fischer-Dieskau duly appeared for a single recital at the Barbican Hall on
Sunday afternoon.
If memory serves right, this was the first time that the baritone has sung
in recital at the hall. It is not an ideal venue and singers who tried
recitals in its early years invariably found their voices drained of colour,
or even lost altogether. However, Fischer-Dieskau is a law unto himself and
his voice sounded as full of nuance as ever it was. Sometimes he sang so
softly that the sound should never have carried in this hall, but every time
it did.
The programme was devoted solely to Schubert's Die schone Mullerin. This is
commonly regarded as the young man's Schubert cycle and that may explain why
we seldom hear it sung with half the meaning with which it was invested
here. Through a life of singing Lieder, Fischer-Dieskau has discovered an
immense amount to say about this music and some of the simpler songs almost
burst out of their seams with the intensity, the range of emphasis and
dynamics, that he packs into their slight frames.
One would be happily admiring the quiet and intimate atmosphere that he had
built up in a song like 'Morgengruss' only to have it suddenly snatched away
in the last stanza. The listener looks anxiously down at the text. Yes, the
words do support the interpretation ('Now shake off the veil of dreams') and
yet it is somehow a feature of the singing these days that it should lurch
so often from one extreme to the other.
Nevertheless, even if a song does not always work as a whole, there is line
after line that comes across with more meaning than it ever had before: the
devotion of the simple words 'if she sent you', the chill as clouds come
over the last lines of 'Tranenregen'. Nor is the pure singing of a section
like the Miller's words in the penultimate song really that simple at all. A
lifetime's knowledge of how to colour the voice was there artlessly on show.
Together with his accompanist, Christoph Eschenbach, Fischer-Dieskau paced
the cycle flawlessly, moving on rapidly from song to song just after the
mid-point, when jealously and resentment start to fire the music. Otherwise
Eschenbach was the respectful partner, underplaying much of the time, rarely
taking the lead. But then to have a pianist as well who was equally as
intense would probably have been too much to bear.
*****
In its specialised way, Miss Battle's light coloratura soprano is
practically a perfect instrument. Not only is it true, flexible and pretty -
ineffably pretty - but it embodies just the sort of character that
opera-composers write for that voice: charming, often little-girlish, bright
with carefully cultivated innocence. In such roles Miss Battle is regularly
enchanting. In recital, as at the Royal Opera on Sunday, there is a risk of
surfeit, of too much of a winsome muchness.
She drew an impressively large house on a very warm night. Her programme
proved to be brief (just seven songs in the second half), but she
compensated for that by starting a quarter-hour late. She chose to sing just
what one might have expected: a little Handel to warm up, the usual light
Mozart, some pretty Liszt and Rakhmaninov, and four high-flying songs from
Richard Strauss's opus. 68. Song by song, they were mostly delicious - but
in the end, it was extraordinary how similar all those composers sounded.
Not only did the vocal personality dominate everything, but the
accompaniments were firmly reduced to discreet background support. American
divas still command the services of an accompanying breed which is almost
extinct on this side of the Atlantic: abjectly self-effacing employees, from
whom any bid for musical attention may amount to a breach of contract. In
Handel and Mozart Margo Garrett was routinely grey, but with the three later
composers - who wrote piano-parts of salient independence - it was deeply
moving to hear a competent musician striving to suppress any expressive
force in her music.
It is a considerable technical feat to keep the note-filled climaxes in
Rakhmaninov and Strauss down to a bloodless pianissimo, but Miss Garrett
managed it, without (as far as I could tell) scamping the literal notes.
That left the Battle voice to float free, to do its own appealing thing; it
also left the song-shapes and the harmonic sense obscure, again and again,
and dramatically null - or anyhow, much of a winsome muchness.
It was disheartening to learn from the programme-book that in America Miss
Garrett is a 'leading teacher' of 'collaborative pianists' (the politically
correct new label for accompanists). Throttled submission is not
collaboration. Must America have another generation of keyboard-doormats?
Whether or not Miss Battle knows or cares, the lines of her Strauss Lieder -
'Ich wollt' ein Strausslein binden' and 'Sausle, liebe Myrte' ravishingly
turned, an ethereally brilliant 'Amor' - could have been enhanced beyond
measure by an unfettered partner at the piano.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Arts: The Merry Wives of Windsor - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It would doubtless have brought a smile to Shakespeare's face if he knew
that two comic operas based on The Merry Wives of Windsor would be playing
in London at the same time. While English National Opera is performing
Verdi's Falstaff, the students at the Guildhall School of Music have turned
to another, less well-known adaptation, Otto Nicolai's Die lustigen Weiber
von Windsor.
Whether this production would have made him smile is less certain. Where
Verdi's Falstaff takes the stage with a scintillating lightness of touch,
Nicolai keeps him the rumbustious figure of fun, a ludicrous philanderer in
whom nobody could see much dignity or nobility of heart. The romantic warmth
of the music is reserved for the other characters - a contrast nicely caught
when the Guildhall last put on the opera in 1983.
For this new production Tim Coleman and his designer Isabella Bywater have
tried something different. One might even have said 'original' if it did not
so neatly combine the main features of both ENO's Falstaff and the Royal
Shakespeare Company's Merry Wives, set in 1950s suburbia. For this show
opens in a launderette of that period and slowly progresses backwards in
time to the formal ruffs and tightly-pinched waists of the Elizabethan era.
Unfortunately the idea is not taken far beyond the obvious jokes. Edward
Hands's spiv of a Fenton sports a garish floral tie and purple socks to woo
his Anne Page, a tart-in-the-making with a beehive hair-do, played by Liza
Pulman. Her lower-middle class mannerisms come from Mrs Page, the incisive
young mezzo Joanna Vincent-Campion, while Elvia Sanchez's light lyric Alice
Ford was left to sing her aria while painting her toenails.
I caught the second cast on Friday, which had fewer obviously bright vocal
talents than are remembered from 1983. Nevertheless, Rene Linnenbank managed
to turn his lanky figure into a Falstaff of convincing girth and there was a
pair of strong voices in Laurent Naouri's Mr Ford and Nathan Berg's Mr Page,
the former forcefully extrovert, the latter relaxed and firm. None made the
impression that he might. There was too much crude knockabout humour for
that.
Some untidy playing from the orchestra under Clive Timms was not enough to
disturb the stage action, but this in any case did not rank among the
Guildhall's finer efforts.
Nicolai's Shakespearian comic opera has not previously seemed so inferior to
that of his Italian counterpart.

FT  16 JUN 92 / People: Banker takes the road to St Ives
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bob Gavron, the 61-year-old founder of St Ives, has anointed his successor.
Miles Emley, a 43-year-old merchant banker, has been appointed deputy
chairman of Britain's leading independent printer.
'After what seems like a lifetime advising people, I am looking forward to
acting as a principal,' says Emley, currently head of UK corporate finance
at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. However, he stresses that his appointment should not
be read as a signal that one of the printing industry's more conservative
companies is about to embark on an acquisition binge.
Emley, who spent the first 17 years in the City with N M Rothschild, first
came to Gavron's attention when Rothschild handled St Ives' stock market
flotation in 1985. Gavron says that Emley 'knows St Ives well and will add
considerable strength to the development of the group'.
'I don't know if I will want to retire in four years' time,' says Gavron,
but adds that it is important to have the next generation of management in
place just in case. Noting that Britain's fragmented printing industry tends
to be rather short of top management, Gavron says that the company has often
tended to recruit outsiders. Gavron, one of Britain's more modestly paid
chairmen, was not born into the industry, and Brian Edwards, 42, the
managing director, came from Touche Ross in 1978.

FT  16 JUN 92 / The Week in Luxembourg: Investigations of dumping must not
ignore issues of competition - European Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Community institutions must take into account EEC competition
rules when determining issues relating to the damage caused to EC industry
by dumped imports, the ECJ ruled last week.
The Court said failure to take competition rules into account would lead to
the annulment of EC regulations imposing anti-dumping duties.
The case involved the validity of the EC Council regulation imposing
definitive anti-dumping duties on imports of calcium metal from China and
the former Soviet Union.
Extramet, a French company and the EC's largest importer of calcium metal,
claimed that the Community institutions had failed to determine correctly
the cause of any injury which may have been suffered by the Community
industry.
Extramet alleged in proceedings before the European Commission and the EC
Council that the Community industry had refused to supply calcium metal and
that this was the true cause of any injury, not imports from China and the
Soviet Union. The French company, Pechiney, is the sole producer of calcium
metal in the EC.
Extrament had also made a complaint to the French competition authorities
alleging an abuse of a dominant position by Pechiney.
The ECJ ruled that in assessing the damage suffered, the Council and the
Commission must take into account only the injury caused by the relevant
dumped imports.
Other factors, including injury caused by the Community industry itself,
must not be attributed to the dumped imports.
As the Council and Commission had not shown that they had taken the alleged
anti-competitive behaviour of the Community industry into account when
determining damage the regulation was annulled.
This is the first time that the ECJ has expressly ruled that the outcome of
anti-dumping proceedings may be affected by the anti-competitive conduct of
the industry which the EC seeks to protect.
Although the decision is limited in scope, it will be welcomed by
international business which is subject to different policy considerations
under the EC competition and anti-dumping rules.
Extrament also challenged the anti-dumping duties on other grounds which the
Court did not consider in the interests of judicial economy.
In particular, the court did not discuss Extramet's argument in the context
of the Community interest that anti-dumping duties should not be imposed if
their effect was to help maintain an unfair advantage in the market
resulting from anti-competitive behaviour.
However, when Advocate General Jacobs delivered his opinion in the case back
in April he stated that competition law issues should be considered by the
Community institutions before deciding that the imposition of duties would
be in the public interest of the Community.
Case C-358/89, Extramet Industrie SA v Council, 6CH 11 June 1992.
Spanish restrictions on bulk Rioja exports overruled
In a rare ruling on internal market export restrictions the European Court
of Justice last week condemned Spanish rules limiting bulk Rioja exports to
other EC countries.
The case involved bulk exports of Rioja from Spain to Belgium. A Belgian
supermarket ordered 3,000 hectolitres of Rioja from a Spanish company. When
told it could only have 600 hectolitres because of Spanish export controls
it brought proceedings in a Brussels court to enforce the contract.
A 1988 Spanish law regulating the registered designation of origin of wine
requires wine producers to bottle all wines where they are produced, except
for exports, until 1993. In 1988, however, Spanish authorities imposed
quotas on bulk Rioja exports.
The ECJ said the export rules contravened EEC rules on free movement of
goods. They discriminated against exports because the bulk quotas only
applied to export sales and not domestic sales. The Spanish government
failed to convince the Court that the quotas were necessary for the
protection of intellectual and commercial property.
The Court ruled that export restrictions could only be justified where they
were necessary to ensure that the origin marking fulfilled its specific
function - to guarantee the wine's provenance and characteristics.
Case C-47/90: Etablissements Delhaize Freres and Compagnie Le Lion SA v
Promalvin SA and AGE Bodegas Unidas SA, FC 9 June 1992.
Taxes on non-Community banana imports lawful
The ECJ also upheld last week an Italian consumption tax on bananas imported
from outside the EC. The law imposing the tax was however repealed shortly
after the case began.
The Italian law imposed a consumption tax on all bananas irrespective of
their origin. In 1987, the ECJ condemned the tax in respect of bananas in
free circulation within the EC under internal market tax rules.
On this occasion the court held that the tax was lawful provided it did not
apply to bananas in free circulation. However, the court made it clear that
certain provisions of international treaties between the EC and developing
countries, such the ACP Convention, should be examined by the national
courts to determine the legality of such a tax.
Joined cases C-228/90 to 234/90, C-339/90 and C-353/90: Simba SpA, Comafrica
SpA, Camar Srl, Co-Frutta SpA and Chiquita Italia v Italian Ministry of
Finance, FC 9 June 1992.
Other cases
The ECJ held that French storage charges on cereals were in breach of the EC
cereals market organisation and the Rome Treaty provisions on customs duties
and state aids. The French storage charges discriminated in favour of
domestic production.
Joined cases C-149/91 and 150/91: Sanders Adour SNC et Guyomarc'h Orthez
Nutrition Animale SA v Director of Tax Services for Pyrenees-Atlantique, 6CH
11 June 1992.
The Court also held that Spanish rules limiting VAT refunds to claims based
on a special form of invoice breached the Sixth VAT Directive provisions
because no refund was available to claims based on an ordinary invoice.
Case C-96/91: Commission v Spain, FC 9 June 1992
The Court of First Instance has rejected an application to declare invalid a
Commission decision fining Finsider, the Italian steel producer, for
exceeding its quotas of steel production.

FT  16 JUN 92 / People: Sears goes shopping from Hanson's office
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Liam Strong, the ambitious new chief executive of Sears who arrived in
February, has headhunted Lord Hanson's assistant Stephen Park on to his
board as finance director.
Park says that 'while this may not be the perfect environment in which to go
into retailing . . . I think I will be missing some opportunities if I have
not improved Sears' performance within three years'.
While Park insists that his decision to accept the Sears offer predated the
arrival of Derek Bonham in the new position of Hanson chief executive, the
group said yesterday that there will be no new assistant to the chairman as
such. Park's duties are being reallocated - most being picked up by Bonham's
team.
Park, meanwhile, says that 'having been finance director of the Allders
division of Hanson for a while I at least know what to expect (of the
retailing industry).'
A chartered accountant with previous experience at Arthur Andersen and Data
General, 39-year-old Park has been at the conglomerate since 1981 - most
recently responsible for strategic planning, acquisitions and divestments.
The styles of the two operations could hardly be more different - but the
gung-ho acquisitive Hanson may be losing some of its lustre, while investors
have great hopes that Strong will shake the slumbering retail giant alive.
The position of finance director is opened up by John Lovering's move into a
newly created position - managing director of corporate development and
international operations. Lovering, 42, has been in the finance seat since
1988, but wanted to move into a more 'operational' job.
Sears currently has only a tiny presence in continental Europe, and while
Strong has been keen to stress that he does not regard European expansion as
a panacea for domestic UK problems, he also appears to believe there is a
degree of urgency if he is not to miss the boat.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Technology: One step forward and two back - Technically
Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPUTERS, through their ability to store and process large quantities of
data quickly and quietly, have greatly complicated the copyright business.
The European Commission is doing its best to deal with the new electronic
threats to intellectual property, but some of the solutions it is
considering seem at best poorly thought through, at worst a potential block
on progress.
A case in point is the measures it is prescribing - in the form of a draft
directive - to protect the intellectual property contained in online
commercial databases. The measures seek to outlaw what Brussels describes as
'unfair extraction': in other words, database piracy.
Online databases are collections of information about specific subjects  -
foreign exchange rates, chemical formulae or medical statistics, for
example, collated, organised and held on computers. The information is
available to customers typically through a computer terminal or personal
computer on a fee basis.
Examples include Priceline, owned by Reuters, and the World Patents Index
from Derwent Publications. The on-line database business in Europe is
flourishing after a slow start and is now probably worth some Pounds 1.75bn
a year.
The EC is intent on building a comprehensive body of legislation to cover
information processing and intellectual property rights. Last year, for
example, it sponsored a directive, which continues to work its way through
the system, designed to protect software producers against piracy. It is
also working on measures to protect personal data.
Earlier this year, however, Brussels approved draft legislation aimed at
would-be database pirates. It would, in essence, protect producers of
databases from 'unfair' copying of the contents of their product for 10
years.
The underlying rationale is that without such protection producers would
hold back from investment in these databases. Sensible enough on the
surface, but some would say the Commission had fired a broadside before
pirate galleons were on the horizon.
Although some database producers have welcomed the legislation, there is
little evidence to date that investment has been prejudiced because of its
absence.
Critics argue, moreover, that the directive contains provisions which are
not only unnecessary, but could stifle the competition necessary to drive
innovation in the business.
The directive, for example, aims to protect not only the originality of the
selection and arrangement of the facts in a database but the raw facts
themselves. This threatens not only to hinder the free flow of information
but also damage competition between providers of data.
Furthermore, the level of originality in the database need not be very high.
So almost any collection of material might qualify for copyright after which
it could neither be reproduced, translated, adapted, arranged or altered
without the express consent of the copyright holder. It raises the bizarre
possibility of database producers scrabbling for information of all sorts to
stuff haphazardly into databases to qualify for copyright protection.
There are other anomalies - protection is awarded to the mechanism which
makes the database work but not to computer programs used in its making or
operation. Many would argue the two are indivisible.
And a reciprocity clause in the proposal is clearly designed to enable
Europe to put pressure on the US, where unfair extraction legislation has
already been rejected by the Supreme Court, to follow the European example.
The point is that databases are already adequately protected - by
conventional copyright laws, by contract and by the EC member state's unfair
competition laws.
Any further layers of protection seem likely to smother the very originality
the EC is trying to protect. This is one directive which should be abandoned
before its clauses catch inextricably in the Brussels machinery.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Technology: Price is the name of the game - How PC makers
are striking back as cheap clones invade their market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What's in a name? Not much, it seems, when it comes to personal computers.
Over the past year an overwhelming number of personal computer buyers have
decided that cheap 'clones' from little-known manufacturers will do the job
just as well as the more expensive brand-name PCs from companies such as
International Business Machines and Compaq Computer.
The trend is forcing startling changes in the personal computer industry.
Compaq yesterday launched a range of 'affordable' desktop and notebook
computers, abandoning its decade-old 'premium pricing' strategy.
IBM is taking a different tack. By establishing its own clone-sales
subsidiaries in Europe and Canada, the market leader aims to preserve the
quality-brand image of its own PS/2 and PS/1 product lines, while
participating in the fast-growing, 'price-sensitive' segment of the market.
For both companies, these are painful adjustments. In the 1980s they
dominated personal computer market trends, vied for technology leadership
and looked down their corporate noses at the lesser 'second- and third-tier'
clone makers.
But by last year 'premium branded' personal computers, including those from
other large computer companies such as NCR, Hewlett-Packard and Toshiba,
accounted for less than one third of personal computer unit sales in the US,
according to market researchers International Data Corporation.
'We lost some of our customers' business,' acknowledges Eckart Pfeiffer,
Compaq president and chief executive. Corporate buyers, among them some of
Compaq's best customers, switched to lower-priced vendors when Compaq's
price premium became too high to justify, the company now recognises.
Yet as IBM and Compaq struggle to stem their market share losses, they face
a tumult of competition from hundreds of clone makers vying for a piece of a
shrinking market.
US unit sales of PCs declined by 12 per cent for the three months ending in
April, according to David Korus, a Kidder Peabody analyst, and revenues were
down 26 per cent. The average selling price of personal computers is
plummeting.
Mounting competition in the market for microprocessors, the 'brain' chips
inside personal computers, has fuelled the fire. Intel, for several years
the sole supplier of microprocessor chips to PC manufacturers, is now
engaged in a market battle with Advanced Micro Devices and a growing cadre
of microprocessor companies with their own versions of Intel's chips.
More important, however, is the shifting attitude of personal computer
buyers. 'Customers have matured from an intimidated, non-technical, obedient
audience to a savvy, price-sensitive, well-educated, hard-to-please market,'
observes Lucianne Painter, Salomon Brothers' PC industry analyst.
One explanation for the ferment in the personal computer market is that a
bulge of second-time buyers; those who first purchased a PC when the
industry was in its heyday, has coincided with economic recessions in the US
and Europe, creating a high degree of price sensitivity.
Corporate PC buyers are now also tuned to the rapid advancement of personal
computer technology. Two years ago, PCs based on Intel's 286 microprocessor
were top sellers. Today, these machines are almost obsolete, unable to take
full advantage of the latest PC software such as Microsoft's Windows.
The PC is fast becoming a disposable product. Like yesterday's newspaper, a
three-year-old PC is hardly worth saving, even though it may still be in
working order. Thus the longevity of higher priced, more rugged brand-name
PCs becomes of questionable value.
Yet reliability and quality remain a serious concern among PC buyers,
especially where PC networks have become the backbone of a company's
information systems.
The dilemma for brand-name suppliers is how to compete in the lower margin
segment of the market without losing the 'quality' image that has set them
apart in the past.
For Compaq, the answer has been to reduce drastically its costs through a
big restructuring of operations, and now to offer what the company calls
'affordable quality' products.
Compaq's new ProLinea desktop PCs and its Contura notebook computers are
designed to compete with the clones. US prices start at Dollars 899 for a
desktop 386SX model with a 40Mbyte hard drive, and Dollars 1,700 for a
notebook computer based on a 386SL microprocessor.
Compaq's new products will not be the cheapest, but the differential between
its prices and those of lesser-known manufacturers will be substantially
reduced and the company aims to lure buyers with a Dollars 100m advertising
campaign stressing the reliability of its products.
'We have done all the things we felt we had to do to win our corporate
customers back, and in addition to become a strong competitor in the small
business and individual buyers segments of the market,' says Pfeiffer.
However, the danger for Compaq is that in cutting costs it may also have
compromised its quality controls. Not so, Pfeiffer insists, although the
final 'burn-in' tests performed on its new models are significantly shorter
than those for more expensive Compaq products.
Even so, Compaq's engineering and manufacturing strengths are widely
recognised and its testing is extremely rigorous. Unlike Compaq, IBM will
not legitimise the clones sold by its new subsidiaries with its own
corporate logo.
The 'Ambra' products, manufactured in Asia by an unnamed third party, will
be 'no better or worse' than other clones, Cannavino says. The Ambra
products will not benefit from the exhaustive testing of quality and
compatibility that IBM demands for its own PS/1 and PS/2 product lines, he
stresses.
Neither will IBM's sales force be compensated for selling Ambra products.
For PC buyers, the latest moves by IBM and Compaq raise anew the question of
whether price should be the primary consideration in purchasing a PC. 'For
large organisations that rely heavily on PCs, buying cheap ones makes no
sense,' says Cheryl Currid, an industry consultant who studies the use of
clones by US companies.
Low-cost clones are more prone to failure, Currid maintains, and there are
'very real compatibility issues'. The true costs of such problems are much
higher than the price of a new PC, she points out. 'The real expense is the
loss of productivity.'
Yet a recent survey of PC users by PC Magazine, a US publication, suggests
that clones are equally as reliable as brand-name PCs and that many users of
brand-name machines are inclined to purchase their next one from a clone
maker.
One thing is clear, the price of PCs will continue to fall rapidly. IBM is
expected once again to slash prices on some brand-name PCs and a host of
other companies are said to be planning to follow suit, accelerating the
price war.
Many analysts are predicting an industry shakeout as profit margins are
squeezed. The most vulnerable companies are those offering the lowest-priced
clones. 'When there are too many suppliers and too much undifferentiated
product, a shakeout inevitably occurs. We believe that 1992 marked the
beginning of consolidation in the PC hardware industry,' say analysts at
Salomon Brothers.
For PC buyers this raises another new consideration. How much is it worth to
know, with a reasonable degree of certainty, that the company you buy a PC
from today will still be there to support it in a year's time?

<TEXT>
ENGLISH soccer fans convicted of criminal offences at the European football
championships in Sweden could be banned from home games, Mr David Mellor,
national heritage secretary, told the Commons yesterday, David Owen writes.
Those convicted in Sweden 'can be prohibited from entering' UK football
grounds, Mr Mellor warned, adding that serious charges arising from the
events in Malmo had already been laid. 'I certainly hope we shall be able to
exclude those convicted from going to football matches again for a very long
time,' he said.
Mr Mellor, who was addressing his first session of Commons questions in his
new position, endured some spirited barracking from a small contingent of
Scottish MPs when he appeared initially to designate the misbehaving
supporters as 'British'.
Reprimanding the minister for his thoughtlessness, Mr Norman Godman, the
Labour MP for Greenock and Port Glasgow, pointed out that there were 'no
Scots anywhere near Malmo'.
He said: 'Not a single Scottish fan has got into any trouble.'

FT  16 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Pounds 100m pledged to global fund
for environment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN IS to earmark Pounds 100m of new money for environmental spending
over a number of years to help replenish the Global Environment Facility, Mr
John Major, the prime minister, told the Commons yesterday.
He admitted, however, that the timescale over which the money would be made
available was indefinite and depended on when the fund - which is used by
the World Bank and the United Nations to help third world countries to
finance environmentally friendly projects - required it.
Reporting back on his return from the Earth Summit in Rio, Mr Major said it
was a 'milestone' while acknowledging that the results had not gone 'as far
as some would wish'.
He said that Britain itself could have 'gone further' on climate change than
the convention provides. Without the intervention of his ministerial
colleagues, however, 'there might not have been a climate convention to
sign'.
He said he had written to other EC heads of government and the G7 leading
industrial nations proposing an 'action plan' to carry forward commitments
made at Rio.
On broader subjects, he said he hoped that other G7 nations would adopt the
Trinidad terms on third world debt by the end of this year, and claimed that
agreement in the current General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks was
nearer 'than anyone realises or anyone imagined just a few weeks ago'. He
said he wanted to see the talks reach a conclusion by the end of this month,
'beyond which I think we run into timetabling troubles with the US
presidential election'.
Mr Roy Hattersley, Labour deputy leader, urged Mr Major to exploit Britain's
'special relationship' with the US to persuade president George Bush to sign
the biodiversity agreement on protecting rare plants and animals.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Executive loses appeal over ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FORMER company chair-man who was jailed last year for insider dealing has
failed to overturn an order disqualifying him from acting as a company
director for 10 years.
Mr Ivor Goodman, former chairman of Unigroup, the quoted Leeds-based timber
and clothing company, is the only person prosecuted for insider dealing in
the UK who has served a jail term for the offence. In April last year he
pleaded guilty at St Albans Crown Court to an offence under the Company
Securities (Insider Dealing) Act.
He was sentenced to 18 months, of which nine months were suspended. As he
had been in custody for five months, having been arrested for failing to
appear for trial the previous year, he had only four months left to serve.
In the event, because of remission, he was released a few days after being
sentenced.
Yesterday he challenged the disqualification order imposed on him under the
Company Directors (Disqualification) Act as part of his sentence.
Dismissing his appeal, Lord Justice Staughton said in the Court of Appeal
that Mr Goodman's offence was 'a monstrous and scandalous example of insider
trading'. Mr Goodman, the chairman of a public company had obtained, or
attempted to obtain, a very large sum.
'It is hard to think of a worse case,' the judge said.
At the trial the Department of Trade and Industry alleged that Mr Goodman
disposed of his 690,209 Unigroup shares - a substantial proportion of the
equity - just before the company announced worse-than-expected figures in
October 1987. He purported to give the holding to his girlfriend and it was
sold for 167p per share, netting Mr Goodman just under Pounds 1.2m.
The sale, and Mr Goodman's resignation as Unigroup's chairman, occurred a
few days before the Stock Exchange suspended the company's shares at its own
request. When dealings were resumed five months later the shares traded at
55p.
Chase Manhattan Securities, Unigroup's broker, confirmed in November 1987
that it had acquired the shares. Civil proceedings later resulted in the
share sale being set aside.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WOMAN who was asked if she expected to be married with 'two-point-whatever
children' during a job interview has won her case at an industrial tribunal.
The tribunal in Aberdeen awarded Ms Vicky Allison, then 26, more than Pounds
6,500 compensation for hurt feelings and loss of earnings. It heard that the
year-long appointment as a technical officer in Grampian Regional Council's
water department went to a 17-year-old youth with less experience.
Mr Robert Aitchison, the assistant manager who interviewed Ms Allison,
admitted he also asked her how she would cope with the lack of toilet
facilities during the mainly physical field work.
He asked her how she felt about the prospect of working all day with a man
and expressed surprise at the number of women applicants - four out of a
total of 15.
The council was held to have unlawfully sexually discriminated against Ms
Allison by allowing untrained staff to conduct an interview without regard
to the statutory equal opportunities code and in breach of its own policy.
Grampian Regional Council refused to comment.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Venture financing recovers slowly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE VENTURE capital market in the west Midlands is slowly recovering, but
most finance is directed at corporate restructuring, particularly management
buy-outs, fund managers have reported.
Mr Alan Lewis, regional director of County NatWest Ventures, said higher
demand for development capital as companies sought equity to finance
expansion out of recession - a trend expected since the general election -
had not taken place to any marked degree. That indicated 'the recovery is a
slow and painful process at best'.
3i, the UK's largest venture capital group, has seen its activity decline
since the pre-election period, although it is committing more funds to
management buyouts.
Mr Chris Rowlands, Birmingham director of 3i, said in financial terms that
meant 'our activity is very strong, but it is not an accurate reflection of
underlying economic activity'.
Fund managers explained that the low demand for development capital
reflected nervousness not only about the state of order books but also about
strict bank policies.
Only 10 per cent of a Pounds 20m fund set up last August by 3i for small
inner-city businesses in the west Midlands had been taken up, Mr Rowlands
said.
Mr Brian Blakemore, regional director of Barclays Development Capital, said
the main emphasis had been in two categories - 'groups divesting of
subsidiaries because they have a need for cash, and family businesses where
outside management has been brought in and which now wants to buy'.
Nevertheless, whereas some venture capitalists did no deals in the first
quarter of last year, now they are bringing to fruition schemes put on ice
in the months before the election.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Courts Charter still not ready
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Courts Charter, which is due to be discussed at the prime minister's
six-monthly seminar on the Citizens' Charter on Friday, is not likely to be
ready for publication before the end of the summer.
The Lord Chancellor's department, which with the Crown Prosecution Service
is responsible for drawing up the new charter guaranteeing standards of
service and facilities for court users, said yesterday it was still at an
early draft stage.
The Lord Chancellor's Department is one of only a handful of government
departments which has yet to publish information about standards of public
service in its area as part of the charter initiative.
The Justice Charter for Scotland, which sets out the standards of service
which all users of the Scottish justice system can expect and what will be
done if services do not come up to standard, was published as early as last
November.
The English charter is likely to be modelled on the Scottish version. It
sets standards of service for the police, courts, prosecuting authorities
and prison service and describes the action being taken to improve the
quality of services.
Yesterday Mr Michael Jack, Home Office Minister, hinted in a speech at a
conference in London that the charter for England would also look for
greater efficiency and economy in the criminal justice system.
The system could be run on sound business principles without compromising
its independence or integrity, he said.
But the government was also seeking value for money - the best quality at
the right price. These complementary approaches were not in any way at
variance with the principles of justice. Expensive justice was not
necessarily better justice. Dealing with cases in the Crown Court which
could have been dealt with more quickly and cheaply in the magistrates'
courts was a good example of decisions not being made on the most logical or
informed basis, he said.

NORTHERN Telecom, one of the world's largest suppliers of digital
telecommunications switching systems, is to enlarge its operation in
Newport, south Wales.
The move is expected to add 120 jobs over the next three years to its
present workforce of 180.
The Canadian company, which also has a factory at nearby Cwmcarn employing
more than 800, is to move into a 150,000 sq ft factory next April being
built for it by the Welsh Development Agency. The factory will enable the
company to increase production of sophisticated cables and communications
systems for naval underwater and Army uses.
Mr David Hunt, Welsh secretary, said that the agency's joint-venture
property scheme with the private sector was running at record levels and
would lead to 900,000 sq ft of space being built this year - 100,000 sq ft
more than in 1991-92.
The agency claims to be one of the biggest property developers in Europe,
with a portfolio of more than 20m sq ft.
It expects to spend about Pounds 58m this year through joint ventures which
should lead to a total public-private spend in this area alone of around
Pounds 320m.

MOSCOW has given state guarantees paving the way for Bonn to resume

the economics ministry said yesterday, Reuter reports from Bonn.
A Bonn official said Russia had provided the long-awaited documents to allow
the German government to grant its Hermes export guarantees. Trade between
Russia and Germany has virtually stalled since January when Bonn put a DM5bn
(Pounds 1.7bn) ceiling on export guarantees for the former Soviet Union.
Moscow had earlier failed to give its guarantee to either Germany's State
Reconstruction Bank or the German export credit organisation, saying this
was against its constitution. Bonn's first export guarantee of the year for
the former Soviet Union went to Ukraine in April.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Supreme Court yesterday ruled that the government was entitled to
kidnap from a foreign country those wanted for prosecution by American
justice.
By a six-to-three margin and over a blistering dissenting opinion, Mr
William Rehnquist, the chief justice, found that the US government had not
broken the terms of an extradition treaty with Mexico by arranging for the
forcible extradition in 1990 of a Mexican doctor suspected of involvement in
the murder of two American narcotics agents in 1985.
He ruled that it was up to the Bush administration, and not the federal
courts, to decide if the doctor should be returned home, as Mexico has
requested. Lower federal courts had ruled in the doctor's favour, prompting
the administration's appeal.
Mr Rehnquist conceded that the kidnapping itself might have been 'in
violation of general international law principles,' but would not be
judicially reversed because it had not broken terms of the 1980 extradition
treaty with Mexico. The US government had never asked Mexico to extradite
the doctor.
Justice John Paul Stevens, joined by justices Harry Blackmun and Sandra Day
O'Connor, wrote: 'I suspect most courts in the civilised world will be
deeply disturbed by the monstrous decision the court announces today.' He
added: 'Every nation that has an interest in preserving the rule of law is
affected, directly or indirectly, by a ruling of this character.'
The torture and murder in 1985 of the American narcotics agent and his pilot
had soured US-Mexican relations at a time when the US was becoming
increasingly concerned at the flood of drugs from Mexico. The administration
had offered a reward for the capture of the doctor and subsequently allowed
the kidnappers to remain in the US.

FT  16 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Slovak steelmakers find success has a
price - A huge rise in exports to the EC is subject of 'dumping' talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR officials from the Slovak steel company Vychodoslovenske Zelezarny
(VSZ) meet leaders of Eurofer, the European steel producers' association,
this week to fend off threats of anti-dumping penalties.
This follows a cry of alarm from French, Italian and other steel producers
over what Eurofer claims is a 126 per cent rise in Czechoslovak steel
exports to western Europe over the first four months of this year. According
to Czechoslovak trade figures steel exports to the EC amounted to 346,000
tonnes over the first quarter of 1992, as the three main steel producers
sought to reverse two years of sharply reduced output. Last year raw steel
production fell to 12.13m tonnes from 14.9m tonnes in 1990 and output of
rolled products dropped 15.7 per cent to 9.27m tonnes from 11m tonnes in
1990.
Much of the increase in rolled steel exports to the EC, from a low base, has
come from this huge integrated steel plant in the far east of Slovakia, less
than 50km from what is now the border with an independent Ukraine.
Mr Zoltan Berghauer, chairman of the 100-per-cent state-owned joint stock
company (which is now being privatised through the Czechoslovak mass
privatisation voucher programme) says that higher exports are allowed under
the association agreements signed between the EC and the central European
states of Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland last year.
But he is anxious to reach a compromise with Eurofer. 'I understand their
fears of being flooded and I think we'll make an agreement,' he says of the
talks on Thursday with Mr Francis Mer, chairman of Usinor Sacilor, the
French steel company, who will head the Eurofer delegation.
After two years of profound managerial and other changes at VSZ, however, he
is also sure that the Slovak company's prices genuinely reflect lower costs
and recent productivity gains.
'We have two main cost advantages,' says Mr Mer. First, they import iron
pellets cheaply from Krivoi Rog in the Ukraine via a 1,100km-long,
Russian-gauge railway while coal comes 350km by rail from Ostrava in
northern Moravia. Neither has to be expensively trans-shipped, and both raw
materials are mechanically unloaded on arrival.
Second, wage costs are only 5-6 per cent of total costs, compared with
between 20-28 per cent in western Europe.
Employment in steel making has fallen from 19,800 to 11,000 men over the
last two years while a managerial revolution has transformed the old
pyramid-shaped command structure. Instead of 1,200 managers and 7-8 levels
of management in 1989, the company now has a 70-man top management
complement, he added.
The company is now organised like a western holding with only 3-4 levels of
management, over 50 subsidiaries centres and a lot of sub-contracting to
newly privatised companies.
Last year the company made a profit of 4.5bn koruna (Pounds 85m) on turnover
of 50bn koruna 'according to accounts audited by Ernst and Young', adds Mr
Berghauer, who was chief metallurgist of the plant throughout the 1980s and
became chairman in 1990.
'Our quality levels are up to western standards - and so are our manning
levels,' said Mr Stefan Link, adviser to the chairman, during a tour of the
highly-automated plant.
Costs will be further reduced next year when continuous casting fully
replaces the traditional rolling mills which still make 50 per cent of the
3.2m tonnes of rolled steel produced annually.
Between 60 and 65 per cent of output is exported. The collapse of the former
Soviet market, and sharply reduced steel demand from Slovakia's own heavy
armaments industry, forced the company to organise its own sales and
marketing organisation and search for new markets in the west.
The company already has a joint venture with Austria's Voest-Alpine and a
metallurgical ceramics joint venture with Intocast of Germany. It is now
discussing new joint ventures with Hoogovens of Holland to modernise tin
sheet production and another with Ilva of Italy to produce special 'dynamo
steel'. A subsidiary has formed a joint venture with Wimpey of the UK to
modernise Kosice airport.
At a time when unemployment is rising sharply in many Slovak companies, VSZ
has pushed through a diversification programme which has created several
thousand new jobs and raised total group employment to 32,000, including
many of the 8,800 shed from steel making.
Over 15,000 are employed in a wide array of mechanical engineering
companies, many of which started life as suppliers to the steel making
complex. They produce a wide range of products from artillery ammunition to
bridge cranes, including boilers, air conditioning plant, domestic
radiators, fuel pumps, castings of all kinds and cutlery.
Much of this production is exported. Sectors such as ceramic refractory
materials, formerly produced mainly for use within VSZ itself, are being
modernised and expanded for wider sale while vehicle component production is
also being stepped up to satisfy the fast growing Czech and Slovak car
industries. Volkswagen is investing heavily in Skoda and is assembling
Passat models at BAZ in Bratislava.
These ancillary operations consume over 170,000 tonnes of steel from the
core steelmaking business. But exports to the west remain crucial to the
prosperity of Slovakia's biggest steel and engineering complex.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Failed savings and loan group's officials in Dollars 1.5bn
lawsuit

THE US government has filed the biggest lawsuit to date against the officers
and associates of a failed savings and loan institution - a Dollars 1.5bn
(Pounds 820m) legal action charging former officials of the Arizona-based
Western Savings and Loan with civil fraud and racketeering.
The lawsuit was filed at the weekend by the Resolution Trust Corporation
(RTC), the federal agency responsible for disposing of assets of failed
savings and loan groups.
The RTC, in an attempt to recover damages, has over the past year filed more
than 100 claims against former savings and loan officials across the US.
The legal action, which is bigger than the well-publicised Dollars 1.1bn US
government lawsuit filed in 1989 against Mr Charles Keating's Lincoln
Savings of California, came just minutes before the statute of limitations
was set to run out at midnight on Saturday.
Phoenix-based Western Savings failed and was seized by federal regulators in
June 1989. The institution's demise is expected to cost US taxpayers about
Dollars 1.7bn, whereas the failure of Lincoln Savings is likely to cost
about Dollars 2bn.
Among those named in the RTC lawsuit are Mr John Driggs, Western's former
chairman and the scion of a politically prominent Arizona family that
founded the group in 1929. The suit named several borrowers as well as a
Phoenix law firm that acted for Western.
The charges contained in the 200-page lawsuit include fraud, racketeering,
gross negligence, breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract.
After its seizure by the federal government, Western Savings was sold off by
the RTC in pieces. Two years ago the San Francisco-based Bank of America
acquired West-ern's deposit base of about Dollars 3.4bn.

TAIWAN will try to establish air links with 19 countries over the next five
years, Mr Eugene Chien, the country's communications minister, said
yesterday, Reuter reports from Taipei.
'Our airlines will fly to 45 destinations and more than 40 foreign airlines
will fly to our country in five years' time,' Mr Chien told a meeting of
senior government officials, including President Lee Teng-hui and Premier
Hau Pei-tsun.
Taiwan's three international airlines fly to 26 destinations and 24 foreign
airlines have landing rights on the island. Taiwan has been hampered in
setting up air links with other countries because China claims sovereignty
over the island and has sought to isolate it diplomatically.
Only 29 countries have formal relations with Taiwan and talks to open air
links with other countries have been slowed by pressure from Beijing,
Taiwanese officials say.
Taiwan set up air links with Australia and New Zealand last year. But China
Airlines, China's flag carrier, suspended services between Taipei and Ho Chi
Minh City last year, after restoring air links broken off in 1975. Hanoi
sought the suspension, apparently after pressure from Beijing.
In April, Taiwan sent a delegation to Europe to try to set up air links with
Britain, France, Germany and Italy. Taiwan and Britain will sign a pact next
month to set up air links, Taiwan's mass-circulation United Daily News said.
Taiwan's second international airline, EVA Airways, will fly the
Taipei-London route in August, the daily added.
Communications ministry and airline officials declined comment, saying the
issue was politically sensitive because of Taipei's rivalry with China.

SEVERAL Japanese electronics manufacturers are facing an investigation by
the European Commission into allegations that they have been dumping compact
disc (CD) players in European markets.
European consumer electronics makers, including Philips and Grundig, have
complained to the Commission that the dumping has been going on throughout
Europe and anti-dumping duties have been circumvented by routing CD player
imports through Singapore, Taiwan and Malaysia.
The CD players being dumped into European markets were 40 per cent cheaper
than comparable models shipped from Japan, according to a Philips
representative.
One Japanese manufacturer expressed surprise at the allegations. It claimed
Philips itself had shown a CD player at a trade show in April priced at
Pounds 99, which it said was 29 per cent cheaper than its cheapest model.
'We were flabbergasted. I think it is an example of a non-competitive
industry unable to compete and therefore fighting in another way,' the
manufacturer declared.
The European market for CD players has been dominated by Japanese makers.
Rankings in the home audio market in Europe by BIS Strategic Decisions, the
market consultancy, place Sony at the top followed by Panasonic/Technics and
Pioneer, with Philips fourth.

FT  16 JUN 92 / People's Bank opens London office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LI GUIXIAN, governor of the People's Bank of China, today opens a
representative office in London, the central bank's first outside China.
The office is a sign of a more outward-looking approach from the Chinese
authorities as they proceed with 'open door' economic reforms. The Bank of
China, a state-owned commercial bank, already has a London operation and
opens a new building in the City this week.
As well as being an observation point for European economic developments,
the central bank's office could be useful in the management of China's
rapidly growing foreign exchange reserves, which exceed Dollars 42bn.
As part of the reforms, the People's Bank was officially designated the
central bank in 1984. It oversees the banking system, which is still in
great need of restructuring, partly because much lending is directed to
lossmaking state-owned industries at subsidised interest rates.
Though individual banks have gained greater independence in making loan
decisions, they are still subject to officially set lending quotas, and
interest rates play only a limited role in the distribution of credit.
Foreign banks have so far been allowed a limited presence in China, though
some branches are expected to be permitted in the booming special economic
zones. Chinese officials caution, however, that it will be will be difficult
to permit full-scale branches of foreign banks, taking deposits and making
loans in the Chinese currency, until reforms of the domestic banking system
have been addressed.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MILLIONS of South Africans will stay away from work today to mark the
anniversary of the 1976 Soweto uprising and to observe the start of an
African National Congress campaign of mass action aimed at breaking a
deadlock in constitutional talks.
The ANC believes that the government is stalling in negotiations at the
Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa), the national negotiating
forum, and that mass action is necessary to force it to quicken the process.
Codesa failed last month to agree on the the details of a
constitution-making body. Although this subject was yesterday returned to at
Codesa, no breakthrough was expected until progress had been made in
bilateral meetings between the government and the ANC.
The mass action has been widely denounced by the ANC's political opponents,
particularly the government, amid fears that it will exacerbate violence. In
language reminiscent of the darkest days of the state of emergency in the
1980s, Mr Hernus Kriel, law and order minister, yesterday told the Afrikaans
newspaper Beeld that if mass action was the way in which the ANC sought to
support negotiations, the government would have to look again at continuing
the the negotiations process.
He said there was a possibility of special legislation going before
parliament this week to assist in countering mass action, while police and
army forces are on standby. 'This government will not let itself be
threatened by mass action to hand over power in the country to the ANC,' he
said.
The business community has also been been critical of the ANC saying that
the economy, in deep recession and with unemployment running at 40 per cent,
can ill afford a period of sustained disruption.
Mr Sam Shilowa, assistant general secretary of Cosatu, the union grouping
closely allied to the ANC, yesterday outlined a four-phase programme of
action. The first phase will be at the regional level, with protests already
under way by municipal and health workers, and further protests planned.
The second phase will run for the whole of July if the government has not by
the end of this month committed itself to firm time-frames. Next would
follow a general strike while the final phase, dubbed 'Exitgate', envisages
the existing government resigning and preparations commencing for new
elections.

<TEXT>
THAILAND'S Board of Investment (BoI) yesterday acknowledged that new foreign
investment would be severely curtailed by last month's political violence
and said it was planning a campaign in conjunction with the private sector
to restore international confidence in the country.
Mr Staporn Kavitanon, BoI secretary general, said many existing
foreign-funded projects had advanced beyond the point of no return, but
potential newcomers to Thailand were likely to have second thoughts after
the events in May, in which troops shot dead 50 or more pro-democracy
demonstrators in Bangkok.
'One has to admit that the incident now has really frightened investors
who've never known about Thailand before,' he told journalists. 'If you're
talking about the first-time outlay of funds - forget it.'
He said the BoI would co-operate with leading companies such as Siam Cement
to raise Dollars 3m to Dollars 4m (Pounds 1.62m to Pounds 2.16m) for a
public relations campaign which would express faith in Thailand's future.
Mr Staporn's efforts to extract money from the government and reassure
foreign investors should both be made easier by the appointment of Mr Anand
Panyarachun as prime minister last week. Mr Staporn is close to Mr Anand,
and the premier's economic reforms were generally praised by the business
community during his previous administration between February 1991 and March
this year.
Mr Anand, however, expects to be in office only until elections are held in
about four months, and fresh investment was already falling before the
violence because of concern about Thailand's overloaded transport networks,
a shortage of skilled workers and other problems.
Mr Staporn said even in 'normal' times it would take a year to recover from
the sort of trouble experienced by Thailand this year, but Japan's financial
difficulties, Germany's preoccupation with eastern Europe and the weakness
of western economies made the foreign investment outlook even worse.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNEMPLOYMENT and underemployment in the West Bank and Gaza Strip have
reached 'alarming proportions' and the general economic situation has
deteriorated markedly since the Gulf War early last year, according to a
report by the International Labour Organisation (ILO).
Unemployment in the West Bank is officially estimated to have risen to more
than 10 per cent by end-1991 from 3.6 per cent a year earlier.
But the United Nations body says unofficial estimates put unemployment in
the occupied territories at anywhere between 25 and 40 per cent of the
320,000-strong labour force.
The report, compiled before the latest clampdown in Gaza, amounts to a
scathing indictment of Israel's economic exploitation of the territories to
its own advantage, from the destruction of Arab lands and property to make
way for Jewish settlements to employment of Palestinians as cheap labour and
restrictions on Palestinian economic development. Per capita incomes in the
occupied Arab lands are only one-fifth Israeli levels.
Over 120,000 Palestinian workers - more than one third of the labour force
in the occupied territories - commute to jobs in Israel, mostly in
construction. All are employed on a daily basis, without job security or the
social benefits enjoyed by Israeli workers, the ILO points out. During the
Gulf war, many Palestinian workers, some of long standing, were summarily
dismissed, often without compensation and sometimes without the wages due to
them.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S DIET yesterday ended a long legislative battle and passed a
controversial bill to allow Japanese troops to serve in United Nations
peacekeeping forces.
The bill, which has caused deep divisions in Japan, authorises the first
despatch of Japanese soldiers overseas since the second world war. Their
first assignment is likely to be on the UN's peacekeeping mission in
Cambodia.
The bill was passed by 329 votes to 17 in the Diet's 512-seat lower house in
spite of intense opposition by the Social Democratic and Communist parties.
The social democrats boycotted the proceedings in a last-ditch effort to
block the bill and tendered their resignations en masse.
Mr Makoto Tanabe, Social Democratic party chairman, said the bill would
leave a 'deep scar' on Japan. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, prime minister, hailed the
bill, saying Japan would be able to send personnel on UN missions.
The bill's origins date back to the Gulf crisis, when the government mooted
the idea of sending Japanese troops to serve in non-combat roles in the
US-led coalition forces.
But the proposals were dropped after arousing public protest, with many
Japanese saying that sending troops abroad, even on UN missions, would
infringe the country's pacifist constitution. Asian countries, notably
China, also expressed concern about a possible revival of Japanese
militarism.
New proposals were eventually passed by the lower house last December. The
bill authorises Japan to send up to 2,000 troops on UN missions. But they
may only serve in non-combatant roles unless the Diet revises the
legislation to allow for front-line duties.
The ruling Liberal Democratic party tried to accommodate opposition parties'
views by watering down the bill. But as parties jockeyed for position with
an eye on elections to the upper house at the end of July, the opposition
resorted to filibustering with a slow-voting technique called the ox-walk in
which members edged towards the ballot box an inch at a time.
A poll conducted at the weekend by TBS, a tele-vision station, showed 55 per
cent against the bill and 32 per cent in favour, with the rest undecided.
After all-night sessions, the bill passed the upper house and was returned
to the lower house for the approval of amendments. Yesterday the Social
Democratic party changed tack and all 137 of its members tendered their
resignations to the Speaker. It was unclear last night whether these
resignations would be accepted.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Outstanding bankruptcy debt rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OUTSTANDING debt from Japan's corporate bankruptcies in May rose 29.1 per
cent from the same month last year to Y571.5bn (Pounds 2.5bn) as more
companies were brought down by stock speculation and fewer failed because of
the country's labour shortage.
Teikoku Data Bank, the credit research agency, said the amount of debt was
down 25.4 per cent from April, though the number of cases rose by 4.2 per
cent. The largest failure was Hachidai, a property developer, which had
outstanding debts of Y114bn.
The labour shortage has been a prime cause of bankruptcy among smaller
companies, but the slowing of the domestic economy has made the problem less
severe. Teikoku said 40 companies blamed their failure in May on a lack of
workers, the lowest figure since November 1990.
However, slowing retail sales has resulted in an increase in bankruptcies of
retailers, of which 73 failed in May, up from 44 in April.
One of the most notable failures was that of Lec, a maker of bathroom
products, which was the first Tokyo listed company to file for protection
since 1986. Lec had outstanding debts of Y25bn, and was apparently a victim
of stock speculation, as its core business was profitable.
The failure of Lec has raised questions about the willingness and ability of
Japanese banks to support all of their troubled clients.

THE 2.5m voters of Papua New Guinea (PNG) are voting this week in an
election which is being watched closely by the international resources
companies which form the backbone of the country's economy.
A record 1,653 candidates are contesting 109 seats in the unicameral
parliament in the fourth election since independence in 1975.
Mr Rabbie Namaliu, prime minister, says he is confident voters will prefer
his six-party coalition government, led by the Pangu party, to its main
opposition, a four-party alliance led by Mr Paias Wingti.
However, the likely outcome is unclear because of the number of candidates
and parties and a tradition of voting against sitting MPs which could cause
the defeat of up to 60 per cent of incumbents.
The resources industry has emerged as an important issue in the campaign
because of discontent in some areas about land rights, royalty payments, and
environmental controls.

FT  16 JUN 92 / BIS Annual Report: Cautious optimism voiced for world
recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BASLE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THERE are grounds for cautious optimism about the prospects for world
economic recovery, according to Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, general manager of
the Bank for International Settlements.
In comments in the BIS's annual report Mr Lamfalussy says that growth in
much of the developed world should soon start to recover from its depressed
levels last year.
Among the reasons for optimism are signs of recovery in the US, aided by a
revival in housing investment. Private sector debt in both the US and UK has
fallen, while low inflation in much of the industrialised world should aid
increased growth.
Large government budgets in many countries are helping to stimulate demand,
even though the consequent deficits give some cause for concern.
Efforts should be made, says Mr Lamfalussy, to reduce deficits where
possible and also to channel extra government spending 'into public
investment rather than public consumption, and into projects chosen on the
basis of their likely return over the medium turn'.
The costs of servicing the large debts taken on by many people and companies
in the 1980s had retarded the recovery in some countries last year. Another
worry concerns the large fall in land and property prices experienced in
many nations.
However, Mr Lamfalussy says it is 'far-fetched' to draw parallels between
the depressed state of the world economy and the depression of the 1930s.
In further discussion of the world economy elsewhere in the report, the BIS
says restrictions in bank credit in the US arising from the weak state of
the banking industry 'may have become a serious constraint' on spending and
hindered an upturn.
As for Europe, the report draws attention to 'dissatisfaction' with the
operation of the European Monetary System, which due to tight monetary
policy in Germany has prevented several European nations from reducing
interest rates to levels that could help recovery.
But one bright spot is the resilient performance of the economies of a large
part of the developing world, particularly in Asia and Latin America. Many
nations in these regions have made strides in structural economic
adjustments and reductions in overseas debt.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANKS must cut their fees for transferring money between European Community
countries by the end of the year or risk the EC passing laws to make them
improve services, European commissioner Sir Leon Brittan said yesterday,
Reuters reports from Brussels.
'By the end of this year the standard of service should be improving, with
prices coming down and delays being reduced,' said Sir Leon, who is in
charge of banking policy at the EC's executive European Commission.
'Double charging for transfers between banks must become a thing of the
past,' Sir Leon told the European Banking Federation, which represents all
major banks in the Community.
'Otherwise the momentum which has built up behind improving payment systems
will lead inexorably towards pressure for Community-wide legislation,' he
said.
It was one of the clearest ultimatums so far in a campaign by the Commission
to cut the time taken to transfer money from one EC country to another and
to lower the often prohibitive costs to business and private customers of
sending money abroad.
Commission officials have said bank charges on around 200m such transactions
each year in the Community amount to about Ecu2bn (Pounds 1.4bn).
Cross-border transfers can cost up to 20 times more than domestic transfers
in some EC states.
Brittan issued a policy paper earlier this year stating that banks should
cut some charges, reduce the time taken to move money from one country to
another and do so without the Commission twisting their arm.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Belgian government should consider privatisation as a way of easing the
burden of Belgium's large budget deficit, Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian
prime minister, said yesterday.
In an interview with the Financial Times he said that he hoped for 'an
objective debate' about privatisation, but he cautioned against
overestimating the impact of such measures.
'Part of the cleaning up (of public finances) has to include questioning or
evaluating a certain number of tasks that the state has done in the past,
which it's not clear it needs to do today,' he said.
The opposition liberal parties in Belgium have long called for a
privatisation policy, but Mr Dehaene, a Flemish Christian Democrat, would
first have to convince his socialist coalition partners of the value of such
a move.
'Privatisation isn't the panacea which is going to resolve all the
problems,' he said 'It would have to be done in an orthodox way: it should
serve to reduce debt, not finance current expenditure - which is the case
with certain opposition plans - and thus the short-term impact would be less
dramatic than some think.'
Belgium has a large public sector, which includes the national lottery, a
number of public credit institutions, the telecommunications, postal, and
rail services. Work has already begun on giving some of these
over-bureaucratic public bodies an autonomous company-style statute and
putting in place a proper corporate management.
Government officials stress that this is not necessarily a prelude to
privatisation and Mr Dehaene himself says he would be happier giving
priority to these 'intermediate routes' for the time being.
Hill Samuel, the British merchant bank, and Petercam Securities, a Belgian
broker, commissioned an academic study earlier this year which estimated
that the state could raise some BFr318bn (Pounds 5.3bn) through
privatisation of the assets which it owns directly.

PORTUGUESE customs officers are due to go on strike at ports, airports and
border crossings for seven days from today to protest against job losses
when the European Community abolishes frontier controls in 1993, Reuters
reports from Lisbon.
The officers' unions predict that 600 to 1,000 lorries will be stranded at
Portugal's borders with Spain on the first day alone.
About 85,000 customs employees across the Community stand to lose their jobs
with the creation of the single market on January 1, 1993, a tenth of them
in Portugal.
The unions said customs workers had been offered Esc 86,000 escudos (Dollars
647) each in redundancy money from EC funds but the Portuguese government
has not made it clear its own compensation plans.

FRANCE'S inflation advantage over its main trading partners continued in
May, official data showed yesterday, Reuter reports from Paris.
For the fifth consecutive month, the consumer price index (CPI) published by
the national statistics office INSEE rose 0.3 per cent, for a year-on-year
rise of 3.1 per cent.
Cumulative inflation in the first five months of 1992 was 1.3 per cent. The
figures were in line with private economists' forecasts.
Finance Minister Michel Sapin 'noted with satisfaction' that inflation was
well below that of France's main trading partner, Germany, traditionally the
champion of monetary rigour in Europe. West German prices rose 4.6 per cent
in the year to May.
His ministry described the French figure as a good result, achieved despite
higher oil prices and charges by doctors.
Prices rose 3.1 per cent last year and 3.4 per cent in 1990.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN'S Centre party will vote today at its annual conference on whether it
wants the country to join the European Community. If it votes against EC
membership the decision will precipitate a political crisis and split the
Swedish government.
As a member of the four party coalition which took office last October, the
Centre is committed to an agreed policy of pressing for Swedish EC
membership. But a large number of the party's members and an estimated two
thirds of its supporters are against EC membership, with only 13 per cent in
favour.
Opinion appears to have hardened against Swedish EC membership since the
Danish rejection of the Maastricht Treaty in the referendum on June 2. At
present the Centre, which draws on support mainly from the rural areas, has
around 7 to 8 per cent backing in the public opinion polls.
Mr Carl Bildt, Sweden's prime minister and Moderate party leader, has
already warned the Centre that if it commits itself to an anti-EC position
its ministers will have to leave the government. Yesterday Mr Olof
Johansson, the Centre party's leader and environment minister, praised the
Danes for rejecting the Maastricht Treaty. He said he was also opposed to
any idea of a future European Union.
As a joint supporter of the all-party recommendation last year by the
Swedish parliament of the application for EC membership, Mr Johansson added
that he remained in favour of joining the EC if the right terms could be
negotiated.
These would include assurances that Sweden would not be involved in any
future military alliance, that the EC would have a strong regional policy
and decentralised decision-making.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Irish PM in last-ditch appeal to waverers in Maastricht
vote: Dublin fears the Danish factor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN AN evident show of jitters in the run-up to Thursday's referendum on the
Maastricht Treaty, the Irish government yesterday took the unprecedented
step of ordering the state television and radio network to give air time to
a broadcast by the prime minister, Mr Albert Reynolds, to argue the
pro-European case.
He made a last-ditch attempt to convince Euro-doubters that by voting 'Yes'
Ireland's sons will not be drafted into a Euro-army, that Irish women will
not be prevented from travelling abroad for an abortion, and conversely that
Irish foetuses will be safe from Godless Eurocrats in Brussels. Instead,
prosperity and national wealth will flow from European Union.
Although the weight of organised political opinion in Ireland has fallen
heavily on the side of a 'Yes' vote in the referendum, the government fears
the Danish factor.
The government, the four main political parties, the four main employers'
and business organisations, the main trade unions and farming leaders have
all come out decisively in favour of ratifying the Treaty.
The most recent opinion polls also suggest that two out of three voters who
have made up their minds will vote 'Yes'.
In similar circumstances, Danish voters proved the pundits wrong by
rejecting the Treaty by a narrow margin.
The large number of undecided voters in Ireland, almost a third at the last
count, suggests a similar outcome could occur, especially as the complacency
and divisions in the 'Yes' campaign have created opportunities for the
opposition to exploit.
Mr Reynolds said that rejection of the Treaty 'would put the whole future of
European integration at risk, and it would also put a serious question mark
over our place in Europe'.
'We cannot have our cake and eat it. It is not realistic to think that we
can reject the European Union treaty and still enjoy the benefits of full
membership.'
The government has budgeted IPounds 600,000 for its campaign, a large part
of which has gone on sending a 16-page pamphlet to every house in the
country, expounding the prime minister's message.
The four main parties have also been financing a poster campaign, although
judging by the scale of their efforts party finance bosses have evidently
been more concerned about conserving resources to fight the next general
election rather than 'squandering' part cash on what until recently had been
considered a foregone conclusion.
Surprisingly, little of the political and financial muscle that is behind
the 'Yes' campaign has actually been flexed. At a press conference
yesterday, Ireland's four main business organisations fired off broadsides
in support of the Trea - but there is little evidence that they have helped
to finance what has so far been a lacklustre campaign.
Mr Roy Donovan, the president of the Irish Chambers of Commerce, said: 'The
entire population is best served by an Irish business community that is
competitive and successful at home and abroad.'
Attacking the Euro-sceptics he said: 'By implying that the economic
advantages would fall to industry only and not to the wider community, they
are thriving on rhetoric rather than fact.'
Mr Paddy Marron, the vice-president of the Federation of Irish Employers
said: 'Rejection (of the Treaty) would have immediate consequences for
business confidence, and the prospects for growth and employment in Ireland
would be severely damaged'.
Mr Liam Connellan the director-general of the Confederation of Irish
Industry said: 'I believe we have ahead of us more opportunities now than at
any time since the founding of the state'.
While Irish industrialists continue to voice their strong pro-Maastricht
views the politicians have been bickering among themselves over the conduct
of the campaign.
The ruling Fianna Fail party has come under attack for failing to get many
of its party workers onto the canvassing circuit. A spokesman for the
opposition Fine Gael party said: 'They've been sitting on their backsides
because Fianna Fail has traditionally been a nationalist party, and is not
convinced by the federalist idea.'
The Labour party leader, Mr Dick Spring, did two U-turns on the referendum
in the space of a week, following the Danish vote; first advocating a
postponement, and then deciding to back the plebiscite.
The anti-abortion lobbyists in the anti-Maastricht camp also draw on support
from within the main parties.
A senior cabinet minister this week admitted that 'many of the
anti-abortionist lobbyists are party activists from within Fianna Fail or
Fine Gael'.
And he warned: 'They know the ropes, how to lobby, and are very dedicated.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE chief economists of Germany's top three commercial banks yesterday sent
out a counterblast to the severe criticism of the Maastricht treaty on EC
economic and monetary union published by 60 professors this month.
'The arguments of the German professors on Maastricht breathe the spirit of
the 1970s', the economists said in a joint statement by Mr Norbert Walter of
Deutsche Bank, Mr Ernst Moritz Lipp of Dresdner Bank, and Mr Ulrich Ramm of
Commerzbank. 'They play down the risks of a regression to national narrow
mindedness in the 1990s.'
The professors, mostly younger academics but including the respected senior
figures of Mr Herbert Giersch, former head of the Kiel economics institute,
and Mr Karl Schiller, former economics and finance minister, had criticised
Emu's haste and questioned whether a European central bank would be
genuinely independent.
The bank economists said Emu was not just a 'desirable goal' of European
integration, as the professors put it, but the logical continuation of the
European Monetary System (EMS) and thus an enhancement of the development
towards a true European internal market.
Nor were the Maastricht criteria for economic convergence ahead of Emu too
weak, the economists said.
In fact, they were so strict even countries such as Belgium and Ireland with
ambitious financial goals could not achieve them at present.

BRITISH Farm Minister John Gummer said yesterday the UK would be able to
keep tough anti-rabies laws when the European Community completes its single
market after 1992, Reuter reports from Luxembourg.
'We have ensured that Britain will remain rabies-free,' he said during a
meeting of European Community farm ministers.
Britain, keen to keep the island free of the disease, had been worried that
pets and other animals would be able to get into the country without going
into quarantine first.
Now ministers have agreed that dealers will be able to import dogs and cats
to Britain without quarantine provided the animals fulfil strict health
criteria and pass blood tests to show they are rabies-free on entering the
country.
But when the Commission gets round to drafting proposals for pets travelling
with their owners, Britain has been promised legislation that would be at
least as tough as its current quarantine laws, Mr Gummer said.
The Commission had floated the idea of 'pet passports' certifying animals as
disease-free, but Mr Gummer said the plan agreed yesterday ruled this out.

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl will press for Austria, Sweden and Finland to join
the European Community by 1995 at next week's EC summit in Lisbon.
If the community did not push on urgently with enlargement, the 'virus' of
nationalism could delay European political union by 25 years or more, he
told a meeting of Christian Democrat (CDU) party leaders and officials.
Attempting to rally his unsettled party behind a quick-fire programme of
international and domestic initiatives, Mr Kohl skated over the
imponderables thrown up by the Danish referendum's rejection of the
Maastricht treaties.
However, he accepted that community leaders might not have explained the
implications of economic, political and monetary union clearly enough.
Stressing the benefits to Germany of EC membership, he asked party leaders
to explain to voters that unification in 1990 had changed radically the
country's political priorities.
As for the proposed single European currency, one of the most contentious EC
issues, he would not support anything which did mot match the stability of
the D-Mark.
Mr Peter Hintze, the CDU's new general secretary, complained of the
'discrepancy' between the party's achievements and popular opinion and
called for a 'movement back to the people' through a fundamental reform of
political communications.
Latest opinion polls show the CDU's popular support lagging 5 percentage
points behind that of the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) and 'an epidemic
of mistrust' of politicians.
The CDU's support in the former GDR is also threatened by disenchantment
with the mainstream parties. Mr Peter Diestel, former leader of the CDU
group in the Brandenburg state parliament, has threatened to form a
cross-party 'Eastern Movement' in protest at the 'emotional humiliation' of
people in the five new federal states.
In response, Mr Kohl said the CDU should take advantage of the
'disorientation' among the opposition, and use the opportunity quickly to
resolve outstanding problems in social and budgetary policy.
Ruling out a 'grand coalition' with the SPD and claiming Mr Diestel's
project would achieve nothing, he called for an end to divisive east/west
thinking in Germany.
Reconstruction in the east had absolute priority, he said. Promising to
announce a firm budget policy in the next few weeks, he said 'we can only
win the 1994 general election if we keep national finances under control.'
The offer of early membership to all interested members of the European Free
Trade Area (Efta) would help counter resurgent nationalist tendencies
threatening to hamper political integration, he claimed.
No-one should believe that chauvinism and nationalism were confined to
Serbia, Croatia or the Balkans. 'There is no European country ' including
Germany ' which can claim to be free of this virus,' he said.
Mr Kohl agreed with Mr John Major, UK prime minister, earlier this month on
the need for the 'speedy initiation and conduct' of entry negotiations for
Efta members.
France, however, is more concerned that the bonds between the 12 should be
tightened before membership is thrown open.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Survey of China (13): A future in grain markets -
Agriculture / The issues facing policy makers today are less about how to
feed the people but more about how to feed them better and more efficiently
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the greatest achievements of the People's Republic has been its
ability to feed the people. There are 1.2bn Chinese and, aside from the
disastrous famine induced by Mao's Great Leap Forward, the government has
been able to ensure they have a full belly.
It is a measure of that achievement that the issues facing policy makers
today are less about how to feed the people but more about how to feed them
better and more efficiently.
This is not to say that China's prime requirement of producing enough grain
for its population has changed but more to highlight that markets and
technology have an important role to play in China's agriculture policy for
the 1990s.
Last year, in spite of damaging floods, China produced 435m tonnes of grain,
second only to the record harvest of 446m tonnes in 1990. With the
storehouses overflowing, policy makers judge it time to reform the country's
grain marketing system. The need to reform grain marketing is pressing. Many
localities have stores of rice equal to many years consumption. These stores
overhang the market and depress prices. Added to that is the problem of
storing all the grain China produces.
More than 50m tonnes of grain is stored in the open air, up from 45m tonnes
last year and at least 20m tonnes the year before. There have been many
reports of state grain procurement agencies refusing to buy grain from
farmers due to insufficient storage capacity.
The State Council recently issued a directive to the provinces to make every
effort to expand grain storage facilities. China is expecting another big
harvest this year.
The grain trade in China is still relatively under developed. Under the
household responsibility system, where peasants have limited land tenure,
they are required to meet state-determined production quotas; anything they
make in excess of the quota can be sold on the open market.
However, moving grain - principally rice - from rice growing surplus
provinces of the country to deficit provinces - is something which is still
at a fairly rudimentary stage. China sees the development of wholesale and
futures markets as one way in which to make the distribution and pricing of
grain more efficient.
In October 1990, with the assistance of the Chicago Board of Trade, a
futures market was opened in Zhengzhou, Henan province. This market is
designed to move about 3m tonnes of negotiated-price wheat from one province
to another. Since then a wholesale rice market has opened in Wuhu, Anhui
province, and a wholesale corn market in Changchun, Jilin province.
The economic research service of the US Department of Agriculture estimates
that about 25 per cent of China's grain market is strongly affected by
wholesale and local market activity.
However, a recent article in Problems of Agricultural Economy, a mainland
journal, pointed out that China had a long way to go before the futures
markets really took off. It noted that China lacked well developed wholesale
markets; futures markets needed speculators in sufficient numbers to ensure
competition; the market needed the backing of a developed financial system
and a body of law to guarantee traders' rights, equal competition and
standardised practices.
Prices are still controlled, with the state purchasing grain from farmers at
one price and selling it at a lower price to the cities. State subsides for
grain and edible oil - which go to the 20 per cent of China's population
which live in cities - amounted to Yn3.6bn in 1978; by 1990 the subsidy had
reached Yn40bn, or nearly 10 per cent of total central government
expenditures.
To deal with this problem, the government introduced price rises for staple
foods last year. Some of the price rises were quite large, although from a
low base. For example, the urban price of milled flour rose 56 per cent from
37 fen to 56 fen a kilogramme.
Signs that more radical reforms might be in the offing came earlier this
year. Starting this April, the provinces of Guangdong and Fujien moved to
free floating prices for rice sales in the cities and with very little
evidence of upward pressure on prices. Indeed, in Guangzhou (Canton), one
can see rice from other countries, mainly Thailand, on sale.
They are, of course, two of the richest provinces in the country and can
well afford to pay market prices, but is an indication of the government's
desire to move towards market determination of agricultural retail prices,
and even ones as sensitive as rice.
In rural China farming has become much less important over the past decade
as an employer. The government has been successful in developing rural and
township industries which provided basic services and manufactures while at
the same time absorbing rural surplus labour. They are the hope of the
countryside, opined a recent editorial in the People's Daily, the principle
organ of the communist party.
There are more than 18m rural and township enterprises in China employing
93m rural labourers - up from 34m in 1988 - and these have gone a long way
in soaking up an estimated 120m-150m labourers surplus to farm work in the
countryside. Growth in output of these industries has averaged 10 per cent
to 20 per cent in the past three years and accounts for 30 per cent of
China's industrial output.
The income generated from the growth of these industries has improved the
lot of the farm household. Over the past decade the average living space per
person in rural China has doubled to 18.5 sq metres. The greater wealth of
rural inhabitants is seen in demand for consumer durables, such as
refrigerators, washing machines and colour televisions.
It is rural China which constitutes an important part of the China market
and many companies located in the fast-growing regions of south-eastern
China have targeted the inland rural provinces for sales of consumer
durables.
The communist party is aware that the past decade of rural reforms -
especially the household contract system - has been a popular success in
rural China. At a high level meeting of the party last year the central
committee reaffirmed its support for the contract system and the limited
land tenure that goes with it.
The party has accepted that there will be income inequalities in rural
China. As the People's Daily, said in December: 'For a fairly long period of
time, excessive control over rural collective economic organisations and
egalitarianism in distribution (pay) had dampened peasants' production
enthusiasm and impeded the development of productive forces in the
countryside.'
China has turned its back on Stalinist collectivisation of agriculture,
although it may be some time before it completely repudiates it. It has
opted for a gradualist approach to farm and farm prices reform, while
realising that urgent action is needed to improve agricultural
infrastructure and internal agricultural trade.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Survey of China (15): Foreign activity lifted by new push
for economic reform - Business guide / The prospects for doing business in
China have never been as good since the country began opening to the outside
world in the late 1970s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
'IT'S an extremely exciting time', said a US lawyer. 'Things have been quite
hot since Deng Xiaoping made his visit down south. The Chinese have become
more aggressive and flexible and are really pushing.'
A foreign business executive said: 'The first quarter is traditionally a
slow season but our office in Beijing had the highest volume of sales during
that time in 12 years of doing business in China.'
Within the last year, the political climate for doing business has changed
significantly. China's economic retrenchment policy is officially over. The
international political fall-out from the 1989 crackdown at Tiananmen Square
has eased.
Beijing concluded a memorandum of understanding on intellectual property
rights with the US, clarified its tax law for foreigners, and plans to join
the Berne Convention on copyright for literary and artistic works.
Talks with the US on opening China's markets to foreign products have shown
some progress. Under US pressure, China has slowly begun publishing
regulations which affect business but which were considered secret.
However, daunting obstacles still confront foreign business people in China.
It is a tough market to crack even for those who do the necessary research
for their products or project.
Here are some points to be remembered and tips gathered from long-time China
traders about how to do business:
The Chinese system is in a process of quasi-reform, but is still a planned
economy. The pricing structure is not rational and policies and regulations
can change suddenly. For example, the price of steel jumped 50 per cent last
year. Accurate forecasts of costs are difficult.
Because the economy is state-run in many sectors, and responds to
administrative decisions rather than to supply and demand, the Chinese often
do not react to business proposals within a reasonable amount of time.
Concluding a business transaction takes much longer than in industrialised
countries.
Co-operation between provinces is poor with the result that it is virtually
impossible to take advantage of economies of scale.
In one instance, a businessman wanted to ship petrol tanks made for his
factory in Shanghai to another similar operation in the north-eastern
province of Jilin. But neither the governor of Jilin nor the mayor of
Shanghai would accept this. The factories are therefore duplicating each
other's efforts, to the frustration of the foreign management.
Financial institutions which are common in other countries do not exist,
with the result that many people with whom one is dealing are not familiar
with the minutia of international business. China has no corporate law and
the country's legal foundation is very rudimentary and is being built from
scratch.
Because of the lack of legal redress, forming relationships with the Chinese
is critical to the success of a business venture. 'You must work at all
levels to develop contacts,' an experienced executive said. 'It is not
enough to work at the top level. Today's middle management will be
tomorrow's leaders.'
If you don't pay attention to this aspect of your business, you will fail or
have a tough road. When problems arise, and they inevitably do, you have a
relationship established. That's the key to success.'
Determining whether the Chinese party has the authority to sign the contract
or participate in a deal is crucial. Provincial enterprises may require
approval from the central government. An essential criterion is the value of
a transaction. Deals exceeding certain amounts need the go-ahead from the
central government.
What requires permission from the central authorities in one case is not
always the same each time. The climate fluctuates between centralisation and
de-centralisation.
'You can make a deal with a government-owned corporation which will say it
has the authority to sign the memorandum of understanding,' one executive
said. 'Suddenly, the competition is back in. The MoU was not authorised by
the central government. You thought you had a deal, but now you must start
from scratch. You may still get your way, but you will sacrifice more before
you get in.'
Selecting a good partner is vital and one of the most difficult tasks.
Whether foreign business people are participating in a joint venture,
running a trading operation, or starting their own wholly-owned enterprise,
they need an ally. The right partner can make all the difference.
'It's better to have a good partner than none', said Mr John Frisbie, a
representative of the US-China Business Council, 'But no partner is better
than a bad one'.
A joint venture with a good partner should have the following
characteristics: it should be financially sound, have political clout and
solid contacts in the domestic market, and it should share a common vision
with its foreign half. If the Chinese party has goals different from those
of the foreign ones, it should be able to understand and accommodate them.
Finding a good partner can be difficult. It is important to conduct a
nationwide industry survey using the services of consultants, trade
associations, embassy commercial sections, and chambers of commerce.
'Any foreign company approaching China for the first time should not be able
to plead ignorance if it does something wrong,' one analyst said. 'There are
enough sources of information and advice available. If a company gets
burned, that's not a good excuse anymore.'
Knowing where to invest in China can be an almost overwhelming decision. In
the coastal provinces, logistics are better, officials are more familiar
with international business practices. However, one long-time China trader
said: 'Companies should go where the greatest need is. The areas of greatest
need give more bargaining power.'
Financing can be a severe problem. In spite of China's large foreign
exchange reserves, many domestic companies have no direct access to hard
currency. An operation must frequently stand on its own.
'The government has asked us to borrow foreign exchange outside China, but
the high cost and the foreign exchange risk are a burden for the joint
venture', one western manager said. 'Finally, the customer pays for the
government decision with the high price of the product.' Because of this,
finding an end-user who has access to foreign exchange is important.
Whatever product or service a foreigner is selling, analysts caution that
its success can often depend on what China's spending priorities are.
Ascertaining whether a project or product fits into the country's state plan
is vital.
'What is good one year may not be good the next', said Mr Frisbie. 'Last
year was a good sales year for equipment, computers, electronics, and
certain kinds of raw materials that China does not make.'
Although the Chinese are committed to reducing import licenses for specific
product categories, tariff rates are still high in many cases and there are
other import bans on certain product lines.
For those buying from China, contracts should be as detailed as possible on
critical issues such as quality and delivery time. Clearly spelling out what
happens if certain standards are not met can help avoid problems later.
Some businessmen argue that contracts can be simplified and still address
the important points. This may be contrary to western business practices.
'Every time in my experience when lawyers are physically present during
negotiations, there are problems,' one executive said. 'The Chinese see red
when they see lawyers, and it is best to keep them out of sight.'
The issue of obtaining political risk insurance was a sore point after the
crackdown at Tiananmen Square in 1989 and delayed the conclusion of a number
of contracts, business executives said. Asking the government for political
risk insurance against riots was viewed as an insult when the official party
line was that the country was stable.
The diplomatic solution to the problem was to include it in the cost, obtain
insurance outside the country, and not mention it.
Corruption is a growing problem, particularly in the south, diplomats said.
The smuggling of high tariff items for use in a joint venture can make
legitimate competition difficult for those companies who import through
legal channels and pay the high customs duties. One US company pulled out of
its negotiations when it learned its competitor was offering the Chinese
customer television sets.
The bottom line: 'China is a strategic market and is still not easy to
penetrate,' one experienced western diplomat said. 'But the pay-off can be
significant for companies that have the resources to put in the effort.'

Guangdong

KARAOKE sets are the latest thing at Yi Fa market, two thriving avenues
containing about 300 shops in Pan Yu, a town just outside Guangzhou.
Virtually all the shops, run by stall-holders who rent from the
municipality, sell electronic goods, and they do brisk business in stereo
equipment, air conditioners, and hand-held video games. The whole market has
grown up over the past five or six years.
The state-owned Friendship Store next door is like Woolworths set beside
Bloomingdales. The gadgets it sells, such as telephones and electric fans,
are basic by comparison with the state-of-the-art technology with which they
now compete, and which Cantonese people seem to have the money to buy.
Guangdong's prosperity is such that most city and town dwellers possess
televisions, refrigerators, watches, electric fans, and washing machines.
Nevertheless, the province still has a savings rate of well over 30 per cent
and bank deposits by individuals rose 37 per cent last year.
In the special economic zones, especially Shenzhen, just over the border
from Hong Kong, the prosperity is even more marked - a traveller by road or
rail who dozed off while leaving Hong Kong and woke up in Shenzhen would not
believe that he had crossed into China.
Some northerners who visit Guangdong view its rampant consumerism with
distaste - but the luggage racks of trains going north carry plenty of
karaoke sets and video games.
The province's drive towards the market economy was given a lift this year
when Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's 87-year-old paramount leader, paid it a
visit. It was Mr Deng's method of forcing a new push for economic reform -
though the struggle he is engaged in against more conservative rivals was
evidenced by the fact that the visit was not at first reported by the
official media in Beijing.
Mr Deng's message was that Guangdong was on the right path and that other
provinces should seek to match it. He told the province to be even bolder,
and it is re-writing its 1991-95 five-year plan.
A boom is evident all over the Pearl River Delta area. Last year, the value
of industrial output in the province rose 27 per cent at constant prices -
and in the three special economic zones (Shenzhen, Zhuhai and Shantou) the
figure was an astonishing 44 per cent. In the previous 10 years, the average
annual growth for the province was 20 per cent.
The driving force behind this growth has been foreign investment in
manufacturing, particularly from Hong Kong. Industrialists in the British
territory, which is due to become a special administrative region of China
in 1997 and will therefore be tied even more closely to Guangdong, estimate
that they invested Dollars 16.5bn in the Pearl River Delta during the 1980s.
Guangdong's wage rates, though higher than in the rest of China, remain a
fraction of Hong Kong's.
It is difficult to determine precisely how much of the output is from the
private sector, since a number of companies with foreign or other private
investment are officially regarded as state-owned or collective. But some 40
per cent of Guangdong's production is estimated to be effectively from the
private sector. Before economic reform began in 1978, there was none. Much
of the new production is exported - the province's exports rose 28 per cent
last year.
With state-owned industries desperately over-manned and inefficient, the
growth of profitable private enterprise alongside them perhaps represents
China's best hope for the future. They can absorb the rapidly growing labour
force and make the enterprise culture more widely accepted across the
country.
Provincial officials have taken to heart Mr Deng's exhortation that in 20
years Guangdong should take its place beside Asia's four industrialising
dragons: Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan. They have calculated
that average annual growth of 12 per cent in gross domestic product would be
necess ary to achieve this target.
However, Guangdong still faces challenges if it is to meet Mr Deng's demand:
Even though the province's infrastructure is being developed at a rapid
pace, it is not keeping pace with economic growth. Roads, electricity
capacity and communications will need to be built even faster.
Growth of private property, private companies and financial markets demands
much greater attention to legal and regulatory structures. There are no laws
governing private property rights and no accounting standards.
Foreign investment will need to continue to grow at a rapid pace, and to be
directed steadily more towards industries involving a higher degree of
transfer of management skills and technology. It will also need to spread
beyond the SEZs and the counties in the Pearl River Delta which are referred
to as little tigers.
At the same time, the political backdrop must continue to remain favourable
and nationwide economic reforms, particularly of the pricing structure,
state industries and the banking system, must advance.
Politically, Guangdong could benefit if Ye Xuanping, its former governor,
were to receive a leading post in the political shuffle surrounding the 14th
party congress, expected to take place this year. Mr Ye successfully defied
Beijing on issues such as tax and led Guangdong's development on a
relatively autonomous path.
Though Mr Ye stepped down and was appointed to a less powerful position in
Beijing, he has not moved to the capital and he remains an influen tial
figure in the province.
On the economic reform front, Guangdong this year became the first province
to have rice prices completely freed - an experiment which has apparently
avoided large fluctuations in prices. It is in the forefront of China's
experiments with western-style capital markets and is expected to give
foreign banks greater freedom to do business.
For the rest of China its prime role is as an example of the relative
prosperity reform and foreign investment can bring. The latest symbol is
Gitic Plaza, a 63-storey complex being completed in central Guangzhou by
Guangdong International Trust and Investment Corporation. Rivalling the most
luxurious Hong Kong office blocks in lavishness, it is the tallest building
in China and will house a hotel, offices, apartments, department stores,
restaurants - and the inevitable Macdonald's.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Survey of China (12): Out to catch the wolf - Profile: Hunan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHEN Binfan, the vice-governor of Hunan province, sits back and reflects.
'As the old Chinese proverb says: If you don't expose the child then you
will never catch the wolf.'
For Mr Chen, a native of Fujian province and a man who has spent three years
in Japan and another five in Hong Kong, catching the wolf is a metaphor for
the economic development of Hunan; and the child in need of exposure is the
local economy to market forces.
'If you can not make big strides then you will be left behind by the
others,' he says.
Hunan, China's premiere rice growing region situated in the south east of
the country, is a middle ranking province in terms of income and prosperity.
It is not as prosperous as the coastal regions of China, but neither is it
as poor as the south west or north west.
Its urban population's average income was Yn1,552 in 1991 - slightly lower
than the national average of Yn1,570 - while the Hunan agricultural
workforce had an average income of Yn688, compared with the Yn710
nationally. Last year industrial and agricultural output grew by 9 per cent;
inflation rose by 4 per cent.
Behind these numbers is a remarkable phenomenon and one which is occurring
throughout China: the growth of industry outside the central planning and
direction of Beijing. Rural and township industries in Hunan have, over the
past decade, come from nothing to occupy a vital part in the local economy.
Last year the output of these industries grew by 15.6 per cent; they account
for 41 per cent of industrial output in the province.
The large growth in rural industries has enabled surplus agricultural labour
to remain in rural areas, thereby relieving the cities of the large scale
migration that has historically occurred in other countries which have gone
through a period of high speed industrialisation.
More than 4m are employed in township and rural industries and 1m have been
sent to Guangdong on temporary work assignment, but the province still has a
surplus of rural labour estimated at about 5m.
Some village and township companies are little more than cottage industries,
such as a sack manufacturer owned and run by Huang Jin village, 60
kilometres from Changsha, the capital of Hunan. Others, such as the Yuelu
Shoe Factory, situated in a township on the edge of Changsha are more
serious ventures.
This factory makes 4m pairs of sports shoes a year, for markets in the
Middle East, Europe and the US. It employs 700 people, mostly young women,
and has a joint venture with a Hong Kong company in Shenzhen, the special
economic zone in Guangdong that boarders Hong Kong. But Yuelu's cost
structure underlines why much of the world's low value-added shoe
manufacturers are being transplanted to China: the labour cost per pair of
shoes is just 15 US cents.
Mr Chen makes much of Hunan's comparative advantages of which cheap labour
is one. Another is the relatively low cost of electricity. He points out
that in Hunan industry pays an average 18.5 fen a kilowatt hour (there are
100 fen to a Yuan) compared with an average 40 fen a kilowatt hour in
Guangdong, the province which boarders Hunan to the south.
Yet how long this cheap energy can last is moot. In Yueyang, 150 kilometres
to the north on the Yangtze river, the Huaneng International Power
Development Corporation's latest twin 350MW thermal power station is going
through its final trials before full operation this summer.
It was built with aid from the British government and utilises generators
and turbines made by the General Electric Company.
The electricity plant was non-economic from day one, saddled with a
structural loss because of the state's pricing policy. Zhang Shang Zhi, the
plant's manager, explains that the state requires him to sell his
electricity for 25 fen a kilowatt hour, but it costs 35 fen a kilowatt hour
to produce.
'Because the electricity price is fixed by the Hunan government we have no
option,' says Mr Zhang. 'Even if we work hard the price is too low and we
cannot achieve economic efficiency. We will have to wait until next year for
the price to be increased.'
The economic pricing of energy in China is some way off, but the provincial
authorities in Hunan are trying to reform some aspects of the economic
system inherited from China's 30-year experiment with Maoist economics.
Much of this work is being done by a government department known as System
Reform.
Its head in Hunan is Yu Zhao Yong, director of the Hunan provincial
commission of economic structural reform. Mr Yu is charged with reform of
the state enterprises in the province - reform which owes its origin to the
policies being promulgated at a national level by Zhu Rongji, China's
industry minister.
The provincial authorities plan a five-pronged attack on state industries
this year. The thrust of the reforms is to increase incentives, relate
reward more closely to effort with job promotion and position more closely
linked to merit. The reforms concern changes to employment and social
security, and the introduction of capitalist forms of ownership, most
notably company shares.
The social welfare implications of the reforms appear to be the most
serious, especially the problem of unemployment.
According to Mr Yu, unemployment in Hunan is defined as those school and
college leavers without work. Currently 2.3 per cent or about 100,000 of
them are unemployed.
Those who are working for state enterprises but without work are not defined
as unemployed, but as redundant, and, he says, there are about 140,000
redundant state workers in Hunan. They continue to draw between 75 per cent
and 100 per cent of their wages and all the other benefits which go with
cradle to grave employment in China, such as housing, health and education,
at a nominal cost.
Hunan has decided to centralise the provision of some welfare services. Pay
for redundant workers is distributed through the labour bureau, which levies
charges on companies pro rata to the level of redundancy in their company.
The province is planning to retrain surplus industrial workers for jobs in
other manufacturing companies and the service sector.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Survey of China (9): Heavy demand for shares - Stock markets
/ Two exchanges, in Shenzhen and Shanghai, have been permitted to operate
while a third, in Haikou, was shut down because it failed to gain official
permission to open
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNNE CURRY

<TEXT>
The development of a system of stock exchanges has been hampered by
ideological disputes and regulatory and administrative problems.
In spite of intense pressure from Chinese cities and provinces for the
central government to allow the opening of more stock markets, so far only
two exchanges, in Shenzhen, bordering Hong Kong, and in Shanghai, have been
permitted to operate. A third one in Haikou, capital of Hainan province, was
shut down after opening without official permission.
The government is adopting a cautious approach, but may authorise two more
exchanges in the north.
'The stock exchanges will continue to expand and be a tremendous source of
funds for Chinese enterprises,' said a US lawyer involved in the securities
business. 'But it's going to be fraught with potential complications unless
the fundamental problems - structure of the system, the regulatory network,
and disclosure - are dealt with.'
With economic reformers in the ascendancy, China's enthusiasm to set up
stock exchanges is understandable. Enterprises are driven by the desire to
tap into the large private savings deposits of ordinary Chinese, estimated
to be worth about Yn900bn. This is in addition to several hundred billion
yuan in cash 'under the pillow' and in bonds and certificates of deposits.
With many state enterprises operating in the red, obtaining access to this
enormous pool of deposits was the rationale for opening the prosperous
markets in Shenzhen and Shanghai. Demand has been so acute that some issues
in both cities were initially offered by lottery, with Chinese buyers having
only a small possibility of getting any shares at all and unable to select
the shares of the companies they wanted.
In the ensuing mayhem, the authorities have cracked down on gangster
violence surrounding places in queues outside brokers' offices, and a
Shanghai investor committed suicide over a relatively small loss.
Intense demand has driven up share prices, in some cases to unrealistic
levels, and is not a reflection of improving company performance. The stock
of Shanghai-based Yu Yuan Department Store, which has a reputation as well
managed, jumped from Yn494.3 (Dollars 91.53) in 1990 to Yn5,037.4 (Dollars
932.85) in late April this year.
To help shift the burden of financial support Beijing gives to state
enterprises, the government is planning to allow companies located elsewhere
in China to apply for listings.
When the markets were opened to foreign participation, foreigners snapped up
all the shares they were eligible to purchase. Several investment funds are
being launched to invest in Chinese shares.
In spite of the enthusiasm, the markets are still small. In Shenzhen, 15
companies have floated A shares, available only to Chinese citizens. Of that
figure, six have issued B shares, which can only be purchased by foreigners
in dollars and are denominated in renminbi. In Shanghai, 14 companies have
listings, only one of which has floated B shares.
The Shanghai bourse tends to be the more tightly controlled, because its
employees were formerly bankers with the People's Bank of China, the
country's central bank which acts as the markets' regulatory authority.
However, prices doubled in a single day in May when limits on daily price
movements were lifted, and then fell as the authorities sought to bar
investment syndicates from ramping shares.
Nine other cities, including Tianjin, Dalian, and Shenyang in the north are
all vying to open stock exchanges, but the central government is thought
unlikely to approve a third until Shenzhen and Shanghai acquire more
experience.
In spite of the wave of enthusiasm, further progress is being hampered by a
fundamental ideological question - how to have such quintessentially
capitalist institutions as stock markets in a socialist country with many
state-owned companies.
The Chinese are deadlocked over the question of ownership in state-owned
enterprises. When companies issue shares to the public, under current
regulations, their worth cannot exceed 50 per cent of the value of the
enterprises' assets, according to Chinese sources.
As the shareholding changes, it becomes more difficult to define the nature
of a company, which is then partly owned by the state and partly by the
public.
'Eventually, shares might be owned by state-owned companies, collectives,
and individuals,' a Chinese analyst said. 'This possibility has given rise
to great concern by central authorities who are afraid of losing control of
enterprises and some state assets.'
However, after Deng Xiaoping's visit to southern China this winter, the
analyst said rules on ownership were relaxed slightly and that enterprises
in non-priority sectors were allowed to sell more of their shares to the
public.
Another problem hindering the development of China's stock markets is the
lack of a strong regulatory agency. Although the People's Bank regulates the
securities business in China, Chinese and foreign critics said it did the
job inadequately.
'The People's Bank has too strong a self interest,' a Chinese legal expert
said. 'They don't want a securities market - they are worried it would
siphon funds away from the banks.'
The government appears to be more concerned with formulating regulations,
but the many layers of bureaucracy cannot agree about a Chinese version of
the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
Moreover, the different agencies - the People's Bank, the Ministry of
Finance, the State-Owned Assets Bureau, State Economic Reform Commission,
and the Stock Exchange Executive Council - are competing for control of an
independent authority if set up.
The lack of a company law describing how to create, operate and dissolve a
company, no unified accounting principles, no strong disclosure system, and
no detailed requirements for evaluating a company's assets mean the infant
markets will have a series of crises during their development.
Analysts have expressed concern about the lack of insider trading
regulations and potential conflicts of interest. Lawyers said the People's
Bank wanted to control and regulate the securities market, but also wanted
to profit from it by trading in it.
'If the government acts prudently, within the next few years, things will
get better and it will set up a regulatory scheme, the necessary laws and
regulations, and an enforcement team,' said a Chinese observer.
'Otherwise, stock markets will go rampant, people will get hurt and the
government will be forced to close them, and they will be dormant or
half-dead,' he predicted.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Survey of China (8): Small fare in the iron rice bowl -
Industry: central planning still dominates a rigid system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST outside the city of Yueyang in Hunan province is a new coal-fired power
plant, built with British government finance by GEC and Babcock Energy of
the UK, as well as Chinese contractors. Because the province's need for
electricity was urgent, it was constructed at speed,
However, from the first day of its operation late last year, the plant has
made a substantial operating loss. Hunan province fixes the price at which
it may sell electricity to the grid at Yn0.25 per kilowatt hour. But the
cost of production is Yn0.35, in which a large element is the price of coal,
fixed by the central government in Beijing.
Provincial officials say that next year, the province will adjust
electricity prices. Zhang Shang Zhi, the plant's manager, admits that he
does not have much control over the situation but says that electricity
prices should be freed step by step: 'We do not want the price to be
completely freed because we are afraid of the inflation we had before.'
Mr Zhang's predicament seems a potent symbol of the problems afflicting
China's state-owned industries. In spite of the attempts to introduce
greater efficiencies and to make managers responsible for their finances,
even new factories run up against the rigidities built into the socialist,
centrally planned economy. One third of state enterprises are loss-making
and another third barely break even.
The problems in the way of improving industrial efficiency include: absence
of financial and managerial autonomy, poor management skills, production
quotas set by the state, a rigid pricing system, overmanning, inability of
wages to provide incentive to better performance, lack of proper accounting,
failure of the banking system to assess creditworthiness before providing
credit, and failure to use the bankruptcy law.
Under the iron rice bowl policy, most industries remain completely
responsible for the housing, medical care and pensions of employees and
their families.
Some industries have large stockpiles of unmarketable products and large bad
debts. Subsidies and directed credits to these industries swallow a
significant amount of the national budget, which is in deep deficit.
Most daunting for reformers wishing to tackle state-owned industries is the
fact that most of these problems are linked. It is difficult to address one
without coming up against the need to address the rest. To attack all at
once, in such a large country with industries spread nationwide, might seem
almost an impossible task.
In spite of the growth of privately-owned industry, especially in the south,
and of local industrial enterprises run by villages or townships, medium and
large industries owned by the central or provincial governments still
account for about half of China's industrial output and for 18 per cent of
the labour force.
As a report by the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation notes:
'The government has been hesitant, in view of the enormous difficulties, to
act decisively on the important issue of management/ownership of state-owned
industrial sector and on fundamental reform to the price structure.'
However, some measures have been taken over the past year. And following the
new push to reform given this year by Deng Xiaoping, China's paramount
leader, officials responsible for drawing up reform plans are talking with
new determination about the need for reform.
The contract responsibility system, under which managers take responsibility
for their finances and may re-invest above-target profits in the business,
has been in operation for some time but has had limited success. There is no
clear way for responsibility to be taken for losses: very few businesses
have been put into bankruptcy and many managers, like Mr Zhang, can do very
little to avoid making a loss or are unable to streamline their workforces.
There has been a move to put some industrial workers on contracts, but the
vast bulk of them continue to be tied to the iron rice bowl.
More recent actions include a reduction of mandatory production quotas, and
adjustments to tax and depreciation rates.
Fan Hengshan, senior economist in the central government's commission for
restructuring the economic system, says that planners have to distinguish
between different reasons for enterprises' making losses: poor management,
the economic environment, or the political or systemic structure.
Too little attention has been paid to managers' skills and to giving them a
true role. Officials 'are too used to the planned economy and too used to
taking over the responsibilities of managers', Mr Fan says. 'It is important
to change the function of the government from giving orders to providing
services, giving suggestions and working with them.'
Mr Fan sees action being taken on various fronts. Because some factories are
being closed down, creation of a social security system has become a
priority. Price reform is proceeding, especially in grains. However, he sees
improvement of the management of enterprises as the highest priority.
As one means of achieving this, Mr Fan and other planners believe that the
share-owning system should be introduced as widely as possible in
state-owned industries. They see it as shaking up managements, separating
management from ownership, and providing incentives to employees. Under most
experiments so far, employees receive shares, which pay dividends if
warranted, but they are not allowed to sell them outside the company.
However, the aim is to groom companies for eventual stock market listings.
Regulations designed to provide the backing for the new shareholding culture
are due to be published soon.
One of the main obstacles to reform of industry is the massive bureaucracy
behind it; the dozens of ministries and other government agencies overseeing
industry and commerce. Their officials enjoy the iron rice bowl and may
resist reform of industry because they have an interest in maintaining the
status quo.
Relaxing the reins constricting China's industries, and nurturing managers'
skills so that they can choose their products, materials, staff and pay
levels, and marketing and financing methods, will be a challenge stretching
over many years. In spite of the growth of private and rural industry, and
the consequent smaller share of the economy taken by the state sector, it
will be essential for the country's future economic health that the
challenge is met.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Survey of China (10): A crippling bill - Social
Welfare/Housing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of the biggest issues facing policy makers in China is what to do about
the country's cradle-to-grave social welfare and housing programmes.
As China travels further down the road towards market reforms this system is
looking not only too costly but also a positive inhibition to the reform of
the economy.
However, reform is complicated by a number of factors.
First, the provision of social welfare and housing policy is not
centralised, but is located in the workplaces of China's workers.
Co-ordinating reform, therefore, requires balancing various bureaucratic
interest, not only at a national but also a provincial and city level.
Secondly, and most importantly, any far-reaching reform of social welfare
and housing has large political implications, especially in the cities.
China's current welfare policies were designed in 1950s to provide not only
economic support for, but also political control of, the population.
Chinese city workers are assigned to a danwei, or work unit, which
circumscribes their daily life. The unit provides housing, health and
education; it also approves marriage. Within the unit is stationed the
public security bureau whose job it is to monitor and maintain files on the
political attitudes of the workers.
This is a powerful system, therefore, of welfare and social control and
changing it has implications for both. Enter the World Bank.
Its economists have recently concluded a study* of urban housing in China.
It warns that without an urgent and comprehensive reform of China's housing
policies attempts to further modernise the economy could fail.
'The ability of business enterprises to restructure themselves in response
to market signals requires that firms be allowed to adjust the size of their
operations, the nature of their products, and the location of their plants,
while adding or shedding workers, as necessary . . . To do so a housing
market must emerge that operates in a significantly different manner from
today's administrative allocation model,' the study said.
The past 12 years in China have witnessed the world's largest residential
building spree. Between 1978 and 1990 China spent 8 per cent of its gross
domestic product and 30 per cent of its total fixed capital investment on
the creation of housing. Over that period about 150m square metres of living
space were added annually, doubling the floor space available to the average
urban dweller.
However, with households in China's urban areas - and the problem is largely
an urban one - devoting only 1 per cent of their monthly income to
work-unit-provided housing there are no incentives for consumers to align
demand for housing with their ability to purchase it.
Housing is produced and financed by a supply-driven system that bears little
relation to cost or recovery. As the bank observes, in most market economies
the ratio of average house prices to average annual income is between 2:1
and 6:1. In China the ratio can exceed 20:1; the rents required to fully
recover the cost of investment could be more than 70 per cent of average
household income.
Indeed, World Bank analysts are concerned that rents collected are
insufficient to pay for minimal housing maintenance. If this is allowed to
continue China could face a financially crippling bill for new housing
within a decade or more as it deals with the replacement of its urban
housing stock.
Housing subsidies to urban residents have ballooned over the past decade.
Between 1978 and 1988 the value of the subsidy has risen from Y4.7bn to
Y58.4bn - an 11 1/2 fold increase.
In 1978, 80.6 per cent of an urban resident's income used to be in the form
of cash and bonuses; housing subsidies accounted for 6.7 per cent, welfare
subsidies 11 per cent, and price subsidies 1.6 per cent of income.
By 1988, and in spite of the economic reforms introduced, subsidies had come
to play and even more important role. Salary accounted for 62 per cent of
income, the housing subsidy had doubled to 15.6 per cent of income, while
welfare subsidies had risen to 11 per cent and price subsidies trebled to
4.8 per cent of income.
The government's response to the growing burden of housing on the exchequer
has been to experiment with various market-linked reforms. Rents have been
raised and home ownership has been introduced on a trial basis in some
cities.
In general, however, the World Bank study found that the reforms to date had
done little to resolve outstanding issues including property rights, urban
planning, the diversification of housing producers and the creation of
housing finance institutions based on prudent criteria.
They have also done little to encourage home ownership. In Yantai, in
Shandong province, where reforms have gone deepest, the scheme mobilises
savings at negative real interest rate and re-lends at slightly higher
rates, subject to onerous down payment conditions and a mortgage repayment
schedule of 10 to 15 years.
Beijing and Shanghai are conducting experiments with owner occupation but,
in common with Yantai and other cities, they balk at cutting the knot which
ties the worker to his workplace. The failure of the authorities to
contemplate this has large implications for economic reform more broadly.
The World Bank said that the Chinese government should withdraw from housing
 -except for providing a regulatory and legal framework for property rights,
mortgage finance and urban planning - and restore consumer sovereignty to
the urban dweller. Leased and individually owned property should be
tradable.
It said the link between work units and household housing choices must be
broken. It recommended transferring control over existing housing allocation
and maintenance from the danwei to an arms-length rental company which would
receive rents which in the short-term cover maintenance and which, in the
long-term, provide a commercial return on investment.
The bank sketched a plan for the deregulation and marketisation of
state-controlled urban housing, estimated at 1.6bn square metres of living
space, over a five-year period. It envisaged a situation where subsidies are
phased out, rents rose to a truer level and where pay was adjusted to
compensated workers.
Whether the Chinese government listens to this advice is moot. So far its
attempts at reform have been peace meal and directed at finding the formula
by which market rents can be mandated from Beijing. With a note of
exasperation the bank noted: 'Too much time is being devoted to finding a
scientific solution to a problem that defies science.' But time is one thing
the authorities do not have.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Survey of China (7): Doubts over role for foreigners -
Infrastructure: China faces energy crisis as economic growth fuels
consumption
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
AS reformers gain ascendancy the development of China's infrastructure has
become of crucial importance if the moderates are to achieve their goal of
sustained market-oriented economic growth.
However, in spite of significant progress, the prospects for expanding and
modernising the country's infrastructure remain clouded by financial
difficulties, geography, bureaucracy, and continuing differences of opinion
over how extensive a role foreign companies should be given in areas deemed
vital to China's national security.
The scale and nature of the problems can perhaps be found most starkly in
three areas where slow progress could prove crippling for economic
development: telecommunications, transportation, and energy.
Under China's Eighth Five-Year plan, all three are deemed priority areas and
receive the maximum resources the state can provide. Progress has been made
in each area, yet all face significant challenges.
ENERGY
China faces a severe energy crunch, which has the potential to cripple the
rest of the economy.
China derives 75 per cent of its energy from coal, of which it is the
world's largest producer. The remainder of the country's energy comes from
hydro and nuclear power, wind, and oil.
Of the energy that is coal-driven, 43 per cent is for industrial purposes,
nearly half is split equally between electricity generation and residential
and commercial use, while the remainder is needed for steel production and
transportation.
Last year's coal production was about 1.1bn tons and it is expected to be
about 1.4bn tons in 1995. By 2000, China's output is projected to be about
2bn tons. By then, western experts forecast China will consume one half of
the world's mined coal.
In spite of this increase, China has an energy shortfall. Many factories
work short weeks because of a lack of electricity, but the country's
economic development is fuelling demand for even greater energy use.
The only option China has to meet its energy needs is to increase coal
production. Its dilemma is how to increase efficiency in mining and
transportation, and to increase efficiency in combustion with minimum
environmental impact.
China's coal production has a serious environmental impact.
Much of the coal has a high sulphur content which cannot be removed with
simple methods such as washing. In the winter, a haze from coal-fired
boilers hangs in the air.
Inefficient use of coal stems partly from prices being set too low. The
industry relies heavily on government subsidies and necessary investment is
not made. Small price increases have not kept up with inflation.
'Sharp increases in coal prices could send too many waves through the
economy', a western expert said. 'Too big a shock would push up the prices
of all other goods and this could lead to unrest.'
Among other resources, the most crucial is oil. Demand is lifted by economic
growth. China produces approximately 2.7m barrels of crude a day, but growth
has been virtually stagnant since 1989. China has had no significant
discoveries in recent years.
Questions are being raised about whether there is enough oil to support the
economy. China exports 500,000 barrels a day, but western businessmen say
that by 1995 it will not have enough to continue exporting.
The government is attempting to increase production in three ways: it plans
to open the East China sea to foreign exploration; secondary and tertiary
recovery techniques from existing oil fields are being stepped up; and much
effort is being put into developing the Tarim Basin in the western province
of Xinjiang.
Western oil executives say the Tarim Basin could equal the reserves found in
some Middle Eastern oil fields. So far, China has not allowed any foreign
equity participation in oil development and exploration in the area. But the
country's economic growth and its nearly stagnating domestic oil production
could compel the government to reconsider.
'China is starting to open the door a crack', a western executive said.
'They are back against a wall, but their national pride and politics get in
the way'.
TELECOMMUNICATIONS
Because of the low density of telephones and the rise in living standards,
demand for telephone services has soared. Residents in cities often wait two
years and pay Yn3,000 to Yn5,000 to install a private telephone. The number
of applicants increases annually by about 16 per cent, according to the
official English-language newspaper China Daily.
China has about 11m telephone lines, more than three times the number 10
years ago. Placing a call internationally to the US or Europe is easier than
dialling domestically or to Hong Kong. There are more gateways, the exchange
equipment which manages transmission paths internationally, in China's main
cities.
There are 1.92 telephones per 100 people, though in Beijing the figure is
13.5. The government is taking steps to increase capacity and is also
improving communications in remote areas, particularly those with strong
national minorities such as Xinjiang, inner Mongolia, and Tibet.
Acute demand has been a boon for cellular telephones. Subscription for a
portable telephone costs about Yn20,000. Even so, the market has taken off,
particularly in prosperous Guangdong province.
Beijing has ambitious plans to continue improving and expanding its
telecommunications network. By 2000, the target telephone density is three
per 100 people nationwide.
About 10,000 km of optical fibre cables have been laid and there are plans
to more than double that figure in the next five years, according to western
businessmen.
During the same period the government plans to add another 15m lines, of
which nearly 12m will use computer switching. Nonetheless, severe problems
remain.
One of the most significant is Directive 56, an internal report issued by
the State Council in 1988. It stipulated that China could form joint
ventures with only three foreign companies - Siemens, Alcatel and NEC - to
manufacture telecommunications switching equipment to sell to the Chinese
market.
Other companies were frozen out. The Chinese expressed concern about the
development of too many software packages that would be potentially
incompatible with the original three.
China faces Cocom restrictions on the transfer of channel signalling,
technology used to re-route calls on demand automatically around damaged
circuitry. This can be useful in warfare and is relied upon in the west when
natural disasters damage telephone lines.
Developing physical transmission capacity and the intelligent software to
manage it with limited financial resources therefore remains a challenge.
According to a western businessman, the main problems have been managing
investment priorities between switching and transmission and the degree to
which China is willing to partner other technology suppliers.
'They want to do everything they can locally. They know they can do it
faster if they import. But they have to determine how they can balance these
two objectives'.
TRANSPORT
China is moving rapidly to eliminate bottlenecks in ports and railways.
All the country's main ports - Guangzhou, Xiamen, Fujian, Ningbo, Shanghai,
Tianjin, Dalian - are carrying out large expansion programmes. Ningbo, near
Shanghai, has the most extensive deep water port for handling container
vessels in China.
Although they lack the high throughputs and efficiency of Hong Kong or
Singapore, China's ports are all fairly efficient and have eliminated the
heavy port congestion and waiting times of the 1980s.
Particularly efficient is the Tianjin free trade zone where cargo can be
kept under bond until the importer pays for it. Tianjin has set up a joint
venture with a Dutch freight forwarding company to clear customs and provide
rail service direct to land-locked Mongolia.
A priority in all ports is development of more container berths for handling
coal and grain. Coal is transported across the country by rail and then on
freighters down the coast to southern ports because it is too expensive to
ship it by rail from the north.
Modernisation of coal handling is crucial as much equipment is obsolete,
causing significant loss and spillage.
The Chinese have plans to develop further a port in the Tumen Basin near
Vladivostok where economic activity is flourishing between Russia, North
Korea, and China.
The government's main goal, however, is to consolidate port projects begun
in the 1980s and improve information, management, and costing systems rather
than to build new ports.
In contrast to the ports, the country's rail network is woefully inadequate
and operates some of the most intensively used lines in the world. China is
the third largest shipper of cargo per kilometre after the former Soviet
Union and the US. Cargo and passenger traffic is growing at 9 per cent
annually.
The main focus is to continue to develop more rail lines to relieve coal
bottlenecks, double-tracking and electrifying along the main north-south
corridors from Beijing to Guangzhou and Shanghai, and east to west from
Zhejiang province to Changsha in Hunan province.
Electrification is cheaper than using diesel fuel and the lines can carry
more traffic.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Survey of China (6): Surplus? What surplus?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The view is rather different from Beijing, writes Alexander Nicoll.
According to Chinese statistics, China has a trade deficit, not a surplus,
with the US. Last year, it was nearly Dollars 2bn. The large discrepancy
occurs because of differing treatment of goods exported from China to Hong
Kong. China views them simply as exports to Hong Kong, but the US views
goods which are shipped on to the US as imports from China.
However, China has apparently taken US strictures to heart and the focus of
its trade policy is on reform of the import regime.
Zhu Mincai, at the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, says
the reforms are necessary in order to speed China's entry into Gatt.
Some tariffs - for example on cars and televisions - have been reduced this
year and cuts on other items are planned. A list of 1,751 items which were
effectively banned from import has been abolished, so that manufacturers may
import them without finding domestically produced substitutes. The number of
items for which import licenses are necessary is being reduced. Previously
secret regulations are to be either published or cancelled.
Related measures include a plan to move to a single floating exchange rate;
and relaxation of the ban on foreign investment in retailing and financial
services.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Survey of China (5): Bush takes a tougher stance - Foreign
trade: human rights cast shadow over talks with US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A senior Chinese textile official was recently reported in the US as
suggesting that Beijing was considering a joint venture in offshore garment
production: factories would be built in the US and, perhaps, Mexico, with
Chinese technology and machinery and local labour and raw materials.
The timing of the report, mid-May, gave it a ring of authenticity. The
suggestion was made two weeks before President Bush was due to issue his
annual renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation trading status.
Ever since the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre the renewal has been more
difficult for the US president to justify to Congress, so things tend to
happen around renewal time: long-sought laws on intellectual property rights
are published while Beijing promises to increase imports.
To extend MFN - which gives China the same tariff treatment as most other
nations - the president must certify that Beijing is not in violation of US
human rights standards. Failing that, he can waive the criteria, stating
that MFN would substantially promote free emigration.
Thanks to the benefits of MFN, the US trade deficit with China was Dollars
12.7bn in 1991 - the second largest US deficit after Japan's - and it is
still growing. Textiles and clothing account for about one quarter of
Chinese exports; the rest are mostly consumer goods such as bicycles,
costume jewellery, toys, games and sports and electrical equipment.
Removal of MFN status would deal a significant blow to China's exports and
to the economy of Hong Kong.
To fend off last year's attempt by Congress to impose conditions on China's
MFN, Mr Bush began to get a little tougher with Beijing.
He vowed to impose sanctions if Beijing did not agree to protect
intellectual property rights, support Taiwan's membership to the Gatt, cut
illegal textile and apparel shipments, and strictly monitor goods thought to
be produced by prison labour. Licenses to sell high-speed computers and
satellites to China were to be disallowed until China promised to adhere to
international non-proliferation standards.
The policy produced results. Hours before the US was prepared to impose
sanctions on Dollars 300m-Dollars 500m worth of Chinese products for
Beijing's failure to protect intellectual property rights, a deal was
reached. China promised to improve protection of computer software, sound
recordings, pharmaceuticals and agri-chemicals. It vowed to join the Berne
Copyright Convention by next October and the Geneva Phonogram Convention in
June 1993.
Last October, the US Trade Representative initiated a Section 301
investigation of Chinese market access barriers. Talks can go on for a year
before the president orders retaliation. The four core issues to be resolved
are China's extensive import licensing system; lack of transparency in its
trading rules; bans or quantitative import restrictions; and the use of
technical standards and certification as trade barriers.
After first making slow progress, US officials described the most recent
market access talks last month as 'the most constructive and productive
ever'. Beijing offered to phase out import licensing requirements for more
than 50 product categories and promised to provide 'an exhaustive and
authoritative' list of Chinese import bans, controls and quotas within two
months.
Substantial differences remain, but the Chinese appear to be convinced that
sanctions will happen if they do not co-operate. The US diplomatically
presents the 301 talks as an exercise to help China prepare for Gatt
membership. The unspoken threat is that Taiwan will be ready before China
is.
In another slap at Chinese trade practices, the US Customs Service has
launched one of its largest investigations in an effort to contain the flood
of Chinese exports seeking to avoid quotas or to use prison labour.
In May, customs officials announced indictments of four Chinese businessmen
and three companies for undervaluing textile imports with the intention of
defrauding the US government of import duties totaling Dollars 120,000.
Agents blocked in US warehouses 10 shipments of goods allegedly made with
Chinese prison labour. Ultimately charges for duty evasion could reach
Dollars 2bn.
All this activity is supposed to convince Congress that US-Chinese trade
problems should be addressed directly and not through cancellation of MFN.
One of Mr Bush's principal supporters on the MFN issue, Senator Max Baucus,
the Democratic chairman of the Senate trade subcommittee, has begun to hint
of defection unless the Administration agrees that the North American Free
Trade negotiations will include more on environmental issues.
Some congressmen are working hard to make MFN conditional on human rights
improvements.
There is talk of setting up a middle category of duties for China - higher
than the MFN level and lower than that accorded to the former Communist
countries.
Ms Holly Burkhalter of Human Rights Watch has proposed higher duties on
selected products, the number of which would be tied to release of political
prisoners or other human rights gains. Penalties on products could be
selected among those produced by state companies.
To end China's MFN, Congress would have to muster a two-thirds vote in both
houses. That is unlikely to happen. But this is an election year, and the
Democrats will not miss one more opportunity to portray Mr Bush as a wimp on
China.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Survey of China (4): A more relaxed grip on the reins - The
Economy / The imbalances underlying the economy will not allow it to grow
healthily for long unless comprehensive reform is taken further
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China's economy has an alarming propensity to boom and then bust. Twice in
the 1980s, the brakes had to be slammed on its rapid growth because of
dangerous inflationary pressures. The latest risk is that overheating will
again rapidly recur.
In China's typical cycle, the growth period sees rapid expansion of credit,
money supply, investment and consumption, and is followed by tighter control
of credit, investment and prices. However, this quickly creates budgetary
pressures, because of chronically loss-making state industries, and
unemployment. So the cycle is repeated.
The tendency for severe cyclical swings is inextricably linked with
pressures caused by economic reform. The transition from a planned to a
market economy is difficult, and Chinese reformers are anxious to avoid the
chaos which has occurred in the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe.
The slowdown in economic reform, though often identified with the political
crackdown on pro-democracy elements after the Tiananmen Square massacre in
1989, began at the end of 1988 as inflation approached 20 per cent even
though prices for many leading goods remained controlled.
A period of austerity reduced the inflation rate to 2 per cent in 1990, and
the economic growth rate to just over 3 per cent compared with the 10 per
cent annual average for the 1980s.
The reins have been steadily relaxed since then. However, Chinese economists
are worried that large pent-up enthusiasm for reform around the country has
been let loose this year by Deng Xiaoping, China's paramount leader. Mr
Deng's endorsement of the economic progress made in the south, especially in
Guangdong, has inspired provincial officials elsewhere to move faster on
reforms.
As part of the reform process, which has been under way for 13 years,
provinces have far greater autonomy even though they must still apply to
Beijing for approval of significant projects and they still depend on the
central planners to approve, for example, new electricity capacity.
Professor He Jianzhang, director of the institute of economics in the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, says: 'We have some concern
about overheating of the economy in the provinces. The provinces are
focusing on taking big steps forward despite their different conditions and
circumstances.'
Prof He says that some of the inland and remote provinces will have to
accept slower growth rates because they lack the infrastructure to support
rapid growth. 'We believe that the economic growth rate should be conducive
to the overall improvement of economic efficiency.'
Introducing better macroeconomic control while at the same time freeing up
the economy will be the greatest challenge for China's planners in the
coming years.
An attempt to avoid the cyclical swings might, for example, begin with
changes in the way in which credit is allocated. Currently, banks operate
with quantitative credit controls set by the central government. The role of
interest rates in the granting of credit remains limited.
However, giving a greater role to interest rates would involve substantial
reform of the banks, which still carry out a large amount of state-directed
lending to loss-making industries. Secondly, it would have a significant
effect on borrowers, since loss-making enterprises would face higher cost of
credit which they would be unlikely to be able to afford. This, in turn,
would increase the urgency of industrial, price and social reforms.
Macroeconomic control is made more complex by the rapid growth of new
enterprises - private sector industry and rural enterprises which have been
developing rapidly and which operate on more commercial lines than state
industries. Both suffered severely in the slowdown of 1989 and 1990, whereas
inefficient state industries, which still account for about half China's
industrial production, retained the protection of government subsidies,
fuelling the budget deficit.
There are signs of greater discipline. Dou Jianzhong, executive
vice-president of CITIC Industrial Bank, says that in the face of fears
about renewed overheating: 'Bankers are reminding themselves to keep a clear
mind, and not to do what they are told'.
In a normal market environment where banks had greater freedom (CITIC
Industrial Bank, for example, is not allowed to make long-term loans to back
industrial investment), they would be happily looking forward to the next
few years' business.
Economic growth is expected to be healthy. The Asian Development Bank,
forecasting before the effects of Mr Deng's pronouncements became clear,
projected growth in 1992 and 1993 just exceeding last year's 7 per cent.
Industrial production was forecast to grow 15 per cent this year, compared
with 14 per cent in 1991. These predictions mask big disparities between
different regions of the country, since growth is particularly concentrated
in the south.
Consumption spending is expected to accelerate as a result of rising urban
incomes, and investment will rise because of heavy spending on
infrastructural development.
However, the budget deficit will remain large, and inflation in some areas
is probably much higher than the official figure - consumer prices
officially rose 3 per cent last year and the ADB projects them to increase 7
per cent in 1992.
Unemployment is heavily understated by official figures, since state
industries keep unneeded workers on the payroll. However, with a growing
proportion of the labour force outside the state sector and more vulnerable
to cyclical swings, it will increasingly be a problem the government cannot
ignore. Reforms of state industries will inevitably involve job losses.
China's trade position is expected to remain healthy, even though imports
are likely to rise because of higher consumption and investment spending and
relaxation of import controls.
Following the push towards economic reform this year, the flow of foreign
investment, especially into the south, is likely to remain strong in the
absence of political upsets.
However, the imbalances underlying the economy will not allow it to grow
healthily for long unless comprehensive economic reform is taken further.
Price controls, subsidies and other protections necessary to maintain a
grossly inefficient public sector will increasingly be incompatible with
development of a strong market-oriented economy. This could spell political
problems, because the economic strength is concentrated in the south and the
weakness in the north.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Survey of China (3): Resisting new world order - Foreign
relations: trade takes over the driving seat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE collapse of the Soviet Union and China's desire to modernise its economy
are the two main determinants governing the country's external relations.
The former robbed it of the opportunity to engage in power politics by
playing the US off against the Soviet Union, with whom it had just
normalised relations. The desire to modernise has meant that ideology has
taken second place to trade-based relationships - a policy no better
demonstrated than in China's policy towards the Korean peninsula.
The aim of China's foreign policy today is to ensure the stability of its
borders - especially those with central Asian countries of the former Soviet
Union, the Korean peninsula and Indo China - and to resist president Bush's
new world order, which Beijing sees as nothing more than a US grab for
global hegemony, under the rubric of non-interference in other countries'
domestic affairs.
In prosecuting this policy, the past year has seen some notable failures, as
well as successes, for Chinese foreign policy.
In July last year, Mr Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the Communist Party,
visited Mr Mikhail Gorbachev in Moscow, the first visit of a Chinese party
leader since Mao went there in 1957. The restoration of party-to-party
relations in 1989 had promised big things for China, especially concerning
the transfer of sophisticated Soviet military technology, but this was
dashed in the aftermath of August last year.
The disintegration of the Soviet Union, the end game of which was the
attempted coup against Mr Gorbachev, was wholly unanticipated by Beijing.
China moved quickly to recognise the Yanayev junta only to see it crumble
after three days of chaos in Moscow's streets.
Today, senior Chinese officials are scathing about Mr Gorbachev. According
to Mr Jiang En Zhu, a vice-foreign minister: 'The disintegration of the
Soviet Union represented a failure of their domestic and foreign policies.'
He went on to enumerate how the Soviet Union had engaged in rivalry with the
US and had failed to improve the lot of its people. 'Since 1980 China's
gross national product has grown by an average of 9.6 per cent a year; the
people's life has been improved,' he says.
Since its initial stumble, Beijing has regained its composure and moved to
establish diplomatic relations with members of the Commonwealth of
Independent States. A succession of latter-day central Asian potentates have
travelled to Beijing over the past six months to sign treaties of friendship
and commerce. According to western diplomats a vigorous trade is being
conducted across China's northern boarder.
On the Korean peninsula, China has been a force for stability. It has deftly
managed its relationship with Pyongyang while deepening its relations with
Seoul. It sponsored a divided Korea's entry into the United Nations and has
sought to curb North Korea's nuclear ambitions.
Kim Il Sung, the North Korean dictator, visited Beijing last October hoping
to secure economic aid. Mr Kim tried to play the Confucian card; in a replay
of Korea's traditional relationship to the Middle Kingdom, Mr Kim
characterised China as the elder brother to the younger North Korea. The
Chinese took him instead on a tour of foreign joint-venture companies and
told him to modernise his economy.
Meanwhile, trade between China and South Korea is growing strongly and last
year totalled Dollars 5.7bn on a bilateral basis. In north-eastern China,
mainly Shandong province, South Korean companies have set up more than 130
joint ventures with an aggregate investment in excess of Dollars 120m.
The Chinese embrace of South Korea is mirrored more widely in its growing
relations with south-east Asia. Diplomatic relations have been established
with Indonesia and Singapore - to where Yang Shangkun, China's president,
paid a visit earlier this year. Relations have been repaired with Vietnam,
although they remain subject to dispute over the Spratly Islands, and
Cambodia.
If central, north and south-east Asia represent a relative triumph for
China's foreign policy then Europe and North America remain relative
failures. The events of the June 4, 1989, Tiananmen massacre, still cast an
unhelpful shadow over China's relations with the developed world.
There is a widespread view in the West that the Chinese government is out of
step with the march of history; that it is a regime living on borrowed time.
When Li Peng, China's prime minister, visited Europe and the UN earlier this
year, the mainland Chinese press was full of reports of deals done with
industrialists; no mention was made of the pressure he came under about
China's record on human rights or the opprobrium with which he is held.
China's relations with the US have been particularly tense since Tiananmen.
The US is the only world power capable of effecting change in China. US
success has been weak on the political front but considerable in trade
matters where it holds the whip hand, in the form of its annual renewal of
most favoured nation status, MFN.
China acceded to US demands over intellectual property and copyright; it now
seems likely to do so again about US demands for greater transparency in
goods and services trade. US pressure has been successful in getting China
to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the US-led Missile
Technology Control Regime, which seeks to control the export of missiles
with a range greater than 300 kilometres.
However, Mr David Shambaugh, of London's School of Oriental and African
Studies, observed*: 'The American missionary impulse to convert China is
once again shaping the evolution of the relationship . . . US-China
relations, which have historically followed a love-hate cycle, are likely to
get worse before they get better.'
Relations with Britain are dominated by Hong Kong. They have been slow to
thaw from the post-Tiananmen freeze. Britain's appointment of a leading
politician to the governorship may pose another set of problems for China as
it seeks to regain the colony with as little of the baggage of western
liberalism as possible.
Mr Christopher Patten will want to leave his stamp on the colony. He is
expected to be predisposed to listen to calls for greater democracy. Whether
he can accede to them is a different question. But one thing does seem
certain. In Mr Patten, Hong Kong will have an able advocate and China a more
sophisticated adversary than they have been used to for a long time.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Survey of China (2): Split over speed of reform - Politics /
The diminutive figure of Mr Deng Xiaoping towers over orthodox political
debate. He is the only one of the octogenarian leadership with the
intellectual vigour and personal clout able to exercise a decisive influence
on events in China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Any discussion of politics must take into account three facts of life
concerning the Chinese polity.
Firstly, the Communist Party of China has abandoned Marxism, though not
Leninism. The party now stands for staying in power, above all else. But
communist egalitarianism and central planning, which made the country poor,
has given way to tolerance of inequality and markets, which might make it
rich.
Secondly, political life is still dominated by a clique of elderly
revolutionaries, the primus inter pares of whom is Deng Xiaoping, 87. Mr
Deng's aim is to ensure that China's door remains open to foreign economic
development, though not ideas. Many of the rest appear to stand for little
more than safeguarding the future of their children and followers.
Thirdly, and crucially, the Chinese leadership has not devised an
institutional structure for the transfer of power from one generation to the
next. In an age when Chinese leaders have repudiated assassination as a
political instrument, politics at the very top is as much about correctness
or deviation in policy as it is about brokering compromises and forging
consensus between competing interests.
It is against this background that events in 1992, both past and
forthcoming, have to be set. The two key ones are Mr Deng's trip to the
southern province of Guangdong at the beginning of the year, and the 14th
Congress of the Communist Party due to be held in the last quarter of this
year.
The diminutive figure of Mr Deng towers over orthodox political debate in
China. He is architect of the country's economic reforms over the past 13
years and is the only one of the octogenarian leadership with the
intellectual vigour and personal clout able to exercise a decisive influence
on events in China.
That Mr Deng can still exercise this power underlines the essentially feudal
nature of Chinese politics as he holds no formal position in either the
government or, more importantly, the Communist Party. But Mr Deng's
influence and power should not be overstated; he is not a latter-day
absolute monarch whose writ runs unlimited.
His trip to the south went unreported in China's media for nearly two
months. His personal intervention - a rare attendance at a politburo meeting
 -was needed to get the working leadership's endorsement of his views after
an intense rearguard action was fought by opponents mainly located in the
party's propaganda and culture bureaucracies.
His personal testament - released to the party as Central Committee Document
Number 2 at the beginning of March - had to be censored before its release
because it contained criticisms of senior party officials. And he had to
court the military's approval.
The form, if not all the content, of Mr Deng's thought has won broad
support. Any visitor to provincial China cannot but be impressed by the lift
Mr Deng's sojourn to the south has given Chinese officials who are charged
with administering local economies and local interests. It is no coincidence
either that his biggest supporters in Beijing are those officials who have
come to the leadership via senior positions in the provinces.
The consensus which appears to be taking shape nationally is one which
supports economic reform and further foreign engagement. Few party officials
would disagree with the proposition that growth is good. They know that
rising prosperity is popular with the Chinese people; most probably agree
with Mr Deng that salvation lies only in going forward, not back. As Deng
noted in Document 2: 'The people are pleased and the world has been
astonished' with China's development over the past decade.
Where disagreement exists is on the speed of reform and economic growth and
the role of the centre versus the provinces. This came to the fore during
the meeting of the National People's Congress in March when prime minister
Li Peng's work report was amended 150 times - a public humiliation without
recent precedent in Chinese politics. But Mr Li survived this humiliation;
importantly his target rate of growth for the Chinese economy of 6 per cent
was left unamended.
However, the debate over the growth rate and centre versus province is
becoming more academic as each day passes. Beijing has been singularly
unsuccessful in developing instruments of macroeconomic control while the
provinces are learning well the ancient lessons of Chinese politics: they
mouth the line but go their own way. Reform measures on the agenda, such as
those planned for state enterprises and social welfare, suggest a further
weakening of central control.
What is clear from the current debate is that political reform is not on the
agenda. As one western diplomat said, concerning Document 2: 'It emphasised
(Deng's) overriding concern for social order and economic reform. It gave no
sign of hope of any liberalisation in the political sphere. Deng looks to
the model of development in South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan; he doesn't
believe that economic reform has to be accompanied by political reform.'
As Mr Deng approaches the end of his life his greatest failure has been his
inability either to devise a structure for power transfer or, more
traditionally, to anoint a successor. He failed with the late Hu Yaobang and
the disgraced Zhao Ziyang, and he shows little enthusiasm for his third
choice, Jiang Zemin, the general secretary of the party.
The 14th congress of the party is due to be held later in the year.
Congresses occur every five years and are important events in the life of
the party. A new central committee and politburo are selected - two of the
most powerful institutions in the country.
If Mr Deng's southern tour was about putting new vigour into the economic
reform debate it was also about the leadership. As he has said: 'A correct
political line has to be underwritten by a correct organisational line.'
Determining the organisation is something the communist party is currently
engaged in. Party committees all over the country are selecting delegates to
provincial assemblies which, in turn, will select representatives to the
congress.
The 14th congress is the last one in which the gerontocracy can play a large
role, assuming no significant deaths before the end of the year. The
leadership that is selected will have to take China to the next, more
difficult, stage of reform.
Observers in Beijing, both foreign and local, believe that the congress may
well remove Mr Li from the prime ministership, though not from the
leadership.
It is felt that Mr Li is not wholeheartedly behind the economic reform
movement, that his heart really lies in central planning. Rumoured
successors include Zhu Rongji, the industry minister and Zou Jiahua, head of
the state planning commission.
Mr Zhu appears to be of the liberal/reformist stripe and is well connected
with Jiang Zemin whom he succeeded as mayor of Shanghai. But Mr Zhu is seen
as possibly too reformist and the smart money in Beijing is betting on Mr
Zou, a more conservative reformer, for the premiership if Mr Li loses his
job.
As one observer of Beijing politics observed: 'I have never seen a party
congress that lived up to the advanced billing. Congresses always get
stalled on personnel issues. China is a big country with factions and
interest groups to be taken account of and it is made more complex now
because of the children.'
The children of the gerontocracy hold important provincial and national
posts and many of them are making a bid for a seat on the central committee.
The sons of veteran politicians such as Mr Deng, Chen Yun, Yang Shangkun,
Peng Zhen, the late Nie Rongzhen, and Xi Zhongxun are all making a bid for a
seat on the central committee.
Some are undoubtedly talented - such as Mr Chen who is deputy governor of
the People's Bank, China's central bank - but many have simply used their
parents' position to enrich themselves.
It will be an indication of just how feudal China still is if many of them
succeed. It will send a signal to the party and the people at large that the
way to get on in public life remains determined by the strength of your
connections, not your talent.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Survey of China (1): Future in the balance - Thirteen years
of economic reform have brought progress; society is more free and parts of
the country are much more prosperous than they were. But Alexander Nicoll
writes that more fundamental reforms need to be implemented
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
IT IS tempting to view the overt prosperity of China's deep south as an
indication that free markets and investment in private sector manufacturing
are sweeping the communist system away.
The idea appeals to the westerner because it fits in with events in the
former Soviet empire, in which communist parties and the countries they
ruled have collapsed like houses of cards. It also appeals to many Chinese
who have become, or would like to be, better off.
The orchid grower in Guangdong province, in the prosperous south of China,
has no doubts about the benefits of economic reform. 'Before the reforms of
the system, we couldn't plant orchids,' says the retired agricultural
official, still a communist party member. 'It was called capitalism, and if
you planted them, they were taken away by the government. Now you can do
things as you like.'
From his comfortable home - the orchids growing in pots on the roof fetch up
to Yn10,000 each - he looks out at a recently-built sports stadium, evidence
of the wealth that the factories springing up everywhere have brought to the
Pearl River Delta.
Such changes cannot yet, however, be taken as indicative of China's overall
direction. Thirteen years of economic reform have brought progress. Society
is more free, and parts of the country are much more prosperous than they
were. The rapid growth of industrial production and exports is also alarming
its neighbours, who have relied on attracting foreign investment to a low
cost base to fuel their own economic development.
The future remains in the balance. Far more fundamental reforms - of prices,
state industry and social welfare - need to be implemented if even the
progress made so far is to be cemented. It is not clear that the leadership
is willing to contemplate them.
The collapse of the Soviet Union has left China's communist leaders, who
crushed a pro-democracy movement in Tiananmen Square three years ago, all
the more determined to hold on to power, but divided as to the best way to
do it.
On the one hand, it has strengthened the arguments of the reformers who
believe that producing economic growth is the best way to retain authority.
On the other, it has stoked fears among more conservative leaders about the
loosening of control which is implied by reform.
The climate for economic reform has improved this year, with the symbolic
visit of Deng Xiaoping, the 87-year-old paramount leader, to Guangdong
province. Mr Deng sees economic progress as the most effective way for the
communist party to retain its hold on power. Making his first known public
appearance for more than a year, he urged a redoubling of efforts to reform.
However, his visit did not surface in the official media for nearly two
months. This revealed deep divisions within the party leadership. It also
demonstrated that even in relatively open Guangzhou and in the Shenzhen
special economic zone across the border from Hong Kong, the party's hold is
such that a significant event of this nature could occur and yet pass
unreported for some time.
Nevertheless, his exhortations have given a fillip to reform-minded
officials all over China. Each province is pushing ahead with its own plans
and projects, and Beijing is being swamped with applications to set up
special zones, give tax exemptions, and establish stock markets.
Mr Deng set a target for Guangdong to become a new dragon or newly
industrialising economy within 20 years. Its economy is becoming
increasingly intertwined with those of Hong Kong and Taiwan, providers of
capital and, potentially, of technological and management skills. Every
other province would like to attract foreign investment just like Guangdong.
Economic reform has, indeed, brought considerable benefits, easily visible
in the shops and on the streets in many areas of the country. But in most
respects, the progress made so far - though significant in a country as
large as China - represents the easy part.
Guangdong is prosperous because investment from Hong Kong and elsewhere has
been pouring in to take advantage of cheap labour. Industrial production
rose 27 per cent last year in spite of sluggish export markets. To advance,
southern China needs better legal, social and physical infrastructure, and
the transfer of technology and management skills.
Chinese agriculture is basically a private sector activity, with virtually
all farmers having individual responsibility for leased plots. Initially,
this brought a big rise in production, which has levelled off since the late
1980s. Agriculture needs big investment to improve its production and yield.
Greater efficiency in agriculture has produced a large labour surplus -
officials say the figure could reach 200m people in the 1990s. Already 93m
of them have been absorbed in rural and township enterprises - light
industrial ventures run on commercial lines - which have given a substantial
lift to industrial production and exports. They fulfil other aims: narrowing
the rural/urban income gap; reducing the flow of redundant farm workers into
cities; and spreading a wider net to catch foreign investment.
But rural enterprises will need proper management, marketing and
technological skills if their role in the economy is to continue to grow.
All these more progressive areas - coastal industry, agriculture and rural
enterprises - need a healthy economic and political backdrop. In spite of
the renewed commitment to reform, this must be in doubt.
China's economy during the 1980s saw bursts of growth triggered by reforms,
creating inflationary pressures which were met by tough austerity measures.
The effects of restraint were felt especially severely by the new, dynamic
areas: private and rural enterprise.
With every province now again going for growth, there is a substantial risk
that the same go/stop cycle will recur. China needs smoother macroeconomic
control.
In part, this simply reflects the enormous challenges involved in changing
the direction of a centrally planned economy. Reform around the edges of the
socialist system creates intense pressures within it, particularly for price
reform. Liberation of prices (including interest rates) brings inflation and
political problems, as well as further disrupting grossly inefficient
state-owned industries.
Because of the growth of the private and rural sectors, state industries
represent a much smaller proportion of the economy than they did before
reform. But they are still bleeding the economy dry.
There have been moves to free prices and to make managers take more
responsibility. But there is no system for them to take responsibility for
losses, and in any case they can often do nothing to prevent structural
losses caused by fixed prices.
It is difficult for them to increase efficiency by reducing their
workforces, because they provide housing, medical care and education to
their employees and their families - the so-called iron rice bowl - though
increasingly, workers are being put on fixed-term contracts rather than
receiving lifelong benefits.
In addition to full-scale price reform and a new social welfare system -
both large tasks - state industries need an infusion of management skills, a
slashing of the bureaucracy which governs them, new legal infrastrucuture
and proper accounting.
For such reforms to be tackled, a high degree of political will is
necessary. In spite of the rhetoric of the leaders, and the enthusiasm of
the officials charged with planning such changes, proof is awaited that the
will exists.
China is still ruled by veterans who have spanned at least 50 years of
fighting for and maintaining communist control. They are united by two
things - their advanced age and their determination to retain control. They
have not developed any institutional means for power to be passed on. Mr
Deng remains the leader though he holds no official posts, but his authority
is far from unchallenged. The future political and economic shape of China
depends to a large extent on who dies first and who subsequently wins the
battle for power.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Survey of Belgium 92 (7): City of Culture for 1993 - Antwerp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS a paradox of European culture that the stuffiest cities play host to
the most radical artists: Vienna, Salzburg and Edinburgh, all famously
bourgeois, woo the enfants terribles of the European avant-garde for
festivals each year.
Antwerp, which has just launched its programme as European City of Culture
for 1993, slots naturally into this set. A deeply conservative, Roman
Catholic, Flemish city, where the right-wing Vlaamse Blok scored well at
last November's election, its long-standing role as a magnet for innovative
artists makes it Belgium's obvious choice as cultural capital.
Yet Antwerp joins Glasgow as the only two in the series of Europe's cultural
capitals - Florence, Paris, Berlin, etc. - not known as an international
arts centre.
Glasgow in 1990 responded with a new, cleaned-up image and a programme
including sports and popular events. Antwerp - on a budget of BF900m, less
than a third of Glasgow's - has a much tighter, arts-orientated schedule
which builds on the tradition of artistic excellence which already makes it
a powerhouse of Flemish culture. Like Glasgow, it has more to prove and more
to gain from its year in the arts limelight, than the other cities.
Visit Antwerp, and the paradox of the radical and the traditional is
everywhere. More than 300 Madonnas are sculpted into niches on the outside
of the stepped, gabled houses of the 17th century merchants who made Antwerp
rich. Now the lugubrious Virgins brood warily over the pazzazz of
developments such as the old docks, about to become Antwerp's Covent
Garden-style piazza and home to Eurosail '93, a mooring of tall ships from
round the world.
At the new Dock's Cafe, a former warehouse on the banks of the River
Scheldt, city slickers queue nightly for cocktails. Seconds away, the
remnant of the old port life, a street of red-lit windows where negro
prostitutes advertise their wares, struggles for survival.
As a young man, Simenon, Belgium's most famous writer, once gave his most
precious possession, a silver watch, for 20 minutes with one of them.
The growth of high-tech industry in Flanders, and especially the expansion
of Antwerp's and Rotterdam's docks into western Europe's two leading ports -
both slick, stream-lined post-modern affairs - has created a milieu spawning
experimental, up-to-the-minute Flemish art.
Ask any Belgian to name national artists of international standing, and the
list will be Flemish: choreographers Wim Wanderkeybus or Anna Theresa de
Keersmaeker and the 'Rosas' group with the kinetic dazzle and compressed
energy of their violent new dance forms, both recent guests in England;
directors Jan Fabre or Jan Lauwers with multi-tongued music-drama like
'Sweet Temptations' or 'Invictos', an Andalusian dance of death based on
Hemingway which plays in Dutch, Spanish, English or German according to its
audience. All these have criss-crossed Europe this year, but at home too,
along with trendy visitors such as Vienna's Claus Peymann, Tadeusz Kantor's
Polish troupe and the American musical 'Josephine' about the life of
Josephine Baker, which began its European tour in Rotterdam and Antwerp,
they were the biggest hits of this season. They illustrate a distinction
between Flemish and Walloon cultural self-images: where Brussels, the
outstanding Monnaie Opera excepted, languishes as a Francophone Cinderella
too close to the rigorous chic of Paris to thrive as an independent artistic
metropolis, Antwerp joins Rotterdam and Amsterdam in a snazzy nexus of
confidant Flemish-Dutch cities which see themselves as a heartland of North
European culture.
It is the European connection that Eric Antonius, director of the festival
Antwerp 93, is stressing in his strategy for the city's role as the first
cultural capital in a Europe without frontiers.
'It is typical of Europeans', says Mr Antonius, 'that they are continually
taking a close, critical look at themselves and at the world in which they
are trying to survive. They ask questions, hesitate, often live at variance
with themselves and dare to brush aside their achievements so as to start
all over again'.
His European theatre programme, 'The Questioner' (De Vragestellar) will
reopen the Bourla Theatre, the monumental late-classical building on the
Komedieplaats which has stood empty since it was declared a fire hazard in
1980.
Oedipus, Hamlet, Orfeo, Don Juan, Faust and other self-pondering archetypes
of European drama will tread its boards in 1993 along with those giants of
modern angst, Peter Handke ('The Question Game'), Bernard-Marie Koltes, with
a roll-call of down-and-out and mass-murderer heroes, and Thomas Bernhard,
who distils existential agony into drama and even comedy like no one else.
It's an exciting programme but there's an unmistakeable whiff of the
Teutonic heavyweight about it; had Brussels hosted such a festival, French
legerete would as distinctly have been the name of the game. But Antwerp 93
undoubtedly has a finger on the pulse of contemporary theatre.
In the other performing arts, the programmes are also serious and
innovative. The modish arts complex De Singel will collaborate with the
Flemish Opera, for example, on the first Festival of Contemporary Opera,
directed by Jan Fabre and including several Flemish composers or
theatre-makers.
'I am an international artist but first I am a Flemish artist', says Jan
Lauwers, who will direct Walter Hus's opera 'Orfeo'. Antwerp 93 will be a
showcase for what there is in Flemish culture beyond Rubens, Brueghel,
waffles and lace. Anyone who has not visited the city for some years will be
surprised. The messy frontage of the turn-of-the-century Centraal Station,
one of the great railway cathedrals of European station architecture, will
be restored to its former lustre for 1993. The wall which has for years
divided Antwerp Cathedral will go, making the Cathedral of Our Lady again
the largest Gothic church in the Netherlands. And the old waterfront will be
a jazzed-up catwalk of restaurants for style-spotters.
In industrial Antwerp early this century, the saying used to go: 'Antwerp
owes the Scheldt to God and the rest to the Scheldt'. The port is still the
city's life-blood, but the old docks should attract a fleet of Euro-yachts
and a crowd of Euro-visitors, and will be the nerve-centre of the new
tourist Antwerp too.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Survey of Belgium 92 (8): Channel tunnel challenge looms
large - Ostend and Zeebrugge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINCE the 12th century, Bruges has faced up to almost every challenge the
sea and seafarers can throw at a port.
Its harbour silted up in the 15th century and it lost its pre-eminence as a
maritime, commercial and financial centre to Antwerp and Amsterdam.
Then the new port of Zeebrugge - inaugurated in 1907 - suffered a blow to
its trade in the late 1970s when Texaco closed down its Ghent oil refinery,
and a blow to its image a few years later when the Herald of Free Enterprise
ferry tragically capsized just outside the harbour.
Having survived such shocks, it is hardly surprising that Mr Walter Falleyn
of the Bruges-Zeebrugge Port Authority (MBZ) is philosophical about the
imminent challenge of the Channel tunnel:
'If they play fair - that is, if Eurotunnel isn't subsidised in any way - we
think they won't be able to compete with the tariffs that the ferries can
offer.
'What ics more, we believe passengers will prefer the ships to the tunnel.'
Zeebrugge and Ostend, its Channel neighbour, are nonetheless bracing
themselves for the competition. Zeebrugge has installed two new ferry berths
to cope with jumbo-ferries and is in the process of constructing a new
distribution park to help enhance its reputation as a freight terminal.
Ostend, meanwhile, has begun its own more modest refurbishment and
improvement programme, investing in a new jumbo-ferry terminal, a new lock,
quay walls and a larger turning space for freight vessels.
'It's a new start for the port of Ostend because we haven't had much
investment before now,' says Captain Rafael Ghys who is the master in charge
of the city harbour.
Competition between the two ports is a reality but it is not cut-throat. 'We
try to keep out of each others' waters,' explains Mr Falleyn. In fact,
Ostend and Zeebrugge are competing in subtly different markets, a point
underlined by P&amp;O's recent decision to restrict its Dover-Zeebrugge service
to freight.
The P&amp;O flag still flies over the Felixstowe-Zeebrugge passenger-freight
service, and on the Ostend-Dover passenger-freight route operated by RMT,
the Belgian state shipping line.
But according to Mr Falleyn, Zeebrugge is not greatly worried about the loss
of some passenger traffic.
Indeed, the port seems happy with the other niche passenger market it has
built up over 20 years with North Sea Ferries - which sails overnight to and
from Hull in the north-east of England.
It is freight, however, which remains Zeebrugge's great strength and income
from cargo helps the regionally-owned port authority pay for continuing
improvements.
In 1991, the port loaded and unloaded some 30.9m tonnes of cargo, 233,111
containers, 192,635 new cars and 748,314 lorries. Zeebrugge's growth slowed
slightly last year, but on average cargo traffic has been expanding at 14
per cent annually for the past eight years.
More than half that cargo is European, but Zeebrugge is also trying to push
itself as an attractive destination for shipping companies further east.
An MBZ team recently visited South Korea in an attempt to woo container and
car manufacturers. 'We think there are a lot of things coming up in the east
 -think of China, for example - and we don't want to miss the boat,' says Mr
Falleyn.
Ostend, with a higher proportion of passenger business, will have more
riding on competition with the Channel tunnel, come 1994. Its main assets
will be the ferries and jetfoils of RMT-P&amp;O and Sally Line, which operates
out of Ramsgate in Kent.
The port's freight traffic is more modest than Zeebrugge's and has been
declining since the early 1980s.
The city and state harbours handled some 5.89m tonnes of cargo last year,
compared with 8.83m tonnes in 1981.
On the other hand, some 1.88m passengers passed through the port, against
Zeebrugge's 1.67m.
But Mr Eric De Praetere, RMT's general manager, says the statistics do not
paint an entirely accurate picture because RMT and P&amp;O share the income from
cross-Channel freight traffic whether it goes to Ostend or Zeebrugge.
'We are really aiming for a mixture of traffic,' he says.
Indeed, most of the increased capacity on the new jumbo-ferry introduced by
RMT on the Dover-Ostend route last month is earmarked for freight trucks,
although it will also carry 1,200 passengers in much greater luxury than
they are used to on Channel crossings.
Ostend's future as a passenger port depends to a large extent on maintaining
its position in the north European rail network, with convenient connections
through to Brussels, Cologne and beyond, which accounts for more than a
quarter of its passenger traffic.
That position is likely to be shaken once a dedicated express service opens
between Brussels and the tunnel.
'I've already had a lot of discussions with the continental railway
administrations and I don't believe they intend to have the TGV as the only
option,' says Mr De Praetere.
He believes, like his Zeebrugge counterparts, that the ferries will compete
on price if nothing else - provided P&amp;O can also convince British Rail that
it should maintain its existing rail services to the Dover ferries.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Survey of Belgium 92 (9): Wagons-Lits is a test case -
Banking and finance commission
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BELGIAN corporate life has never really rediscovered the excitement of 1988,
when Carlo De Benedetti launched his audacious but unsuccessful hostile bid
for Societe Generale de Belgique, the country's largest holding company.
That may be a disappointment to Brussels brokers, but it is a cause of some
satisfaction to Jean-Louis Duplat, chairman of Belgium's bid watchdog, the
banking and finance commission.
Mr Duplat - responsible for vetting takeover documents and listing
particulars under 1989 takeover legislation - would like to see the sluggish
Brussels bourse livened up, but only by legitimate and fair means.
The 1989 legislation has made it impossible for wily predators such as De
Benedetti to creep up on their targets. Stakes of 5 per cent or more have to
be declared - Mr De Benedetti built up more than 15 per cent before
revealing his plans - and all shareholders are supposed to be informed
equally of a large investor's intentions. 'People now know what they can do
and what they must not do,' says Mr Duplat.
Unfortunately, not everybody agrees with him. The stake declaration demands
seem to be working well, with many large companies choosing to enforce
tougher disclosure requirements at the 3 per cent level. But there has been
much criticism of the banking commission over its interpretation of the law
on the launching of a full takeover bid.
Unlike the British takeover code, or the draft EC takeover directive,
Belgium has no set threshold above which a bid must be launched. Instead, a
bid is triggered if a premium is paid for control of a company. The problem
lies in defining 'control'.
Attention has focused on Wagons-Lits, the Franco-Belgian tourism group which
has just been taken over by Accor, the French hotels company, in
collaboration with Societe Generale de Belgique. Minority shareholders claim
the Accor offer document reveals that control of Wagons-Lits actually
changed hands when La Generale and Accor bought a joint stake in the group
at a much higher price in 1990. They say the full bid should have been
launched at the higher price and have taken Accor to court to argue the
case. A ruling is expected this month and could have significant
implications for minority shareholders in Belgium and beyond.
The banking commission is at the centre of the row, mainly because Accor and
La Generale have defended themselves by pointing out that the commission
approved both the original purchase and their bid.
Mr Duplat will not comment, except to say that joint control is not the same
as having a 'common attitude' to the management of a company and to point
out that the commission's action has been fully explained - as required
under the law - in its annual report.
Whichever way the case goes, market analysts question whether the commission
is equipped to carry out the job it is supposed to do.
Mr Duplat argues that the increase in 'quality' staff - from 150 four years
ago to about 230 now - is sufficient to cope with the added burden of
supervision. 'We want to be able to intervene efficiently at the right
moment in serious cases, but not to get mixed up with bureaucracy, which
helps nobody,' he says.
The commission has also been criticised for not having any real weapons at
its disposal. In really serious cases, where the commission's published
'opinion' is ignored, the watchdog can only resort to the courts.
Mr Duplat, on the other hand, does not want the banking commission to become
a strong-armed Belgian Securities and Exchange Commission: 'I don't think it
would be useful to transform ourselves into a super-gendarmerie, independent
of the courts,' he says.
Ironically, however, it will be the court's decision on the Wagons-Lits case
which will decide how seriously the commission is taken by its clients in
future.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Survey of Belgium 92 (5): Transition proves difficult - Dick
Leonard examines moves towards devolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DICK LEONARD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FOR its first 150 years
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
between 1830 and 1980 - Belgium was perhaps the most over-centralised state
in Europe. It was not considered a great success, at least during the latter
part of this period. Now, Belgium is well on the way to becoming the most
decentralised, although it is not there yet.
The transition is proving difficult and it is far from certain that the
process will be completed within the next couple of years, as the present
government intends.
The centralised system worked well enough in the 19th century, but only on
the basis of a less-than-democratic constitution and the understanding that
power would be monopolised by the French-speaking minority.
The coming of universal suffrage for men in 1918 - women got the vote only
30 years later - meant that it was only a matter of time before the
Dutch-speakers, who now make up 57 per cent of the population, would gain
the upper hand.
Thereafter, a large part of Belgian politics, and an even greater share of
the emotional commitment, was devoted to pursuing the interests of the two
language groups, with an astonishing array of checks and balances being
built into the Belgian constitution.
It was to little avail. The Dutch-speaking majority was too conscious of
past slights to accept with good grace that, with growing prosperity in
Flanders, they were now the top dogs both economically and politically - the
last 11 governments have all been headed by Dutch-speakers - and could
afford to be magnanimous. The French-speakers were only too aware of their
minority status, and tended to be over-defensive.
Mr Wilfried Martens, who ceased to be prime minster after 12 years last
March, was the first senior Belgian politician to conclude that if the two
language groups could not happily collaborate to run a centralised state,
each of them should be left to run their own affairs, leaving only a minimal
competence to the national government.
He was the principal author of the Egmont Pact of 1977, which foresaw the
creation of three self-governing regions of Flanders, Wallonia and Brussels.
Unfortunately, the pact was never implemented and it was left to Mr Martens
to introduce a more limited scheme of devolution when he became prime
minister in 1979.
This scheme, which came into effect in 1980, established only two regions -
Flanders and Wallonia, leaving Brussels under central control. It also
established three language communities, including one for the tiny
German-speaking minority in eastern Belgium.
The regions were given a long list of economic and social responsibilities,
including planning, the environment, housing, water policy, the economy,
energy, employment and supervision of local government.
The language communities were endowed with a narrower range of
responsibilities, comprising cultural affairs - language matters, museums,
libraries, radio and television, youth policy, sport, tourism, adult
education and scientific research - and personal health and welfare
services.
Each region and community was granted limited taxation powers and an
indirectly-elected assembly. The Dutch-speaking community and the Flemish
region voted immediately to combine, so that one Flemish assembly and one
executive council was responsible for the powers granted to both
authorities.
No such amalgamation occurred on the French-speaking side, so that both
Wallonia and the French-speaking community retained their separate
identities.
This experiment in partial devolution led to a marked lessening in tension
between the two main language groups but failed to remove all the sources of
conflict between them.
The 1987 poll was brought about by a quarrel over the mayoralty of a tiny
mixed-language commune on the Dutch border near Maastricht, known as the
Fourons (Voeren in Dutch). This was the third time in 20 years that this
commune, whose population is less than 4,500, had brought down a Belgian
government and the conviction grew that it was time to reach a final
settlement of all constitutional issues affected by the language issue.
A three-stage programme of reform was drawn up by Mr Jean-luc Dehaene in
1988, as the basis for forming a new government and it was accepted by the
leaders of all the five parties which joined the new left-centre coalition
led by Mr Martens.
The first two stages were enacted with surprising ease, securing the
necessary two-thirds parliamentary majority. These respectively dealt with
power-sharing in mixed-language communes, and with increasing the powers of
the regional and community councils,including the establishment of a third
region for Brussels, with its own directly-elected assembly. Education,
previously under national control, was transfered to the language
communities.
The third stage envisaged the replacement of the Senate with a new upper
chamber representing the regions, and the direct election of the Flemish
assembly and of those for Wallonia and the French-speaking community.
Although the overwhelming majority of parliamentarians supported these
changes in principle, it proved impossible to get agreement on the details.
This is still the position under the new Dehaene government, which lacks a
two-thirds majority although it will need this level of support to get the
changes through.
The biggest difficulty is over whether French speakers living in Flanders
(of whom there are a large number) should have the right to vote in
elections for the French-speaking community. Absolutely, say the Walloons.
Absolutely not, say the Flemings.
Mr Dehaene has set up a standing conference consisting of himself and four
members from each of 10 parties represented in the national parliament to
seek an agreed approach. It is getting nowhere fast - the opposition parties
(in particular, the right-wing Liberals) are setting unacceptable conditions
for support.
The betting in Brussels is that Mr Dehaene will be unable to break the
deadlock and that his government will fall before the autumn. Whether or not
a new government, perhaps expanded to include the Liberals to ensure a
two-thirds majority, will be any more successful, is far from clear.
What is certain is that there is no going back. Either Belgium will complete
its transition to a fully federal state or it will be stuck indefinitely at
its present, rather more than halfway, house. The days of a unified national
structure are dead and gone.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Survey of Belgium 92 (6): A year of stagnation - The
chemical industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY CLARKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS YEAR'S results reporting season was not a happy one for Belgium's
chemical companies. The Gulf war and the recession in the US and the UK, a
surge in cheap imports from eastern Europe and the re-emergence of
overcapacity in basic chemicals production all took their toll in 1991.
It was the first real year of stagnation in the chemicals sector after a
long period of growth.
Solvay SA, the kingdom's second-biggest company and Belgium's largest
chemicals company, saw its profits slide 22 per cent. The company's plastics
business - especially its cyclical products such as polyvinyl chloride, used
in a plethora of industrial applications - fared worse and was largely
blamed for the poor results.
Tessenderlo Chemie, a producer of mainly basic chemicals and therefore the
most dependent on cyclical products of the large Belgian companies,
witnessed a 32 per cent drop in net profits.
Nevertheless, despite the gloomy picture painted by annual reports, the
chemicals industry in Belgium as a whole managed to scrape a 1.7 per cent
turnover increase at BFr952bn in 1991, the Belgian Federation of Chemical
Industries (FCI) reported in May.
This compares with a drop in turnover in 1991 of 5.9 per cent from the
previous year in the UK chemicals industry and a 2.1 per cent slide in
Germany, according to the Brussels-based European Chemical Industry Council.
In addition, a massive 50 per cent jump in investment in the industry last
year helped the chemicals sector in Belgium register an increase in
employment of 2.8 per cent between 1990 and 1991, according to industry
figures.
Belgian chemicals have been cushioned to some extent from recession by their
wide product spread. 'Global results were better than elsewhere because the
industry in Belgium is very diversified,' said Mr Paul Launois, chief
economist with the FCI. Only half of the sector's business in Belgium is in
basic or bulk chemicals; the rest is divided between parachemicals,
including pharmaceuticals and chemical transformation of rubber and
plastics.'
The industry also managed to fight off some of the worst effects of the
slump by posting good results for 1991 in the pharmaceuticals sector, one of
the main growth areas. The success of the anti-allergic drug Zyrtec, now
registered in 70 countries, helped UCB, Belgium's second largest chemicals
company, to offset a 22.1 per cent profit slump in its chemicals division,
so that the company posted an overall 1 per cent profit.
Analysts expect the company's income to continue to rise a minimum of 10 per
cent a year, and a further boost is expected from the US Food and Drugs
Administration approval of Zyrtec, expected in the autumn. Sales growth is
also expected for UCB's other market leader, the memory aid Nootropil.
Solvay expects its animal and health division to expand rapidly over the
next few years. They already account for 14.3 per cent of Solvay sales. The
company plans a high level of research and development investment, currently
standing at about Dollars 200m, small acquisitions to boost its portfolio
and a string of marketing alliances such as the one reached with Upjohn last
year. Under the agreement, the US company will market Solvay's
anti-depressant Fluvoxamine in Europe. Although Fluvoxamine had been on the
market for several years it was struggling to reach its sales targets.
Because of its strategic position in Europe's industrial belt, with good sea
outlets, Belgium has long been considered by US and German companies as a
good base from which to serve the rest of Europe. The German firms
Agfa-Gevaert, Bayer and BASF and the US's Dow Chemical and Monsanto all have
subsidiaries in Belgium, the majority established since the 60s.
In turn, this has forced Belgian companies who saw their share in the
domestic market shrink as a result, to consolidate and expand their
activities abroad. BASF-Antwerpen, the wholly-owned Belgian subsidiary of
the German chemicals giant, put up a quarter of the BFr106bn ploughed into
the industry last year, making Belgium by far the favourite place for BASF's
foreign investment. A BFr6.5bn ammonia plant was opened by the company on
its 600-hectare Antwerp site in 1991. Work also began on a BFr27bn 'steam
cracker' which produces ethylene - vital for numerous production processes -
now due to become operative at the end of 1993 and only the second to be
built in Belgium.
BASF-Antwerpen is also due to put into operation this year a new ethyl
benzine and styrene plant and work has begun on a new ethylene oxide and
ethylene glycol plant.
Solvay, already the world leader in its primary business of soda ash, a
chemical used to make glass, hydrogen peroxide and high-density
polyethylene, has also plunged into a radical restructuring and acquisitions
programme in order to strengthen its position on the world market.
In March this year, the 139-year-old company dissolved a 21-year-old joint
venture with Laporte PLC of the UK, giving Solvay full ownership of the
Interox worldwide business in the hydrogen peroxide and persalts businesses.
A month later the company announced it was buying natural soda ash mines in
the US from Tenneco Inc. Analysts said the Dollars 500m paid for the mines
was steep, and the deal led to a downgrade in the company's credit ratings.
But Solvay remained undeterred.
'We have effectively bought reserves in trona (a mineral used to make soda
ash) for 100 years', said Baron Daniel Janssen, the company's chairman, when
he announced the purchase. He also said it would help strengthen the
position of the company, which carries out 75 per cent of its business
overseas, in the growing North American soda ash market as well as giving
Solvay a good base from which to launch an export drive to Latin America and
Asia.
Continuing its push overseas, Solvay also programmed Dollars 125m for
investment in a soda ash and hydrogen plant in Bernberg, eastern Germany,
returned to Solvay last year by the Treuhandenstalt, more than 50 years
after it was seized by the Nazis. The plant is set to become the company's
base in eastern Europe.
Chemical industry experts in Belgium are predicting an improvement in
business around October. But the threat of more cheap imports into Belgium
from east Europe and Saudi Arabia, the continuing existence of the
overcapacity phenomena, as well as the slowdown in the German economy -
Belgium exports three quarters of its products, a large quantity of which
goes to Germany - meant that first quarter 1992 results continued the
downward trend.
But the restructuring and investments made by some of Belgium's key players
in the sector last year should put the industry in a good position for when
the situation improves. 'It takes a while for the benefits to come upstream
with investment in the chemical industry but we expect it to do so at about
the same time as an upturn in the world economy', said Mr Launois.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Survey of Belgium 92 (4): Starting from a high base - The
economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BELGIUM should be among the very best performing economies in Europe. Within
a few weeks, when it presents its convergence programme to meet the tight
financial criteria for European economic and monetary union (Emu), it is
expected to give an earnest undertaking that it has every intention of
becoming just that.
It starts from a high base, but weighed down by public indebtedness which is
more than twice the average of its EC partners.
To take but one startling illustration, a recent study by the Cologne
Institut der Deutschen Wirtschaft shows that Belgian productivity is on
average 20 per cent better than that of Germany, the EC's leading industrial
power. Yet Belgian per capita income is 13 per cent below German average
living standards.
The two main explanations are that the government payroll has swelled to
include about a quarter of the workforce, while more and more Belgians are
retiring early - subsidised, in effect, by the exchequer.
The number of public employees has grown about two fifths since 1970, to
nearly 900,000, while private sector employment has contracted. Yet civil
servants' earnings have only risen 40 per cent in that time, or less than
half the rate of remuneration in the private sector.
A study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
of workforce participation rates for 1987, shows that in Belgium only 54 per
cent of males, and 15 per cent of females between the ages of 55 and 59 were
in work, against respective averages of 76 and 38 per cent in Germany, 81
and 54 per cent in the UK, and 74 and 37 per cent among the main OECD
economies. The state's generous facilitation of early retirement helps fuel
both the budget deficit and the debt.
Belgium's public debt is about Dollars 200bn, or 130 per cent of its gross
domestic product. Interest payments on this debt eat up nearly 11 per cent
of GDP each year, leaving about double this to meet the public sector
payroll, but only one tenth of this for public investment - about a third of
the EC average.
Just about everything else in Belgium's economy is in good working order or
better. Growth averaged about 4 per cent in 1987-90. This fell to 1.5 per
cent last year, mainly because Germany - which provides the Belgian economy
with a large part of its locomotion - started running out of its
post-unification steam. A slight pick-up in demand and investment this year
points towards gradual recovery, conservatively estimated by the central
bank at 1.6 per cent this year and 2.3 per cent next.
Inflation is creeping below 3 per cent (2.6 per cent in the first five
months this year). Wage increases, averaging 4.8 per cent so far this year,
are below German settlement levels. The current account, strongly negative
in 1975-85, has been in surplus ever since and is now averaging about 2 per
cent of GDP, and rising.
This surplus reinforces the cornerstone of Belgium's economy, the hard franc
policy it introduced in May 1990, along with a reduction of the withholding
tax on income from financial assets from 25 yo 10 per cent.
For two years, the central bank has held the franc to a narrow fluctuation
band of half a percentage point either side of the D-Mark. This is a far
tighter discipline than the 2.25 per cent band allowed the Belgian currency
within the exchange range mechanism of the EMS. In fact, the franc in the
past 18 months has been no further than 0.06 per cent out of alignment with
the EMS anchor, according to the central bank.
As a result, the narrowing of short-term interest rate differentials with
Germany has been almost total, from a 5.1 per cent gap in 1980 and a 2 per
cent premium before the hard franc policy was adopted. Indeed, Belgian
short-term rates have been dipping 0.2 per cent below German rates recently.
The premium on Belgian long-term rates has also narrowed in the past year,
from 1 per cent to just over 0.6 per cent. The difference reflects the main
area of vulnerability: Belgium's public finances.
The annual budget deficit came down from 13 per cent in 1981 to 5.6 per cent
in 1990. This implied cuts in spending - exclusive of interest payments on
the stock of debt - of 10 percentage points of GDP. But last year there was
slippage, on both the deficit (to 6.3 per cent of GDP) and debt stock, and
only this year will the public sector shortfall return to 1990 levels.
Belgium's currency and interest rates easily meet the criteria for Emu laid
down in the Maastricht treaty (which Belgium, along with its partners,
assumes will come into effect next year despite rejection by Denmark). But
it still has a lot of work to do to 'converge' its public finances towards
targets of 3 per cent for the deficit and a ratio of debt to GDP of 60 per
cent, by the end of 1996, the first possible date for the third stage of Emu
and the creation of a single currency.
Yet Mr Alfons Verplaetse, cautious governor of Belgium's central bank, is
certain his country will enter Emu in the first wave: 'I don't doubt it for
one second,' he says.
He argues that last year's deficit - primarily the result of higher
unemployment and pension payments - was quickly brought under control by the
new government of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene.
Mr Dehaene took over in March after more than 100 days of hiatus following
last November's inconclusive general election. In April, he introduced a
corrective fiscal package of savings and extra revenue which, Mr Verplaetse
says, prevented the deficit reaching 7 per cent this year. Without any
further measures, he adds, this will reduce the deficit to 5.5 per cent next
year, within hailing distance of the current EC average.
However, the hope is that the government will swiftly follow presentation of
its convergence plan with stringent budgetary measures to implement it,
possibly in August.
In theory, there would then be four years to cut back to 3 per cent, a
target which should be achievable. This is especially true given Belgian
enthusiasm for Emu and European political union.
'Maastricht has been good for Belgium; it has been useful as an alibi,' says
Mr Peter Praet, chief economist at Generale de Banque. Most officials appear
to believe that if the deficit is cut, and the debt stock is clearly coming
down, then Belgium will not be held to the 60 per cent debt-to-GDP target
stipulated by Maastricht.
But much depends on whether Mr Dehaene can keep macroeconomic policy
separate from the mired issue of constitutional reform, upon which the
future of his shaky coalition depends. A consensus on convergence is thus
urgent.
'No matter what happens with the government,' says Mr Verplaetse, 'once you
have in place the mechanisms of Maastricht nothing untoward will happen.'
When Belgium was without a government for more than three months, its
squabbling politicians must have been chagrined to learn that the franc
strengthened and interest rates fell.
But the rigorous fiscal effort required by Emu will need political will and
persistence. Furthermore, in the 1987-90 years of high growth the
authorities were able to do little more than stabilise public finances. The
size of Belgium's debt overhang makes it potentially dangerous in a
downturn, especially if Emu provokes a budget squeeze across Europe.
Belgium has potential shock-absorbers, however. Its rate of savings is
unusually high and could be drawn down if the government creates sufficient
confidence in the rigour of its convergence plan. Belgium's conservative
companies built up huge cash surpluses with each leap in profitability
during the 1980s. While much was reinvested, a great deal was kept as a
buffer rather than distributed in dividends or spent on acquisitions.
This means, Mr Praet believes, they can face with equanimity slower growth,
high interest rates and greater fiscal pressure, through the closing of tax
loopholes rather than higher tax rates.
'The major difficulty is social consensus in the public sector,' says Mr
Praet. Cutting back on the public payroll will not be easy in a time of
fast-spreading disenchantment with the traditional parties.
One possibility being canvassed is greater devolution of public spending so
that the Flemish and Walloon language communities, for example, would be
directly responsible for passing on the cost of, say, more teachers that
they assume their electors want. This superficially attractive idea would
risk making Belgium more fissiparous than it already is.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Survey of Belgium 92 (2): Bulldog tenacity needed - Andrew
Hill talks to Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgium's prime minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgium's pugnacious new prime minister, is just three
months into his government, but he has already got his teeth into the two
basic problems which cast a shadow over Belgium's future: constitutional
reform and the cleaning up of the country's public finances.
But the 51-year-old Flemish Christian Democrat will need all his bulldog
tenacity if his administration is to survive the summer and complete its
four-year term.
The government - like its prime minister - is small, but weighty. Mr Dehaene
admits it is 'un peu non-classique' by Belgian standards, with just 16
ministers (half the usual number) and a concise legislative programme. It
also moves fast: an emergency budget for 1992 was wrapped up in just three
days.
What the centre-left coalition lacks is the two-thirds parliamentary
majority necessary to carry through the next stage of constitutional reform
 -a flaw which has led doubters to conclude that it is simply a stop-gap
administration which will disintegrate as soon as it is tested on this
fundamental issue. Mr Dehaene himself warns against such short-termism.
'You have to be careful not to assume that because there are fewer pages (in
our programme) and it's less detailed, that it doesn't have much of a
long-term view. One of the challenges I'm faced with is to prove that a
government doesn't have to have a legislative Bible to function properly,'
he says.
Mr Dehaene was a loyal supporter of his long-serving predecessor, Mr
Wilfried Martens, over nearly 13 years.
Now he has graduated from the vice-premiership to the top spot, he seems
determined to do the job properly in spite of all the obstacles to efficient
government which Belgian politics throws up.
So, in the hope that a two-thirds majority will evolve, Mr Dehaene has set
in motion a 'dialogue of the communities' - Flemish- and French-speaking
politicians talking through the country's constitutional problems.
Interviewed by the Financial Times last month, the prime minister was
confident that the dialogue would not end inconclusively.
'It's wrong to say that nothing will come out of this,' he said.
'Most of the people taking part are doing so with the will to reach an
agreement.'
Almost everything else of significance that Mr Dehaene wants to do depends
on the success of the dialogue. The 1992 emergency budget measures were
mainly an attempt to patch up damage caused by economic neglect during the
long political interregnum. The 1993 budget, which should be negotiated in
the first weeks of August if all goes according to plan, is intended to
tackle the deeper-rooted problem of the budget deficit - which has to halve
from about 6 per cent to just 3 per cent of GDP by 1996 if Belgium is to
fulfil the European Community's criteria for membership of a currency union.
This, as Mr Dehaene has already made clear, will be painful, but he is
convinced that it is essential - even if the people are not.
'I recognise it's difficult for the population to understand,' he says. 'The
(economic) crisis at the beginning of the 1980s was something that everybody
felt - everyone knew someone who was unemployed and everybody realised we
had to make an effort. But because of everything that was done then, people
now have the impression they're living in a healthy economy at a previously
unknown level of well-being. According to public opinion, the state budget
is the politicians' - not the people's - business.'
Mr Dehaene says this is a burden which should be borne jointly by the people
and the politicians. He draws a parallel with the public's road safety
duties - a good analogy for Belgium, home to some of Europe's least tolerant
drivers:
'Everyone complains about road safety. Politicians can contribute to solving
the problem by making a certain number of rules. But in the end, if each
citizen sitting behind his steering wheel, inside his steel shell, thinks
that he has right on his side and that the rules were made for others and
not for him, no amount of political repression is going to solve the
problem.'
Mr Dehaene criticises individuals who 'cocoon' themselves to escape their
public duties. He says this 'deep malaise' is part of the explanation for
the anti-political reaction of voters in the Belgian elections.
At the Lisbon summit, on June 26-27, Mr Dehaene will get his first chance to
discuss that malaise with other EC leaders who have suffered a similar
electoral backlash over the past year.
For a man fascinated by domestic politics, but who has hardly dabbled in
foreign policy, this will be a new experience. Indeed, to get himself into
the swing of summit politics, Mr Dehaene has been touring some Community
capitals over the past few weeks.
Last month, before his grand tour, it was clear that there was unlikely to
be any great change in Belgium's staunch pro-European stance under Mr
Dehaene's leadership. The new prime minister wants the European Community to
be open to new candidates, but also to build on its existing strengths -
widening and deepening, to use the Euro-terminology.
'Unity in diversity should be the leitmotif of what we do during the years
to come,' he explained.
And what of Belgium itself? With its constant bickering between linguistic
communities, its institutional complexities and its fragmented politics is
it really a good example to the Community of a federal system in action?
Mr Dehaene pauses before answering. 'We're a good example of how to try to
recognise the autonomy of entities which have specific characteristics, and
aspirations to independence, lawfully and peacefully,' he replies.
'In several parts of Europe this (move to independence) is being accompanied
by conflict and deaths. What we've achieved in Belgium, without being ideal,
is a peaceful and lawful restructuring. That's created a model with a
certain complexity - but we're dealing with a complex reality.'

FT  16 JUN 92 / Survey of Belgium 92 (3): Recanting is not an option -
Profile: Charles Picque
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS the first chief minister of the Brussels region, Charles Picque is the
man who runs the capital of Europe. For exactly three years - since direct
elections in June 1989 - the 43-year-old socialist has had the difficult
task of squaring the demands of a growing international centre with the need
to preserve the 'soul' of Brussels.
Mr Picque and his government face some formidable obstacles, including an
institutional framework of mind-boggling complexity, even by the standards
of Belgian's complicated federal system of government.
The chief minister admits that simply managing the web of councils,
executives, assemblies and Flemish and francophone commissions takes up more
of his government's time than he would like, but he calls it 'le miracle
bruxellois' that the system works at all.
Much of the rest of the government's time is spent working to correct or
soothe the planning and financial scars inflicted in preceding years of
centralised state control when Brussels was, in Mr Picque's words, 'the
unloved child of Belgium'.
'Brussels was made poorer by the central state,' he explains. 'For 15 years,
the 19 communes (boroughs) of the Brussels region were receiving two or
three times less money than the other large towns in Flanders and Wallonia
(the Flemish and French-speaking regions of Belgium).'
Belgium's capital has also inherited the legacy of several decades of
haphazard urban planning, including a system of tunnels and inner ring-roads
dating from the 1950s and early 1960s which has blighted some of the most
attractive parts of the city.
But in trying to set right the errors of the past, Belgium has imposed new
burdens on its capital's government.
Everybody seems to agree that the boundaries of the city were drawn too
tightly in 1989. Politically that was prudent because it avoided treading on
the toes of the regional authorities. But economically it made little sense.
Mr Picque talks hopefully of sharing the government - and the fiscal
revenues - of the Brussels hinterland, but for the time being he literally
cannot afford to alienate Brussels' 1m or so inhabitants.
The wealthy commuters who work in the capital and live beyond the city
limits pay their taxes to Flanders and Wallonia but spend their weekdays
using services bought by Mr Picque's government. At the same time, there are
fears that the inner city will be abandoned to offices or to the European
institutions, and to poorer inhabitants, including a large number of
immigrants often resentful of what they see as harassment by the
authorities.
For practical as well as idealistic reasons, then, Mr Picque - who is still
mayor of one of the 19 communes - does not want Brussels to go the way of
other international centres. In an attempt to prevent the village atmosphere
of some parts of Brussels being replaced with administrative sterility, the
government has tried to encourage joint developments with the private
sector. More controversially, it has frozen or cut the number of city-centre
parking spaces and imposed strict rules on granting planning permission for
new offices.
Partly because of this draconian policy and partly thanks to the European
Community institutions' voracious appetite for space, Brussels already has
one of the lowest office vacancy rates in Europe. Developers - many itching
to acquire and convert older buildings - believe, or hope, that Mr Picque's
ideas are doomed to failure. In five or 10 years he or his successors will
have to relax their restrictions, they say, because Brussels will be starved
of investment.
Recanting is not an option contemplated by the current chief minister, who
believes it could take 10 or 20 years to set the city to rights. During that
time, Mr Picque is aware that Brussels must avoid alienating the business
world and the European Community institutions, but he is determined to stick
to his principles: 'I don't think you can always dream about the ideal
city,' he says, 'but you ought not to give in either.'

FT  16 JUN 92 / Survey of Belgium 92 (1): Right man for the job - Jean-Luc
Dehaene is the epitome of the hard-headed approach which Belgium needs. He
is prepared to make Belgians sweat, if that is what it takes to guarantee a
solid political and economic future for the country
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BELGIANS do not have much time for idealism. In a small country, burdened
with one of the most complex political, linguistic and institutional
structures in Europe, ideals usually do not work. Pragmatism is a much more
useful commodity.
For an almost unbroken 13-year period until this March, the public face of
that pragmatic spirit was the long-serving prime minister, Mr Wilfried
Martens, a Flemish Christian Democrat with a talent for compromise and an
ability to soothe the periodic disputes between Flemings and French-speaking
Walloons.
But a massive protest vote in last November's elections rocked the
traditional Belgian political parties, almost all of which lost
parliamentary seats, and dealt a fatal blow to Mr Martens' premiership.
After more than 100 days of wrangling over the composition of the new
government, Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene - a fellow Flemish Christian Democrat and
former vice-premier - took over at the head of a smaller, more manoeuvrable
centre-left coalition.
Mr Dehaene is the epitome of the hard-headed approach which Belgium now
needs.
The emollient Mr Martens was long considered the only Belgian who could
reconcile the conflicting demands of Flemish- and French-speakers, but he is
now coming in for his fair share of retrospective criticism.
His own party, the CVP, thinks he conceded too much to the French-speakers;
economists believe the spirit of compromise overcame the pressing need to
tackle economic slippage in the latter Martens years.
Even Mr Dehaene - a staunch Martens supporter during his term in office -
describes 1991 as 'in budgetary terms, a lost year'.
Such neglect, Mr Dehaene asserts, will not be repeated.
He will make Belgians sweat, if that is what it takes to guarantee a solid
political and economic future for the country.
'I belong to a political party, and to do what has to be done you have to
have electoral support,' he told the Financial Times.
'But people are more likely to back a government which has taken its
responsibility, than one that has run into the sand.'
Mr Dehaene's government has two pressing responsibilities.
One is to set Belgium's economy - in particular its public finances and
budget deficit - on course for European economic and monetary union (Emu) in
1996.
The other is to give new impetus to the domestic constitutional reforms
which were set in motion by previous governments.
Living up to the nickname 'TGV', the energetic Mr Dehaene has moved with
express-train speed on the first point, wrapping up an emergency budget for
1992 in just three days before his premiership was more than a month old.
With its plans to tighten up on dole fraud, close loopholes in the tax
system, and introduce a new 1 per cent social security tax, it has not been
universally popular.
But without this mini-budget, Belgium's large budget deficit would have
risen from 6.3 per cent of GDP in 1991 to 7 per cent this year. The measures
should curb the figure to only 5.6 per cent for 1992.
A full-scale budget for 1993, which should be decided at the end of July or
the beginning of August, will help put Belgium on track for a 3 per cent
deficit-to-GDP ratio by 1996 - one of the three criteria for joining a full
European currency union in the first wave of EC countries.
As a founder member of the Community and one of its keenest supporters,
Belgium has at least a sentimental interest in being part of the Emu
vanguard.
Mr Dehaene is a domestic politician at heart, but he is already honing his
Euro-jargon ready for next week's Lisbon summit. He must hope he will still
be prime minister in a year's time when Belgium will be poised to take over
the six-month presidency of the EC.
Many believe, however, that the Dehaene express will hit the buffers long
before then - derailed, ironically, by the very effort of shunting Belgium a
little further towards a national federal goal.
The problem is that constitutional reform requires a two-thirds majority in
parliament.
The first two stages of the three-stage programme drawn up four years ago
passed without too much difficulty under Mr Martens' leadership.
But Mr Dehaene's four-party coalition - socialists and Christian Democrats
from both sides of the language divide - does not command enough seats to
guarantee the passage of the latest proposals. They include direct elections
for the regional and language community councils, and the controversial
issue of increasing fiscal responsibility for the regions.
Mr Dehaene's solution was typically workmanlike. He set up a 'dialogue'
between politicians from 10 parties (excluding, to their huge irritation,
the maverick and extremist groups which increased their parliamentary
representation at the last elections) in the hope that the requisite
majority would gradually emerge.
That discussion began in April and was scheduled to restart this week, but
it has moved slowly and at times has looked like grinding to a halt. Even
optimists put the chances of success at only 50-50, while cynics call it the
dialogue of the deaf. If it fails, then Mr Dehaene's government of
pragmatists is unlikely to outlast the summer.
The political and budgetary pressures are ominously closely linked. Flemish
politicians have argued in the dialogue for a regionalisation of part of the
public debt, a point which the francophones will not even discuss.
French-speaking teachers, meanwhile, have this month threatened industrial
action if the French community cannot deliver on its promises of increased
wages - a commitment the community can only honour if it also takes on
greater fiscal responsibility.
It was a very similar dispute, and its inevitable repercussions, which
brought down Mr Martens' last government.
So how likely is another election in Belgium before the end of the year?
Probably not as likely as one might expect, given the odds apparently
stacked against Mr Dehaene.
The main stabilising factor may be fear. The strength of the popular vote
against traditional politics last November came as a shock to all Belgian
politicians and represented a clear signal that they should get down to
business and stop squabbling.
However vocal their criticism of Mr Dehaene's plans, the opposition parties
would probably be reluctant to test the electorate again so soon,
particularly as the lengthy interregnum proved that in many areas the
Belgian state can operate perfectly well without a strong government.
If he survives, Mr Dehaene has much he wants to do.
Reform of the public sector is one priority. It has already started with the
management restructuring of some of the bureaucratic 'regies' which control
most of Belgium's public services.
This process may even end in privatisation, an approach promoted by many
Belgian financiers and academics.
Mr Dehaene believes this should be part of the debate about the public
sector, but he shies away from starting an ideological argument and says
privatisation could never be the 'panacea which is going to resolve all the
problems' of public finance. It is a realistic approach, applauded by
economists.
'When you look at the amount of inefficiency (in the economy) you can see
theoretical solutions, but can you see how to correct the situation? For
that you need to be very strong, you have to have vision and you have to
have courage,' says Mr Peter Praet, chief economist at Generale de Banque in
Brussels.
He believes Mr Dehaene is probably the man for the job and is inclined to
compare these attempts to prune back the overgrown public sector to the
first stages of the Gorbachev-inspired reform process in the old Soviet
Union.
At the moment, Belgium is benefiting from improved transparency: glasnost.
Next will come perestroika, the more radical restructuring.
It seems worth pointing out - even though most analysts say it would never
happen in Belgium - that stage three of the Gorbachev process was the
disintegration of the central state itself.

AZERI forces said yesterday they had pushed Armenian fighters out of the
Shaumyan district of Azerbaijan, in a third day of heavy fighting in and
around the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, Reuter reports from Moscow.
Recent clashes have left thousands of refugees including these Azeris
(above) in a camp close to the Armenian border.
The Asa-Irada news agency reported that Azeri forces captured the town of
Gulustan, the last Armenian-held stronghold in Shaumyan district just north
of Nagorno-Karabakh itself.
In Armenia, which punched open a road corridor to Nagorno-Karabakh in a
major offensive last month, a Karabakh committee official confirmed the loss
of Shaumyan. He said Azeri forces were using more than 300 tanks and
armoured vehicles, helicopters and jets.

FT  16 JUN 92 / Opposition seeks full inquiry on Maxwell revelations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH

<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S opposition Labour party yesterday demanded a full inquiry into
what the government knew of Mr Robert Maxwell's activities prior to the
collapse of his business empire.
Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, wrote to Mr John
Major, the prime minister, urging him to set up an inquiry after the
Financial Times reported yesterday that the UK government had intelligence
information at least two years before the death of Mr Maxwell that suggested
he had been acting dishonestly.
Government officials said yesterday there was no evidence to suggest that
any government ministers had seen telephone or other intercepts which might
have alerted them to fraud in the Maxwell empire. Mr Major was certain that
he had seen nothing either as chancellor of the exchequer or prime minister.
Mr Brown called for a statement on 'who was informed, when and in what
detail, and - specifically - why no action was taken to investigate fraud'.
Conservative MPs including Mr Rupert Allason, the author of books on
espionage, were ready to accept that Mr Maxwell had been the subject of
intelligence reports, but expressed scepticism that these would have gone
into his financial activities.
Mr Richard Page, Conservative co-chairman of the all-party group of MPs
campaigning on behalf of the Maxwell pensioners, said: 'If it turns out the
government knew that Maxwell was bleeding money out of the pension funds,
then the pressure on the government to provide for the pensioners becomes
almost irresistible', he added.
The FT yesterday quoted Mr Robin Robison, who in June 1988 became an
administrative officer for the Joint Intelligence Committee, part of the
Cabinet Office which assesses information from Britain's intelligence
services.
The FT has confirmed separately, from a source other than Mr Robison, that
intelligence information on Mr Maxwell's activities had been available for
some years. A full intelligence report on Mr Maxwell was prepared from files
for the JIC at the time of his death on November 5 last year.
Mr Robison - a Quaker who was positively vetted by the security services in
1987 - claimed that in 1989 he saw intelligence information on Mr Maxwell
from intercepted telephone conversations and faxes. The information, he
said, had been distributed to government officials.
Senior government officials disputed Mr Robison could have seen signals
intelligence information in autumn 1989, as he claimed.
Downing Street indicated that there were no plans to seek a prosecution of
Mr Robison under the Official Secrets Act.
Government officials declined to comment on the suggestion that the
intelligence services may have collected information on the Maxwell empire.
Any suggestion that the government was responsible for the late Mr Robert
Maxwell's raiding of his companies' pension funds was rejected last night by
Miss Ann Widdecombe, junior social security minister.
She also rejected calls for another Commons' debate or government statement
on the affair. 'It would be quite counter productive to react every day to
every new twist of the Maxwell saga,' Miss Widdecombe said on Channel Four
News. She also ruled out a fresh investigation into the affair.
It also emerged yesterday that a book co-authored by Mr Peter Thompson, a
former director of Mirror Group Newspapers, and suppressed by Mr Maxwell in
1988, had originally claimed that the British security services had
extensive files on the publisher.
According to Mr Thompson, Mr Maxwell strenuously objected to a claim by a
former MI5 agent saw no fewer than 37 assembled dossiers on the publisher.
The book, Maxwell: A Portrait of Power, was published in February 1988,
without the passages in question. But Mr Maxwell's lawyers obtained an
injunction to prevent further sales.

FT  15 JUN 92 / Monday Interview: Defender of a fine British line - Malcolm
Rifkind, defence secretary, talks to Robert Mauthner and David White
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER and DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few members of the post-general election cabinet have settled in more
quickly - or more comfortably - into their new jobs than Mr Malcolm Rifkind
at the Ministry of Defence.
Draped elegantly on the office sofa in his shirt sleeves, the Secretary of
State gives the impression of having dealt with security and defence issues
for most of his life. His relaxed manner, coupled with one of the most
articulate intellects in Mr John Major's new team, are in sharp contrast to
that of the bustling and somewhat less ordered Tom King, his immediate
predecessor.
If the Scottish Office, Mr Rifkind's last but one portfolio, was a thistle
which even a native Scot sometimes found difficult to grasp, the MoD is not
very different in character. Though it may not be quite the ministerial
'ejector seat' that its German equivalent is reputed to be, it can be
something of a graveyard for political ambitions. Neither of Mr Rifkind's
two predecessors, Mr King and Mr George Younger, have continued their
ministerial careers.
The new defence secretary was thrown in at the deep end. Opponents of army
cuts seized on his appointment to fan speculation about plans to rescue some
of the Scottish regiments, condemned by Mr King's rationalisation measures.
But Mr Rifkind, in spite of his origins, seems determined not to reopen that
emotional debate.
Foreign mines also strewed his path. Hardly was he appointed, than Germany's
doubts about the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) came to the boil,
threatening the imminent break-up of the venture (Spain and Italy are the
other partners).
While recognising, 'as a fellow politician', the parliamentary pressures on
the German government to withdraw from the project and making constructive
cost-cutting suggestions, he has not hesitated to speak his mind on the
consequences for European co-operation.
'I don't think it is possible for the German government, on the one hand to
speak robustly about the desirability of a European defence dimension and
European co-operation, and at the same time consider withdrawing from the
single most important example of European defence collaboration that exists
at the present time.'
That is tough talk from the representative of a country which has not
exactly distinguished itself by its enthusiasm for European collaborative
projects in other fields, such as space research. Nor does Mr Rifkind appear
at all put out by criticisms that Britain continues to be unduly
'Atlanticist' in its approach to European security problems.
Though he undoubtedly sees himself as 'a good European', Mr Rifkind's views
do not diverge an iota from the traditional British government line on
defence. That is based on the hallowed proposition that, whatever steps are
taken to deepen European defence co-operation, absolute priority must
continue to be given to the preservation of Nato as the principal
organisation responsible for Europe's defence. Only in this way can
Washington's commitment to the defence of Europe be guaranteed.
'The US shares with all European countries a desire to see better European
co-operation. There is no problem about the basic consideration of Europe
getting its act together more effectively. The question is whether the
practice of European co-operation is to strengthen the Atlantic alliance or
ultimately to weaken it.'
His main concern, Mr Rifkind went on, is not so much the view of the US
Administration, but how the signals sent from Europe were interpreted by
Congress and American public opinion as a whole. Any talk of a 'European
army' is bound to alienate the sensitive people on Capitol Hill and lead to
the very troop withdrawals that all America's European allies say they want
to avoid.
That said, Mr Rifkind is firm in his support of the British interpretation
of the formula on a common European security and, eventually, defence
policy, laid down in the Maastricht Treaty. The present furore over the
future of the treaty in no way invalidates the objective of developing a
European defence identity, he emphasises, because parallel decisions were
taken in other western forums at about the same time. The decision to
develop a European defence dimension via the Western European Union
(nine-nation defence organisation, pre-dating Nato), for instance, was taken
by the Rome Nato summit last November and was subsequently referred to in
the Maastricht communique.
'But, actually, in the legal sense, it was an independent decision. It is
precisely because the European Community does not have direct competence in
defence matters that they do not directly relate to the Maastricht Treaty.'
That is called killing two birds with one stone. In one short statement Mr
Rifkind has proclaimed both Britain's commitment to greater European defence
co-operation within Nato and its rejection of an independent EC defence
organisation - even in the long run.
The link that the French, and to some extent the Germans, believe should be
established between the EC's institutions and the WEU is recognised by Mr
Rifkind only in the broadest sense that both organisations 'are relevant to
the development of common European interests'.
He is quick to add, however, that 'there is no single authority which covers
both. There is no legal binding relationship between the two nor any
proposal that there should be so . . . the WEU itself takes its decisions
with regard to its own development and possible role.'
As for the practical measures required to give some substance to a new
European defence identity, such as the provision of forces for possible WEU
operations outside the Nato area, Mr Rifkind concedes, with a wry laugh,
that they do tend to be rather 'confusing'.
Britain's original idea of a European rapid reaction corps is basically
using Nato forces in another guise - 'double hatting' in the deceptively
jokey official jargon. This is very different from the French and German
concept of a 'European corps'.
Mr Rifkind does not oppose the Franco-German force in principle. It could be
one of a whole number of forces made available to WEU. But he has strong
reservations about the fact that it is made up of German forces which are
assigned to Nato and French forces which do not come under Nato's integrated
command. In short, he finds the German argument that the joint force will
bring France closer to Nato, from whose military structure the French
withdrew as long ago as 1966, less than convincing.
'As an aspiration, we can obviously see it as an attractive objective. But
if that is the reason for the Franco-German corps, then it would have been
the easiest thing in the world for the French government to make that
clear,' Mr Rifkind proclaims.
'Will the relationship between the Franco-German corps and Nato be the same
as the current German relationship (with Nato) or the current French
relationship? It must be one or the other, and the indication so far is that
the relationship would be closer to the current French than the current
German one. If that is true - and I say, if - then clearly we would have to
see the Franco-German corps as weakening Similar scepticism is displayed
about the possibility of giving the new European defence identity a nuclear
dimension, involving essentially nuclear co-operation between Britain and
France.
'I cannot conceive a foreseeable future situation in which the use of
nuclear forces did not point towards Nato responsibility. Obviously, we are
not averse to a closer French involvement in Nato at any time, whether it be
on nuclear or non-nuclear matters. Close co-operation between Britain and
France on nuclear defence very much depends on France's ongoing relationship
with Nato. In present circumstances, I think the French would rule it out.'
The British litmus test for European defence co-operation has thus been
forcefully restated by Mr Rifkind. It is likely to be modified only if the
US itself has a fundamental change of heart about its commitment to Europe.

RESELLERS of telephone services in Canada, including the UK's Cable and
Wireless and other foreign companies, will be among the main beneficiaries
of a landmark government decision to allow more competition in the
telecommunications market.
The ruling by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications
Commission (CRTC) ends the monopoly on long-distance calls held by Canada's
provincial phone companies.
It also opens the residential market and other services to the resellers,
who buy lines at wholesale prices from the utilities and then resell them to
users at discount prices. The fast-growing resale market has up to now been
confined to business customers.
The CRTC was ruling on an application, first brought almost a decade ago, by
Unitel Communications (formerly CNCP Telecommunications) and a smaller
company for approval to offer a public, long-distance service. Unitel is a
joint venture between Rogers Communications, Canada's biggest cable
television operator, and Canadian Pacific, the railway and resources
conglomerate.
The agency's deliberations were complicated by the fact that the provincial
phone companies have always used handsome profits from long-distance calls
to subsidise their local service. They argued that downward pressure on
long-distance rates would inevitably force up local charges.
Bell Canada, the biggest of the utilities, estimates that the cross-subsidy
was close to CDollars 2bn (USDollars 1.6bn) last year, or 60-65 cents of
each dollar earned from long-distance calls. All local calls are still free
in Canada, and the monthly basic service fee is only about half that in the
US.
The CRTC ruled, however, that Unitel and any other new entrants must
contribute towards the local service subsidy. The level of the contribution
has been set about 15 per cent higher than Unitel had proposed.
Long-distance competitors will also have to share the cost of connecting
their lines to the phone companies' local networks.
Despite these conditions, the end of the long-distance monopoly is expected
to lead to fierce price-cutting. Unitel claims it can undercut current
long-distance charges by about 15 per cent. It expects to be offering
services in large cities within a year.
The threat of competition has led Bell and the other provincial phone
companies to slash rates by an average of 28 per cent in the past decade.
They are trying to recoup this by offering a growing array of value-added
services.

MR Steve Ross, chairman and co-chief executive of media group Time Warner,
announced yesterday he was taking a temporary leave of absence from the
group to resume treatment for prostate cancer, from which he has been
suffering for a considerable time. Mr Ross said in a letter to Mr Gerald
Levin, his co-chief executive that he had been advised he had not fully
recuperated and must now resume treatment.
Time Warner declined to comment further on Mr Ross's cancer, or on how long
the leave of absence might last.
Mr Ross, who began his business career as a director of funeral homes, built
the Warner group into a leading film and entertainment business before
combining it with Time, the book and magazine publisher, in a highly
controversial 1989 merger.
Earlier this year Mr Nick Nicholas, previously Mr Ross's co-chief executive,
quit the group after a series of disputes over strategy, leaving Mr Levin as
the chairman's evident heir apparent.
Mr Ross said in yesterday's letter that he was 'completely comfortable' with
Mr Levin taking over during his absence. He expressed confidence in Mr
Levin's leadership skills and said the two shared the same vision for Time
Warner.

FT  15 JUN 92 / County Hall buyer threatens to pull out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHIRAYAMA Corporation, the Japanese company which bought County Hall,
headquarters of the former Greater London Council, has threatened to pull
out unless the government clarifies its stance on the future development of
the site.
The company's plan to turn County Hall into a hotel and leisure complex has
drawn wide criticism since it bought the site in March from the London
Residuary Body, the organisation responsible for winding up the affairs of
the GLC.
A Shirayama official in London said yesterday: 'We have made it clear that
unless the government makes public its policy on the issue, we cannot go on
like this.'
Shirayama has faced a vigorous campaign against its proposals by the London
School of Economics, which wants to relocate to the site.
If the company is forced to give up its plans, under a termination agreement
included in the deal, it will be seen as an important victory for the LSE
and those who say that public benefit should be the main consideration in
the sale of such a historically important site.
Such a move, however, would be a blow for the government, which aims to get
the best price for its assets. Nor would it help to increase the appeal of
London to international commercial property developers following the shock
to the property market of the failure of the Canary Wharf development in
Docklands.
Shirayama is believed to have paid Pounds 60m for the main building alone.
How much more it is paying for the entire site, which includes three smaller
buildings, is not known. Last week, Shirayama submitted plans to the English
Heritage watchdog in which it made a number of concessions to local
considerations in the hope that they would ease criticism of its proposals.
Initial plans to use half the site for luxury flats, for example, were
scrapped, partly for commercial reasons, but also to allay concerns raised
by the local authorities that the privacy requirements of luxury flats would
restrict public access to the site.
The hotel complex, with conference rooms, 24-hour restaurant and health
centre, would also house a children's education centre, art gallery, library
and a central chapel.

FT  15 JUN 92 / Labour to press for early reduction in interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH, the shadow chancellor and clear favourite for the Labour
leadership, will today press for a cut in interest rates as anxiety grows in
the government over the sluggishness of the long-predicted economic
recovery.
In an effort to maximise the government's discomfiture, Mr Smith will argue
that, with mounting unemployment and business failures, there is 'precious
little' evidence of the recovery the Conservatives had promised would follow
their April election victory.
His speech to the GMB general union in Blackpool criticises the government
for taking no action to stimulate production or demand: 'It is time now for
a further reduction in interest rates - a reduction which I believe can be
sustained within the exchange rate mechanism.
'After all what is the point of being in the wide, 6 per cent band, if the
greater latitude it offers is hardly ever used.'
Treasury officials believe, however, that the opportunity for the government
to stimulate demand by cutting interest rates has receded significantly
following Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty on monetary union.
On Friday, sterling stood at DM2.92, three pfennings below its DM2.95
central rate in the ERM, while interest rates at 10 per cent are just a
quarter of a percentage point above the German Lombard rate.
Most independent economists also seem to concede that there is little margin
for flexibility. Private sector economists have revised their expectations
for economic growth this year to less than the 1 per cent forecast by Mr
Norman Lamont, the chancellor, in his March Budget.
The lacklustre outlook for the economy is provoking disquiet among
Conservative MPs, with the Euro-sceptic faction seizing on the Danish
referendum result to step up its attacks on the UK's ERM membership as an
intolerable constraint.
Meanwhile, ministers last week completed their submissions to Mr Michael
Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, for spending in the coming
fiscal year.
In spite of an early round of meetings with Mr Portillo, aimed at ramming
home the government's call for austerity, the rise in unemployment levels
alone means that at least Pounds 1bn more will be needed to pay benefits.

FT  15 JUN 92 / UN worried over Serbian plans: Ethnic groups will be split
apart if division of Sarajevo goes ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED NATIONS and European Community officials are increasingly concerned
that Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of Bosnia's Serb community, will press ahead
with a plan to divide the besieged city of Sarajevo along ethnic lines.
The plan, which the UN and EC have consistently opposed, would involve the
transfer of residents into ethnically-homogenous sectors. It would be
carried out irrespective of any ceasefire.
A green line, modelled on the one which divided Beirut for many years, would
run north-south through Sarajevo, with Serb irregulars holding the western
half of the city. Much of the recent fighting has been concentrated along
the north, centre, and west of the city in what western diplomats say is an
attempt to drive out the local population.
Dividing Sarajevo, which before Serb irregulars laid siege to it nine weeks
ago had a population of 525,000, would mean the mixed ethnic communities of
Moslems, Serbs and Croats, and those from mixed marriages who have
co-existed for centuries, would be forced to choose which part of the divide
they would live in. An estimated 200,000 people have already fled the city.
Western diplomats said Mr Karadzic has repeatedly tried to link the
re-opening of the city's airport - controlled by Serb irregulars so as to
prevent food from reaching the starving people of Sarajevo - with the
division of the city.
Any such linkage has been repeatedly rejected by UN officials. The UN's
primary task in securing control of the airport is to facilitate the
unhindered supply of food and humanitarian aid into Sarajevo.
'This plan by Karadzic is sheer madness. We are talking about another
Beirut. But Karadzic refuses to let go of this idea. Somehow he sees it as
his historical mission, on behalf of Serbs, to divide the city, and give it
to the Serbs, even if it means completely destroying large parts of Sarajevo
in the process,' a western diplomat said.
Mr Karadzic originally drew up the plans to divide Sarajevo on the basis
that it would merge with Serb-controlled areas in central and eastern
Bosnia. Those areas, which would then be linked to Serbia, which borders
with Bosnia-Hercegovina, would form Greater Serbia.
He has the full backing of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, who,
despite his attempt to convince the international community that Serbia no
longer supports the Bosnian Serbs, continues to send arms, money, and
logistical backing to Mr Karadzic and General Ratko Mladic, commander of
Serbia's proxy army in Bosnia.
Western diplomats say Mr Karadzic will continue to bombard Sarajevo to
establish his green line, even if Mr Milosevic drops his Greater Serbia
plan.
'The point is that if, and when, all this fighting is over, the desire for
revenge among all ethnic groups in Sarajevo, and Bosnia, will be intense,' a
senior western diplomat said.
'Karadzic realises this. He knows that those Serbs who participated in the
siege of Sarajevo will never be safe to walk the streets of that city again.
'Karadzic also wants the green line for his own security, and for those
Serbs who choose to live there, even if that means creating a ghetto, or a
kind of east Berlin which will never be recognised by the international
community.'

FT  15 JUN 92 / Personal View: The economic costs of Ireland saying 'no'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRET FITZGERALD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Thursday, the Irish people go to the polls to decide whether to ratify
the Maastricht Treaty. Although in earlier Irish referenda on European
Community membership and on the Single European Act, pro-EC majorities of 83
per cent and 70 per cent respectively were recorded, the result this time is
far from certain.
As in Denmark, a certain popular negativism towards politics and politicians
is working against ratification. In addition, many are frustrated at being
asked to vote on something they feel they do not understand, and are liable
to decide that, when in doubt, they should say 'no'.
There are also fears about an erosion of cherished neutrality. In addition,
the introduction by Mr Charles Haughey, the former taoiseach, of a protocol
on abortion into the treaty has provoked a hostile reaction to ratification
from both sides in the controversy over abortion and the rights to travel
and information.
It is impossible to say at this stage how heavily these emotional factors
will weigh against the immense economic benefits EC membership has brought
to Ireland, and the prospect of lower interest rates that European economic
and monetary union is expected to bring in its train.
Unhappily the referendum issue has eclipsed a recent report on the Irish
economy by the Economic and Social Research Institute which is relevant to
the economic issues raised by the Maastricht Treaty. This report is the
first to give a considered reaction to the longer-term economic implications
of startling improvements in the Irish balance of payments estimates
revealed earlier this year. These revisions effectively doubled previous
forecasts of the 1991 Irish external payments surplus and have positive
implications for the future prospects of the economy - which were already
bright, even before this new data became available.
Last year's Irish current external surplus is now placed at 4.5-5 per cent
of gross national product - almost twice the Japanese figure. For the
current year the institute forecast a rise in the external surplus to almost
7 per cent. It bases this on what it describes as a 'cautious' forecast of a
10 per cent rise in the volume of exports - a description justified by the
export returns for the early months of this year.
This performance reflects the remarkable improvement in competitiveness that
has taken place during the past 10 years as a result of the incomes policies
pursued by successive Irish governments. Because of these policies,
industrial pay rates have risen more slowly in every year since 1986 than is
the case for the group of countries with which Ireland mainly trades: the
UK, the US, France, Germany, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands. According
to the central bank, this favourable pay trend, together with productivity
increases, has reduced Irish unit wage costs relative to those of these
trading partners by no less than 30 per cent during the past decade. The
result has been a radical improvement in the balance of payments - from a
disastrous 1981 deficit of almost 15 per cent of GNP to the now-forecast
1992 surplus of almost 7 per cent.
With an external surplus running ahead of any other EC country and well over
double that forecast for Japan, the Irish economy is now remarkably
well-placed for a sustained high rate of growth. Even in the present year,
when high interest rates in Europe are holding back economic expansion, the
Irish growth rate is forecast at 3.25 per cent - higher than anywhere else
in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Were it not
for some unwise handling of recent budgets, which has left the government
with too little room to stimulate growth by means of tax cuts, an even
higher rate of growth could currently be achieved.
In the institute's view, what is now holding back even more rapid growth is
simply 'unduly pessimistic assessments of Irish economic prospects' and a
'misguided perception' in Ireland that 'economic prospects (are)
significantly higher' in the UK and US. This has led to perverse capital
outflows, the reversal of which, the institute philosophically concludes,
must await the persuasive effect of 'allowing the facts to change the
general perception within the financial community of Ireland's relative
economic prospects'.
In Ireland itself, however, there is as yet little public recognition of
these growth possibilities. Consequently, the Maastricht referendum is
taking place in an unreal atmosphere of national pessimism induced by the
present record level of unemployment. This high unemployment is not
primarily a function of Irish economic performance but rather a consequence
of past demographic forces - the fact that the traditionally high Irish
birth rate started to fall much later than in the rest of Europe, its recent
one-third decline dating back only to 1980 - and of the UK recession, which
has reversed the traditional flow of Irish emigration across the Irish Sea.
There is in consequence no recognition by Irish public opinion of the scale
of the growth that could be released by lower interest rates as and when
Germany eventually gets its affairs into order - or of the correlative
danger, that a 'no' vote might have the effect of reversing the recent
steady downward movement in these rates.
For if the well-placed Irish economy has a vulnerable spot, it is in the
extent of its dependence in recent years on non-resident subscriptions to
its domestic government borrowing. German institutions have been happy in
recent years to secure a somewhat higher rate of return from Irish
government stock than they could achieve at home and have been encouraged to
do so by the strength of the Irish pound, which for more than five years has
without strain kept within 1 per cent of its central rate vis-a-vis the
D-Mark.
A 'no' vote on Thursday might disturb this confidence, especially as German
opinion, conscious of the strength of the Irish pound, may not be quite as
well informed about the unusual growth prospects of the economy - Ireland's
best-kept secret of recent times.
However, public opinion polls taken last week suggested a two-to-one
majority in favour of the treaty among those who had made up their minds -
with, however, up to one-third of those polled still undecided. Since then,
the leaders of the four main political parties have issued a strongly worded
and comprehensive joint call for a 'yes' vote, which also has the support of
the trade unions, employers' and farmers' organisations.
Fears of a 'no' vote have been somewhat allayed by these developments,
although memories of the late swing which in 1986 converted a prospective
majority for divorce into a negative decision continue to haunt the
political establishment.

Still on the subject of the City's old training schools, Bryan Quinton of
Invesco MIM has solved Observer's request for information on how many
Conservative MPs honed their early business skills inside the Slater Walker
empire which collapsed so spectacularly in the mid-1970s.
Quinton, who was Jim Slater's first employee, has counted six ex-colleagues
still making their way up the political ladder: Sir John Cope (paymaster
general), Tony Nelson (economic secretary), Alastair Goodlad (foreign
office) and Jonathan Aitken (defence) have made it to ministerial rank,
while Alan Haselhurst and John Butterfill carry the torch on the back
benches.
Admittedly, none of them comes close to matching the success of Lord (Peter)
Walker, Jim Slater's first deputy chairman. But unless one counts Lords
Hanson and Sterling, who in their early days benefited from Jim Slater's
charisma, far more Slater Walker old boys seem to have made their mark in
politics, rather than the City.
A subject for an explanatory doctoral thesis, perhaps?

There can be few banking names in the City which have the same mystique as
that of Glyn, Mills &amp; Co.
It disappeared inside the Royal Bank of Scotland empire a long time ago, but
its reputation as a breeding ground for future bank chairmen lingers on.
Perhaps it is no great surprise then that the dear old TSB should recruit a
new chairman for its loss-making Hill Samuel merchant bank from the Glyn,
Mills stable. John Sclater, who is relieving TSB chief executive Don
McCrickard at the Hill Samuel helm, is the latest in a long line of bankers
who passed their institute exams at Glyn, Mills.
He is in good company. Sir Jeremy Morse, the current chairman of Lloyds
Bank, and Sir Eric Faulkner, his immediate predecessor, both came from Glyn,
Mills, and both did a good job in their subsequent careers. Even so, there
is a danger that Sclater's appointment may look a bit incestuous.
After all, Sir Richard Lloyd, who chaired Hill Samuel before McCrickard took
over in March 1991, is another old Glyn Mills' cadet. Meanwhile students of
the City's old boy network will note that Sclater was appointed to the board
of Union Discount by Alex Ritchie, another ex-Glyn Mills man, who used to
head Grindlays with Nigel Robson, who just happens to sit on the TSB board.
Doubtless, they are all first rate chaps, but if the TSB really wants to
strengthen the management of its wayward merchant bank, it could do worse
than start fishing in less well-trawled waters.

It says much for the sheer doggedness of the Basle-based Bank for

happens.
The central bankers' bank was certainly not going to allow the rebellious
Danes to disrupt its long-planned discussion of the non-European view of EMU
at yesterday's BIS annual meeting. Indeed, scores of central bankers from as
far away places as India and Mexico were invited to the closed session.
Luckily, Erik Hoffmeyer, chairman of the Committee of European Community
Central Bank Governors, was on hand to give his advice. Not only is he
attempting to pick up the pieces of EMU after the Danish referendum result,
but he is also the governor of the Danish Central Bank.
Yesterday the amiable Danish bank chief was doing his best to shrug off any
possible discomfort and insisting that the Danish vote had been the result
of a fair and proper debate.

FT  15 JUN 92 / Observer: Trouble shooter
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Who is going to replace Sir John Cuckney? Observer poses the question
following the news that Sir John has been hired yet again to try and clean
up another lovely City mess - recovering the Maxwell missing millions for
the unfortunate pensioners.
Over the last couple of decades, Sir John has carved out a reputation for
himself as the man who can be relied upon to sort out financial
mismanagement or skulduggery in both the public and private sectors. The
Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, Westland, Crown Agents, John Brown, the Port
of London Authority, are just a few of the casualties who have had the
Cuckney treatment.
Now Sir John has been made chairman of the trust for Maxwell pensioners and
has the unenviable task of persuading the private sector to cough up. If
anyone can do it, he can, given his network of contacts. As an old
intelligence hand, he should know where the skeletons are hidden and even if
he doesn't he is rather good at twisting arms for the public good.
Nevertheless, Sir John turns 67 next month and has already started to shed a
heavy City work load. He remains chairman of Royal Insurance but steps down
from 3i next month. Sooner or later someone else is going to have to do Sir
John's dirty work. Suggestions to Number 10 and the Bank of England, please.

FT  15 JUN 92 / Interest rates not so high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I used to have a distant South African relation who would silence her
loquacious husband by saying: 'Barney, don't talk about things you don't
know.' That is what I feel like saying when I read claims that the European
exchange rate mechanism is the main cause of the British recession and the
main obstacle to economic recovery.
These are mostly political writers, gossips and others who mainly read each
others' writings and assume that what they tell each other a million times
must be true. Should any of them seek economic confirmation, they will find
the assertion repeated on almost every page of Economic Affairs, the journal
of the Institute of Economic Affairs, back under Brugiste control.
If any of these anti-ERM zealots is prepared to look up from their reserved
corners of the Tory press and examine a genuine piece of economic analysis,
they could do no better than look at a paper that Professor Mervyn King,
economic director of the Bank of England, gave to a British audience in Rome
last week on Europe in the 1990s: the Economic Perspective.
The author first outlines the conventional wisdom on the recession:
An unbalanced policy mix in Germany (with taxes too low to pay for
unification) is keeping German long-term interest rates high.
Another result is tight German monetary policy, leading to high short-term
interest rates throughout Europe.
These high rates are preventing recovery.
King disagrees in part with all these propositions. He does not accept that
German short-term interest rates represent a floor to short-term rates in
ERM countries. This is so, even if Germany remains the anchor country of the
system in the longer run. On the sheer arithmetic other countries could
temporarily move several percentage points below German rates if they are
near the bottom of their bands and are expected to move back towards the
centre or top. Whether this can happen 'is not a question of high theory but
of practice and market expectations'. Or as I said on May 18: 'Suck it and
see.'
The more novel part of King's case is that recovery depends much more on
long-term real interest rates and less on short-term ones than commonly
supposed. Nominal long-term bond yields are very similar in the UK and
Germany. Real long rates, after allowing for inflation (and excluding
mortgage interest distortions in the British case), are actually lower in
both Germany and the UK than in the US.
The conventional wisdom is that most private sector borrowing is on a
short-term basis. King believes that to be a superficial view. US and
Japanese exporters will not be able to take advantage of present low
short-term rates, because built into financial markets is an expectation of
dollar recovery. Thus the competitive advantages are not entirely where they
seem and European exporters may be better off than spot real exchange rates
suggest.
That is not all. Capital investment takes a long time; and today's base
rates are not a good guide to the cost of finance over several years. Even a
company that finances itself with a revolving bank credit has to think in
terms of an average of base rates over several years; and long-term rates
may here be a better guide to what to expect.
King does not overstate his case and accepts that high short-term rates
'have a restraining impact on consumption and create special difficulties
for countries suffering high burdens of debt inherited from the expansion of
the 1980s'.
Naturally he does not speculate on when German short-term interest rates
will decline. Given all the pressures on him, the Bundesbank president,
Helmut Schlesinger, has to engage in tough talk. But German interest rates
will come down if activity weakens enough.
Professor King also alludes to a theme that he has developed earlier. This
is that high long-term interest rates may be appropriate, given the supply
side revolution in the west and the voracious demands for capital in the
ex-communist world. Here I am not so sure. The need for capital investment
will not automatically translate into an investment prospect appealing to
lenders in the west. And in the English-speaking countries the new,
once-bitten caution about borrowing may continue for a while.
The important question is not which guess will prove right. It is whether
the world's bond markets will have sufficient flexibility to respond to
pressures in either direction by allowing long-term interest rates to move
up or down enough.

FT  15 JUN 92 / A game of missed opportunities: Though the Rio Earth Summit
fell short of its goals, it served a useful purpose
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES and CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If for no other reason, the Earth Summit will go down in history as an
astonishing political event. At tea-time on Saturday afternoon, no fewer
than 103 world leaders sat down at a huge round table in the Riocentro and
solemnly vowed to work for a better world environment. It was, in the words
of one official involved in the two-year preparations for that single
moment, 'inspirational'.
Mr Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister of Pakistan speaking on behalf of the
developing countries, said simply: 'After this summit the world will never
be the same again.' Mr Erskine Sandiford, the prime minister of Barbados was
so moved that he penned an ode to the environment.
But to the rest of the world, subjected for 12 days to the massive coverage
provided by the 9,000-strong press corps, the results must have seemed far
more confusing. What had this grandly-titled conference really been about,
with its curious vocabulary of bio-diversity and sustainable development?
How would it affect their lives? Did it even matter?
In one sense, the Earth Summit was a dismal failure. Billed as the event
that would finally place the environment at the top of the global agenda,
its readily identifiable achievements were disappointingly few. All its
decisions fell well short of the original goals. They also look haphazard:
there are measures to protect forests, the climate and plant and animal
life, but none on water or waste, or even population control which was
widely hailed as the best form of environmental protection. The summit also
spent an enormous amount of time arguing about aid to the Third World, a
subject which, to inhabitants of the industrial world at least, might seem
far removed from everyday environmental concerns.
But in another sense, the Earth Summit was a monumental success. It was the
first convocation of world leaders since the end of the Cold war, and as
such demonstrated the strong pulling power of the environment as a political
issue. The gruelling negotiations, which lasted until dawn on several
nights, may have wearied the participants, but they stirred rigorous debate
on whole areas of policy which had never been examined before. And the sheer
weight of publicity - even of the White House's hapless handling of the
event - created a momentum for environmentalists to harness.
But if the summit achieved so little in hard terms, it was because it showed
just how divisive even the most worthy of environmental goals can be, and
the extent to which they touch upon vital national interests. This was
disheartening for those who hoped for concrete results. But in another sense
it was also very educative.
One of the liveliest topics, for example, was the preservation of tropical
forests. Yet the conference failed to agree on an international conservation
treaty, ending instead with a much watered down 'declaration of principles'
which was immediately denounced by Friends of the Earth, the environmental
lobby group, as a 'chainsaw charter'. The real issue had nothing to do with
trees but with whether the world had a right to tell a country how to manage
its natural resources. The fact that it was mainly the rich countries which
were trying to get the poor countries to give up their logging livelihoods
only made it worse.
Another knotty question arose with a bio-diversity treaty. This was
originally proposed as a measure to preserve plant and animal life. But the
real issue quickly became the exact opposite: how living organisms could be
commercially exploited, and who should have the patent rights. The treaty
that was finally agreed was more about commerce than conservation, which is
one reason why the US refused to sign it even though it originally mooted
the idea. As Mr William Reilly, the administrator of the US Environment
Protection Agency, said: 'We would have hoped that the conference would have
confined itself to protecting flora and fauna.'
The other specific agreement - on climate change - threw up a further set of
difficulties. The purpose of this treaty was to curb emissions of greenhouse
gases which threaten to alter the planet's climate. Instead it turned into a
tussle over how big a sacrifice individual countries should make to support
a global cause, in this case by accepting tough emission controls even at
the cost of economic growth. For President George Bush, there was a clear
limit, and he insisted on weaker emission targets before he would sign.
Underlying all these issues lay an even greater question: how far the
world's environmental problems could be traced to the gap between the rich
north and the poor south. The summit's official title was the UN Conference
on the Environment and Development, a title that was supposed to stress the
closeness of the two themes.
For the Third World, there was no question about this link. Mr Anwar
Saifullah, Pakistan's environment minister, said: 'Eighty per cent of our
water is untreated. That's our biggest problem. When I have to worry about
such basic provisions of life, it's a luxury to talk of environment.' Much
of the world's degradation - over-exploitation of land, polluted water and
deforestation - can be traced to poverty, and the voracious demands of the
industrial countries, now and in colonial times.
The Group of 77 developing countries came to Rio determined to secure a
strong increase in aid as the price of their support for the conference. But
though their case was strongly argued, and supported by the World Bank among
others, the Third World did not win the day.
The rich countries acknowledged that they placed the heaviest strains on
world resources and bore a special responsibility to repair the damage. They
also agreed in principle to provide 'new and additional financial means' to
boost environmental aid for the Third World. But when it came to putting
actual money on the table, they were tight-fisted, citing recession and
other budgetary pressures. The financial pledges made in Rio were so vague
that it is hard to size them up. But they appear to amount to Dollars 2.5bn
a year. This is well below the Dollars 5bn-Dollars 10bn that had been
predicted, and mere chicken feed beside the Dollars 70bn which the UN said
was needed. To the bitter end, many rich countries resisted pressure to
commit themselves to raising their aid to the UN target of 0.7 per cent of
gross national product by the turn of the century.
But if the summit must be judged a failure for those who sought to link
poverty to the environment, it achieved a success of a different sort. All
the rich industrial countries committed themselves to giving more aid
specifically for environmental projects, such as sewage treatment, waste
management and cleaner air. Strong support was also given to the Global
Environment Facility, a fund administered by the World Bank and the UN
specifically to help poor countries carry out work which is of value to the
planet as a whole. Environment has thus moved higher up the aid agenda.
The summit also witnessed a shift of a different sort, in the relative roles
of the US and Japan. Washington's aversion to environmental over-regulation,
to the moral obligations included in the summit's legally binding treaties,
and to the attacks that were made on the US appetite for energy and
resources made Mr Bush a reluctant and prickly participant. 'Environment
protection has replaced communism as the great threat to capitalism,' said
one member of the faction-riven US delegation.
By contrast, Japan approached Rio with a carefully planned diplomatic
offensive backed by the largest offer of new environmental aid made at the
summit - some Dollars 500m a year. Whatever Tokyo's motives - and sceptics
were quick to hint that these were driven above all by self-interest - Japan
added measurably to its international status in Rio. 'They're the owners of
all the new issues - and they're getting it so cheap,' said a senior
Brazilian official with mixed admiration and regret.
The real question now that Rio is over is whether it will make any
difference. The answer is virtually none in the short term. The measures
that were agreed, and the financial commitments that were made, were so
modest that the critics can convincingly argue that it was a waste of time.
A more profound reason for questioning the summit's value is that it was
supposed to put the world economy on a path to sustainable development -
that is, by growing in a way that does not impoverish future generations.
But though the summit gave ringing endorsements of this concept, it produced
no binding agreements to force governments to promote it. Green lobby groups
were pressing hard for measures to encourage trade in goods that are
produced on a sustainable basis, or to build true environmental costs into
the manufacturing process. But these were all dismissed as unrealistic in
the harsh reality of the economic world.
Mr Charles de Haes, director general of World Wide Fund for Nature, the
green organisation which helped develop the notion of sustainable
development, described the summit results as minimal. He said: 'It's all
generalities. We need to know specifically what is going to be done and by
when.'
Yet it is hard to escape the impression that Rio did set some very large, if
slow-moving, wheels in motion. Two legally binding treaties will now be
implemented, and more may follow. A commission on sustainable development
will be created to monitor implementation of the summit's decisions, and put
pressure on countries to live up to its spirit. And even if Rio did not
provide the answers, it pressed people's noses very hard against the
questions. One hundred and seventy eight governments put themselves on the
environmental hook, and it will be up to their constituents to keep them
there.
President Francois Mitterrand of France, whose stance was among the most
prominent of the industrialised countries, proposed another 'rendezvous' in
three to five years to review progress.
'We know we still have an enormous way to go in narrowing our points of view
so as to produce common solutions,' he said. 'But our meeting will not have
been in vain if it teaches the people of the south that ecology is not a
rich man's luxury, and those of the north that there is no true
environmental protection without help with development.'
WHAT WAS AGREED AT RIO .....
Treaty on climate change to curb emissions of greenhouse gases
Statement of principles on forests: non-binding agreement to conserve
forests
Bio-diversity treaty to preserve flora and fauna.  US refused to sign
because it weakens bio-technology patent rights
Agenda 21: action plan covering all aspects of environment. Non-binding, but
a yardstick against which to measure government actions
  ...AND WHAT WAS NOT
Treaty on forests: dropped because of Third World opposition.  Its failure
was summit's biggest setback.
Earth Charter: its simple precepts were not up to the complexities created
by summit debate

FT  15 JUN 92 / Arts: Samson et Dalila - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The revival of Saint-Saens' opera at Covent Garden on Saturday was the 143rd
Midland Bank Prom, with 700 eager fans sitting on the floor of the stalls.
Outside in the piazza, there was a still larger crowd watching it on the
giant screen (courtesy of the Royal Opera House Trust, the Covent Garden
Friends, the City of Westminster and Premium Cinzano). With such overflowing
generosity and enthusiasm, all that was needed was good weather and a really
good performance: both of which we got.
This time round, Elijah Moshinsky's 1981 production has been rehearsed to
excellent purpose by Jeremy Sutcliffe. Sidney Nolan's designs, which lend an
Aboriginal tang to the Near East, still look fine. So does Placido Domingo,
the original Samson of the production, though his elegant distress while
pushing the millstone around suggests a fastidious Duke in exile rather than
a legendary strong-man. (Jon Vickers' bull-like frame was always an
unbeatable advantage there.)
By Domingo's own lofty standards he was only in second-best voice - incisive
and eloquent at the millstone in despair, slightly out of puff when the time
came to pull down the temple. There were of course all his usual marks of
thoughtful integrity; and with his new Dalila, he conducted himself with
perfect gallantry. For young Olga Borodina is a new star of the first
magnitude, as the entire house soon recognised; and far from attempting to
pull operatic rank, Domingo played to her as to an equal. The
seduction-scene at the heart of Act 2 was for once a seriously erotic
affair, not an operatic contest.
Miss Borodina is tall and beautiful, and her warm mezzo is a lovely
instrument: ample, not huge, but never forced. Where many another Dalila
vamps strenuously, she sang limpid phrases, the more penetrating because
they were so effortlessly balanced. Her French is secure (rare among Russian
artists nowadays), if not exactly native; and she inhabits her billowing
costumes with languorous grace. The combination of gentle facade with
unbending inner purpose is extraordinarily potent.
In plain, familiar French, what Saint-Saens' opera is about is a discarded
mistress (Dalila, a Philistine) who turns nasty, and the off-and-on
strongman (Samson, a Hebrew) who swings helplessly between wanting her and
wanting to follow his God-given instructions to annihilate her tribe. Beyond
the text, however, there are ambiguities of feeling which would normally
seem beyond Saint-Saens' tidy artistic range. Borodina's performance was
positively radioactive with them, and to the end they remained fascinatingly
unresolved.
The rest of the cast are mostly old regulars: Jonathan Summers' stylised
brute of a High Priest, Roderick Earle's sneering Abimelech, Mark Beesley's
staunch Ancient Hebrew. The dancers again fling themselves into David
Bintley's Bacchanale with a will.
That still turns the final scene into a flashy charade - which is no more
than this curiously jerry-built opera deserves; but I want to enter another
plea for some British opera company to get Steven Pimlott to re-stage
Samson. His memorable Bregenz Festival version, with its echoes of the
Holocaust, lent the piece unprecedented force and depth.
For the first time here Mark Ermler conducts the opera, and he finds
consistent musical dignity in a score that contains not a few passages of
ricky-tick and fustian and academic note-spinning. That is a creditable
achievement, and an important strength of this performance. On the last
night, by the way, Domingo's place will be taken by Vladimir Popov.

FT  15 JUN 92 / Arts: Dejavu revisited - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Osborne's Dejavu could turn out to be a bit of a test case for the
future of the West End theatre. The thrust of my review last week was that
anyone who enjoys the stage should book tickets at once. Since several of my
fellow critics have been less enthusiastic, however, some further comments
may be allowed.
There is a tendency among critics - not only of the theatre - to try to
raise their intellectual standards whenever something out of the ordinary is
up for judgement. I do it myself and have probably been harsher than
strictly justified to some of the later works of Alan Bennett mainly because
I do not think that they are as good as his earlier ones. The same may go
(just about) for what I have written about Harold Pinter. Yet, in the case
of Dejavu, I think my praise was understated.
In the West End nowadays there is little left of what used to be called
'serious theatre'. By 'serious' I mean a play by an educated playwright for
an educated audience. Certain levels of knowledge have to be taken for
granted. Of course, the play has to be good: above all, it has to be
actable. No one wants to go to the theatre to hear a sermon.
When I read the text of Dejavu published by Faber and Faber, I was full of
foreboding. It was excessively long and preacher-esque, with a terrible
tendency to rant. That is not how it turns out on stage at the Comedy
Theatre. Tony Palmer's production passes all the tests. You want to watch
and you want to listen. I do not think, to adapt a phrase from Kenneth Tynan
on Osborne's earlier Look Back in Anger, that I have any friends who would
not enjoy at least 80 per cent of Dejavu. By my standards, 80 per cent is a
pretty high strike rate for a performance of anything.
To be sure, you have to be steeped in theatre fully to appreciate it, and
not only in Osborne's earlier work. The influence of Shakespeare in general,
and Hamlet in particular, is pervasive. The opening line from Jimmy Porter
to Cliff is 'What Ho, Bernardo]' There are also some pleasing pick-ups from
Noel Coward: 'I went round the world you know.' 'How was it?' 'Far too
long.' Yet it is an essential part of theatre for one playwright to draw on
another on the assumption that an audience will recognise the references.
You also need to be steeped in current affairs. There is a remarkably sharp
line in Dejavu that goes back to Arthur Scargill and the miners' strike:
'Couldn't he drop concrete blocks on a few intransigent cancer patients en
route for the chemotherapy department?' On the first night, it dropped
unnoticed. Even the title Dejavu, written as one word, is a kind of Osborne
joke. Jimmy Porter senior is full of French phrases. The element of
self-parody is never far away.
Plays like this in the West End are rare. They depend on a regular
theatre-going audience which may no longer exist. If Dejavu flops - and I am
not saying that it will - it will be harder to try again. The outlying
theatres in Greenwich, Richmond and Islington all have their place, but it
used to be good to have a mecca.

FT  15 JUN 92 / Arts: Italian Songbook - Symphony Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To refugees from London's musical life, concerts in Symphony Hall often have
a familiar look. The programmes of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra
may be a shining exception, but much of what is programmed in Birmingham
crops up around the same time in the capital - the Pittsburgh Symphony
played two concerts there last week before coming south, Richter visited
with one of his London programmes, James Galway and the Philharmonia will
introduce Dave Heath's flute concerto in Birmingham just before its London
premiere.
Some duplication of that kind is inevitable, the economic logic of
concert-giving being as it is. But currently there appears to be more of it
than ever, just when in its second year of active life Symphony Hall needs
to begin carving out an individual artistic profile.
On Wednesday, however, Symphony Hall came up with a celebrity recital all of
its own: Felicity Lott, Thomas Allen and Geoffrey Parsons gave Wolf's
Italian Songbook to a sizeable and immensely appreciative audience. Not a
full house, but a very decent one, demonstrating that although the public
for recitals may not yet be as large in Birmingham as it is for orchestral
concerts (which it isn't in London either), it is building all the time.
Lott's and Allen's performances were beautifully wrought; Parsons'
accompaniments began in a slightly unfocused way and gained steadily in
point and purpose. It took all the performers, in fact, the first group of
songs to settle down and to judge the hall exactly. There was a surprising
amount of resonance around the voices, and a consequent emotional distancing
until the ear adjusted, and then the two singers' arts seemed exactly
complementary.
Lott produced some deliciously silvery tones and elegant phrasing - a
beautiful sense of shape in 'Wir haben beide' - and kept the coquettish side
under strict control; Allen was at his best in the more ebullient songs,
sometimes seeming a little laboured when required to sustain a line,
especially in the lowest register. Yet such passing moments of uncertainty
were invariably followed by a number delivered with perfect judgement; so,
after a distinctly uncomfortable 'Heut Nacht erhob ich mich', there was
immediately a beautifully proportioned 'Schon streckt' ich aus'. Sense of
proportion was the essence of everything about the evening; nothing was out
of scale or place, nothing was contrived for cheap effect.

<TEXT>
What can be done about Stonehenge? It is always described as 'the most
important prehistoric monument in Europe' and visiting it on the Wiltshire
plain was once a romantic and moving adventure. Today it is very different.
Almost a million people a year from all over the world make the pilgrimage
to ponder on the meaning of the stones and they usually have a pretty
horrible experience.
The ghastly visitors' facility is situated away from the monument and
necessitates a squalid walk through a concrete tunnel under the road. This
may save a few lives but ruins any romance or mystery for the visitor.
Things are worse when you get to the monument, which is viewed through a
wire fence as though it were in a concentration camp.
English Heritage is responsible for the monument - it is one of the few
ancient sites that produces a large profit, about half a million pounds a
year. The stones are listed as part of a World Heritage Site, as designated
by Unesco, which includes Avebury. The National Trust owns some 1,600 acres
of land around the monument.
These two bodies, the National Trust and English Heritage, have combined
forces to improve matters and in May 1991 they submitted an application for
outline planning permission to the local council at Salisbury. Their
proposals suggested the removal of the A344 road and the existing visitor
facilities and the re-routing of a byway and its downgrading to a footpath.
A car park and new visitor facilities were proposed for a site some
three-quarters of a mile north of the stones at Larkhill. Visible garrison
buildings (the army is always a lurking presence on the plain) were to be
shielded and plantations created of indigenous trees. Much of the historic
landscape is proposed to be restored to chalk downland grazing. English
Heritage and the National Trust have produced 'The Stonehenge Conservation
and Management Project' and are planning a Conservation Trust to manage the
whole site in the future.
Many of these proposals seem sensible. The application is backed by a
government report supporting the idea of a new road and accessibility to the
Stonehenge estate, which is full of other ancient archaeological features.
Last December, however, Salisbury District Council refused to grant outline
planning permission and the problem is now to be aired at a public inquiry.
To counter local objections and to persuade the world that these proposals
are purely dedicated to the overdue enhancement of the monument, English
Heritage and the National Trust have just announced an international
architectural competition to choose a designer for the new visitors' centre.
An appeal against the refusal of planning permission was lodged with the
Secretary of State for the Environment in June. Three new detailed planning
applications will be submitted that will include visitor access, landscape
restoration and improvements to an adjoining farm.
The local objections to granting approval for this scheme have been voiced
in colourful language. English Heritage has been accused of turning
Stonehenge into a 'thundering great theme park'. More particularly, the
objections are (as phrased in planning jargon) 'contrary to the countryside
policy C2A of the South Wiltshire structure plan' and the proposed western
access route is seen as having a deleterious effect upon the archaeological
landscape. The local council also opposes the closure of the A344 road.
The saga has been running for a long time. Proposals to improve the setting
and the tourist facilities have been on the drawing board for the last eight
years at English Heritage. Mr Jocelyn Stevens, the new chairman, has a
reputation for sorting things out quickly. He will face the challenge with
the help of the new minister for National Heritage, Mr David Mellor.
There is no doubt that the plan, which in effect creates an archaeological
park, is an enormous improvement. But is it necessary to do so much?
Certainly the road closures and the new access route will considerably
improve both the setting and the atmosphere. But I am anxious about the
competition for an architect (he could be a landscape architect) for the
visitors' centre. I question the value of an interpretation centre,
lavatories, mother and baby rooms, children's play areas and the inevitable
cafe. The jury for the competition is chaired by the establishment architect
Michael Hopkins and I would like to offer him a scrap of advice.
How about making Stonehenge one of the few places of archaeological interest
in the world where you do not have a shop, do not have a cafe, do not have
all the hideous trappings of the tourist trade? Make it a place that is
completely unlike anywhere else - emphasising only its mystery and beauty.
All the time and money that is going to be wasted on a huge and pointless
competition should be spent on removing as much of the modern world as far
away as possible from Stonehenge - leave it to the real sheep, and leave it
unexplained and inspirational. Let it be free from the imposition of
'heritage'.

FT  15 JUN 92 / Directors divided on EC schism: Business hopes the
Maastricht shambles can be sorted out swiftly

ALTHOUGH Mr John Major will have the unity of his party uppermost in his
mind as he struggles to create order and consensus out of the Maastricht
shambles, there will be another critical constituency watching his every
move.
Britain's business community is not prone to panic, but it hates instability
and uncertainty. The outcome of the Danish referendum, the ensuing fall-out
at Westminster and the chance that Maastricht might unravel are threatening
to create both. Industry is adamant that the politicians must sort things
out and do it quickly.
British business has generally been more pro-European than many individuals.
But boardroom opinions are divided on whether the setback to the treaty
represents a possible calamity or a golden opportunity to strike a more
beneficial deal.
'It is potentially quite a dangerous situation,' says Mr Christopher
Haskins, chairman of Northern Foods. 'It carries with it grave political
uncertainties, with the threat that unstable currencies and rising inflation
could come back into vogue. We could all go back to square one.'
Mr Haskins says a prime concern is that enemies of the 'ever-closer union'
envisaged at Maastricht will get the upper hand: 'We must keep the pressure
on for a deal and make sure the loonies aren't let out again.'
But Mr Martin Taylor, chief executive of Courtaulds Textiles, says the
Danish vote is excellent news. 'The community was developing on profoundly
undemocratic lines. It would one day explode and cause lots of damage. It
has been punctured with a relatively small pin.'
Mr Taylor, like many other business leaders, emphasises the need for
pressing on with the completion of the internal market.
For the most part, industry's interest has focused on the construction of a
vast, barrier-free marketplace. Most reservations and suspicions have
centred on the growing influence of Brussels and on plans for a broader
social dimension to European development.
The treaty signed in December was widely welcomed as an honourable
compromise by commerce and industry. While it enables Britain to stand aside
from the social chapter and to reserve judgment on monetary union, it also
allows the UK to press on with building the internal market - the economic
backbone of the community.
Although the events of the past 10 days have left business, along with the
politicians, bewildered about what happens next, there is universal
agreement that progress made so far must not be jeopardised.
Sir Denys Henderson, chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries, says it is
essential that talks over Maastricht should not impede the implementation of
decisions already taken to help improve the business climate in Europe.
He adds: 'In particular, it is vital that the momentum towards completion of
the single market by the end of this year should be maintained.' During its
presidency of the EC, the British government should make it a priority, he
adds.
Mr Geoffrey Sewell, director-general of the European Computer Leasing and
Trading Association, whose members are responsible for supplying the
European market with equipment worth Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.4bn), says it
would be a disaster if progress towards a single market were to be
frustrated.
There are also fear that progress towards a single currency may be halted.
Industrialists such as Sir Patrick Sheehey, chairman of BAT Industries,
regard the single currency as an essential part of a true single market.
The Confederation of British Industry, which will debate the latest
developments at its council meeting on June 24, also agrees that a single
currency is essential. It believes any delays to economic and monetary union
which arise from arguments over political union will be harmful.
Although Mr Peter Morgan, director-general of the Institute of Directors,
says he is pleased that the Danes have 'ended the fudge' on Europe's
political framework, he believes that the community needs a single currency
now.
Others are not so convinced. Mr Geoffrey Whalen, chief executive of Peugeot
Talbot, is not certain that a single currency is realistic. 'I am sceptical
about it, and where there is doubt I think we should stay as we are.'
There is also some concern over prospects for the exchange rate mechanism,
which is seen as the halfway house to monetary union. Mr John Early, the
director responsible for strategic development at construction group Amec,
says the stability of the UK economy would be under threat if the ERM were
to disintegrate. Any additional delay to sterling moving into the narrow
bands of the ERM would also be unwelcome, he believes.
Mr Nick Temple, chief executive of the UK subsidiary of US-based computer
group International Business Machines, says it sees no need for immediate
strategic changes, but it will have to keep a very close eye on events. This
response is shared by, among others, UK-based computer manufacturer ICL.
Mr Hugh Collum, finance director of SmithKline Beecham, the pharmaceuticals
and consumer products group, says: 'It's sad it's fallen apart, but it's far
from clear what the full implications are.'
Sir Michael Angus, president of the CBI, also agrees with that view. 'It is
sad because I cannot really believe everything is back in the melting pot.
It is serious because the Danes have sounded a warning to Brussels that they
have to take more more notice of people's susceptibilities.'
