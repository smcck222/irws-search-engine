FT  11 SEP 92 / IMF cash resources 'facing strain'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE international Monetary Fund's cash resources could fall to their lowest
level in years if its member countries do not quickly put into effect the
Dollars 62bn (Pounds 31.4bn) capital increase they agreed two years ago, IMF
officials have warned.
Faced with heavy demands for money from new members in eastern Europe and
the former Soviet Union, the IMF's available cash resources fell last year
to Special Drawing Rights 20.9bn, the organisation's reserve currency unit.
The officials said their liquidity position could worsen considerably by the
end of this year unless they receive the funds from the quota increase. 'We
do see the liquidity situation as potentially becoming quite strained,' one
official said.
The biggest problem for implementing the quota increase, which would raise
the IMF's capital base by 50 per cent to SDR135.2bn (Pounds 100bn), has been
the reluctance of the US, the IMF's biggest member, to pass the necessary
legislation for its share.
The Bush administration has now rolled the IMF quota increase into a package
of aid measures for the former Soviet Union; this bill has been delayed by
wrangling over aid for US inner cities, but congressional aides say they
expect it to pass, probably at the end of this month.
But even US acceptance will not be enough to implement the quota increase.
Under the IMF's rarely simple operating rules, the quota increase cannot
come into effect until a separate amendment to the organisation's articles,
providing for the suspension of voting rights for countries which do not
fulfil their obligations to the IMF, has been ratified by three-fifths of
the member countries possessing 85 per cent of the voting rights.
Even with the US's 18.9 per cent of voting rights, this level will not be
reached until some other substantial member countries such as Italy have
ratified the amendment.
IMF officials said the Washington-based organisation's usable resources fell
last year as a proportion of liquid liabilities to 82 per cent. This
liquidity ratio is projected to fall to about 50 per cent by the end of the
year without the extra resources that would be brought in by the quota
increase.
Members can usually pay three-quarters of their quota in their domestic
currency, which for most countries is not readily usable elsewhere, so the
quota increase is expected to provide nearly SDR30bn of immediately usable
resources, roughly doubling the IMF's liquidity.
Even without the addition of the former communist countries, calls on the
IMF's resources have increased substantially, the IMF's annual report,
published yesterday, says. New commitments in the financial year ending
April 30 totalled SDR8.7bn, against SDR5.6bn in the previous financial year.
Arrangements with Argentina, India and Brazil accounted for most of this.
Additional members from the former communist bloc and elsewhere have brought
the IMF's membership list to 169 countries. With the completion of pending
applications from republics of the former Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, as
well as from Micronesia and San Marino, the IMF will have 178 members.
'For the first time, the IMF can be said truly to have moved towards the
goal of universal membership,' an official said.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Fed criticised over fine-tuning of US economy
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Monetary Fund (IMF) board members have criticised the US
Federal Reserve for 'fine-tuning' the US economy by repeated cuts in
interest rates, George Graham reports from Washington.
Some members of the IMF's executive board said the Fed was justified in
lowering its federal funds rate, 'given the hesitancy of the economic
recovery and the slow growth of the broadly-defined money supply', but
others saw risks in the cuts because inflation still seemed to be running at
a rate no lower than 4 per cent even at the trough of the economic cycle.
Most directors agreed that the Fed should be ready to raise interest rates
again as the recovery took hold.
The IMF's principal worry about US economic policy, expressed during
consultations designed to draw attention to the international implications
of policies and developments in the economies of member countries, remains
the federal budget deficit.
Board members 'saw a clear need to strengthen the credibility of fiscal
policy,' calling for spending cuts but also additional revenue measures.
Many directors suggested eliminating a number of tax breaks that distort
private savings, but also proposed higher excise taxes on energy use,
especially on petrol.
In their scrutiny of economic policy, published in the IMF annual report
yesterday, directors also issued their recommendations for other major
industrial countries:
Japan should continue efforts to reform its trade practices. They said there
was scope for greater fiscal stimulus - a desire subsequently met by Japan's
recent economic package - but urged caution in guiding interest rates below
their already low levels.
Germany needed to discourage unsustainable wage increases, which had
contributed to the country's worsening inflation performance and justified
progressive increases in interest rates.
A clearer medium-term budget strategy was needed, however, with the
elimination of unproductive subsidies to coal mining and agriculture.
France was not showing 'sufficient determination' in reforming its tax
structure, its labour market practices and its protectionist tendencies.
The UK must keep as its main economic goal a rapid convergence of its
inflation to that of its low-inflation partners in the European Exchange
Rate Mechanism.
The European Community did not fulfil the criteria for an optimal currency
union. Some directors saw little prospect for developing a true European
budget policy because of political constraints.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Clifford to face NY BCCI trial first
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FEDERAL judge in Washington yesterday ruled that Mr Clark Clifford, former
US defence secretary facing criminal charges in connection with the
collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI), should first
stand trial in New York before facing a federal indictment in Washington.
Judge Joyce Hens Green granted a prosecution request that the Washington
trial of Mr Clifford be postponed until at least next March, so that he can
first be tried on the more serious New York charges of accepting bribes,
conspiracy to commit fraud and misleading bank regulators.
The New York trial is expected to begin in early January. Justice Department
officials have said the Washington case might then be dropped.
The Washington charges relate mainly to Mr Clifford's statements to bank
regulators regarding First American Bankshares, the Washington bank he
chaired until last year and which was illegally controlled by BCCI.
The judge also decided to appoint a cardiologist to examine the 85-year-old
Mr Clifford, as he and the Justice Department had requested. US prosecutors
have said that, depending on the doctor's assessment, they may decide to
excuse Mr Clifford a trial.
Mr Robert Altman - Mr Clifford's 45-year-old protege and law partner, and
the former president of First American - will face trial whether or not Mr
Clifford is excused.
Yesterday, before the Washington hearing had begun, Mr Altman's actress wife
Lynda Carter - known as the star of Wonder Woman, the television show - made
a point of appearing in the front row of the courtroom to give Mr Altman a
lavish hug and kiss.
Both Mr Clifford and Mr Altman have denied any wrongdoing.

FT  11 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Russian helicopters may fly to Turkey's
aid - Ankara is looking to Moscow for arms to fight Kurdish separatists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE rugged mountains on the borders of Turkey, Iran and Iraq more than
100 Turkish soldiers and Kurdish guerrillas died last week in the worst
clash of the eight-year separatist conflict.
With the war escalating rapidly - more than 1,000 have died so far this year
 -and some western countries banning arms sales to Turkey, Ankara has turned
to Russia in search of weapons supplies.
The two countries are looking at a barter deal whereby Turkey would supply
various goods and services in return for Russian helicopters and armoured
personnel carriers.
Western defence officials say the initial decision to consider Russian
equipment was for political rather than military reasons - the idea was
first mooted during a meeting between President Boris Yeltsin and Prime
Minister Suleyman Demirel at the Black Sea Economic Conference in Istanbul
in June.
But Turkey has increasingly identified a more immediate need to strengthen
its rapid reaction capability in the Kurdish conflict.
Under a Dollars 2bn proposal, the armed forces have invited bids from
western defence suppliers for 200 large combat helicopters, although budget
pressures have delayed any early decision. The government procurement agency
SSM also has a collaboration with FMC of the US to make armoured vehicles.
This project has been plagued by disputes with the army over sub-contracts
for the engine and night-sight equipment.
The latest moves suggest Turkey is reconsidering some of these long term
joint manufacturing programmes, in the wake of escalation in the fighting.
Earlier this year, Ankara asked companies in the helicopter tender to
resubmit bids to include an off-the-shelf purchase of up to 50 helicopters,
the remainder being part of a long term co-production deal. Meanwhile the
Turkish police negotiated the purchase of armoured personnel carriers from
Cadillac Gage of the US, using credits from the US export import Bank.
Last month Mr Vahit Erdem, head of SSM, sent a team to Moscow. Mr Ismet
Sezgin, the Turkish interior minister, confirmed a commission had been set
up to evaluate the MI-17 troop carrying helicopter, and the BTR-60
eight-wheeled armoured personnel carrier.
However, the Turkish army, as distinct from the police, has said it is not
interested in the deal, and is said to have advised the police against
acquiring the smaller MI-24 Hind-D combat helicopter which is also on offer.
The exact cost of the deal is a matter of speculation, although Turkish
reports suggest the deal could be as much as Dollars 300m. Settlement is
likely to be part of the gas protocol under which Turkey takes Russian
natural gas in exchange for goods and contracting services. Turkey is
initially looking to acquire 20 MI-17s at a cost of Dollars 50m.
Turkey has reportedly been asked for assurances that the arms would not be
sold to third parties. Both Turkey and Russia are concerned at the growing
conflict in the Caucasus, where Turkey is anxious not to be accused of
siding with the Moslem Azerbaijanis against the Christian Armenians who have
historically enjoyed Russia's support.
By buying Russian Mr Demirel may also be seeking to deflect criticism of his
fragile coalition government, under attack at home for failing to curb the
PKK guerrillas, and internationally for the heavy-handed methods of the
security forces.
Before the war with Iraq, Switzerland banned arms sales to Turkey because of
its mistreatment of Kurds, affecting purchase of the Oerlikon gun for the
armoured personnel carrier. In March, Germany suspended arms shipments after
television reports claimed former East German armoured personnel carriers
supplied by Bonn were being used to put down Kurdish demonstrations.
Significantly, it was the BTR-60 armoured personnel carrier which was at the
centre of that dispute. The German agreement stipulated the equipment could
only be used in Nato's defence. If Turkey is now to acquire the Russian
BTR-60, it will be hard for the Germans to protest again, as no such
restriction is likely to be written into the contract with Moscow. Turkey
could then use its mixed stock of BTR-60s with impunity to put down its
Kurdish rebellion.

FT  11 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Californian sushi may fall victim to
Japanese rice ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A JAPANESE plan to import frozen sushi - a raw fish and rice ball - from the
US may be blocked by the National Food Agency, which enforces the Japan's
ban on imported rice.
Sushi Boy, an Osaka-based food distributor and retailer, wants to import
sushi from California, where the rice ball will be blended in the
traditional way and frozen for shipment.
Because the company claims it will be able to sell the sushi for 30 per cent
less than local prices, its competitors are alarmed. But the most important
barrier is the Food Agency, which has the duty to ensure that Japan's rice
import ban is not violated.
There are exceptions to the import ban. Individuals can bring in rice for
personal use, and companies are permitted to import prepared rice dishes
such as pilaff, as long as at least 20 per cent of total weight is in
vegetables or meat.
Importers of prepared dishes must also prove that the rice cannot be easily
separated, because the Food Agency is wary of companies attempting to get
around the ban by filtering vegetables out of the pilaff and reselling the
rice. The agency said its biggest concern in the Sushi Boy case was that the
structure of sushi would allow for easy separation of the rice: 'We want to
see exactly how the ingredients are prepared.'
The agency, for example, allows imports of curried rice in which the rice
and curry are blended, but forbids curried rice in which the curry comes in
a separate sachet.
Mr Masahiro Nanba, a manager of Sushi Boy's trade department, said its sushi
would easily meet the weight requirements. The average slice of tuna weighs
10 grams, while the rice tips the scales at 23g. He was also confident that
the tuna and the rice would not separate in transit: 'By freezing the sushi,
we should be able to ensure that the two stay together.'

FT  11 SEP 92 / The French Referendum: Maastricht bewilders the Vosges -
David Buchan visits the home town of leading No campaigner Philippe Seguin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUFFAWS break out in the Bar de La Poste, as the news is read out from the
local paper that the city hall has acquired a new table. 'I didn't know the
mayor was so hard pressed for furniture,' mocks one of the bar-proppers.
The mayor in question is Mr Philippe Seguin, better known to millions of
French since last week as the man who took on President Francois Mitterrand
in single televised combat over the treaty of Maastricht. The table in
question is the small round one over which the two men debated in the grand
amphitheatre of the Sorbonne and which Mr Seguin has now brought to Epinal
as a souvenir of his historic encounter.
In fact, most of the denizens of the Bar de La Poste say they will vote Mr
Seguin's way - No - in the September 20 referendum. Not because they
necessarily agree with the way the neo-Gaullist RPR leader articulated his
objections to the pact on European union but, mainly, because they can't
make head or tail of it.
'I read it three times, and still don't really understand what it's on
about,' says Mr Laurent Grosdemange, son of the bar's proprietor. He says he
would like to vote Yes to portions of the treaty and No to others, and so in
10 days' time he may end up posting a blank ballot.
One of his customers, a young trainee mechanic, says he may also adopt the
same tactic. Why vote at all, then? 'At city hall, they keep a record of
whether you have voted, and if you want something from them later on, it's
better to have voted something - even blank - than nothing at all,' he says.
This attitude helps explain why the level of abstentions/don't knows/won't
says is still so high, nearly a third in most opinion surveys, frustrating
predictions of the outcome.
Clearly, then, the Mitterrand-Seguin debate was not one of those moments of
heroic clarity in French history, such as used to be recorded in the
18th-19th century prints known aptly as 'les images d'Epinal', produced in
the city.
But, locally, if Mr Seguin has not charmed his anti-Maastricht supporters by
his stand, neither has he appalled the pro-Maastricht camp in his Vosges
constituency.
'I think he has taken the position for purely internal political reasons,'
says Mr Gilles Bragard, a textile company head and president of the Vosges
employers' federation.
Mr Bragard denies that any Vosges opposition to the treaty reflects local
economic difficulty and timidity in the region about opening up to
international competition.
'We are beautifully placed in the Vosges to take advantage of Europe. I
myself am within two hours' drive of my German, Swiss and Belgian
subsidiaries,' he says.
He concedes that the Vosges textile sector has lost jobs, shrinking from
20,000 to 14,000 in the past decade. If he has any reproach of EC textiles
policy, it is that Brussels has not helped employers like him foot the bill
 -large in France - of shedding labour and so improving competitiveness.
But the Vosges shows little of the fear that 'the Germans are coming' which
seems to fuel the anti-Maastricht vote elsewhere in France. This is, in a
way, ironic. The fact that the region has a textile sector at all is
historically due to German aggression, which after 1870 pushed many
industrialists out of Alsace and into the Vosges, bringing their money and
technology with them.
Indeed there is some relief now that, as Mr Jacques Minier, who presides
over the Vosges' economic development committee, puts it, 'the Germans are
coming back'.
Immediately the Berlin wall fell in 1989, German investors stopped
prospecting in the Vosges. Now, he says, they are back, knowing they can
find in the Vosges the sort of skilled and dedicated workforce they have
realised will take a generation to produce in eastern Germany.

BRITISH GAS has beaten competition from Europe and Asia to win exclusive
rights from the Gas Authority of India to negotiate on establishing a
Dollars 70m (Pounds 35.4m) joint venture to supply natural gas to Bombay.
The project will use gas from the Bombay High and other offshore fields, and
involves building a gas network to 600,000 businesses and households.
British Gas will have a 35 per cent stake. It will also provide technical
support.
The deal is a boost to India's policy of encouraging joint ventures with
foreign companies. For British Gas, which is being forced to cut its market
share to increase competition in the UK market, the deal will help fulfil
its target of improving income from its Global Gas supply business to
account for 20 per cent of group earnings by the end of the decade.

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PERSISTENT reports that the French government has authorised 'in principle'
the sale of 60 Mirage 2000-5 fighter jets to Taiwan yesterday elicited only
a half-hearted denial by the French Ministry of Industry and Trade.
Commenting on a report by the French news agency AFP, quoting 'concordant
French sources', that the green light for the Dollars 2.6bn deal had been
given to the French manufacturers, Dassault Aviation, Mr Dominique
Strauss-Kahn, the French Minister of Industry and Trade, said that the
export of Mirages to Taiwan had not been 'officially authorised.'
'As long as a detailed dossier of the sale has not been formally submitted
to the government by the industrialists concerned, we cannot make a
decision,' the minister said. But he was quick to add that the government
would not consider such a sale as 'an aggression against China,' which has
registered its strong opposition to any sales of fighter-bombers of the
Mirage type to Taiwan.
For good measure, Mr Strauss-Kahn stressed that the French government had
given its blessing to Dassault for its efforts to sell Mirage
fighter-bombers to Taiwan.
The sale of French warplanes to Taiwan has long been a subject of dispute
between government departments favouring a deal, the ministries of defence,
finance and industry, and the foreign ministry, which opposes it because of
the adverse effect on Franco-Chinese relations.
However, the economic arguments in favour of such a deal are powerful.
Dassault, which has not sold a single military aircraft abroad since 1988,
desperately needs export orders to boost its falling profits. Moreover, an
aircraft deal with Taiwan could open the door to further export orders for
France for high-speed trains and nuclear power stations, it is hoped in
Paris.
The US proposal to sell F-16s to Taiwan could ease the Chinese pressure on
France to abandon the deal. Moreover, French officials believe Taiwan may be
ready to share its military aircraft market between the US and France.

FT  11 SEP 92 / The French Referendum: Europolice eager to unite against
crime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAASTRICHT looks like getting the police vote. The treaty contains a precise
plan to set up a Europol, creating a single market not only for criminals
but also for their pursuers.
Certainly, President Francois Mitterrand pitched for the law-and-order vote
on television last week, warning that 'No to Maastricht would be a Yes to
the Mafia'. Since then, the Lyons-based European Council of Police Unions
(ECPU), which has among its multinational members two thirds of French
police inspectors, has strongly backed Maastricht as 'laying the ground for
police co-operation, aimed at thwarting the collaboration of criminals,
which has no need to be endorsed by any referendum'.
In fact, such police co-operation between France and its EC partners is
already germinating beside a cornfield in the Neuhof suburb of Strasbourg.
In a building ringed by a double fence and barbed wire, some 15 police
officers from seven EC countries last week started designing the skeleton of
a Europol. Their report will go first to EC interior and justice ministers
and then to the EC summit in December, with the aim of having Europol start
business next January.
'We will not be an operational unit, a kind of Euro-FBI,' stresses one of
the Frenchmen in the Europol planning team. 'As the Maastricht treaty says,
Europol will, in its first phase, confine itself to exchanging information
on drug traffickers.'
But he said he would not be surprised if this remit were quickly extended to
attacking the Mafia, whose activities will be the subject of a special EC
ministerial meeting on September 18.
Will Europol die if Maastricht does? Few in the Neuhof planning cell think
so, because the need for the men in blue to join hands against international
criminals is so evident. 'Criminals have long exploited and hidden behind
our frontiers. It is time for us policemen and magistrates to set aside
these borders a bit and see what's going on on the other side,' says the
Frenchman.
A great deal of informal co-operation has grown up already among Europe's
police forces, through the 1990 Schengen convention. Europol's provisional
headquarters is based in Neuhof because the Schengen Information Centre
(SIS) now sits there.
Opened officially last week, the SIS is an enormous Bull-Siemens computer
system, ready to receive police data from the eight Schengen signatories.
The SIS data bank will remain empty until all eight signatories - France,
Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain and Portugal -
have ratified the convention. More than half have yet to do so. However,
there are hopes this process will be complete by next year.
The UK remains averse to signing up to Schengen, as a British police member
of the Europol team notes, partly because of what it will mean on the Ulster
border with Ireland.
Mr Roger Bouiller, secretary general of the ECPU in Lyons, hopes that
eventually Maastricht will lead not only to more exchange of information
among the Twelve's police forces, but to a harmonisation of the legal rules
under which they have to work in pursuing criminals across each other's
borders.

FT  11 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Airbus wins Dollars 1.1bn order - The
Farnborough Air Show
</HEADLINE>

   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIRBUS Industrie has won an order for up to 10 of its new A340 long range
wide body airliners worth about Dollars 1.1bn from Philippine Airlines.
The contract announced yesterday at the Farnborough air show includes six
firm orders and options for another four.
With large orders for new aircraft scarce because of a slump in the civil
aviation market, the Philippine deal is significant for the European
aircraft manufacturing consortium of British Aerospace, Aerospatiale of
France, Deutsche Aerospace of Germany and Casa of Spain.
The contract brings total firm orders for the A340-A330 family to 264 jets
from 30 customers.
With its four-engined A340 and the twin-engined A330, Airbus is challenging
Boeing at the top end of the airliner market traditionally dominated by the
US company.
Boeing also announced a firm order at Farnborough yesterday for four of its
757 twin-engined narrow body airliners worth about Dollars 240m from Shorouk
Airlines, a joint venture charter carrier formed by Egypt Air and Kuwait
Airways.
The firm orders include one passenger and three cargo versions of the 757.
The airline has also taken options on another four 757s including two
passenger and two cargo aircraft.
Shorouk announced earlier this week a firm order for two Airbus A320 narrow
body twin engined airliners and options for a further two aircraft.

JAPAN'S Fair Trade Commission is investigating a New Zealand based company
and nine local trading houses charged with forming an illegal cartel in kiwi
fruit, an FTC official said. Reuter reports from Tokyo.
New Zealand Kiwifruit Marketing Board (Japan), sole importer of the fruit,
said it was questioned by the FTC over the allegation on September 3, but
the company denied it was involved in price fixing.
The official said the FTC had started questioning the trading companies,
including Mitsubishi and C. Itoh.
The New Zealand Kiwifruit company said: 'We are willing to co-operate with

Agriculture ministry data show that domestic production of kiwi fruit in
1991-92, ending March, was 45,700 tonnes, while imports were 42,700 tonnes.
About 99 per cent of imports come from New Zealand. The ministry said its
data showed Japan was the world's biggest kiwi fruit importer.

FT  11 SEP 92 / The French Referendum: Minister warns of danger of No vote:
Sapin foresees threat to French economy

<TEXT>
MR Michel Sapin, the French finance and economics minister, yesterday threw
the weight of his powerful government department behind the campaign for a
Yes vote in the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty to be held on September
20 and predicted widespread adverse consequences in the event of a negative
outcome.
'A vote in favour of the treaty by the French people, and not only by its
parliament, would reinforce France's position not only within Europe but in
the world,' the minister said at his weekly press conference, reinforcing
his point with detailed statistical information showing how France had
benefited from membership of the European Community.
On the other hand, a No vote would weaken France's international position
and have very bad economic consequences.
One of the results, according to Mr Robert Lion, managing director of
France's principal state savings and investment institution, the Caisse des
Depots et Consignations, would be a general rise of 1 point in French
interest rates and a fall of economic growth to below 2 per cent in 1992,
compared with 2.6 per cent in the case of a Yes vote.
These warnings from two of the leading members of the country's financial
establishment coincided with the publication of new opinion polls showing a
continuing decline in support for the Maastricht Treaty, though those
intending to vote Yes in the referendum remain in the majority.
Although they predict a narrow victory for the Yes camp, the polls do not
agree on the size of the majority. The IPSOS institute announced yesterday
that 53 per cent of the voters polled intended to endorse the Maastricht
Treaty, against 47 per cent who would vote against it. But the ISL poll
found that only 51 per cent of the electorate at present intended to vote
Yes, compared with 49 per cent opposing the treaty.
The large number of polls conducted over the past three weeks, publication
of which will be banned from midnight on Saturday until the referendum is
held a week later, show that a large number of voters remain volatile and
could change their minds at the last minute.

REJECTION of the Maastricht Treaty on European union by the French
electorate would cause foreign exchange and financial instability and throw
the Community into crisis, Mr Antonio Borges, deputy governor of the
Portuguese central bank, warned yesterday, Patrick Blum writes from Lisbon.
The Portuguese government, whose economic strategy is predicated on
deepening European integration, is concerned at the possibility of a
negative vote in the French referendum.
Mr Borges told the Financial Times a No result would be 'disastrous not just
for Portugal, but especially for Portugal' - 'Not simply because of the
money (Portugal receives from the Community), though that is important, but
because (Portugal's EC membership) has opened trade opportunities,
encouraged foreign investment which otherwise would not have come here, and
has motivated (the authorities) to implement difficult domestic decisions
which would not have been made without the excuse of the Community.'
About three-quarters of Portugal's trade is with the Community, which is
also the main source of direct foreign investment. Trade would suffer and
investment decisions would be put off if there was financial instability, he
said.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Many voices go into a Bundesbank utterance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank's slab-like headquarters on the outskirts of Frankfurt gives
the German central bank the look of a monolith. However, the bank makes its
views known to the outside world in a bewildering multiplicity of ways. This
is primarily because of its pluralistic way of making decisions.
When, as in recent weeks, a variety of Bundesbank views ricochet onto the
foreign exchange markets from several different angles, the central bank can
stand accused of inconsistency.
Worse, when remarks from the centre of the Bundesbank appear to be
contradicted by those from the periphery, the central bank can appear to be
organising some form of conspiracy.
The appearance of raggedness is an inevitable result of some deep-rooted
ambiguities in the bank's management of Germany's current economic problems.
On the one hand, the central bank welcomes the concept of stabilising
exchange rates within the European Monetary System in a way which will
maximise anti-inflation discipline. On the other, it wants the EMS to remain
capable of organising occasional exchange-rate adjustments to allow for
differing economic performances among member countries.
Because its short-term priority is to keep exchange rates stable, the
Bundesbank has no interest in furthering speculation that it is trying to
engineer an EMS realignment.
Nor does it want to strengthen the view that another increase in its Lombard
rate may soon be on the cards. This is why Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the
Bundesbank president, agreed at the weekend that the Bundesbank would not
raise its interest rates 'in present circumstances'.
Even though Frankfurt money market rates are just under the 9 3/4 per cent
Lombard level, another increase in the rate looks unlikely, in view of
strong signs of stagnation in the German economy.
The Bundesbank is equally opposed, however, to creating the impression that
it is allowing pressure from foreign finance ministers to dictate its
anti-inflationary monetary policies. This explains why Mr Schlesinger this
week has been at pains to point out that his Bath declaration added nothing
to a statement already made 10 days earlier.
An important reason why Bundesbank policy utterances can appear confusing is
its federal structure. The central bank takes monetary policy decisions
every other Thursday on the basis of majority voting by its 18-man governing
council. Each representative has one vote - which means that each member
theoretically carries the same weight in, effectively, determining interest
rates around Europe.
The 11 presidents of state (Land) central banks, at present reduced to nine
by death and retirement, who sit on the council have become in recent years
much more outspoken.
Many of them now employ their own advisers and press spokesmen to make sure
their frequent utterances are given play in the media.
Some of them weigh their words less carefully than the ultra-cautious Mr
Schlesinger. In addition, their remarks - either on or off the record - can
be influenced not just by the criterion of maintaining monetary rectitude,
but also by personal and political controversies around the council table.
All this means that leaks and indiscretions about the Bundesbank's views on
a possible EMS realignment are likely to continue. The Bundesbank has always
been sceptical about whether Britain could accept the anti-inflation
discipline inherent in the system. Mr Karl Otto Pohl, Mr Schlesinger's
predecessor, predicted two years ago that full British membership of the ERM
could lead to 'mass unemployment and enormous payments problems' in Britain.
As far as the chances for sterling or lira devaluation are concerned, the
formal Bundesbank view, and the private feeling of most Bundesbank
officials, is that the decision on realigning is basically up to individual
countries.
The Bundesbank can, however, hardly pretend that EMS tension is above all a
problem for others, since its high interest rates are a principal cause of
the present turmoil.
The central bank is not hatching a conspiracy to bring the EMS to its knees.
But, if the EMS does suffer a breakdown in the next few weeks, the
Bundesbank can hardly claim to have been nowhere near the scene.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Mollemann warns of German stagnation
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DRASTIC action must be taken to revive the competitiveness of the German
economy, and prevent a vicious circle of stagnation in the west undermining
recovery in the east, Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the economics minister, warned
yesterday.
In a thoroughly gloomy assessment of the state of the German economy, he
called for further tough measures to cut public spending in the west, to
boost transfers to the tottering eastern economy, and insisted that tax
increases could only be considered as the very last resort.
'The economy in west Germany is stagnating,' he declared. 'Most of the
economic indicators point downwards. The expected relief from (increased)
exports is not within reach.' As for east Germany, it was still far removed
from any self-sustaining recovery.
'The danger exists that our entire productive capacity will be overtaxed for
the foreseeable future.'
As the government, opposition, industry and trade unions appeared to be
manoeuvring towards the negotiating table to thrash out Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's proposed 'solidarity pact', further details emerged on the plight of
the east German economy.
The new Institute for Economic Research in Halle warned that the collapse of
eastern industrial production could get worse. The key engineering sector
had been badly hit by the collapse in trade with eastern Europe: in May this
year, it was producing just 25 per cent of its monthly output for the second
half of 1990.
Mr Wolfgang Roth, the economics spokesman of the opposition Social
Democratic party (SPD), called on the German government to make industrial
recovery in the east the highest priority on its agenda. A pick-up in
service industries, retail trade, banking and insurance could not provide
the basis for a genuine economic revival, he warned.
He said the government must admit the full plight of the eastern economy,
and the mistakes in its own policies, to make the planned round table talks
on a solidarity pact meaningful.
Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, made it clear that the government was
hoping for agreement on an outright wage freeze from the talks, the planning
for which will begin next week.
Mr Mollemann spelt out a string of tax reforms for industry he wanted, in
addition to the corporation tax reform for 1994 announced by Mr Waigel,
which would cut the rate from 50 to 44 per cent.
The trade unions, on the other hand, are adamant that a solidarity pact must
involve sacrifices from industry and the well-paid.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Issing firm on targets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank will not be deflected from its policy of pursuing firm
monetary targets by outside criticism or failure to meet these in the short
term, Mr Otmar Issing, a director of the German central bank, said
yesterday.
He told economists in Hamburg the Bundesbank's concept of setting
medium-term goals in line with expected growth in production was founded in
solid theory and had helped achieve the monetary stability to which the
Bundesbank was committed by law.
This strategy would not only be appropriate as part of a European monetary
union, he added, it was 'without any convincing alternative'. Mr Issing
spoke as financial markets continued to be nervous ahead of the French
referendum on Maastricht and as speculation continued about the Bundesbank's
intentions.
In a magazine interview, Mr Eberhard Martini, head of the German Banking
Association, said he expected the high discount and Lombard rates to be cut
at the start of 1993 at the latest and 'perhaps already in December'. He
cited signs of moderation on the wage front, notably union concessions to
help Lufthansa master its current crisis.
The Bundesbank has lifted German interest rates to present record levels -
the Lombard rate is at 9.75 per cent - to curb inflation and dampen monetary
growth.
Mr Issing said domestic influences on inflation, expected to average 3.5 per
cent in 1992, showed 'anything but cause to sound the all clear'.
Inflationary relief came almost wholly from abroad; in July, import prices
were 4 per cent down on a year ago.
He denied the Bundesbank was operating too rigid a policy based on 'sticking
blindly' to monetary targets. The central bank also considered other
factors. That a monetary target could not be achieved in a particular period
did not render the bank's concept obsolete.

squashed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FOREIGN currency dealers are well known for having an attention span of two
minutes. But yesterday, they were still discussing a news story which
surfaced on Wednesday night, suggesting the Bundesbank wanted to see a
devaluation of several European currencies, including sterling.
The story, published by an Anglo-French news agency on Wednesday,
immediately pushed the pound and the Italian lira down to new lows. Both
currencies recovered during trading in the North American market after the
Bundesbank, the UK Treasury and the Bank of Italy issued strong denials of
the rumour.
But the episode illustrated how nervous foreign exchange dealers have become
in the run-up to the French referendum on Maastricht on September 20.
'Rumours like this are coming in every 10 minutes in this market,' said Mr
Jim O'Neill, head of research at Swiss Banking Corporation in London.
'Rumours usually don't affect the foreign exchange market with this
frequency or intensity.'
At 4pm on Wednesday the AFX news agency, run jointly by Agence France-Presse
and Extel, issued a short story through its Frankfurt office. This said that
Bundesbank sources saw a realignment of the European Monetary System as
necessary, regardless of the result of the French referendum. The source was
quoted as saying that the Bundesbank believed the lira, peseta and sterling
were 'all candidates for devaluation'.
AFX had not directly interviewed a member of the Bundesbank. Its story came
from an internal circular written by an unnamed European bank. Yesterday,
the news agency refused to reveal its source, although several dealers
suggested the circular might have come from a big French commercial bank.
The report only came to the attention of the market at about 4.15pm, after
it was run by the Oracle television text service run by Britain's
Independent Television News. According to some market sources, the Oracle
text compressed the agency report, omitting its indirect nature.
A few minutes later, it was picked up in this form by the London stock
exchange's Topic news service and came to the direct attention of the
markets.
Sterling dipped to DM2.7808, its lowest point against the D-Mark since
Britain joined the Exchange Rate Mechanism. The lira was also heavily sold
and fell below L765, close to its ERM floor of L765.40.
At 5.30pm, both currencies started to recover as the Bundesbank, the Bank of
England and the Bank of Italy issued separate statements saying a
realignment of the ERM was out of the question. But there was intense
pressure on both currencies throughout European trading yesterday.
Analysts said the market had heavily over-reacted to the report. However,
its timing explained its impact. 'At some time in the next few weeks, we
will either see a realignment of the EMS or the Bundesbank will bring
interest rates down,' Mr O'Neill said. 'Anything which convinces the market
of one outcome or the other is bound to be sensitive.'

mourned only by communist faithful

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MOST OF the leaders of former communist Poland yesterday paid their last
respects to Mr Piotr Jaroszewicz, the former prime minister who was murdered
with his wife 10 days ago. However there were some conspicuous absentees,
with neither the Polish state, nor the government, nor the army in
attendance. As a communist, he was also buried without benefit of clergy.
Farewells were left to the old party cadres. Mr Edward Gierek, the former
communist chief, tanned and relaxed, signed autographs for his ageing
admirers. General Wojciech Jaruzelski, the general who briefly interned the
1970s leadership during martial law, hovered discreetly in the background as
did his prime minister Mr Mieczyslaw Rakowski.
But the man who best captured the fears stirred up by the murders was Mr
Jerzy Urban, the mouthpiece of the regime during martial law and now the
publisher of a highly-successful but scurrilous weekly. His tiny, rotund
figure and bald head was practically invisible behind a wall of mean-looking
bodyguards.
The still-unsolved murder shocked Poles, including those who cordially
detested the humourless, Moscow-loyal apparatchik who together with Mr
Gierek, picked up the pieces after police suppressed the 1970 Gdansk
shipyard revolt.
The bloody street fighting led to the downfall of party boss Wladyslaw
Gomulka, whose son was among yesterday's 5,000-strong crowd of mourners.
More important, it fatally undermined the prestige and long-term survival of
communism in Poland and beyond.
Once in power, Mr Gierek and Mr Jaroszewicz turned to western bankers and
government export-credit agencies to prop up their shaky regime. They sought
finance to import western factories and consumer goods. Western bankers,
flush with Arab oil money, were pleased enough to oblige.
Unfortunately, such transplants were not enough to heal the underlying
sickness of the communist economy and the Dollars 20bn borrowed in the
Gierek-Jaroscewicz years ballooned into Dollars 46bn through accumulated
unpaid interest. Significantly, bankers were not among yesterday's mourners
and sent no flowers.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Bank chief holds firm line: Short-term rates to remain high
until structural budget deficit is addressed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN'S short-term interest rates will remain high until the country's
government and its parliament agree on a strategy to eradicate Sweden's
structural budget deficit over the next two to three years.
This was the message delivered yesterday by Mr Bengt Dennis, governor of the
Riksbank, the country's central bank.
Over the past two days, he said, there had been a 'satisfactory response in
the markets' to the central bank's decision to lift its marginal interest
rate to commercial banks to a towering 75 per cent. He added that there had
been 'a substantial inflow of capital' as a result.
Mr Dennis, aged 62 and celebrating his tenth year as governor this month, is
also pleased at the unanimity among Swedish industrialists and politicians
in support for the authorities' fixed exchange rate policy and repudiation
of devaluation.
'We have learned from experience that devaluation was the wrong policy,' he
said. He added that 'no restrictions' were being imposed on the central bank
to use whatever means were necessary to defend the krona.
Mr Dennis reaffirmed that Sweden still wanted to achieve associate status
with the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System as soon as
possible, within a 2.25 per cent band with access to support from other
central banks and credit facilities. This would be in place before the
country joins the European Community, which would be in 1995 at the
earliest.
But the governor is anxious for the government to come up with a medium-term
plan to eliminate the structural deficit and satisfy the markets.
'The sooner we have such a policy the better,' he said, adding that at the
moment, 'there is no programme, no timetable, nor has parliament agreed on
any measures. This is what is troubling the markets'.
There was 'a long way to go' before the politicians focused on the budget
deficit problem. 'They have not got down to serious basics yet.' In the
current fiscal year the total budget deficit is believed to have more than
doubled, with some estimates suggesting it could be more than SKr160bn
(Pounds 15.66bn) compared with SKr68bn in the last fiscal year.
The central bank estimates that about half of that deficit is due to the
downturn in the business cycle and would disappear in a revival of the
economy, but the other half is structural.
Any determined action to reduce the deficit will mean painful cuts in a wide
range of government spending programmes which have made Sweden a model
welfare state. Politicians of all parties have been reluctant to confront
this problem because of the unpopular measures it would involve.
Parliament is not due to return from its summer recess until October 6.
'This makes it difficult for the government to carry out a dialogue with the
opposition parties in a meaningful way', Mr Dennis said.
The markets wanted to see the details of a package of measures designed to
eliminate the structural deficit. 'If the government and the Social
Democrats could agree on the main elements of a fiscal policy, the markets
would respond', he added.

MANY of Sweden's bank customers are worried that the unprecedented increase
in the marginal rate - the rate at which the central bank lends to other
banks - would be reflected in higher interest rates on home loans and
mortgages, Our Foreign Staff writes.
Svenska Handelsbanken, one of the biggest commercial banks in Sweden, told
customers yesterday that if they wanted to take out new loans, the bank
would not be able to provide any indication yet of where the interest rates
would be pitched.
Some mortgage lenders have already acted on the news and raised mortgage
rates. Statshypotek, a mortgage lender, raised its rate from 17.5 per cent
on Tuesday to 24 per cent yesterday. Sweden's main savings bank raised rates
on personal loans by 2.5 percentage points to 18-20 per cent.

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Lars Jagren, economist at the Federation of Swedish Industries, said the
large leap in interest rates would have a serious 'negative impact' on the
Swedish economy.
'Even if the rates come down, it is unlikely they will come down to their
previous level (of 13 per cent in the marginal rate) immediately.'
He warned that the high rates will curb consumer demand - which is already
weak - and probably lead to an increase in the number of bankruptcies, a
rise in unemployment (currently at a historic high of 5.8 per cent) and a
further decline in property prices.
The impact is likely to be much greater on smaller companies than on the big
groups, many of which are well insulated from the turbulence in Sweden
because a high proportion of their income comes from abroad.
Corporate Sweden was adopting an unconcerned attitude yesterday to the new
high short-term interest rates. Indeed, there was overwhelming public
support from the large private companies for the Central bank's drastic
action.
'Sweden needs the large companies but the large companies don't really need
Sweden any more,' explained Mr Marcus Storch, chief executive of Aga, the
industrial gas group.
Only about 10 per cent of his company's activities are within Sweden. 'We
are little affected by what is happening in the Swedish market. Aga can live
with the interest rates but I am less sure about our domestic customers.'
For Sweden"s internationally renowned blue-chip companies like Volvo,
Electrolux, Saab-Scania and Astra - the draconian domestic interest rates
play little part in their calculations.
'The short-term interest rate rises have no impact at all on us,' said Mr
Klaus Dahlback, chief executive of Investor, the largest Swedish investment
company in the Wallenberg sphere of interest. 'We fully support the action
the Central Bank has taken.'
Some companies could make short-term gains from the high rates as long as
they have liquid funds that can be used in the money markets.
'The short-term interest rates actually have a slightly positive effect on
our business,' said Mr Staffan Ternby, vice-president at Astra. 'We have
substantially more liquid funds than any interest bearing short-term
liabilities'.
Mr Lars Ramqvist, chief executive at Ericsson, the telecommunications giant,
agreed. 'We are in a fortunate position with a good liquid cash situation.
'We can even gain in the short term from these high interest rates.' But he
added that he supported the high interest rates as a 'warning signal to
Sweden'.
'It is better for us to stick to the present exchange rate value.'

FT  11 SEP 92 / 'Tax meter' unveiled to expose Italian dodgers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian finance ministry claims to have perfected a device to catch
tax-evaders.
It is called a 'redditometro' - literally an income measurer - but more
aptly it might be termed a 'taxmeter'.
In essence a computer model of a person's income is drawn up on the basis of
their possessions and the cost of their maintenance.
This is then measured against that individual's declared income. If
projected income exceeds more than 25 per cent of declared income, then the
tax-payer will be called to explain.
Against the back-drop of continuing large-scale tax evasion the authorities
want to have a reliable means to check declared income against real
earnings.
The government has previously relied on an unsophisticated system of
assessing 'real' income, backed up by casual checks from finance ministry
inspectors.
According to Mr Giovanni Goria, the finance minister who announced the new
'taxmeter' after Wednesday's cabinet meeting: 'The real novelty is not so
much in the philosophy but in its application which can now be applied on a
vast scale thanks to all the information technology available to the
ministry.'
Within a month of the proposal being approved by parliament, the tax
authorities will start sending a questionnaire to people suspected of
evading taxes asking for details about the size of the home and nature of
ownership, possession of cars, motorcycles, yachts, helicopters and
aeroplanes as well as household help.
Each item is graded on a scale of one to 10 to form the model projection of
the contributor.
Interestingly, the only items to be graded the potential maximum 10 points
are insurance policies and life insurance premiums - and indeed the latter
if divulged provide an accurate indicator of wealth.
Another indicator, telephones and telephone bills, are excluded.
But already the finance ministry has threatened to check a taxpayers'
electricity consumption to check the size of homes.
Critics argue the 'taxmeter' blurs the distinction between checking wealth
and income while the government maintains that in a country where there is
chronic tax evasion the assessment of wealth must be used as a means to
establish income.
The authorities have carefully chosen to ask people to declare those items
whose ownership can be easily checked in existing registers.
Successive Italian governments, partly reflecting the authoritarian controls
of Mussolini times, have established an ever growing jungle of bureaucracy
surrounding the purchase of items like cars, the transfer of property or the
supply of public services. Italians are asked to divulge a large number of
intrusive details about themselves.
However, until now the country's tax authorities appeared never to have
co-ordinated such information.
In theory, computers have made this possible. But equally the tax
authorities' threat to be more intrusive could encourage the evaders to be
even smarter, and in turn create even more bureaucracy.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Sweden awaits return of the 'hot money'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SWEDEN'S commercial banks have a total of SKr46.6bn (Pounds 4.56bn) in
borrowings outstanding from the Riksbank, the central bank, but the
Riksbank's graduated ladder of interest rates means that only SKr1.6bn of
these funds attract the top marginal rate which yesterday reached 76 per
cent.
A rate of 75 per cent applies to the next SKr4.4bn of borrowing.
As the banks borrow more from the Riksbank, the higher rates of interest
come into play.
Each individual bank has its own interest rate scale which is set according
to its capital base.
Riksbank officials estimated that the average overnight lending rate would
be about 22 to 24 per cent for banks borrowing from the central bank.
The central bank governor, Mr Bengt Dennis, refused to comment on how long
the marginal rate would be kept at such a high level.
However, there was speculation in the financial market that the marginal
rate may be lowered in stages after the weekend.
The effect of the rise in the marginal rate was to push up money market
rates, and draw so-called 'hot money' back to Sweden.
Foreign and domestic investors bought Treasury bills and bought forward
contracts on the Swedish krona in order to take advantage of the high
returns currently available.
Foreign and domestic investors were described as enthusiastic buyers of the
Treasury bills during Wednesday and yesterday.
The rate on three-month Treasury bills ended at 24 per cent yesterday. This
compared with less than 15 per cent on September 1.
The rate on six-month Treasury bills reached 19 per cent yesterday.
The Riksbank said that investors had also been buying forward contracts on
the Swedish krona in order to benefit from the difference in currency
interest rates.
According to Mr Dennis, the decision to raise the marginal rate to such high
levels was intended 'to send a very strong signal to the market that we mean
business' and to deter speculation in the currency.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Italy takes the offensive in battle for its currency: The
government has stirred even the most somnolent back-benchers with its latest
effort to streamline economic decision-making
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GIULIANO Amato, the Italian prime minister, has taken a leaf from the
military text-books: when out-numbered, surprise is the best form of attack.
In proposing on Wednesday that parliament approve a law delegating to the
cabinet wide powers in the event of an economic emergency, Mr Amato has
stirred even the most somnolent back-benchers.
Yesterday, the 54-year-old Socialist prime minister had to deploy all his
considerable talents to explain his intentions. The partners in the
government coalition - the Christian Democrats, Socialists, Social Democrats
and Liberals - swung behind him as parties. But individual party members
voiced misgivings, while the opposition Reconstructed Communism declared the
move an 'attempted coup d'etat'.
Nevertheless, Mr Amato's move has placed on the table an issue which
parliament can ignore only at the nation's expense. The government says
existing legislative procedures are out of step with the rapid decisions
necessary at a time of financial turbulence. Italy faces a foreign exchange
crisis.
The lira has hovered at its floor in the European Monetary System for two
months and the discount rate has been raised since last week to what is seen
as an unsustainable 15 per cent.
This situation has been triggered by scepticism in the financial markets
about the ability of any Italian government to carry out tough measures to
reduce a huge debt and improve public finances, to bring the country into
line with its European partners.
Part of the scepticism derives from the record of successive Italian
governments who have ducked unpopular measures despite promises of mending
their ways. But the markets are also worried about the time it takes the
government to turn policy into legislation.
For instance, the law allows parliament three months to debate the annual
budget, and parliamentary procedures allow amendments, which can emasculate
the original proposals. Italy's coalition governments with narrow majorities
(the Amato government has a 16-seat majority in the Chamber of Deputies)
also mean that special interest groups can enjoy disproportionate influence.
The procedures themselves are time-consuming. Debates in commission and full
house are repeated in the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies. Thus the
emergency economic package designed to raise an extra L30,000bn was
announced on July 10 and the government used a vote of confidence to push it
through in record time, but even so, it took a month.
The situation is more dramatic now. On July 10 the government announced its
intention to reform pensions, public health, local administration and the
civil service as the centre piece of money-saving in its 1993 budget.
Mr Amato is hoping to obtain parliament's approval for delegated authority
to provide the details of these reforms; but parliament still has to approve
the outline reforms. Until this is done, the budget cannot be properly
prepared, and this has to be presented to parliament by the end of the
month.
The current state of nervousness, compounded by worries over the French
referendum on Maastricht, has forced the government to behave like a
conjuror pulling rabbits out of a hat. This lay behind the cabinet decisions
on Wednesday to try to appease the markets with a plethora of measures and
intended measures.
These included the selling-off of Credito Italiano, one of the top five
commercial banks, and Nuovo Pignone, the heavy engineering subsidiary of
ENI, the state oil concern.
Equally, the absence of sufficient evidence from Italy's body politic to
confront tough decisions was reflected in yesterday's performance of the
lira, which again touched its floor against the D-mark in the ERM.
Yesterday, Mr Amato told the Senate he was aware of their concerns that the
emergency powers should not be to the detriment of parliament's sovereignty.
He proposed 15 representatives of each house should form a monitoring
committee in the event that the law be approved and invoked.
Further, he insisted that it would be for the governor of the Bank of Italy,
as an impartial observer, to decide when circumstances merited the
government invoking emergency powers.
But he warned that the inter-dependence of international economies meant
Italy had to respond to fast-changing events with speed, otherwise 'there
could be real damage affecting employment, raising prices, labour costs,
inflation - effects which only can be avoided by measures which are
introduced immediately'.
At present, the Bank of Italy is the sole institution with such powers of
quick response, but these are limited to monetary and foreign exchange
intervention.
Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, governor of the Bank of Italy, yesterday was
cautious in assuming the role of arbiter thrust upon him. Mr Ciampi, who has
been outspoken in calling on politicians to endorse an effective economic
policy, suggested a collegiate structure might be more appropriate to judge
when the government might invoke emergency economic powers.
Mr Amato's logic is hard to dispute and even if the proposal is rejected, he
has succeeded in rudely reminding the politicians what is at stake. With its
existing parliamentary mechanisms and internal party bickerings, Italy has
few tools left to avert a sustained and worsening foreign exchange crisis.
On the other hand, if the measure is approved, it will be one further nail
in the coffin of the traditional exercise of party power in Italy and could
encourage greater technocratic government - an example which the two months
of Amato government have already set.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Ukraine may bring back state controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KIEV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Ukrainian government is to reintroduce state control of wages and
prices, according to an economic action plan to be presented to parliament
next Tuesday.
The economic blueprint reflects the pragmatic and heavy-handed approach of
its author, Mr Valentyn Symonenko, first deputy prime minister.
The proposals of his more reformist predecessor, Mr Volodymyr Lanovoy, were
praised by western experts but strangled by government infighting. However,
Mr Symonenko, who has been granted wide powers to rule the Ukrainian economy
by decree, has already won the approval of Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian
president, and Mr Vitold Fokin, the prime minister. If parliament backs his
proposal next week, the plan will represent an unprecedented political
consensus on what to do with Ukraine's faltering economy. Mr Symonenko has
warned that Ukraine has fallen victim to a dangerous inflationary spiral of
rising wages and prices.
In a diagnosis that echoes the International Monetary Fund's report on
Ukraine, the plan identifies the ballooning budget deficit, the collapse of
the financial system and the deterioration of inter-republican trade as the
main sources of Ukraine's economic malaise. When the IMF visited Kiev last
week, their request for a written copy of the programme was denied. The IMF
has yet to see the complete programme.
Mr Symonenko's remedy is, in the short-term, to tighten administrative
control over all sectors of the economy. In the long term, the plan insists
that Ukraine is headed for a market economy and views privatisation and the
introduction of a separate Ukrainian currency as the main forces to propel
it along that path.
Mr Symonenko's plan calls for stricter limits on the emission of credit and
a curbing of the budget deficit, already running at Rbs69.6bn.
Concrete proposals for reining in the deficit include ending the disastrous
practice of allowing state enterprises to cover their own financial
shortfall out of the government's budget, restricting industrial and
agricultural subsidies, which currently place the greatest strain on the
budget, and making the funding of all government programmes conditional on
the government having sufficient revenue.

FT  11 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Amec shares fall 10% on dive to Pounds 11m
and halved interim pay-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMEC yesterday became the third large UK construction company this week to
cut its interim dividend.
The group is halving the payment to 2p following a first half pre-tax
profits fall of 52 per cent, from Pounds 21.9m to Pounds 10.6m. Turnover
fell by 9 per cent to just over Pounds 1bn.
Wimpey and Taylor Woodrow both announced dividend cuts earlier this week
after incurring first half losses.
Amec's share price, which had fallen by almost two thirds since May, tumbled
a further 10 per cent yesterday to 60p as fully diluted earnings per share
slipped to 2.7p (6p).
The stock market, which had expected a dividend reduction was surprised by
the announcement of an unexpected Pounds 12m loss on the company's
Australian business. The losses included Pounds 5m of provisions against
hotel, shopping and office developments in Sydney and Melbourne.
Sir Alan Cockshaw, chairman, said conditions in the Australian market were
difficult due to previous over-building in the commercial sector.
The company had cut its Australian workforce by half, which led to labour
disputes resulting in cost over-runs on some developments. It was also
proving difficult to persuade customers, themselves under pressures from the
collapse of property markets, to pay bills.
Sir Alan said that the provisions were more than enough to cover any
liability on the contracts and that the Australian business was expected to
break even in the second half.
He said that the reverse had offset a resilient performance in the UK, where
profits were roughly similar to those in last year's first half which 'was
an excellent performance in very difficult market conditions.'
Mechanical and electrical engineering profits in the UK and Europe, helped
by acquisitions and settlement of claims, jumped from Pounds 12.4m to Pounds
22.1m.
Against this, building and civil engineering profits, reflecting difficult
conditions in UK commercial and industrial property markets, were more than
halved from Pounds 11.6m to Pounds 4.7m. Housebuilding and property
development incurred a loss of Pounds 2.3m (Pounds 1.3m).
The US, where the group has been cutting back its mechanical and electrical
operations in depressed oil and gas markets in Louisiana, saw losses
increase to Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 1.3m).
The company had a net cash outflow of Pounds 60m in the period reflecting
timing of payments, seasonal factors and lower turnover which left it with
net cash of Pounds 15m at the end of June.
The group is continuing to cut costs where it can - the workforce is
expected to be reduced by a further 10 per cent this year.
COMMENT
Amec's worldwide mix of businesses, with its weighting towards mechanical
and electrical engineering, had been considered to be better suited than
many of its rivals for riding out the construction recession. What these
figures show is that no construction company is immune from the downturn.
The complexity and higher value of m/e work means that when things go wrong
it can be very expensive, as Australia shows. On the positive side, Amec has
a stronger balance sheet and has shown a keen ability for generating cash
from its businesses. With no sign of any recovery and fears that another
Australia may be waiting to mug the group it is difficult to recommend
anything more than a hold, notwithstanding its previously good cash
management record. A pre-tax profit of Pounds 25m puts the shares on a fully
diluted prospective p/e of 10.

FT  11 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Falling demand cuts Blue Circle to Pounds
42.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST HALF pre-tax profits of Blue Circle, Britain's biggest cement
manufacturer, fell by a quarter, from Pounds 57.5m to Pounds 42.7m, as
demand for building materials continued to fall faster than companies could
cut costs, writes Andrew Taylor.
Profits from UK cement, concrete and aggregates during the six months to
June 30 fell from Pounds 20.4m to Pounds 12.3m. The company said that,
despite rationalisation, UK cement plants were still working at only 75 per
cent capacity.
The fall in profits would have been greater but for stronger performances
from the US, Chile and Aalborg in Denmark.
Profits from domestic products, bathrooms, boilers and radiators, were only
slightly lower at Pounds 23.1m (Pounds 23.4m).
The group, as it promised in June when it raised Pounds 241m in a rights
issue, is maintaining the interim dividend at 3.75p although this is
uncovered by earnings of 3.5p (6.2p) in the first half.
The rights issue cash, which cost shareholders 200p a share, has been used
to buy Celsius, the French manufacturer of domestic heating products.
Yesterday Blue Circle's share price was unchanged at 134p.
The effect of the Celsius purchase will be to reduce the proportion of the
group's domestic products sold in the UK from 80 per cent to 60 per cent,
said Mr Jim McColgan, Blue Circle's chief executive.
He said that worldwide turnover from cement and domestic products rose from
Pounds 530.8 to Pounds 539.7m in the first half. This was despite a 10 per
cent fall in UK cement volumes.
In the US cement, concrete and aggregate profits rose from Pounds 1.3m to
Pounds 1.9m, helped by higher volumes and previous cost-cutting. In Chile,
cement profits rose from Pounds 6.1m to Pounds 9.4m.
Unfortunately, there was no sign of any recovery in UK markets for either
cement or domestic products, according to the chief executive.
Volume sales of home products had fallen by 6 per cent in the first half.
The success of the sector was closely tied to the fortunes of the housing
market, said Mr McColgan. About 60 per cent of bathroom sales were prompted
by people moving home.
Net debt at the end of June stood at Pounds 190m compared with Pounds 306m
at the end of December. Lower interest paid on UK cash deposits however
meant that overall interest charges rose slightly from Pounds 10.2m to
Pounds 12.6m.
Gearing at the half year, if Pounds 90m of convertible bonds is included as
debt, was 27 per cent.
COMMENT
The current over-capacity in Blue Circle's cement operations is worrying and
points to further plant closures and redundancies unless sales pick up -
which is unlikely. Cement volumes are expected to decline by about 8 per
cent this year. The outlook for domestic products also looks uninspiring
given the importance of a healthy housing market to sales. Many continental
European markets also are suffering, although not as much as in the UK.
Profits of Pounds 105m pre-tax would put the group on a prospective p/e of
about 15 times. The shares are at best a hold in the current nervous
climate.

PRE-TAX PROFITS of the London Forfaiting Company rose from Pounds 6.61m to
Pounds 8.42m for the six months ended June 30. Trading income improved by
Pounds 2.98m to Pounds 10.9m.
Bank interest receivable and income from certificates of deposit totalled
Pounds 1.92m (Pounds 4.38m) while interest payable was cut to Pounds 312,000
(Pounds 2.29m). That left net income before expenses up 25 per cent at
Pounds 12.5m, against Pounds 10m.
Earnings per share worked through at 6.41p (5.02p) and the interim dividend
is stepped up to 2.9p (2.625p).
The directors said that during the period borrowings were further reduced
and the company continued to be a net depositor with bank interest received
exceeding interest payable by Pounds 1.6m.
During the six months the USM-quoted company, which provides finance in
connection with international trade, concentrated on strengthening its
overseas offices.
Directors believe trading will continue 'satisfactorily' in the second half.

Pounds 6.4m

<TEXT>
BODYCOTE International, the metal technology, packaging and textiles group,
reported a 16 per cent increase from Pounds 5.52m to Pounds 6.4m, in pre-tax
profits for the six months to June 30.
The increase partly reflected the acquisition in March of Industrial
Materials Technology, which has two plants in the US, and IMT Europe, based
in Belgium, from National Forge Company of Delaware.
The two acquisitions contributed about Pounds 600,000 to profits.
Despite the current economic conditions the group said all its divisions
continued to trade satisfactorily, showing increases in both profit and
turnover.
Turnover showed an advance of 14 per cent from Pounds 32.6m to Pounds 37.3m
and earnings per share increased to 14.5p (13.4p).
The interim dividend goes up to 3.75p (3.5p).
The metal technology division, which now accounts for 62 per cent of group
profits, is expected to continue to be the main source of future growth.
With nil gearing at present the group said the second half should show a
healthy liquidity position, despite a Pounds 5.5m capital investment
programme this year.

FT  11 SEP 92 / UK Company News: RTZ shares rebound on 3% rise to Pounds
295m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN RTZ, the world's biggest mining company, yesterday rebounded by
22p to 514p after the group reported a 3 per cent improvement in pre-tax
profits for the first half of 1992 and said it would maintain its interim
dividend at 6p.
RTZ's shares fell 19p in heavy trading on Wednesday after investors became
jittery because of unexpectedly poor results from English China Clays, the
world's largest producer of china clay.
RTZ's pre-tax profit rose from Pounds 286m to Pounds 295m. Net attributable
earnings, which RTZ suggested is the most relevant measure of its
performance, was also up by 3 per cent, from Pounds 154m, or 15.6p a share,
to Pounds 158m, or 15.8p.
Mr Bob Wilson, chief executive, said that, while the group's balance sheet
remained very strong, it would have sent the wrong message if the dividend
had been increased.
No improvement in metals prices or trading conditions was expected in the
second half-year, nor was there any indication that 1993 would be anything
but flat. He said there would be no dividend increase until RTZ could see
clearly the chance of a significant improvement in market conditions and
earnings.
The marginally better performance, in spite of lower metals prices,
reflected Pounds 26m of extra volume, mainly from new projects coming into
production, and tight cost control.
Gearing was reduced from 27 per cent to 25 per cent but capital expenditure
was down only slightly, from Pounds 149m to Pounds 147m.
In the face of difficult economic conditions RTZ continued to press for
efficiency improvements and there was a 3 per cent, or net 2,000, reduction
in its world-wide workforce.
The UK operations have been particularly badly hit with a reduction of 6,000
or 20 per cent of the workforce at RTZ Pillar since the begining of the
recession in 1989.
Group turnover was virtually unchanged at Pounds 2.28bn (Pounds 2.27bn). An
extraordinary loss of Pounds 30m was recorded on the recent sale of a 51.5
per cent interest in Rio Algom of Canada.

FT  11 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Laing fall restricted to 11% and dividend
maintained
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHN LAING yesterday brought a brief moment of cheer in a chill week for
construction companies which has seen three of its larger rivals announce
dividend cuts, writes Andrew Taylor.
Laing managed to restrict its pre-tax profits fall to just 11 per cent to
Pounds 5.6m (Pounds 6.3m) and maintained its interim dividend at 3p.
This was covered by earnings per share of 4.5p (4.8p).
At the end of June the company had net cash of Pounds 10m, compared with
borrowings of Pounds 13.2m at the same stage last year.
The share price rose 11p to 120p.
In the first half there was a small loss on housing in the UK and US. Both
markets remained very difficult said Mr Martin Laing, chairman.
He criticised the government's failure to stimulate the economy, while the
jobless total was mounting and construction companies were going into
receivership.
COMMENT
Laing's reputation as a quality contractor is not misplaced. The company has
displayed an admirable ability to generate cash. It has been helped by some
big contracts won in the late 1980s, when margins were higher, and which
have still to be completed. The current order book is about 25 per cent
lower than in June last year, which may not be a bad thing. It may indicate
that the group is choosy about what work it takes on. Laing, like others,
continues to struggle with housing. It says further provisions are not
required at this stage, but much will depend upon whether house prices have
finally reached bottom. The company, however, plans to take about Pounds 20m
a year out of housing over the next three years. In the current year it may
make Pounds 18m, which would put it on a prospective p/e of just over 8. One
of the few companies in the sector which might just justify a buy
recommendation.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE African National Congress last night pulled back from the brink of
confrontation with the South African government by agreeing that Mr Nelson
Mandela, the ANC leader, should accept Pretoria's invitation to meet
President FW de Klerk to address the question of political violence.
The decision to hold talks with the government over violence which earlier
this week claimed the lives of more than 20 people in the Ciskei black
homeland represents a victory for the moderate faction of the ANC, which is
committed to negotiating a new constitution for South Africa.
It was an important move to defuse one of the country's most serious
political crises since Mr de Klerk launched his political reform programme
in 1990.
During a two-day meeting of the policymaking national working committee of
the ANC, which ended last night, powerful voices within the organisation's
leadership were raised in favour of halting negotiations altogether, and
pursuing mass protest actions to weaken the government. However, leading
moderates won the day, arguing that Mr Mandela should meet Mr de Klerk,
subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions. These included the release
of remaining political prisoners, the banning of dangerous weapons in public
and action to reduce violence emanating from hostels in black townships.
Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, the ANC secretary-general, said he was ready to meet Mr
Roelf Meyer, the minister of constitutional development, as early as today
to prepare for a summit between the ANC and National party leaders.
He said ANC leaders would welcome a visit from a UN representative to
mediate in the crisis - a move proposed earlier in the day by Mr Pik Botha,
foreign minister.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Major stresses solid opposition to devaluation: Pound's
realignment would be 'betrayal'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR last night staked his government's political authority on the
value of sterling with an uncompromising refusal to contemplate devaluation
in the European exchange rate mechanism.
In a speech billed by Downing Street as unequivocal evidence of his
determination to resist the speculation on currency markets, the prime
minister said a realignment of the pound's ERM parity would be 'a betrayal
of our future'.
Senior aides said the comments were intended to signal that even if other
European currencies were devalued against the D-mark in a general ERM
realignment, the government would seek to hold sterling's central rate at
DM2.95.
But the speech coincided with a new survey from the Confederation of British
Industry which suggested there was little chance of a recovery in consumer
confidence before the end of the year.
More than two-thirds of retailers, who continue to suffer from consumers'
fear of losing their jobs and high levels of household debt, said they did
not expect the business situation to improve over the next three months.
Wholesalers and car traders expected conditions to worsen.
As the pound continued to hover just above its DM2.7780 floor on the foreign
exchange markets, the survey pointed to a reversal during the summer of a
modest improvement in the annual growth rate of retail sales earlier in the
year.
Sterling closed in London unchanged on the day at DM2.7875. In New York it
rose to DM2.7917, although it shed nearly 2 cents against the dollar which
was strengthened by Mr Major's remarks that the ERM's problems were being
exaggerated by the weak US currency.
The government came under further attack yesterday from senior
industrialists who urged action to help economic recovery.
Mr Major's remarks came as Sir Michael Angus, CBI president, voiced concern
at the same meeting about the depths of the recession. He said that, while
business supported the government's stance over the ERM, he believed other
measures could be taken to stimulate recovery.
Elsewhere Mr Martin Laing, chairman of the building group John Laing,
criticised the government's failure to stimulate the economy while
unemployment figures were mounting and construction companies were going
into receivership. Sir Owen Green, chairman of BTR, described market
conditions as an 'economic desert'.
Mr Major, who used the first cabinet meeting since the summer break to
congratulate Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, on his handling of the
currency turmoil, detailed the arguments against any devaluation.
Mr Lamont delivered a report to cabinet on the Treasury's strategy in
countering speculation against the pound. Although there was no discussion
of the strategy, senior ministers said the consensus around the cabinet
table was that the government has long been too deeply committed to the
present value of the pound to allow room for doubts.
One senior minister commented after the meeting that: 'Even those who would
have preferred not to have started from here (the present ERM parity)
believe there is no going back'.
The prime minister, speaking to the Scottish CBI in Glasgow, insisted that
the ERM had delivered the low inflation and the relative exchange rate
stability demanded by the business community. Maintaining sterling's parity
was essential to ensure that Britain preserved and improved on those gains.
Dismissing the inevitable 'chorus of quack doctors' calling for a reversal
of policy, Mr Major said: 'As the chancellor has made crystal clear, there
is going to be no devaluation, no realignment.' He continued: 'The soft
option,the devaluer's option, the inflationary option would be a betrayal of
our future; and it is not the government's policy'.
Mr Major, who repeated that defeat of inflation was a precondition of
sustained economic success, dismissed the arguments of those blaming the ERM
for the depth of the recession.
The painful 'problem of adjustment' after the build up of business and
individual debt was apparent throughout the industrialised world.
Alluding to the failure of past devaluations to deliver a sustained
improvement in Britain's competitiveness, he added: 'We must bite the
anti-inflation bullet or accept that we will be forever second-rate in
Europe.'
Ministers were predicting that the publication today of inflation figures
for August would further demonstrate that price rises were being brought
under control.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Fat rascals rescue the US dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN tourists worried that their currency will not stretch to three
meals a day in over-priced Britain can rest assured: a thin dollar still
buys a fat rascal.
Hungry Americans can find the cake-cum-scone at Taylors Tea Rooms in York,
where they sell for only Pounds 1.85 each. A mere Pounds 3.20 will buy a
Palace Ploughmans (bread, cheese and salad) at the Crystal Palace pub in
Bath.
With American tourists wincing at British prices, the British Tourist
Authority has come up with some less-than-overwhelming illustrations of how
affordable Britain is.
The culinary bargains cited above appear in a book called Amazing Britain -
How to have an amazingly affordable holiday in Britain this year. The BTA is
handing out 250,000 free copies in the US.
The book sings the praises of Norwich ('An amazing corner of East Anglia'),
Stratford-upon-Avon ('Where the Bard comes amazingly to life') and Glasgow
('An amazingly cultural city').
But it is London which is the main UK attraction.
The BTA says it has carried out a survey of 17 cities which found that
London was only the eleventh most expensive, being cheaper than cities like
Tokyo, Rome, Brussels, Paris, Amsterdam and Frankfurt. When it came to
shopping, the BTA claimed London was the cheapest of the lot. Mr William
Davis, the BTA chairman, said yesterday that London 'is still one of the
greatest capitals in the world.' But he wrote in the authority's annual
report: 'There is no doubt that people's desire to visit Britain is largely
determined by their image of London, which regretably, has become more than
a little tired, even tarnished.' Amazing Britain invokes DH Lawrence, who
once said: 'The English . . . are the nicest people in the world . . .' but
says this now applies equally to the Scots and Welsh. Amazing.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Gillette in Pounds 285m Parker Pen deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER and NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GILLETTE, the US toiletries and shaving products group, is writing itself a
much bigger role in the world pen market with the Pounds 285m purchase of
Parker Pen.
Parker, based in the UK since a Dollars 100m (Pounds 51m) management buy-out
from its US parent in 1985, said yesterday it had decided against seeking a
stock-market flotation.
By adding Parker to its Paper Mate and Waterman brands, Gillette should
double, to 15 per cent, its share of the world's Dollars 5bn writing
instrument market Parker claims to be the world leader in ballpoint pens and
roller balls, making about 53m a year.
Up market, where Parker sports the Pounds 3,000 18-carat gold Premier
Presidential, it makes 6m pens a year and reckons to rank second to Mont
Blanc, which is owned by Dunhill.
Mr Gerry Grimstone, the Schroders director who organised the sale, said that
when Pounds 15m to Pounds 20m of profit-related payments were added to the
purchase price, plus the assumption of Pounds 45m debt, the deal was worth
Pounds 340m.
Mr Jacques Margry, Parker's chairman and chief executive, who owns 2 1/2 per
cent of the company, said flotation had been rejected because it would have
raised only about Pounds 265m.
Parker was nearly sold to Pentland Industries for about Pounds 180m in 1988,
but the deal foundered on warranties and indemnities.
Mr Margry started with Parker 43 years ago 'in the service department
learning how to dismantle and maintain pens', then predominantly fountain
pens and propelling pencils.
As area manager in Europe, he felt the US parent company - which later
changed its name from Parker Pen to Manpower - erred in the 1980s when it
tried to push the pens downmarket, a fiercely competitive segment suited to
mass production experts such as Bic. 'After the MBO, we returned to our
origins which was to make good quality pens.'
In its last year under its US parent it lost Dollars 20m. In the 12 months
to February 1992, Parker made Pounds 29.5m pre-tax on sales of Pounds 181m.
About 60 per cent of Parker's sales are in Europe, 17 per cent in North
America, 15 per cent in Asia and the Pacific and 8 per cent in Latin
America.
Paper Mate sales, which are strong in North and Latin America, concentrate
on products costing Dollars 5 or less. Waterman's greatest strength is in
the Dollars 50-plus segment. Parker sells heavily in the Dollars 5 to
Dollars 50 range.
Boston-based Gillette bought Paper Mate in 1955 and Waterman in 1987.
The beneficiaries of the sale will be Parker's management, which owns 31 per
cent, Schroder Ventures with a similar amount, the Parker family 16 per
cent, and Electra and Chemical Ventures, 10 per cent each.
The deal must be approved by regulators in various countries.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Arts: June Moon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HERE'S a twist: not another musical to lift downcast spirits during the
recession, but a well turned play about creating popular music which both
enables the cast to enjoy a song and dance finale and the audience to leave
the theatre smiling.
June Moon was the only collaboration between Ring Lardner and George S
Kaufman and was a Broadway hit during the Great American Depression.
It surfaces brightly at Hampstead with hopes of a West End transfer and its
snappy dialogue, racy characters, and boy gets girl plot are all in its
favour.
Fred (charmingly played by Adam Godley) is an aspiring lyric writer from
Schenectady. On the Pullman train to New York he meets Edna (Maria Gough)
who is his perfect match in naivety and ordinariness.
With the lovelight in his eyes, Fred suddenly realises that June rhymes with
moon, and, can you believe it, so does spoon. Edna helpfully adds macaroon.
Fred is a Holy Fool, totally in tune with popular taste, and 'June Moon' is
an instant hit.
But Tin Pan Alley is a treacherous place and Fred's innocence is threatened
by Eileen (Susannah Fellows) who knows how to spend his advance.
With the help of the wise cracking Maxie (Frank Lazarus) who plays Cupid,
the plot twists to a happy ending.
What lifts June Moon above an enjoyable PG Wodehouse style yarn is the
setting.
Tin Pan Alley in 1929 was a factory at full capacity, with song writers in
their cubicles churning out songs like 'Ain't Misbehavin', 'Singin' in the
Rain' along with many hundreds more that never made it.
Lardner and Kaufman lay bare the hard cheerless graft of it all, with Paul
(Neil McCaul) living off the glory of his one hit 'Paprika' and the aspiring
Benny (Clive Walton) playing his novelty number 'Hello Tokyo' to the window
cleaner for want of an audience.
Behind the optimistic numbers and the sentimental numbers, the marriages of
the writers crack up and the power of the publisher corrupts.
Designer Michael Holt, helped by a revolve, makes the tiny Hampstead stage
seem quite spacious.
Godley, all nervous body language and guilless charm, is a good foil to the
New York sophisticates, and Lazarus, the in-house pianist, has all the best
lines. 'The tune's easy to remember and if you forget, it doesn't make any
difference' is his laid back reaction to most new songs.
Director Alan Strachan has effectively scaled down June Moon to a chamber
musical play.
There seemed to be plenty of moist eyes to go with the lifted spirits at the
end, which should be a winning combination.
Hampstead Theatre, Swiss Cottage Centre, London NW3, (071) 722 9301

FT  11 SEP 92 / Pounds 12m cash for homes 'unused'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT money intended for refurbishing redundant space above city-centre
shops is not being used, Living Over the Shop (Lots), a project set up at
York University in 1989 to arrange for housing associations to use spare
space above shops, said yesterday.
The reason was a mismatch between the location of the properties and the
location of councils with funds, Lots said.
Ms Ann Petherick of Lots said yesterday that 80 per cent of the 600
properties available on the project's database for refurbishment were in
towns where there no funds were available.
She said most of the Pounds 12m available this financial year from the
Department of Environment and the Housing Corporation remained unused.
The department has budgeted Pounds 5m for living-over-the-shop schemes this
year, Pounds 15m in 1993-94 and Pounds 10m in 1994-95. It said it was quite
satisfied with the administration of the funding. 'The cash is based on bids
from local authorities, so we are dependent on what they ask for,' it
explained.
If a council does not use the funds during the fiscal year for which they
are requested they revert to the Treasury. Ms Petherick said some of the 80
councils which have funds are struggling to spend them. She suggested that
funds should be allocated to properties not to authorities.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Business faces rising tax burden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS is facing a growing burden of advance corporation tax which it
cannot offset against its tax bill in the UK, according to a study released
yesterday.
It shows that ACT rose to 34 per cent of the total tax charge on quoted
companies in 1991, compared with 23 per cent in the previous year.
The analysis, by DM Collins &amp; Associates, a financial consultancy,
calculates that quoted companies collectively incurred liabilities of Pounds
6.6bn for the 1991 financial year.
ACT is the tax a company must pay on its dividends - currently at the rate
of a third of the gross dividend. It can be offset only against the tax on
profits earned in the UK, up to a maximum of 25 per cent.
Companies that derive much of their profits from overseas and those in which
ACT exceeds a quarter of the total tax bill are unable to offset the full
charge.
A study last year by the London Business School estimated the total for such
irrecoverable or 'surplus' ACT at more than Pounds 3bn and growing at Pounds
400m a year.
Yesterday's study called for clear disclosure in company accounts of ACT. It
says the largest ACT payers are the oil and gas and conglomerates sectors.
The largest single ACT payer last year was BP, the oil company, at Pounds
600m.
Business has complained that the growing ACT burden restricts its
competitive position by generating a large tax bill and restricting
dividends. Mr Norman Lamont, in his last Budget speech, acknowledged that
surplus ACT was a handicap to business.
The latest figures from the Inland Revenue show that in the 1989-90 tax year
the exchequer received Pounds 7.78bn in ACT payable for the year for all
public and private businesses.

<TEXT>
THE LEADER of the NUCPS Civil Service union is expected next week to advise
acceptance of a controversial pay deal that his members had previously
rejected.
If Mr Leslie Christie's advice is accepted by the union's executive, it will
mean that all Civil Service unions have concluded pay deals this year that
will lead to significant extensions of performance pay.
Mr Christie was unavailable for comment yesterday but it is thought that
after meetings with Treasury officials this week he has concluded that
continued rejection of the offer might result in the loss of a long-term pay
agree-ment.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Fernando Collor of Brazil last night was granted an extra week to
prepare his defence to the Congressional commission considering whether he
should be impeached for corruption, Christina Lamb reports from Braslia.
The Supreme Court ruled that Mr Collor will have until September 22, instead
of next Tuesday as was scheduled.
Mr Collor's aides greeted the decision as his first victory in the
impeachment battle.
The delay may mean that no Congressional vote on impeachment would occur
until after the municipal elections to be held on October 3. Presidential
advisers believe that would increase his chances of survival.
Earlier yesterday, though, Mr Jorge Bornhausen, Mr Collor's political
co-ordinator, resigned. He was angered by Mr Collor's refusal to include his
suggestions in a speech to the nation 10 days ago.

<TEXT>
MR JOHN McNamara, a car dealer on New York's Long Island, has pleaded guilty
to charges that he defrauded General Motors in a Dollars 6bn loan racket,
and that he used some of the money to bribe local officials so as to win
approval for real estate schemes.
The fraud has embarrassed GM's finance arm, General Motors Acceptance
Corporation, which has a reputation for strict credit controls. It has led
GM to shake up the subsidiary's management, and the group was forced to
write off Dollars 171m in loans.
Mr McNamara, aged 53, borrowed billions of dollars from General Motors over
more than a decade to finance the purchase of cars which did not exist. He
used new borrowings to pay off old debts, while siphoning off part of the
money for his own Dollars 400m business empire. He faces up to 20 years jail
and Dollars 800m in fines.

TWO US Air Force F-16 fighter jets yesterday intercepted what was believed
to be an Iraqi fighter violating the no-fly zone over northern Iraq but no
shots were fired in the brief encounter, the Defence Department said, Reuter
reports from Washington.
Mr Pete Williams, Pentagon spokesman, said the French-built F-1 Mirage jet
flew approximately three miles north of the 36th parallel but left the zone
as it was intercepted.
'It simply quickly turned south and retreated below the 36th parallel,' Mr
Williams told reporters. 'It is a technical violation of the no-fly zone. We
don't know whether it was advertent or inadvertent.'

<TEXT>
THE South African government yesterday stepped up its propaganda campaign
against the African National Congress in the wake of the Ciskei massacre,
appealing to the United Nations to put pressure on the ANC to stop what it
called 'provocative actions which put at risk the lives of innocent South
Africans'.
The appeal came in a 21-page memorandum from Mr Pik Botha, South Africa's
foreign minister, to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, and the
Security Council. Pretoria asked for a UN representative to visit the
country urgently to mediate between the government and ANC.
Relations between the two sides have fallen to new lows after the Ciskei
shooting. Mr Botha warned the government was ready to 'take steps of a
coercive nature' to handle violence.
UN monitors, deployed as a result of the July visit of UN envoy Cyrus Vance,
are to arrive within days.
As Mr Botha released the memorandum to the press, the ANC's top
policy-making body, the National Working Committee, met for a second day to
determine its response to the Ciskei shooting, for which it holds Pretoria
responsible. The committee is understood to be split between militants who
believe all negotiations with the government should be abandoned, and
moderates who argue that negotiation is South Africa's only chance.
Winnie Mandela, estranged wife of African National Congress leader Nelson
Mandela, has resigned her top posts in the movement because of 'a vicious
and malicious' campaign against her, Reuter reports from Johannesburg. In a
statement issued late on Wednesday night, Mrs Mandela said she had resigned
from the ANC's policy-making national executive committee and its women's
league.

<TEXT>
NATIONAL Semiconductor, the US semiconductor chip manufacturer, reported
slightly higher than expected first-quarter earnings and a 15 per cent
increase in sales.
Net earnings for the quarter were Dollars 21.9m, or 17 cents per share,
compared with a loss of Dollars 168m, or Dollars 1.64 per share in the same
period last year when the company took a restructuring charge of Dollars
149.3m as it consolidated manufacturing operations. Sales for the first
quarter of fiscal 1993 rose to Dollars 472.4m from Dollars 411.0m in last
year's first quarter.
'Earnings for the first quarter reflect on-going improvement in
profitability as we continue our business turnaround activities,' said Mr
Gilbert Amelio, president and chief executive.
'We have now had four consecutive quarters of profitability.'
As part of its worldwide manufacturing realignment, National recently
completed the transfer of one of its most advanced production lines to
Greenock in Scotland.
The company said that its manufacturing lines are now working at
approximately 79 per cent of capacity, up from about 70 per cent a year ago.
National said that the normal seasonal slowdown in business over the summer
months was smaller than usual.
New orders booked during the quarter were up substantially over the previous
year's first quarter.
'Although we have seen some improvement in the semiconductor market, there
are still few clear signals regarding trends in the worldwide economy,' Mr
Amelio said.

FT  11 SEP 92 / International Company News: Bertelsmann net income up 6%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GUTERSLOH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BERTELSMANN, the German publishing, music, and commercial television group,
has made a favourable start to its current financial year and expects its
earnings growth to surpass the 6 per cent rise in net income to DM570m
(Dollars 407.1m) it managed in 1991-92.
Mr Mark Wossner, chief executive, said: 'We are satisfied with the
development so far in 1992-93.' He expected turnover and profits to rise by
around 10 per cent.
Turnover in the financial year to June 30 1992 rose by 10 per cent to
DM16bn, of which 38 per cent was achieved in the buoyant domestic market.
Operating profits were 16 per cent higher at DM1.4bn before start-up costs
on new projects of DM310m - sharply up from DM183m - and tax.
Mr Wossner said the jump in these costs partly reflected the need to take
full ownership of a Berlin publishing venture after the death of Mr Robert
Maxwell, whose Maxwell Communications was a partner in the project.
Bertelsmann has also been investing in newspapers in east Germany, the
Premiere pay-TV channel in Germany, and new music labels in the US and UK,
as well as expanding its book club activities. It has also begun a new
business magazine, Capital, in France.
Mr Siegfried Luther, the finance director, said most of the turnover
increase came from existing businesses and around 2 per cent from new
ventures such as newspapers in Dresden and Berlin. Cash flow was 8 per cent
higher at DM1.3bn and net indebtedness down considerably from DM363m to
DM43m.
In the US, where Bertelsmann owns RCA music and the Doubleday, Dell, and
Bantam publishing operations, Mr Wossner said economic weakness had affected
business. 'Our profits are under strength there,' he said.
The Doubleday book club was now in profit after heavy losses. In publishing
and recording, Bertelsmann was investing heavily on restructuring and
business growth. North American turnover is 22 per cent of the total.
Group investments rose to DM2.8bn from DM2.2bn, although Mr Wossner said
spending would come down to around DM2.5bn this financial year. The group
defines its investments to include marketing efforts to recruit new book and
music club members, as well as licensing rights and fees for new
publications and recordings.
The company also announced a move to make its DM725m of interest-bearing
participation certificates more attractive. These carry no vote and are
quoted. Bertelsmann will give up its rights to buy these back at historical
values lower than today's market prices in return for greater flexibility in
fixing the terms of future issues.

DE NATIONALE Investerings-bank, the Dutch banking group with strong links to
the government, has set up an Ecu500m Euro-medium-term note programme in a
move to expand and diversify its funding base.
The programme will be used to 'tap the international capital markets on a
more systematic basis' than in the past, said Mr Peter van der Lugt, a
member of the DNIB board of managing directors.
The bank's borrowing programme is set to increase from Fl 2.5bn (Dollars
1.57bn) this year to more than Fl 3bn in 1993, as its balance sheet grows.
Also, demand from corporate clients for loans denominated in dollars has
increased its need for foreign currency borrowing.
In future, About half of the bank's funding will be sought in the
international capital markets, through the MTN programme and Eurobond
offerings.
The programme, arranged by Morgan Stanley, has been rated AA plus by
Standard &amp; Poor's and Aa3 by Moody's.

A US bankruptcy court judge yesterday gave Trans World Airlines, the
bankrupt US carrier, a green light to go ahead with its plan to sell a 45
per cent stake to its three unions, in exchange for wage concessions. Under
the proposed deal, creditors would get the remaining 55 per cent in return
for forgiving much of TWA debt, writes Nikki Tait.
The deal, however, still needs ratification from the unions. And TWA's
emergence from bankruptcy still requires a resolution to the dispute between
the carrier and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the federal agency
which underpins pension benefits in the US. The PGBC claims that TWA pension
plans are underfunded by Dollars 1.2bn, and wants the airline's owner, Mr
Carl Icahn, to make good the deficit.

<TEXT>
PARAMOUNT Communications, the publishing and entertainment group which last
month agreed to buy a string of US theme parks for Dollars 400m, yesterday
unveiled a 12 per cent rise in net profits for its third quarter, ended July
31.
Net income was Dollars 113.3m, or 95 cents a share, compared with Dollars
101.2m, or 86 cents a share in the same period of 1991. Revenues for the
three months were Dollars 1.06bn, against Dollars 963.9m.
Publishing operations, led by traditional second-half strength in
educational areas and gains in consumer publishing, reported Dollars 112.5m
of operating income, up only marginally year-on-year.
Entertainment operations, including the Hollywood studio, had Dollars 60.8m
of operating income, compared to Dollars 55.3m in the same period last year.
Paramount also earned Dollars 10.7m of net interest and other income in the
quarter.
Results from theatre operations declined because of lower contributions from
Paramount's Famous Players and partly-owned Cinamerica chains.
Madison Square Garden posted a smaller operating loss, thanks largely to the
leasing of the arena for the Democratic National Convention in July.
For the first nine months of Paramount's fiscal 1992, net profit totalled
Dollars 160m, a solid recovery from Dollars 38.9m in the first nine months
of fiscal 1991. Revenues for the period were Dollars 3.06bn, against Dollars
2.72bn.
On Wall Street, Paramount's share price closed yesterday at Dollars 45, up
by Dollars 1 1/8.

COLES Myer, Australia's biggest retailer, has declared a scrip issue and
higher dividend after a modest rise in earnings and sales in the year to
July.
The company is making a five-for-four scrip issue and lifting the effective
annual scrip-adjusted dividend to 17.33 cents a share from 16.44 cents,
after net profits edged ahead to ADollars 370.7m (USDollars 266.6m) from
ADollars 368.2m.
Sales rose 1.6 per cent to ADollars 15.18bn from ADollars 14.94bn and Mr
Peter Bartels, chief executive, said the company's performance in the early
weeks of the current year gave cause for optimism.
'In maintaining our profitability this year we were significantly assisted
by reduced debt, lower interest rates and excellent cost control at the
corporate level,' he said.
Mr Bartels said the company had reduced its total debt in the year by 39.5
per cent to ADollars 807.5m in the year from ADollars 1.34bn. With cash
proceeds from the sale of New Zealand-based Progressive Enterprises during
the year, net debt was reduced by 65 per cent to ADollars 433.4m.
Net interest expense was down from ADollars 167.0m to ADollars 88.1m.
Among the group's best performers was its core department store division,
lifting pre-tax profits to ADollars 163.1m from ADollars 157.8m, but
supermarket earnings fell to ADollars 179.0m from ADollars 199.3m. K mart
earnings dived to ADollars 94.5m from ADollars 155.7m.
The result followed a tax provision of ADollars 200.4m (ADollars 201.1m
previously) and depreciation ADollars 277.2m (ADollars 255.8m).

FT  11 SEP 92 / International Company News: Feud hits Yamatane restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE restructuring of Yamatane Securities, the Japanese broker, has become
complicated by a feud within the company's founding family and by an ongoing
disagreement with the leading banks supposed to fund the restructuring.
Yamatane, which reported a Y25.4bn (Dollars 206.5m) net loss last fiscal
year, confirmed yesterday that it would close a Swiss subsidiary
specialising in equity-linked bonds, and said it is studying a plan to cut
senior management staff by 40 per cent and total employees by 30 per cent.
But doubt remains over the fate of the broker's former chairman, Mr Tomiji
Yamazaki, who is still on the board and has yet to relinquish his control
over the company, in spite of repeated requests from the banks and from his
family.
The Yamazaki family is at the centre of the unfolding drama that has
embarrassed the securities industry. Japanese financial newspapers have
provided daily reports on the feud between Tomiji and his brother, Seizo,
who runs Yamatane Corporation, a warehouse operator and food distributor.
Some of Yamatane's problems are characteristic of those of other second-tier
brokers, most of which reported losses last year. The company has been
bruised by the fall in stock prices and turnover, and is now regretting its
rapid expansion during the 1980s.
Yamatane was also investigated by the finance ministry for its role in the
'tobashi' scandal, in which brokers shuffled stocks around client accounts
to avoid booking losses. However, some of those clients discovered that they
were left holding the losing stocks, leading to at least four legal actions
against Yamatane.
In an attempt to return to profit this year, the company appealed to its
main banks - including Sakura Bank and Mitsubishi Trust and Banking - to
provide funds for a restructuring, and hinted that it would otherwise begin
offloading its bank stocks. Sakura sent two managers to the company, but
found that Tomiji Yamazaki continued to direct management decisions.
Mr Tomiji Yamazaki, who says renovating the company is his 'responsibility',
also appealed to his brother, Mr Seizo Yamazaki, for assistance, but the
latter was dismayed by the scandal that the Yamatane name had attracted.
Seizo's company, which has a 6.2 per cent stake in the broker, has its own
profit problems, as the economic downturn has hurt the warehousing business
and its property interests.
The Yamatane group was built by their father, Taneji. He dispatched the sons
to separate companies in the belief that they would argue if put together,
but they still managed to fall out.
The daily twists in the family saga and the broker's tortured relationship
with the bankers have left its workers wondering if they will be among the
first lay-offs at a leading Japanese company.
On Tuesday, Yamatane said that a new agreement was reached for
reconstruction and on Wednesday, the pact was said to have fallen through. A
Yamatane Securities spokesman said that 'we really don't know what is going
on at the top - it's difficult for us to tell from down here'.
Sakura Bank, destined to play an important role in overhauling the troubled
broker - in which it has a 4.9 per cent stake - said 'negotiations are
continuing'.

APPLE COMPUTER is to restructure its worldwide manufacturing operations with
the loss of 345 jobs. The US personal computer manufacturer will take a
pre-tax charge of about Dollars 20m against earnings in the current quarter
to cover the costs of the changes.
In order to lower its manufacturing costs and deliver products quicker to
customers, Apple will shift some manufacturing operations closer to the
markets they serve.
'By combining our manufacturing and distribution activities, we will be able
to respond to customer needs quickly and efficiently, while significantly
reducing our manufacturing costs,' said Michael Spindler, Apple president.
In Europe, Apple will cut about 45 jobs at its plant in Cork, Ireland, as a
result of 'cost efficiency measures'. This is despite plans to shift some
assembly work currently performed at Apple's Singapore plant to Cork.
Apple said it will also open a new facility in Apeldoorn, the Netherlands,
in December 1992, to provide system configuration and direct shipping
services for the European market.
In the US, Apple will close its manufacturing plant in Freemont, California,
and shift part of this operation north to Sacramento, where it plans to open
a distribution facility.
Singapore will become a final assembly operation for Japan, Australia, and
Asia. Apple will transfer final assembly for the US and Europe to those
regions.

SKr1.37bn
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PROCORDIA, the Swedish food and pharmaceutical conglomerate jointly owned by
Volvo and the Swedish state, announced yesterday it was acquiring for
SKr1.37bn (Dollars 267.3m) Swedish Match, the world's leading match and
disposable lighter manufacturer.
At the same time it also revealed that it was selling its sugar producing
subsidiary for around SKr2.4bn to Danisco As, Denmark's sugar producing
company, which will bring Procordia around Skr600m profit.
Swedish Match, which is owned by a consortium of international companies
including Citicorp Venture Capital in London, will become a subsidiary of
Procordia's tobacco and confectionery business, United Brands. It is hoped
that the agreement can be finalised on 15 September. Mr Klaus Unger, vice
president of the company's United Brands division, said yesterday that the
products of both businesses complemented each other and provided strong
possibilities for co-operation in the European consumer market.
The purchase of Swedish Match will provide Procordia with a company that has
an annual turnover of around SKr2bn and employs 4,400 people. As a result of
the acquisition, the Swedish company's United Brands division will have a
SKr8bn annual turnover, with nearly 10,000 employees.
Swedish Match was once run by the famous Swedish industrialist Mr Ivar
Kreuger who shot himself after his empire collapsed in 1931.
Swedish Match has had several owners since it was bought in March 1988 by
Stora, the Swedish forestry group, for SKr5.9bn. In November 1989 Stora sold
Swedish Match consumer products, which included Wilkinson Sword, for
SKr3.93bn to a group of international investors, including Gillette of the
US.
As a result of this the Monopolies and Mergers Commission in the UK
investigated the sale and ruled that Gillette had to undo the effect of the
merger in the UK market.
Commenting on the sale of its sugar business - Sockerbolaget - to Danisco,
Mr Goran Linden, Procordia's vice president, said that the deal would ensure
a stable future for the Swedish sugar industry.
He added that the divestment was also in line with the company's strategy to
divest itself of all but its core business in food, pharmaceuticals and
bio-technology. The acquisition will make Danisco the fourth largest sugar
producer in Europe.

FT  11 SEP 92 / International Company News: Pinault sale raises FFr1bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PINAULT has strengthened its financial position by concluding a FFr1bn deal
with Credit Lyonnais, opening the way for the investment bank to take a 20
per cent stake in the enlarged capital of the timber company which is being
transformed into a retailer.
'This operation gives Financiere Pinault supplementary financial means so
that it can pursue its development,' the company said.
The French press reported yesterday that Pinault might be interested in
buying the French arm of the Habitat furniture chain which is owned by the
UK Storehouse group. Such an acquisition could make a good fit with
Pinault's existing Conforama furniture chain. But both sides declined to
comment on the reports.
However, Ms Patricia Barbizet-Dussart, deputy managing director of Pinault,
added that Pinault may use the additional funds to move into new areas away
from retailing altogether.
Another financial priority for Pinault, which recently took over the Au
Printemps retail group, has been to drive down its high level of debt which
rose to FFr15.5bn after clinching the controversial acquisition at the end
of last year.
Last month, Pinault succeeded in selling one of its original timber
businesses, Isoroy, to the German Glunz group for an undisclosed sum and
indicated that it was looking for other means of raising capital.
Clinvest, the investment arm of Credit Lyonnais, will inject FFr1bn of new
capital into Pinault's financial holding company, Financiere Pinault, in
return for its 20 per cent stake. The holding company's other main
shareholders are Mr Francois Pinault - the group's aggressively
entrepreneurial founder - and his family.
Clinvest already controls 7.55 per cent of the capital of Pinault and 7.42
per cent of its voting rights.

<TEXT>
BACARDI, the Bermuda-based international rum company, has paid more than
Dollars 1.5bn for a majority stake in Martini &amp; Rossi, the Italian vermouth
and wines group.
This emerged from industry sources yesterday as Bacardi confirmed a
Financial Times report of a deal between the two companies to create the
fourth largest drinks group in the world.
A statement from JP Morgan, Bacardi's financial advisers, said Bacardi had
agreed to make 'a significant investment' in General Beverage Corporation,
Martini's Geneva-based holding company, but did not disclose the terms of
the transaction.
Bacardi would work in partnership with General Beverage, the statement said.
'This transaction will give the two groups reciprocal access to their
distribution networks around the world.
'The Martini &amp; Rossi group's wide range of products will also complement
Bacardi's product line.'
Their joint portfolio of brands will include the two best selling alcoholic
drinks in the world - Bacardi rum with annual sales of 22m cases, and
Martini vermouth with sales of 17m cases.
Martini also has a range of other drinks including Otard, the sixth-ranked
cognac, Benedictine liqueur, Offley port and William Lawson Scotch whisky.

SOUTH AFRICA'S third largest mining house, Johannesburg Consolidated
Investment (JCI), yesterday revealed a 5.3 per cent rise in earnings to 298
cents a share for the 12 months ending June 30 from 283 cents a year
earlier, AP-DJ reports from Johannesburg.
Net profits rose by 5.2 per cent to R439.6m (Dollars 159.80m) from R418.0m
while the annual dividend is being raised to 133 cents a share from 132.7
cents.
JCI expanded its coal operations in 1990 with the purchase of 40 per cent of
the Middelburg Colliery.
Mr Pa Retief said the company had no intention of listing its coal interests
on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange while the business was so vulnerable.
'We'd rather go to the market at a more opportune moment,' he said.
Platinum profits fell by 39 per cent to R120.1m from R196.2m, which had a
big impact on the group's overall earnings.
Diamond contributions to the group were down 13 per cent to R68.8m from
R78.8m. He said the diamond industry was very difficult to forecast at the
moment. JCI's gold interests suffered from higher costs stemming from the
country's average 15 per cent inflation rate as well as low gold prices, it
said.

NATIONAL Semiconductor, the US semiconductor chip manufacturer, reported
slightly higher than expected first-quarter earnings and a 15 per cent
increase in sales.
Net earnings for the quarter were Dollars 21.9m, or 17 cents per share,
compared with a loss of Dollars 168m, or Dollars 1.64 per share in the same
period last year when the company took a restructuring charge of Dollars
149.3m as it consolidated manufacturing operations. Sales for the quarter
rose to Dollars 472.4m from Dollars 411.0m a year earlier.
'Earnings for the first quarter reflect on-going improvement in
profitability as we continue our business turnaround activities,' said Mr
Gilbert Amelio, president and chief executive.
'We have now had four consecutive quarters of profitability.'
The company said that its manufacturing lines are now working at
approximately 79 per cent of capacity, up from about 70 per cent a year ago.

<TEXT>
BTR Nylex, the Australian industrial group controlled by BTR, has defied the
recession with a solid profit and dividend lift in the first half of 1992.
Net earnings rose 20 per cent from ADollars 153.2m to ADollars 183.8m
(USDollars 132.2m) on a 14 per cent sales boost to ADollars 2.61bn (ADollars
2.28bn).
The interim dividend is up from 4.5 cents to 4.75 cents.
Directors said the group had not experienced any real improvement in demand
in its main markets. They indicated earnings had benefited most from
restructuring, cost reductions and contributions from acquisitions.
The effect of acquisitions was mainly evident in the newly-created corporate
activities division which lifted pre-tax profit from ADollars 28.2m to
ADollars 56.8m.
The other main improvement came in the packaging division, which lifted
pre-tax profits to ADollars 158.5m from ADollars 124.2m. The construction
products and resources side lifted its contribution from ADollars 43.8m to
ADollars 55.5m.

losses

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORWAY'S ailing financial sector has suffered losses on loans and guarantees
of an estimated NKr80bn (Dollars 14.3bn) in the past decade, according to
the Banking, Insurance and Securities Commission, the country's financial
watchdog. The bulk of the sector's losses have occured during the last four
years.
BISC's composite figures for the first half of this year - which cover
commercial banks, savings banks, finance companies and credit institutions -
indicate that the worst may be behind the sector with interest earnings
showing signs of revival as costs are being reduced.
First-half combined net interest earnings rose to NKr10.81bn from NKr10.39bn
last year as costs fell to NKr8.2bn from NKr9.2bn.
Last year was by far the sector's bleakest year with combined losses hitting
a record NKr21.33bn; in other words Norway's financial institutions operated
at a loss of NKr58m a day in 1991.
In the first six months of this year the sector's combined losses have been
reduced to NKr5.3bn from NKr8.1bn in the same period last year. BISC
believes the latest figures may indicate that losses for the year as a whole
could be lower than last year's record level.
'This is dependent on (Norway's) economic development in the second half.
Experience shows, however, that losses have been greater in the second half
than the first half.'
The level of second-half credit losses is uncertain and the securities
markets have developed more weakly as money-market rates increased,
From end-June 1991 until end-June this year the sector has reduced combined
assets by an estimated NKr70bn to NKr740bn, or by 9 per cent.

ranges of personal computers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines and Apple Computer are launching inexpensive
personal computers aimed at individual and small business buyers in an
effort to reclaim ground lost to 'clones'.
IBM made the first move with the introduction this week of 21 models
incorporating different combinations of standard hardware and popular
software.
All are expected to sell in the US for under Dollars 2500 (Pounds 1250).
Apple will follow next week with the announcement of long anticipated
'consumer' versions of its Macintosh personal computer, with prices expected
to start at under Dollars 1000.
Slow growth in the corporate PC market has forced the companies to target PC
buyers who pay out of their own pockets including home office professionals
and small business proprietors.
The PC makers are broadening their distribution channels to include more
retailers to reach these customers.
IBM is also expected to follow Compaq Computer by adopting the 'direct'
sales approach , by phone and mail. Smaller manufacturers such as Dell
Computer have found this method successful.
IBM's new PS/1 desktop models and PS/note portables are the first to come
from the its newly autonomous PC division, announced last week, called the
IBM Personal Computer Company. The new PS/1s are grouped into three areas
aimed at different types of users.
This is in line with the increasing segmentation of the PC market.
IBM's Essential line is aimed at the person who buys for a small business.
It will be sold in the US through office warehouse stores that sell a range
of office supplies at discount prices.
The PS/1 Expert line is for the more sophisticated buyer who may already own
a PC. It will make its debut in the special superstores selling computer
equipment and accessories.
The PS/1 Consultant line, for people who work at home, will be sold in
department stores such as Sears and Montgomery Ward.
IBM's expansion into retail distribution follows a similar move this week by
Compaq Computer, which announced that its budget-priced computers,
introduced in June, will be available in US superstore chains. Similarly,
Apple Computer is renewing its efforts in the retail channel.
For IBM, the PS/1s are the first step in an overhaul of its PC products.
Later this month it will unveil new Premium systems, updating its current
PS/2 product line for corporate customers. Also planned is a Value Point
line of PCs to be sold through direct mail as well as an expanded line of
portable computers.
IBM's competitors, however, are not standing still. Dell Computer plans to
expand its mail order services to include a broad range of products from
other manufacturers.
Everex Computer, another US PC maker, in a move that indicates that the PC
price war is far from over, slashed its prices this week by up to 50 per
cent on some models.

UCB, the Belgian pharmaceuticals and chemicals group, expects slower profit
growth in the second half of 1992 compared with the 43 per cent rise
reported yesterday for the first six months, Reuter reports from Brussels.
'The second half of the year has not taken off too badly, but prudence
incites me to say that growth will not be as high as in the first half,'
said Mr Georges Jacobs, UCB's chairman of the executive committee. Profits
for the first half jumped to BFr1.49bn (Dollars 51.4m) from BFr1.04bn in the
previous corresponding term. Net profit rose to BFr1.57bn from BFr1.01bn.
The increase was due to the good performance in UCB's three sectors of
activity, said Mr Jacobs.
The chairman said the target date for the approval of Zyrtec in the US
remained early 1993, while he hoped to get the approval in Japan in 1994.
Mr Jacobs said UCB, which currently has 15 per cent of its sales outside
Europe, aimed to double its non-European sales before the end of the decade.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Greek government under fire: Ex-ministers joining the attack
on pension reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREECE'S conservative government, wrestling with the public sector unions
over pension reform, has come under attack from a group of prominent
ex-cabinet ministers opposed to its tough new economic policy.
The dissidents claim they represent the ruling New Democracy party's social
conscience. But their populist call for gentler handling of the economy, if
heeded, could wreck Greek efforts to meet the Maastricht targets for
European union.
In August, Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis, after months of
prevarication, finally gave the green light for launching painful reforms
urged by the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund.
A revenue package, including a 30 per cent increase in petrol prices, was
followed by privatisation of the strike-plagued Athens bus company. The
dismissal of 8,000 workers, the first large-scale purge of public sector
workers for many years, set the stage for a decisive confrontation between
government and the unions.
The measures also provoked the populists in New Democracy, a party still
dominated by old-fashioned patronage politicians, to step up their campaign
to undermine the technocrats who have taken over at the economic ministries.
Divisions in the party deepened as Mr Mitsotakis moved away from the
populist faction - whose laissez faire approach to the economy influenced
his first two years in office - to back Mr Stefanos Manos, the economy
minister, and his energetic team drawn from outside the New Democracy ranks.
The dissidents this week publicly criticised the new pension law being
debated in Parliament.
Although the legislation was approved in principle yesterday, both Mr
Athanassios Kanellopoulos, former deputy prime minister, and Mr Antonis
Samaras, former foreign minister, have said they will oppose several of its
clauses.
The political atmosphere is already highly charged after two weeks of
strikes by workers in the power company, state-controlled banks, transport
and telecommunications organisations which are crippling industry and
disrupting everyday life.
While the populists say they are as enthusiastic as anyone in Greece about
European union, they appear reluctant to accept that only a radical overhaul
of the pension system can have an impact on reducing the public-sector
deficit and overall debt in accordance with Maastricht requirements.
This year Greece will spend almost 15 per cent of the country's gross
domestic product on pension outlays, the largest single item of government
spending. The population is ageing faster than in any other EC country. The
main pension funds, chronically short of contributions and often mismanaged,
are sunk in debt.
It is clear the government cannot afford to maintain the generous policies
of the past, with many public-sector workers receiving pensions equivalent
to 90 per cent of their salaries well before reaching their sixties. The new
law, drafted with the help of advisers from the IMF, Britain and Germany,
aims at gradually raising the retirement age to 65. Contributions will be
increased, while new entrants to the workforce will have to accept that in
future pensions will represent a much smaller percentage of salaries.
However, strong unions like the electricity and bank workers, able in the
past to secure extra wage increases and special benefits from the ruling
party because of their power to bring the economy to a halt, are fiercely
resisting reform.
Moreover, Mr Andreas Papandreou, the opposition leader, has been quick to
exploit the unions' challenge, calling on members of his Panhellenic
Socialist Movement to take to the streets in support of the strikers.
Despite his avowed support for Maastricht, Mr Papandreou has boosted the
unions' cause by pledging to repeal the pensions law if he returns to power.

THE first Western researchers to investigate the Arctic waters north of
Russia for nuclear waste said yesterday that preliminary tests showed no
radiation from such waste believed dumped by the Soviet Union, AP reports
from Oslo.
A Norwegian-Russian team returned to Kirkenes in Arctic Norway yesterday
after a three-week expedition in the Kara Sea, a formerly closed area near
Russian naval bases and a nuclear weapons test site, the Norwegian news
agency NTB reported.
A Norwegian official said the scientists were only allowed to take samples
at 11 points selected by the Russians, and were denied access to the most
interesting areas.
Greenpeace has claimed that the Soviets dumped 17,000 containers of atomic
waste, as well as 15 nuclear reactors, in the Arctic oceans. Mr Aleksander
Mikhailov, a nuclear safety official in the Russian port of Murmansk, has
said that the Soviet Union dumped radioactive waste in the Kara Sea as
recently as last summer.

<TEXT>
MR CONRAD BLACK, the Canadian entrepreneur who owns London's Daily
Telegraph, last night suffered a major setback in his quest to acquire The
Daily News, the loss-making New York tabloid that used to be owned by the
late Mr Robert Maxwell.
A key aide to Mr Black said that after meeting the two largest and most
powerful of the newspaper's unions it had been decided to 'adjourn
temporarily our negotiations for The News'.
Mr Martin Maleska, the New York investment banker representing Mr Black in
the Daily News talks, said the decision came after leaders of the pressmen
and drivers unions made clear they favoured a rival offer from Mr Mortimer
Zuckerman, the owner of US News and World Report, the weekly news magazine.
The two unions represent 600 of the 2,000 employees at the Daily News.
Their co-operation is needed if a deal is to be consummated.
'We met with the pressmen and drivers unions and we decided we could not,
realistically, match Mr Zuckerman's proposals. So we have ceased our
negotiations with the drivers and pressmen this afternoon,' Mr Maleska said.
Mr Maleska added: 'We have been the lead horse in this race and we are now
realising that Mr Zuckerman has a commanding position vis-a-vis the major
unions, a position we cannot match.'
Mr Black had previously obtained a letter of intent from the management of
The Daily News, which last year filed for protection from creditors under US
bankruptcy law.
Any takeover still needs the approval of the unions and the creditors, as
well as Judge Tina Brozman of New York's bankruptcy court.

BMW, the German luxury car company, has appointed Mr Horst Teltschik, the
former foreign policy adviser to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, to its management
board to head a new department handling environmental, transport, and trade
issues.
Mr Teltschik, 52, played an important role in helping to shape policy ahead
of German reunification in October, 1990, before leaving to become head of
the foundation which controls Bertelsmann, the big publishing, music, and
electronic media concern.
The foundation concentrates on cultural and political research programmes.
He will leave the foundation to join BMW in January.
His appointment reflects a growing awareness among German car companies of
the need to develop a more comprehensive, co-ordinated, and far-sighted
policy on international issues which affect their business, but are not
directly connected with manufacturing.

<TEXT>
Correction (published 14 September 1992) appended to this article.
THE UNION Bank of Finland, one of the country's leading private commercial
banks, is in discussions over a merger with the new state-owned Savings Bank
of Finland.
The proposed financial conglomerate is seen as part of a much wider
restructuring of Finnish banking taking place against of mounting debt
losses and weak operating performance.
A merger would be welcomed by Finland's hard-pressed centre-right government
which has already provided about FM28bn (Dollars 6.31m) in loans and
guarantees to prop up the banking system. Government sources believe further
support will be needed soon.
Last autumn the Central Bank had to take control of Skopbank, then the
country's fourth largest bank and the clearing bank for the savings banks to
rescue it from collapse.
The Central Bank sold its holding in Skopbank to the government's guarantee
fund in June. As a result of the rescue the Central Bank has already lost
about FM6.9bn.
But the Union Bank is believed to be laying down strong conditions for any
merger or other arrangement with the Savings Bank which has emerged from a
merger of 41 Finnish savings banks, including Skopbank.
CORRECTION
UNION Bank of Finland is negotiating with the Finnish government's bank
guarantee fund to buy Skopbank and not Savings Bank of Finland as reported
in the FT on September 10. Other parties are also negotiating to acquire
Skopbank.

Pounds 2.8m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 11 September 1992) appended to this article.
Avonside Group, the housebuilder floated by Cannon Street Investments in
March, produced turnover of Pounds 25.9m and a pre-tax profit of Pounds
2.82m for the first half of 1992.
'A creditable achievement for a group almost wholly dependant on the housing
market', said Mr Christopher Glynn, chairman.
The figures compared with a pro forma Pounds 24.5m and Pounds 3.41m
respectively in 1991.
The housebuilding division sold 125 units (94), the increase reflecting a
deliberate switch of emphasis to the relatively stronger market for lower
priced units and starter homes.
Earnings per share were 4.37p (5.26p) and the interim dividend is 1.8p.
CSI floated 69 per cent of the capital at 106p per share; yesterday the
shares were 74 1/2p.
CORRECTION
Cannon Street Investments has no stake in Avonside Group, the housebuilder
it floated earlier this year. Yesterday's edition of the FT stated CSI had
floated 69 per cent.

FT  10 SEP 92 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: BAe to sell satellite and
telecom services arms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Correction (published 14 September 1992) appended to this article.
BRITISH AEROSPACE is planning to abandon its remaining interests in
satellites with the sale of its communications services division as well as
its satellite-making business.
It has offered both businesses for sale as a package and Matra Marconi
Space, the Anglo-French joint venture 51 per cent owned by Matra and 49 per
cent by GEC, wants to buy them.
If successful, it would dispose of the services side to a third party, said
Mr Claude Goumy, chairman, yesterday.
Matra Marconi Space has been in talks with BAe for almost a year over the
sale of the satellite manufacturing side. But last month the fate of the
division was thrown into doubt when Deutche Aerospace said it was also
interested.
The BAe board is likely to indicate the fate of both businesses when it
publishes its interim results on September 23.
Turnover of the space and communications services operations was Pounds 121m
in 1990, the last time the figure was separated in the company's accounts.
Sales two years earlier were Pounds 136m.
The communications services division has not previously been acknowledged as
being for sale.
It includes Bishopsgate Systems, which operates private telecommunications
and has clients in the City of London, Starbird Satellite Services, which
provides television news gathering via satellite, and Satellite Management
International which provides equipment and expertise for ground to satellite
links.
BAe said yesterday that these areas had been identified as 'non-core
businesses'.
BAe's satellite manufacturing side has seen orders dry up in the past two
years. In June it halved the 1,200 workforce at its Space Systems plant in
Stevenage in a move interpreted by senior executives in the space industry
as a slimming exercise before disposal.
It is a victim of increasing competition on the world stage as more
contracts go to open international tender.
European manufacturers have reacted to the increased competition by forming
two camps in an attempt to cut costs and compete with the market leader,
Hughes Aircraft of the US.
Dasa is allied with Aerospatiale and Alcatel of France and Alenia of Italy.
This group also has 49 per cent of a US company Space Systems/Loral, with
the US company Loral, holding the other 51 per cent.
The second group is the GEC-Matra joint venture Matra-Marconi, which has
ties with ANT, the space arm of Bosch of Germany.
CORRECTION
British Aerospace sold its 50 per cent stake in Starbird Satellite Services
to World Wide Television News on July 30 last year. Due to incorrect
information supplied on behalf of the company, Starbird was reported as
being part of BAe in a Financial Times report on September 10.

PEPSI-COLA International, part of the US PepsiCo group, is to form a joint
venture with Lion Nathan, the New Zealand brewer, to produce, distribute and
market PepsiCo soft drinks in Australia and New Zealand, the companies
announced yesterday.
The joint venture would have combined sales of more than NZDollars 200m
(USDollars 107.5m) in a highly competitive market.
Lion Nathan, the biggest liquor group in Australasia, has been the sole
producer of Pepsi products in Australia since 1990. The venture will also
incorporate the New Zealand operations owned by Pepsi.
It will be 83 per cent owned by Lion Nathan and 17 per cent by Pepsi. The
companies said the equity stakes reflected the values of their respective
businesses.
The venture will be managed by Lion Nathan, which last year had sales of
more than NZDollars 2bn.
Mr Douglas Myers, chief executive of Lion Nathan, said his company had
invested heavily in the Australian soft drink market, and recently opened a
ADollars 50m (USDollars 35.7m) facility in Sydney.

HUGHES Aircraft, a unit of GM Hughes Electronics, said it would cut at least
4,000 production jobs and relocate 2,000 others, Reuter reports from
California.
The consolidation, which involves mainly missile production lines recently
acquired from General Dynamics Corp goes beyond the 9,000 job reduction the
company announced in June.
Mr David McPherson, a Hughes vice-president, said an undetermined number of
engineering jobs would also be cut. He would not comment on whether the new
round of consolidations would result in extra restructuring charges.
Southern California will lose at least 6,000 jobs in the consolidation, as
all missile production is consolidated in existing plants in Tucson,
Arizona.
LTV Corporation, the large steel group, confirmed it would relocate its
corporate headquarter operations to Cleveland and close its Dallas
headquarters at the end of the year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HINO Motors, Japan's leading truck maker, yesterday forecast a 57 per cent
fall to Y3bn (Dollars 24m) in pre-tax profit for the first half to the end
of September, blaming a weak domestic market and a strong yen for the sharp
decline.
The downturn in capital spending in Japan has hurt the truck industry, which
reported a 2.4 per cent fall in unit sales for the first quarter of the
fiscal year, which began in April.
Hino expects sales of Y299.5bn for the first half, down 5 per cent. The
decline would have been greater but for commissioned production of cars by
Toyota Motor, which has an 11 per cent stake. The company reckoned on an
exchange rate of Y130 to the dollar for the year, but the yen has been
trading at about Y123, reducing profits from exports to Asian markets, where
demand remains strong.
Japan's truck makers are hoping the increase in infrastructure spending
promised in the recent emergency economic package will stimulate the
domestic market, but fear sales will continue to decline for the next few
months.
The industry reported sharply increased sales during the late 1980s, when
construction orders surged and companies were generally expanding capital
investment. Unit sales in Japan rose 17.8 per cent in 1988 and 10.3 per cent
in 1989, prompting an increase to what is now excess capacity.

<TEXT>
BURNS Philp &amp; Company, the diversified Australian food technology group, is
holding its annual dividend at 15.5 cents a share after a 73 per cent rise
in net profits to ADollars 92.1m (USDollars 65.76m) in the year to June,
from ADollars 53.3m 12 months earlier, writes Bruce Jacques.
The result, achieved on a rise in sales to ADollars 2.43bn from ADollars
2.35bn, was helped by im-proved earnings from its Australian hardware
operations and higher interest income on proceeds of the sale of its
interest in QBE Insurance Group, its former associate.
Profits from the company's core food and fermentation division fell 4 per
cent to ADollars 62.4m, but hardware earnings rose 8 per cent to ADollars
22.8m.
Investment division earnings were up 47 per cent at ADollars 6m.
Mr Andrew Turnbull, managing director, expects the company's main food
businesses to make steady progress this year. He also indicated the company
was 'fairly advanced' in discussions to buy into the eastern European yeast
market and into a privatised business in Russia.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the agency which underpins pension
benefits in the US, yesterday stepped up the pressure on Mr Carl Icahn,
owner of Trans World Airlines, to support TWA's pension plans which, it
claims, are underfunded by Dollars 1.2bn.
In a letter faxed to the former corporate raider, the PBGC claimed that Mr
Icahn had twice reduced a verbal offer to settle responsibility for the TWA
pensions, and 'we have yet to receive the often promised, never-delivered
written offer'.
It also said that the original verbal offer, which would have provided
'secured backing for the TWA's minimum funding payments to the plans of the
next 10 years up to a present value of Dollars 150m' was not adequate. The
PBGC's executive director, Mr James Lockhart, urged Mr Icahn to come to
Washington 'to present a serious and realistic offer for resolving this
matter'.
The letter came a day ahead of a bankruptcy court hearing at which TWA will
ask for permission to sign an agreement in principle with its unions, which
would transfer a 45 per cent stake in the airline to employees in exchange
for wage concessions. Creditors would be given the remaining 55 per cent
stake in return for forgiving about two-thirds of TWA's debt.
The PBGC, in a separate motion, said it supported this deal, but noted that
any reorganisation scheme at TWA was still dependant on settlement of the
pensions issue. 'In addition,' the agency claimed, 'a feasible plan of
reorganisation will require a financing commitment, from Icahn or others,
which does not yet exist'.
There was no immediate response from TWA, although the airline has
previously disputed the pension underfunding figures calculated by the PBGC.
On Tuesday, TWA - which has made sizeable operating losses all year -
announced plans for a major cut in services and jobs next month in an effort
to reduce costs.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S two main airlines have agreed to merge after months of off-and-on
negotiations.
PWA, parent of Canadian Airlines International, yesterday rejected proposals
by its employees for a cash injection and wage cuts, leading to a close link
with American Airlines. PWA's board said it had accepted a revised merger
deal with Air Canada as announced on September 3.
A holding company, to be owned 40 per cent by PWA's shareholders and 60 per
cent by Air Canada's shareholders, will be set up to manage operations of
both airlines.
Air Canada's head office will remain in Montreal and Canadian's in Calgary.
Each will have its own president and chief operating officer. Shareholders
of both airlines will exchange their stock on a one-for-one basis for shares
of the new holding company.
Duplicate operations in international services will be eliminated and excess
domestic capacity pruned. The holding company will set broad policy and
provide certain common services. The existing maintainence bases at
Vancouver and Montreal will be retained. Each airline will be represented
equally on the holding company's board.
The combined debt will be about USDollars 4bn, with long-term lease
obligations of USDollars 2.5bn.
Mr Hollis Harris, Air Canada president said the merger would bring 6,000
lay-offs out of a combined total workforce of 34,000 people.
A group representing 80 per cent of Canadian's employees fought for the link
with America, offering cash and pay reductions totalling nearly CDollars
500m (USDollars 420.1m).
In August, Air Canada and a Texas financial group offered USDollars 400m for
a restructured Continental Airlines. Air Canada has also proposed a
commercial link with United Airlines and is searching for a European
partner.

<TEXT>
DIRECTORS of Banque Bruxelles Lambert (BBL) yesterday met for an unscheduled
discussion of the Belgian bank's future strategy, amid continuing
speculation about the company's unstable shareholder structure.
BBL refused to comment on the substance or outcome of the meeting, but said
it would release a statement today.
Belgian newspaper reports yesterday suggested that the meeting would focus
on the intention of Internationale Nederlanden Groep, the Dutch banking and
insurance group, to increase its 10 per cent stake. ING, which is seeking
some form of collaboration with BBL, also declined to comment yesterday.
Over the past few months, market hopes of a significant development have
frequently been raised ahead of BBL board meetings only to be dashed by
bland statements from the bank afterwards.
Brussels brokers cautioned against reading too much into yesterday's
meeting, but pointed out that it was exceptional - coming a week ahead of
the scheduled meeting - and that a number of executive directors had been
called back from their holidays to attend.
The future of BBL revolves around the attitude of Groupe Bruxelles Lambert,
the Belgian holding company which controls 24 per cent of BBL. Mr Albert
Frere, who heads the holding company, is believed to want to reduce the
stake. ING last month turned down a 5.2 per cent stake offered by the
Italian holding company Union Nazionale de Participazioni, on the grounds
that the price was too high.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Curbs on regulators urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TUC made its first serious contribution to the national debate on the
regulation of utilities yesterday by calling for greater accountability for
the regulators and less favouritism for business customers.
Moving a motion on the regulation of public-service industries, Mr Tony
Young, general secretary of the NCU communications union, said: 'For too
long we have ignored the role that regulators have to play. We've seen them
as agents of the Tory government, instead of realising they could just as
easily work for the country.'
The call is a response to the government's sale of about 25 per cent of
British Telecom shares last year, which ruled out the prospect of a return
to state control of the company under any future Labour government.
Previously, the possibility of renationalisation prevented the NCU from
entering the regulation debate.
The motion urges new responsibilities for regulators to protect the needs of
all regions, promote training and research, and ensure that business and
individual customers benefit from new technology.
Mr Young criticised bodies such as Oftel, the telecommunications regulator,
for ignoring the public interest.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Wage council abolition opposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Trades Union Congress is hoping to exploit differences between
government ministers and among employers in the campaign to retain the wages
councils, which set minimum wages for 2.47m workers.
The TUC fears that abolition of the councils - most important in shops,
hotels and the clothing industry - will feature in legislation this autumn.
Officials believe Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, is more
reluctant to press ahead than some of her colleagues. One said: 'Mrs
Shephard is likely to have qualms about removing protection from 2m women
workers and supporting a measure which is likely to discourage training.'
The TUC hopes that retailers will be too busy with the campaign to legalise
Sunday trading to seek abolition of wage councils. The Confederation of
British Industry does not support complete abolition but 'sector-by-sector
review'.
An NOP poll commissioned by the TUC has found that nine out of 10 people
support continued protection for people on low pay.

FRENCH aerospace industry leaders yesterday called for closer European
collaboration in military aircraft production to fend off efforts by US
manufacturers to penetrate the European market.
Mr Serge Dassault, head of the Dassault military aircraft group, said he
favoured the development of several different and competing military
aircraft programmes in Europe but insisted that there should be greater
resolve on the part of European governments to keep the US out of the
market.
'European countries should form a bloc and stop buying US equipment,' he
added.
Mr Henri Martre, former chairman of Aerospatiale and the president of the
French Industry Aerospace Association, also urged for greater European
collaboration in the military field. He argued this was essential as long as
the US bought no European military aircraft.
Dassault is developing the Rafale, an advanced combat aircraft which
competes with the European Fighter Aircraft.

FT  10 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Chinese threaten US with retaliation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA's outrage at the US sale of F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan threatened
yesterday to spill over into already testy trade negotiations.
Beijing's official media warned that it would slap punitive tariffs on US
goods including computers and aircraft if the US carried out its threat to
impose tariffs on Dollars 3.9bn of imports from China unless China relaxes
its import regime. The US has set a deadline of October 10, and its
negotiators are due in Beijing at the weekend to seek an agreement on market
access. Chinese officials had previously indicated that they were willing to
loosen and clarify import restrictions.
China remains furious at President Bush's decision, announced last week, to
allow the sale of up to 150 fighters to Taiwan. It says the sale would
violate the 1982 Sino-US communique under which Washington undertook to
limit and eventually phase out arms sales to Taiwan.
It also accused the US yesterday of bad faith in the market access talks.
Xinhua news agency said: 'China showed sincerity and made major efforts to
reach agreement, but the US side failed to respond positively and instead
published the blacklist on August 21.'
Xinhua said China could impose tariffs on US goods including computers,
aircraft, cars, medical apparatus and instruments, duplicators, pesticides,
chemical fibres, timber and wood products, cameras, cotton, petroleum
products, medicines and chemicals.
Though China is widely expected to take some retaliatory action over the jet
sale, its options are thought to be limited by its desire to retain most
favoured nation (MFN) status for its exports to the US.
It has threatened to withdraw co-operation in global arms control talks.

FT  10 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Talks fail on banana quotas to EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TALKS in Geneva between the European Community and a group of Latin American
banana producers over proposed EC import barriers to bananas ended in
failure yesterday. The talks were a first step under the disputes settlement
mechanism of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), which could
lead to the establishment of an arbitration panel.
The seven exporters involved - Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua,
Panama, Colombia and Ecuador - claim existing national trade barriers are
discriminatory and that the EC plan, which extends import quotas and customs
duties to all 12 member states, could halve their existing exports to the
Community of some 2.5m tons a year.
Mr Roberto Rojas, trade minister of Costa Rica, which led the delegation,
said afterwards that the group would raise the issue at the next meeting of
Gatt's governing council on September 29. It would also be asking Mr Arthur
Dunkel, Gatt's director-general, to call an urgent meeting of the
surveillance body of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks to rule
whether the EC proposals violated a commitment not to introduce new
protectionist measures.
Gatt procedures do not allow panels to be established until the rules being
challenged have been adopted. Thus a request for a panel on the new
proposals would have to await their endorsement by the council of ministers.
The plan drawn up by the executive European Commission would impose a basic
banana import quota of 2m tons next year, with a 20 per cent tariff on
bananas from the so-called 'dollar region'. Higher-cost bananas from Africa
and the Caribbean would enter duty-free under the EC's Lome Convention.
Mr Rojas said yesterday the scheme could cost the seven exporting countries
about Dollars 500m a year in lost foreign exchange earnings over 10 years.
The EC plan has aroused concern among other participants in the Uruguay
Round, including the US, because it runs counter to proposals in the Round
to convert all import quotas into tariffs. If the EC gets its way on quotas
for bananas, this could create a precedent for others, especially Japan and
South Korea which are opposed to tariffication of their restraints on
imported rice.

OLYMPIA &amp; York, the Canadian property developer which has been under court
protection since mid-May, is aiming to obtain creditors' approval by the end
of November for a plan to restructure about two-thirds of its CDollars
13.5bn (USDollars 11.3bn) debt.
O&amp;Y has indicated to creditors of its Canadian operations that it intends to
ask an Ontario judge to extend its protection from October 21 to the end of
the year, in order to finalise the restructuring.
Its plans are complicated, however, by the fact that negotiations with 27
different creditor groups are not proceeding at the same pace.
An official of one project lender said yesterday that O&amp;Y has made 'great
progress' in talks on some of its 11 core Canadian properties, but that wide
differences still remain on others.
A lawyer for another group of lenders predicted that it is 'most unlikely'
that agreements can be signed by the end of November.
'Most of their proposals are so far out that it would take a significant
change in position and significant redrafting to get there,' he said.
O&amp;Y last month presented draft restructuring proposals. The proposals
effectively ask project lenders to extend the maturity dates of their loans
and furthermore to accept tax-exempt 'distress' preferred shares.
Unsecured lenders would exchange their debt for bonds convertible into
equity in the parent company, Olympia &amp; York Developments.
O&amp;Y has not offered to hand over any of its Canadian properties to their
bondholders as it has done with the mammoth building at 55 Water Street in
New York.
Mr Steve Miller, O&amp;Y's chief negotiator, is understood to have told the
lenders that none of the Canadian properties falls into the same
'basket-case' category as the Water Street property. That property has a
high vacancy rate and it is also in need of expensive renovations.

The record results were scored on sales of Dollars 6.26bn, virtually
unchanged from the previous year. In the final quarter alone, Campbell saw
after-tax profits rise by 29 per cent to Dollars 109.2m, on sales of Dollars
1.43bn compared with Dollars 1.35bn.
Mr David Johnson, Campbell's Australian chief executive, said the group was
par-ticularly pleased by the growth in its core soup business, both in the
domestic market and overseas.
He also pointed out that exchange rates had the effect of depressing
reported sales in the first three quarters, and that underlying sales from
continuing business rose by five per cent during the year.
The Campbell North America division, the largest part of the group, saw
operating profits rise by 19 per cent during the year, to Dollars 792.8m,
with sales from continuing businesses rising by 5 per cent. Helped by some
new varieties, soup volume increased by 5.5 per cent. The Campbell bakery
and biscuit operations fared less well, with operating profits easing to
Dollars 90.6m.

IN A bid to capture a bigger share of the billion dollar market for personal
computer spreadsheet programs, Borland International, the US software
company, today launches its Quattro Pro for Windows program.
Quattro Pro will compete directly with spreadsheets from Lotus Development,
an early leader in the market, and from Microsoft, which has won sales with
its Excel program.
Earlier this week, Lotus slashed the price of its 1-2-3 for Windows
spreadsheet by Dollars 100 to Dollars 495, matching the price of Microsoft's
Excel.
Borland has also priced Quattro Pro for Windows at Dollars 495, but will
include a copy of Quattro Pro for use with the older DOS operating system as
well as the Windows version. It is also offering the program to users of
competing products for a special price of Dollars 150.
Borland and Lotus are locked in a copyright dispute in which Lotus has
accused Borland of copying elements of 1-2-3 for use in Quattro Pro. Borland
recently modified its program to eliminate some elements after a US court
ruled that they infringed Lotus copyrights. Borland is expected to appeal
the decision.

FT  10 SEP 92 / International Company News: Commonwealth Bank profits fall
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
COMMONWEALTH Bank, the leading Australian financial institution, has
announced a big fall in earnings in its first full-year as a publicly-quoted
company.
The federal government-controlled bank, which floated 30 per cent of its
capital last year, sustained a 54 per cent slide in net profits to ADollars
408.8m (USDollars 292m) for the 12 months to June from ADollars 883.3m the
year before.
However, the figures released yesterday suggest underlying profits improved.
Excluding abnormals, net profits rose to ADollars 455.2m from ADollars
279.9m. The distorting factor was an ADollars 608.8m abnormal profit in the
previous year.
The directors announced a 20 cents a share final dividend, bringing the
bank's first annual payout to public shareholders to 40 cents a share and
making a dividend ratio of 82 per cent.
Commonwealth Bank maintained its 'conservative' image by reporting sharply
lower bad debt write-offs and problem loans than its long-standing public
rivals, Westpac, ANZ and National Australia Bank, which all recently
reported for the first half to March.
The Commonwealth bank reported reduced bad and doubtful debt write-offs,
down to ADollars 843m from ADollars 1.03bn, with total problem loans easing
to ADollars 3.41bn from ADollars 3.45bn.
Mr David Murray, managing director, said the bank's capital adequacy ratio
had improved to 9.9 per cent at the latest balance date, from 8.73 at June
30 last year - before the flotation, but just after the bank acquired the
State Bank of Victoria. This compares with an Australian Reserve Bank
minimum ratio of 8 per cent.
Mr Murray sought to distancehis bank from the property valuation problems
besetting other leading Australian banks.
He said a review of its commercial property exposures, involving about
ADollars 8bn worth of property, had confirmed the adequacy of values and
provisions.
'The bank does not have any material involvement in property development
activities, either directly, through subsidiaries, or through joint ventures
in Australia or offshore,' he said.
But he said the bank's results continued to reflect the effects of the deep
and widespread recession in Australia. 'Economic recovery is weak and
patchy,' he said.
'The current year is likely to feature continuing low demand for lending
business, making our commitment to cost control, improved efficiency and
enhanced customer service critical to better profit performance.'
A divisional earnings breakdown showed banking operations lifted their
contribution to ADollars 385.5m from ADollars 207.4m, and the financial
services division boosted its result to ADollars 11.8m from ADollars 6.2m.
The New Zealand-based ASB Bank turned in an almost static profit of ADollars
28m from ADollars 28.4m.
Westpac has brought forward the date of its annual meeting by almost a month
to January 19. The bank has also changed the requirement for removal of
directors from a 75 per cent majority to a simple majority.

BURNS Philp &amp; Company, the diversified Australian food technology group, is
holding its annual dividend at 15.5 cents a share after a 73 per cent rise
in net profits to ADollars 92.1m (USDollars 65.76m) in the year to June,
from ADollars 53.3m 12 months earlier.
The result, achieved on a rise in sales to ADollars 2.43bn from ADollars
2.35bn, was helped by im-proved earnings from its Australian hardware
operations and higher interest income on proceeds of the sale of its
interest in QBE Insurance Group, its former associate.
Profits from the company's core food and fermentation division fell 4 per
cent to ADollars 62.4m, but hardware earnings rose 8 per cent to ADollars
22.8m. Investment division earnings were up 47 per cent at ADollars 6m.
Mr Andrew Turnbull, managing director, expects the company's main food
businesses to make steady progress this year. He also indicated that the
company was 'fairly ad-vanced' in discussions to buy into the eastern
European yeast market and into a privatised business in Russia.
QBE Insurance Group held earnings to a 3 per cent fall in the latest June
year. The company is raising its annual dividend to 25 cents a share from 22
cents. Total operating revenues rose to ADollars 1.02bn from ADollars
921.1m.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; York, the ailing Canadian developer, is turning over ownership of
its biggest New York office building to the property's bondholders.
The deal involves a 53-storey building at 55 Water Street in Manhattan's
financial district. It marks a rare vote of confidence in the future of the
New York office market - plagued for four years by high vacancy rates and
tumbling rentals.
Besides exchanging their Dollars 548m in secured notes for a 100 per cent
equity stake in the 3.3m sq ft building, the bondholders have agreed to
invest an extra Dollars 21m in preferred shares. The deal is expected to be
finalised early next year.
The biggest bondholder, the Retirement System of Alabama, has expressed a
willingness to buy out the remaining investors as well as to contribute
their share of the preferred share issue.
Mr Wilbur Ross, senior managing director at Rothschild, which has advised
the bondholders, said this commitment could require an investment of up to
Dollars 140m by the Alabama pension fund. Mr Ross interpreted the pension
fund's commitment as a vote of confidence in the New York property market.
'This is not some real estate speculator doing it on borrowed money. This is
a very serious investor,' he said.

FT  10 SEP 92 / International Company News: Hino Motors predicts 57% fall in
earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HINO Motors, Japan's leading truck maker, yesterday forecast a 57 per cent
fall to Y3bn (Dollars 24m) in pre-tax profit for the first half to the end
of September, blaming a weak domestic market and a stronger than expected
yen for the sharp decline.
The downturn in capital spending in Japan has hurt the truck industry, which
reported a 2.4 per cent fall in unit sales for the first quarter of the
fiscal year, which began in April.
Hino expects sales of Y299.5bn for the first half, down 5 per cent, though
the decline would have been greater but for commissioned production of cars
by Toyota Motor, which owns 11 per cent of the truck maker.
The company had reckoned on an exchange rate of Y130 to the dollar for the
year, but the yen has been trading at around Y123, reducing profits from
exports to Asian markets, where demand remains strong.
Japan's truck makers are hoping the increase in infrastructure spending
promised in the recent emergency economic package will stimulate the
domestic market, but fear sales will continue to decline for the next few
months.
The industry reported sharply increased sales during the late 1980s, when
construction orders surged and companies were generally expanding capital
investment. Unit sales in Japan rose 17.8 per cent in 1988 and 10.3 per cent
in 1989, prompting manufacturers to increase capacity.
But economic downturn has left most makers with excess capacity and
difficult-to-cover depreciation charges, which rose in line with their
expansion of facilities. Meanwhile, the volatility of the Tokyo stock market
has left them less able to bolster profits by selling long-held stocks.

<TEXT>
PEPSI-Cola International, part of the US PepsiCo group, is to form a joint
venture with Lion Nathan, the New Zealand brewer, to produce, distribute and
market PepsiCo soft drinks in Australia and New Zealand, the companies
announced yesterday.
The venture will have combined sales of more than NZDollars 200m (USDollars
107.5m) in a highly competitive market.
Lion Nathan, the biggest liquor group in Australasia, has been the sole
producer of Pepsi products in Australia since 1990. The joint venture will
also incorporate the New Zealand operations owned by Pepsi.
It will be 83 per cent owned by Lion Nathan and 17 per cent by Pepsi. The
companies said the equity stakes reflected the values of their respective
businesses.
The venture will be managed by Lion Nathan, which last year had sales of
more than NZDollars 2bn.
The managing director will be Mr William Wilson, formerly group
vice-president for PCI Asia. He will be based in Sydney.
Mr Douglas Myers, chief executive of Lion Nathan, said his company had
invested heavily in the Australian soft drink market, and recently opened a
ADollars 50m (USDollars 35.7m) facility in Sydney.
The company's soft drink sales were up 20 per cent in the past year, in
spite of the Australian recession, Mr Myers said.
In the US, Pepsi said it saw considerable efficiencies to be gained from
combining the Australian and New Zealand operations, given the similarities
of the two countries' markets.
No cash was involved in the deal, but the US soft drinks, snacks and
restaurants group said that it expected some 'aggressive' investment in the
joint venture - in proportion to the shareholdings.

<TEXT>
HOWARD SMITH, the Australian shipping and engineering group, has reduced its
annual dividend from 35 cents to 27.5 cents a share after a 62 per cent fall
in earnings to ADollars 53.5m (USDollars 38.2m) in the 12 months to June
from ADollars 140.5m a year earlier.
However, the comparison was distorted by a one-off ADollars 75.4m profit in
the previous period on the sale of the group's strategic stake in Coal and
Allied Industries. Following this sale, Howard Smith is virtually debt free,
with cash reserves of ADollars 100m.
Pre-tax earnings were down by 16 per cent to ADollars 81.4m from ADollars
97.4m, on a 15 per cent fall in revenue from ADollars 977.6m to ADollars
832.2m.
Mr Penton Sutcliffe, managing director, said the group was looking to
expand, but he saw little sign of rapid economic recovery.

FT  10 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: ICI falls on sell circular
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ICI share price was sent tumbling by a strongly worded sell
recommendation from County NatWest, although the securities house initially
went to great lengths to distance itself from the situation.
The nub of the argument was that the present dividend will be cut by around
15p after the chemicals and pharmaceuticals giant is split in early 1993. Mr
Ian John, County's chemicals analyst, said: 'It is our view that prudent
dividend policies for each company will result in dividend payments which,
when combined, will produce a net dividend of less than 55p in 1993. We
would expect a combined net payout of 40p as a reasonable expectation.'
Rumours of a County sell circular had leaked into the market on Tuesday and
were partly responsible for that day's 28p fall. However, County had denied
that it was issuing a note and even yesterday morning was refusing any
comment.
Mr Mike Lewis, County's specialist salesman, said he had discussed the note
with no one on Tuesday and all the information was embargoed until 8am
yesterday. Most analysts were highly sceptical of a dividend cut, but ICI
shares were marked down by more than 40p at the start of trading yesterday -
principally as a spoiling operation by rival marketmakers.
The stock recovered slowly throughout yesterday to close only 7 off at 1055p
after turnover of 2.4m shares. Industrial gases group BOC's rise of 14 to
629p was prompted by switching out of ICI.
ECC plunges
The market again suffered the effect of bad corporate news yesterday when
English China Clays (ECC), considered by many to be the 'glamour' stock in
the 'other industrial materials' sector, fell sharply after the company
reported lower profits than had been expected.
Interim profits were down to Pounds 40.8m, against expectations of around
Pounds 57m, leading to one of the busiest sessions in ECC stock on record.
The shares retreated 30p on the figures, but it was the gloomy meeting with
City analysts that moved them to cut full-year profit estimates. One said:
'Not a single positive point was made.'
Dealers rushed to sell the shares, briefly causing a price backwardation - a
situation in which the bid and offer prices are temporarily reversed. At
worst the shares were down 82 at 364p. Bargain hunting left the stock at
371p, down 75 on the day after turnover of 7.3m, the highest daily figure
for more than five years.
Mr Chris Alexander at Lehman Brothers, who reduced his figure for the year
from Pounds 114m to Pounds 95m, commented: 'The shares will not bounce soon
and they will be derated further as investors are reminded again that the
company's markets are cyclical, and currency will continue to be a potent
negative.'
Hillsdown drops
Diversified foods group Hillsdown experienced an ignominious finale to its
membership of the FT-SE 100 Index. The stock suffered the biggest fall in
percentage terms in the London market with a slide of 23 to 83p on turnover
of 10m shares.
First-half profits came in marginally higher than last year's but at the
bottom of the range of estimates. They were accompanied by news of heavy
borrowings and a gloomy statement predicting a difficult second half. Nomura
lowered its full-year estimate by Pounds 18m to Pounds 175m.
C and W setback
News that US West, the US telecoms carrier, is forming a new electronic
directory service in the Minneapolis/St Paul area of Minnesota along with
France Telecom caused a sharp slide in shares of Cable and Wireless, owner
of Mercury, the UK telecoms group. US West has been seen as a likely
candidate to acquire a minority stake in Mercury.
Telecoms specialists were surprised at the extent of the drop in C and W,
which ended 15 down at 511p on relatively thin turnover of 1.2m. 'This news
has not knocked US West off the list of potential suitors,' said one
analyst, who added that there were plenty of buyers of a sizeable stake in
Mercury 'at the right price'. The C and W weakness was also attributed to a
rather clumsily handled selling order.
Taylor Woodrow weakened 8, or 18 per cent, to 35p after cutting the interim
dividend and recording a Pounds 16m loss. Blue Circle suffered a 10 per cent
fall, closing 15 off at 134p in front of today's interims. These are
expected to show profits in the region of Pounds 42m, down from the Pounds
57.5m recorded in the first half of last year.
Sun Alliance was unsettled after SG Warburg Securities was said to have
adopted a more cautious stance on the stock, highlighting the group's
exposure to property and the equity market. The shares ended 13 lower at
241p. Prudential closed 6 higher at 236p after the good interim figures.
Calor Group outpaced a subdued oil and gas sector, responding to a buy note
issued by County NatWest. The shares rose 5 to 179p.
Position-taking ahead of Glaxo's results affected all the big pharmaceutical
stocks. Wellcome picked up 11 to 854p: the impact of quick-turnover
speculators who came in after the recent share issue has now faded.
SmithKline Beecham gained 7 both in the 'A' shares and the US-driven units
after sizeable switching between the two classes of stock.
Fisons rallied 10 to 160p as the opinions of more positive analysts filtered
through following Tuesday's announcement of poor first-half results. Nomura
Research was one that issued a buy recommendation.
J. Sainsbury lost 8 to 446p, with Lehman Brothers pointing out that the
rating differential between Sainsbury and Tesco (off a penny at 211p) had
widened too far.
Supermarket chain Asda saw heavy turnover of more than 16m shares on the
back of the chairman's agm statement. The shares eased to 27p.

FT  10 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CURRENCY worries continued to dominate trading in the derivates market,
making for a volatile session in stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo.
An early squeeze in the September contract on the FT-SE Index, after opening
at 2,326, sent it climbing to 2,347 by 9.30am. September then drifted lower
to trade between 2,323 and 2,343 as dealers focused on the latest
developments in Scandinavian currencies. As a result of weakness in other
European markets, and a spate of disappointing corporate results, September
continued to drift, although early firmness on Wall Street helped the future
claw back some of the decline.
The contract traded at a premium to cash for most of the session. It
eventually stood at 2,336, down 3 points from Tuesday's close and 11 ahead
of the underlying cash market. Turnover of 10,775 lots for the September
future was reasonable, as was volume in the December contract, which came to
4,000 contracts.
Traded options volume remained dull but was above Tuesday's poor level. A
total of 26,112 lots were traded, of which the FT-SE 100 option accounted
for 9,951 and the Euro FT-SE option 2,342. British Aerospace, on 1,430 lots,
was the busiest stock option.

FT  10 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Further ground lost in nervous trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK EQUITIES continued to give ground yesterday as European foreign exchange
dealers struggled to respond to the latest developments in Scandinavian
currencies. The sudden increase in Sweden's marginal lending rates to 75 per
cent alarmed London and share prices fell sharply in early trading. By the
close, however, the London market had rallied very cautiously behind
sterling to record a net fall of a further 10.2 on the FT-SE scale.
Once again trading volume was poor and marketmakers were left to move prices
around quickly, often in response to company trading reports which sounded
an uncertain note. English China Clays, the industrial materials group,
shook the sector with news of a heavy drop in profits. However, there was a
maintained dividend at P &amp; O and a good performance from Prudential, the
insurance company.
Equities rallied from an early loss of nearly 15 on the Footsie and were
approaching overnight levels until London money market rates moved higher.
The market swiftly went into reverse again and was 16.1 down at 2,321.6
until a steadier trend in the pound helped equities stage a second recovery.
The UK stock market closed before reports - later denied - that a Bundesbank
official had suggested that sterling devaluation was inevitable received
publicity on the Seaq trading screens.
The final reading showed the FT-SE Index at 2,327.5, for a decline on the
day of 10.2 points. While a 10-point loss on the Footsie is no great news in
markets at present, yesterday's fall reflected continued nervousness among
investors.
Seaq volume increased towards the close when marketmakers moved to pick up
stock to meet selling commitments taken on earlier in the week. The final
Seaq total of 400.8m shares compared with 418.2m on the previous day, but
Tuesday's figure represented a mere Pounds 682.2m in terms of retail, or
customer, business.
The big institutions continued to keep away from the London equity market,
watching nervously as the developments in Scandinavian currencies implied
fresh pressures on sterling and thus on the UK government's commitment to
the ERM network.
There was no immediate response, however, to a call from a leading member of
the UK Labour opposition party for Britain to drop the pound's link with the
D-Mark and to press for sterling devaluation.
The renewed worries over sterling and the implications for UK interest rates
fell heavily across the building and retail consumer sectors. With ECC's
poor figures adding to the pessimism, there were substantial falls in
Redland and other stocks in the building materials area.
The London Stock Exchange announced yesterday that, following the quarterly
review of components of the FT-SE 100 Share Index, TI Investments, Scottish
Hydro-Electric, Southern Electric, Burmah Castrol, De La Rue and Kwik-Save
will join the index, and Willis Corroon, Pilkington, Royal Insurance,
Hillsdown Holdings, British Aerospace and RMC will leave the index list.

FT  10 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Firmer dollar leaves Dow
mildly better
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
US SHARE prices posted modest gains yesterday, ending a two-day decline
prompted by last week's bad August employment figures, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 10.80 better at 3,271.39. The more
broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 improved 1.92 to 416.36, while the
American SE composite eased 0.54 to 382.82 and the Nasdaq composite put on
3.72 to 574.89. Turnover on the New York SE came to 179m shares, and rises
outpaced declines by 931 to 807.
The stock markets were aided at the opening by a firming of the dollar in
overnight trading (the US currency gained almost two pfennigs against the
D-Mark to just above DM1.41) and a higher Tokyo share market, but losses in
European equities and slight weakness in US Treasury prices restrained
sentiment in New York.
Johnson &amp; Johnson fell in early trading after investors were unimpressed by
the company's announcement of a new pact with Olympus for marketing,
research and development in endoscopic surgery instrumentation.
The decline in the share price was probably an expression of disappointment
that the significant announcement that Johnson &amp; Johnson had promised on
Tuesday failed to live up to expectations, and once that disappointment had
eased the shares recovered to end a net Dollars  1/4 up at Dollars 52 .
Compaq lost Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 32 7/8 in heavy trading after broking
house Oppenheimer cut its rating to 'market perform' from 'short-term buy'
because of concern about possible price cuts on personal computers and the
stock's recent run-up.
Campbell's Soup rose Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 39 3/8 after pleasing the
market with fiscal fourth-quarter net income of 44 cents a share, up from 33
cents a year ago.
Equitable put on Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 8 3/4 in busy trading after the
insurance group forecast that third-quarter pre-tax profits would reach
Dollars 25m, a significant turnround from the loss incurred from continuing
operations in the second quarter. Family Dollar firmed Dollars  1/2 to
Dollars 17 5/8 on news that August sales rose about 7 per cent from a year
ago, and that fiscal fourth-quarter sales were up 15.5 per cent from a year
earlier.
Chemical Bank eased Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 31 in early trading after
securities house Salomon Brothers lowered its rating on the stock from a
'buy' to a 'hold' and reduced its earnings estimates for 1992 and 1993. The
moves were made because credit quality costs were coming down more slowly
than expected and problem loans were not improving as quickly as had been
hoped.
General Motors edged ahead Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 34 in spite of warnings
from industry analysts that there could be further industrial disruption at
the giant car manufacturer between now and next summer, when formal
negotiations with the unions over pay and job cuts begin.
Canada
AMID THE volatility in world currency markets, traders found some solace in
Toronto stocks, which closed only marginally lower.
The Canadian dollar fell to a four-year low of CDollars 1.2185 to the US
unit at one point, but partly recovered to CDollars 1.2145.
The TSE 300 index lost 2.9 at 3,449.1 after shuffling within a five-point
range. Declines led advances by 281 to 259 after volume of 28.7m shares.

FT  10 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets: FLC problems weigh on New Zealand
sentiment - The forestry heavyweight, with other blue chips, has led the
market down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fletcher Challenge (FLC), the New Zealand forestry-based conglomerate
suffering from a wave of negative sentiment, hit a six-year low yesterday.
Other leaders, including Lion Nathan, Brierley Investments and Carter Holt
Harvey, also dragged equities back, masking the fact that prices of many
second line stocks have remained buoyant.
The NZSE-40 index closed 12.82 down at 1,459.96 yesterday, against a high
this year of 1,597.45 on July 17. FLC has been the main factor in the fall,
declining to NZDollars 2.22 yesterday, down from a mid-June peak of
NZDollars 3.80. The latest bout of pressure dates from the annual profits
announcement three weeks ago, although trading volume has been low.
The fall below NZDollars 2.30 raises concern over the future of the FLC
employee trust, which holds around 21 per cent of the capital. At prices
below NZDollars 2.30, FLC becomes liable to repay some of the debt incurred
from borrowing to buy shares in the market on behalf of staff who pay for
them on easy terms. These shares were bought at up to NZDollars 4, although
the average is nearer NZDollars 3.50.
A total of USDollars 230m is involved at yesterday's prices. A spokesman
said that the formula for repaying debt did not start as soon as the price
fell below NZDollars 2.30, adding that FLC's exposure, at worst, was only 2
per cent of total debt of NZDollars 8.4bn (USDollars 4.5bn).
The group's current difficulties began with a wave of selling from Australia
in late July, as rumours spread about the problems involving Jennings, its
property associate. FLC had announced in late June that it would be writing
off some NZDollars 400m of debt, mainly because of difficulties with
Jennings, and that a change in accounting policies to conform with the US
practice would produce a loss of around NZDollars 150m after extraordinary
items for the year to June 30.
In spite of its frankness - FLC confirmed in mid-August a loss of NZDollars
157m on a trading profit of NZDollars 305m - the rumours in Australia
intensified. Meanwhile, FLC's difficulties in its Canadian and British pulp
and paper operations were well known; the same applies to weaker prices for
methanol, in which it is the world's biggest producer following the purchase
of Cape Horn Methanol last year.
Late June saw drastic revisions in analysts' forecasts for the group, saying
that the anaemic world recovery, especially in newsprint demand, would defer
its forecast recovery by a year. Most analysts are predicting a profit of
around NZDollars 330m for the current year to next June 30, and NZDollars
400m for 1993/94.
The market's second-liners are continuing to perform strongly. This is
especially the case for stocks such as Ceramco, Steel and Tube, and Mair
Astley, which have little or no debt and have been rewarding shareholders
with substantial dividend increases. Many of these companies' shares have
doubled, trebled or quadrupled in price in recent months.
Carter Holt Harvey, New Zealand's other forestry heavyweight, has held firm
in spite of a seven-week strike at its former NZ Forest Products' plants.
There is continuing speculation that International Paper, which manages the
company under an agreement with Brierley Investments, will eventually seek
to increase its 16 per cent holding.
Brierley Investments has seen its shares fall back from NZDollars 1 to
around 85 to 86 cents, largely because of its ownership of Mount Charlotte,
the UK hotel group.
For several years Fletcher Challenge and Brierley vied for the equity
market's number one spot in market capitalisation terms: they are now at
numbers three and four, having been replaced by Telecom and Carter Holt.
Lion Nathan weakened yesterday, losing 8 cents to NZDollars 4.25, after a
high of NZDollars 4.85 earlier this year. This followed the announcement
that a joint venture would own and manage the Pepsi soft drink franchise in
both Australia and New Zealand. There had been some speculation that Lion
Nathan would sell its Australian Pepsi franchise to the US soft drink giant,
freeing up capital.

FT  10 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan rises 1.7% on
privatisation hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MILAN was cheered by signs that the government was finally coming to the
market's rescue, while Nordic markets remained under a cloud, writes Our
Markets Staff.
MILAN rose on hopes that, later in the day, the government would announce
which state-owned companies would be privatised first. There were also
rumours that fiscal measures to boost equities, such as the abolition of the
unpopular capital gains tax on share transactions, were under consideration.
After the close, ministers leaving yesterday's weekly cabinet meeting
indicated that Credito Italiano and Eni's engineering unit, Nuovo Pignone,
were the two likely privatisation candidates.
The Comit index rose 6.15 or 1.7 per cent to 371.63 in turnover estimated at
L150bn after L171.3bn on Tuesday.
Shares in Credito Italiano were suspended for excessive gains after they
jumped 28 per cent early in the session. They were eventually fixed at
L1,390, up L170 or 13.9 per cent. Banca Commerciale Italiana rose L110 or
4.5 per cent to L2,585. The state food group, Sme, was fixed L236 or 6.9 per
cent higher at L3,650.
STOCKHOLM fell 2.2 per cent to a year's low for the second consecutive
session after another big rise in the key lending rate. The central bank
raised its marginal lending rate to 75 per cent from 24 per cent to reverse
the capital outflow and relieve pressure on the krona due to Finland's
currency crisis. The Affarsvarlden General index dropped 15.7 to 712.5 in
turnover of SKr430m after SKr456m.
Trygg-Hansa, Skandia and Gota requested a temporary suspension of trading in
their shares ahead of information on anticipated losses stemming from
Svenska Kredit and Gota. Svenska Kredit, controlled by Skandia and
Trygg-Hansa, said later that it was suspending payments to creditors.
Skandia's free shares closed unchanged at SKr58 after the suspension was
lifted.
HELSINKI rose another 0.8 per cent after a 5 per cent gain on Tuesday, the
Hex index closing 4.6 higher at 473.0. But analysts pointed out that
Tuesday's effective devaluation of the markka meant a sizeable loss for
foreign investors. After first day of the float, a 4.3 per cent gain for the
FT-Actuaries Finland index in local currency terms reversed into a 8.2 per
cent drop in dollar terms.
FRANKFURT reacted badly to news of a DM17bn draining of money market funds
by the Bundesbank in its latest securities repurchase tender. The DAX index
closed 19.29, or 1.3 per cent lower at 1,525.26 in turnover down from DM5bn
to DM4.2bn. Leading share prices fell further after hours in London.
Kaufhof fell DM14 to DM416 on a market newsletter which estimated a
particularly big drop in the company's turnover. Klockner-Werke dropped
another DM4.60 to DM75, taking its fall this week to DM8 after news of a
prospective DM180m loss in its steel division this year.
PARIS came off the day's low to close just below the day's high, as the
CAC-40 index finished 6.90 down at 1,756.77 in moderate turnover of
FFr1.7bn.
BSN dropped FFr28 to FFr936 with 117,760 shares traded following its interim
results. Although the headline figure was in line with expectations, James
Capel said the operating margin fell from 11 per cent to 10.3 per cent and
that the rise in earnings came essentially from a fall in net financial
costs and in the tax rate.
The insurer UAP added FFr13 or 3.5 per cent to FFr390 while L'Air Liquide
fell FFr15 to FFr726. Carrefour and Accor were also weaker, losing FFr8 and
FFr15 to FFr2,092 and FFr517 respectively.
ZURICH got a modicum of balance from easier Swiss money market rates and a
firm bond market. But the SMI index still fell 8.4 to 1,779.7 as EMS
tensions and weak bourses elsewhere dampened sentiment.
BBC Brown Boveri ended SFr70 lower at SFr3,560 as selling pressure on Asea,
its Swedish partner, spread to BBC. Ascom bearers fell another SFr80 to
SFr1,380 after the telecoms equipment company said that profits could fall
this year.
BRUSSELS fell back at the close as Delhaize, the most active issue, finished
BFr15 lower at BFr1,500 after an intraday high of BFr1,530. The Bel-20 lost
2.61 to 1,066.05 in low turnover of BFr550m.
BBL gained BFr80 to BFr3,275 on reports that ING, the Dutch insurer, was
about to increase its stake in the bank. BBL is due to release a statement
today.
AMSTERDAM remained cautious with the CBS Tendency index easing 0.5 to 108.5.
Ahold, the supermarket group, put on 80 cents to Fl 73.50 after forecasting
strong profits growth by 1997 and a possible US acquisition next year.
Grolsch fell Fl 9 or 4.1 per cent to Fl 210 on disappointing second-half
earnings forecasts.

FT  10 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei up 3.2% at best
close since March
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL WEINBERG

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FUTURES-LINKED buying sparked a late-afternoon rally and the Nikkei average
rose 3.2 per cent to its highest close since March 31, writes Neil Weinberg
in Tokyo.
The Nikkei ended 593.13 up at 18,875.55 after an early low for the day of
18,208.25, and a high of 18,897.63 shortly before the close. Turnover, at
320m shares, was down from the previous day's 398m, as the market lacked
direction for most of the day.
Advances outnumbered declines by 618 to 373, with 158 issues unchanged. The
Topix index of all first section stocks put on 21.66 to 1,413.52, and in
London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 1.80 to 1,145.94.
The nature of the day's trading was reflected in the preponderance of
speculative issues among the 10 most active stocks, which together accounted
for about one-quarter of the total market volume.
Mr Chris Ringer, equity sales manager at County NatWest Securities Japan,
said foreign houses intent on covering short positions ahead of tomorrow's
expiration of September futures undertook heavy index arbitrage, buying
stocks in Tokyo and selling futures in Singapore.
Other market observers agreed that, barring a fundamental boost, such as an
improved profit outlook or an economic upturn, the measures unveiled by the
government to support stock prices were likely to do little more than
prevent another precipitous fall in values.
Lacking fresh incentives, investors focused once again on speculative,
theme-related stocks, with several recording daily limit gains. Nissin Food
forged ahead Y400 to Y2,730 on news that it has signed an agreement with a
UK company to develop and market an Aids cure.
Other biotechnology and pharmaceutical shares also surged, with Green Cross
adding Y150 at Y1,880 and Meiji Milk Y50 at Y1,190. Rhythm Watch, which
issued Dollars 50m in warrant bonds the previous day, jumped Y36 to Y446,
while Isuzu Motors advanced Y23 to Y403 on reports that it has developed a
ceramic engine.
A handful of petrochemical shares rose sharply on news that Mr Boris
Yeltsin, the Russian president, is likely to push for additional investment
in the development of his nation's natural resources during his forthcoming
visit to Japan. Mitsui Petrochemical gained Y30 to Y615.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone made its first advance in four sessions as
brokerages focused on laggards. The telecoms giant was up Y18,000 at
Y603,000.
In Osaka, the OSE average moved up 122.13 to 20,058.62 on volume of 23.1m
shares. Nintendo rose Y100 to Y10,800.
Roundup
TOKYO'S rally had little effect in the Pacific Rim. Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta
were both closed for a public holiday.
HONG KONG ended firmer, following Tokyo's rise and on optimism over a
possible solution to the financing of Hong Kong's new airport. The Hang Seng
index put on 26.4 to 5,726.99 in turnover of HKDollars 1.51bn, up from the
year's lowest of HKDollars 1.14bn registered on Tuesday.
Most actively traded was HSBC, which rose HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 56,
followed by Cheung Kong, up 30 cents at HKDollars 22.80.
AUSTRALIA's decline continued on worries about possible interest rate rises
and a weak Australian dollar. The All Ordinaries index lost 23.0 to 1,478.9,
its lowest close for 17 months. Turnover amounted to ADollars 235.3m.
News Corp fell 98 cents to ADollars 23.62, while Commonwealth Bank lost 15
cents to ADollars 6.50 after reporting a 54 per cent drop in 1991/92 net
profit.
BANGKOK rose sharply, led by banks and finance stocks. The SET index
advanced 12.43 to 782.85 in turnover of Bt10.4bn. Bangkok Bank climbed
Bt2.50 to Bt73.50 and Union Asia appreciated Bt10 to Bt113.
SEOUL ran into profit-taking on the eve of the three-day Chusok festival.
The composite index fell 2.23 to 551.12 in turnover of Won335.59bn, after
Won365.15bn.
TAIWAN ended slightly higher after a dull session. The weighted index closed
11.74 ahead at 3,770.12. Turnover contracted to TDollars 16.3bn.
SINGAPORE closed easier with activity focused on speculative,
over-the-counter Malaysian companies. The Straits Times Industrial index
shed 8.66 to 1,368.54 in volume of 31.6m shares, against 40.5m.
MANILA saw quiet trading as the composite index fell 5.43 to 1,407.47 in
combined turnover of 160m pesos.
BOMBAY's BSE index dipped 2.77 to 3,201.46.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar gains on rate rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR regained ground against the D-Mark yesterday after Sweden's
central bank raised interest rates to 75 per cent to support the krona,
writes James Blitz.
However, in spite of the dollar's rise, pressure on sterling and the Italian
lira remained intense in a very nervous market. In later American trading,
the Bundesbank, UK Treasury and Bank of Italy were all forced to deny
rumours that there would be a realignment of currencies in the European
exchange rate mechanism or that either the pound or lira would be devalued.
The extraordinary rise in the Bank of Sweden's marginal interest rate
negated the effects of Finland's devaluation the day before. The Bank of
Finland devalued the markka by 13 per cent on Tuesday, triggering
large-scale selling of the Finnish currency and the Swedish krona, and the
buying of D-Marks and Swiss francs.
The Swedish authorities have pegged the krona to the Ecu to strengthen their
application for EC membership, and they underlined the policy yesterday with
the rise in rates. But they could do little more than staunch the selling of
their currency: it ended slightly firmer at around SKr3.6580 to the D-Mark,
against Tuesday's SKr3.6620.
Sweden's move prompted some caution about the rise of the D-Mark and induced
some dollar buying. After touching a low of DM1.3890 in American trading the
night before, the dollar moved up to a high of DM1.4115 and closed in London
at DM1.4110. In New York it finished yesterday at DM1.4140.
European currencies were depressed against the D-Mark after the Bundesbank
drained a surprisingly large amount of liquidity from the German money
market, pushing rates close to the Lombard level and renewing fears of an
interest rate rise.
In later American trading, both the pound and the Italian lira came under
renewed pressure after a Bundesbank source was quoted in the market as
saying that the lira, peseta and sterling were all 'candidates for
devaluation'. At one stage, the pound was trading at DM2.7808 and the lira
at L765.0. The UK Treasury again issued a statement saying that no ERM
currency was seeking a realignment, while the Bank of Italy said it would
not devalue its currency.
In London, the pound had closed unchanged at DM2.7875, while the lira
finished at L763.2 per D-Mark, up from a previous close of L764.3.
Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency trading at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew,
said the Swedes would find it hard to resist devaluing at some stage. 'By
devaluing the Finnish markka by so much over the last year, the Finns have
gained significantly over Sweden in terms of exporting their forestry
products,' he added.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Money Markets: Futures fall again
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING futures again fell sharply yesterday after Sweden raised its
marginal interest rate to 75 per cent and the Bundesbank drained the German
money market of much more liquidity than had been expected.
For the second day running, futures reflected profound uncertainty over the
prospects for UK base rates. In recent days, several dealers have said that
a rate rise could happen even if the French vote Yes to the Maastricht
treaty in their referendum next Sunday.
In part, that is because the Bundesbank's intentions on the Lombard rate
remain uncertain. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the German central bank's
president, tried to soothe markets at the weekend by saying that there could
be no rise 'in current circumstances'.
Yesterday, however, the Bundesbank drained a huge DM17bn from the banking
system, pushing call money up to 9.70 per cent, fractionally below the
Lombard rate level of 9.75 per cent. If call money rises above the Lombard
rate, the Bundesbank could be forced to lift interest rates to keep a
tighter control on the market.
Sweden's massive rate rise has also worried traders because it shows the
lengths to which a European country will go to protect its currency from the
mighty D-Mark. The Swedish move throws the spotlight on the UK as the one
EMS country which has not adjusted rates to support its currency.
These fears pushed the December contract down 27 basis points from its
previous close yesterday to a low of 89.19. It later recovered fractionally
to finish at 89.24. Period rates in the cash market rose in thin trading.
Three-month money finished  1/4 percentage point firmer on the offered side
at 10 9/16 per cent.
In the morning, the Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 800m. In
early operations, the Bank purchased Pounds 67m of Band 3 bank bills at 9
3/4 per cent and Pounds 239m of Band 4 bank bills at 9 per cent.
The forecast was later revised up to Pounds 900m and the Bank purchased
Pounds 11m of Band 1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent, and Pounds 450m in a
repurchase agreement at 9 15/16 per cent. The forecast was revised to Pounds
1.05bn and the Bank purchased Pounds 10m of Band 1 bank bills. Late
assistance was Pounds 40m.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zinc squeeze fears continue
despite price fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ZINC'S PRICE fell again yesterday on the London Metal Exchange but analysts
suggested an options-related technical squeeze was still looming in the
final quarter of this year.
Market interest was also focussed on nickel, which recovered only slightly
yesterday after touching its lowest price for two and a half years. Analysts
said producers must be seriously considering cuts in output.
Zinc's price had been easing because some speculators, disappointed that it
had not broken through Dollars 1,400 a tonne, had been liquidating their
positions, said Mr William Adams, analyst at Rudolf Wolff, the metal and
commodities broker. 'There has been a bit of a sell-off but the price will
head higher again,' he said. Mr John Wolff, chairman of the LME, said the
zinc market was still being closely monitored by the board because tightness
persisted for metal for delivery in the months of October to December.
Zinc for immediate delivery fell by Dollars 36 a tonne to close at Dollars
1,376 yesterday. Since Monday morning zinc has lost more than 4 per cent of
its value.
Three-month nickel recovered slightly yesterday, by Dollars 7.50 to Dollars
6,995 a tonne. Traders suggested that nickel producers were buying yesterday
to put a brake on the steep fall seen earlier this week. However, 'at this
level it is cheaper to buy LME metal than to produce', said Mr Nick Moore,
analyst at Ord Minnett, part of the Westpac banking group. 'How much longer
before a producer cut occurs?' he asked.

BRAZILIAN investors have acquired Minpeco USA, the North-American arm of
Peruvian state-owned minerals trader Minpeco. The company was sold by
auction on Monday at the Lima stock exchange.
The sole bidder was Mercantile Industrial Inga, which has a long-established
trading relationship in zinc metal and concentrates with Minpeco USA. Inga
is associated with Ralbir, an investment group with Brazilian and Uruguayan
capital.
Minpeco USA went for Dollars 4.1m, the rock-bottom price acceptable to the
parent company and the precise amount of the debt that it had to clear with
its traditionally profitable US subsidiary. Last year Minpeco USA sold about
Dollars 400m of minerals and turned in a modest profit of about Dollars
320,000.
Mr Peter Warner, spokesman for Inga in Lima, said Minpeco had a 'fine
reputation' and there were no plans to change the company name. 'Minpeco's
strength is on the west coast of Latin America while ours is on the east
coast, so there's a nice fit,' he said.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pakistan can halt sugar imports
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SURPLUS SUGAR stocks in Pakistan are set to eliminate the country's need to
import sugar, although the potential for export remains unclear.
Pakistan's total production is expected to hit 2.6m tonnes by the end of the
1992-93 fiscal year, up from 2.3m tonnes in 1991-92. Government officials
estimate that private traders are holding 132,000 tonnes of stocks, and that
is expected to start rising next month as the new production season begins
at sugar mills.
The rise in sugar production has partly resulted from an increase in the
number of sugar mills as well as improvements in the recovery rate of sugar
cane and beet. Pakistan started with 2 sugar mills with a daily sugar cane
crushing capacity of 1,500 tonnes at the time of its independence in 1947;
today there are 54, with an aggregate capacity of 175,000 tonnes.
The rise in production has allowed cuts in sugar imports. In June this year,
imports of white refined sugar fell to just 538 tonnes, down from 3,480
tonnes in May. Last year, 36,819 tonnes was imported in June, following
48,290 tonnes in May.
However, the country's sugar export potential remains unclear. With
countries such as Brazil and Cuba having lower costs of production,
Pakistani sugar might not be able to compete, said one senior official.
Up to 100,000 tonnes of sugar is estimated to be smuggled annually to
neighbouring Iran and Afghanistan. That has made it difficult to assess if a
surplus will be left after meeting domestic consumption, including
smuggling, in order to set aside large quantities for export. However,
Pakistan will at least save valuable foreign exchange by meeting its sugar
requirements domestically. Last year Dollars 36.8m was spent on importing
sugar, which was down from Dollars 160.5m, a year earlier.

<TEXT>
CANADA IS examining ways of forming a united front with other grain
producers to protest against President George Bush's decision to offer extra
subsidies on US wheat exports.
Mr Bill McKnight agriculture minister said yesterday that Canada has
suggested a meeting with Australian and Argentine government representatives
to discuss their response to the US action. The two other countries have
already indicated that they plan to challenge the subsidies under the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Mr McKnight complained that the Americans 'are spending taxpayers' dollars
in areas where it is not beneficial in gaining markets'. He added that 'they
are harming the friends and allies that they have'.
Mr Charles Mayer, Canada's wheat minister, is due to meet Australia's trade
minister Mr John Kerin in Washington on September 21.
French President Francois Mitterrand has protested to Mr Bush about the
Dollars 1.1bn subsidy package, government spokesman Mr Martin Malvy said,
reports Reuter from Paris.
He quoted Mr Mitterrand as saying the subsidy 'creates disarray in countries
which wish to conclude an international trade accord and will certainly put
back the date at which such an accord can be signed'.
France and the US have been at loggerheads over a new Gatt pact, with
Washington pressing for deep cuts in subsidised European Community cereals
exports and Paris saying a recent reform of EC farm policy was as far as it
could go.

Australian wool is selling well at firm prices. Demand from Japan and the
EEC is good, and China is also said to be behind some of the Japanese
buying. The Australian Wool Corporation's market indicator has maintained
last week's small gain and is unchanged at 545c/kg. There was almost a
complete clearance at Wednesday's Newcastle sale, a mere 2 per cent was
passed in at Adelaide, and 10pc at Fremantle. Erratic fluctuations in the US
and Australian dollars keep prices changing even where wool itself is
selling well. The trade believes they undermine confidence, and add to
recessionary pressures.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Enticing investors to troubled
waters - Disputes about Russia's Sakhalin island fields
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN government is planning new tenders to exploit remaining oil and
gas fields off the island of Sakhalin in a bid to cool political passions
over natural resources in the far east of the republic.
A first feasibility study for just two offshore fields was awarded in March
to a consortium made up of Marathon Oil and McDermott, both of the US, and
Japan's Mitsui, amid a major dispute between Moscow and the local
authorities over which competing group of western oil companies should get
the contract.
Competition between the various consortia for the contract was so fierce
that local buses were drawn into the fray - carrying advertisements saying
'Mobil - a reliable partner for Russia' and '3M Consortium - working for the
benefit of Sakhalin People'.
Despite the cancellation of President Boris Yeltsin's trip to Japan
yesterday, politics is unlikely to come between Russian energy resources and
the Japanese companies that have been competing among each other for a piece
of the action.
Plans for an as yet unspecified number of new tenders - there are eight
fields off Sakhalin but it has not yet been decided how they will be divided
up - are designed to ease political tensions over Sakhalin's resources, as
well as to give other oil companies a share of a large but so far neglected
pie. These include the Adoptinskoye and Chaivo oil and gas fields, on which
Japan's Sodeco has priority rights entrenched in a Russo-Japanese government
accord dating from 1975; and the Arkutinsky and Daginskoye fields, for which
Amoco has already offered to conduct a feasibility study.
Sodeco was set up specially for the purposes of exploiting Sakhalin oil as
part of a diplomatic effort in the 1970s to resolve the territorial quarrel
over the South Kurile islands off Sakhalin. But having completed a
feasibility study for Chaivo and Adoptinskoye in 1983, Sodeco has been
waiting to begin work ever since, while the Russians continue to sit on
Dollars 277bn owed to Sodeco for its efforts so far.
'The question of (attracting) foreign capital has suffered from inertia,'
says Mr Andrei Konoplyannik, the deputy oil minister responsible for foreign
investment affairs. 'We have been talking about it for five years but now we
are trying not to talk but do something which goes beyond joint ventures.'
The idea is to award feasibility studies this year, and begin developing
resources in 1993. Estimated resources in the Sea of Okhotsk, the bulk of
which are off Sakhalin, include 15.8bn barrels of oil, 1bn barrels of gas
condensate, and 190 trillion (million million) cubic feet of natural gas.
While promising a start to the exploitation of these resources, the first
Sakhalin tender is also seen as a model for what not to do if the country
really wants to can build a smooth tendering mechanism.
The 3M consortium is now working to meet a December 31 deadline to complete
the feasibility study for developing the Lunskoye gas and Altun-Pistovskoye
oil fields.
But until it won the feasibility study, and even afterwards, the Sakhalin
administration and parliament challenged the choice made by a government
commission as accusations flew that corruption provided the motivation for
backing one or other consortium.
Mr Viktor Sirenko, the Sakhalin deputy governor for economic affairs, voices
two main objections to the 3M consortium: doubts that it has the resources
to carry out the work and a fear that it will drag its feet in developing
gas supplies, which the Russian far east needs for its own energy security.
Mr Sirenko carries around with him detailed figures of corporate results of
the three companies plus western agency ratings to argue that Exxon would
have been a 'more solid' partner than Marathon or McDermott.
He claims that Exxon, which had teamed up with Sodeco in the competition for
the feasibility study, has the most experience operating in a Sakhalin-type
environment. He also claims that the consortium is unlikely to produce the
gas by 1995 as the Russian side wants because Japan does not need any new
supplies before the year 2000.
These criticisms are roundly rejected by Mr Konoplyannik, who says the
government opted for a 'comprehensive approach taking into account a number
of factors'.
But the tender also became an opportunity for local authorities to present
rival oil companies with an unofficial shopping list for new infrastructure,
which the central government has so far been unable to provide. This opened
up a fierce competition among oil companies to outbid each other in
generosity.
Apart from the usual conflicts between central and local authorities
wherever natural wealth is at issue, a driving force behind the Sakhalin
squabble is local politicians' fears for their own future as they find
themselves trapped by election promises made two years ago of a
Singapore-style economic miracle on the island.
'People now blame us because things are getting worse as a result of the
government's economic policies,' said one senior Sakhalin official, who
declined to be identified. 'But we have no power to improve things because
of the dictatorship of the centre'.
Although the reserves have been known about for decades, another reason
nothing has been done until now is the enormous complexity of an offshore
drilling project fraught with great risks for the environment.
Mr Anatoly Torchinov, managing-director of Far East Offshore Exploration
Company, a state-owned company that is a subcontractor in the 3M feasibility
work, says the main challenge is ensuring that moving blocks of ice cannot
damage offshore installations and spill oil into the rich fishing grounds
around the island.

PLATINUM moved ahead on the London bullion market on concern that ANC mass
action might disrupt production at Impala's operations in Bophuthatswana.
New York's platinum futures moved sharply ahead in early trading, but then
lost most of the gains on reports that South Africa's three largest platinum
producers did not expect any production problems because of the recent
unrest, analysts said. GOLD closed unchanged in London. Dealers said the
market was still stuck in a range between Dollars 338 and Dollars 344 a troy
ounce and would continue to look weak technically until it could break above
the upper end of the band. December New York arabica COFFEE futures were
more than 2.5 cents a lb down in late trading, reflecting concern over
long-term oversupply and sentiment that ICO talks on price support will make
little progress later this month. 'Certified stocks continue to rise and it
doesn't seem like the ICO can do anything to stop it,' said one analyst. The
New York fall took the London robusta market down. New York COTTON futures
were under pressure from sluggish world demand for US cotton and plentiful
supplies.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Azerbaijan hopes for
oil-fuelled renaissance - Efforts to capitalise on the former Soviet
republic's energy wealth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STEP off a plane at Baku airport, and you see an oilfield. Hundreds of
derricks and nodding donkeys stretch away across the parched landscape like
the skeletons of trees in a dying forest.
Drive into town, and on the way the warm, humid air is heavy with the smell
of crude. In Baku itself, you may drive along Oilmen's Street, and on to
Azneft Square, named after the state oil producer.
Drop into the Academy of Sciences, moreover, and this week you will find a
high-tech exhibition by the BP-Statoil alliance, which on Monday became the
second western oil group to sign a deal with Azerbaijan.
The former Soviet republic is looking to oil to bring about its economic
renaissance, and with a population of only 7.1m but oil reserves that
experts believe could be as big as those in the UK North Sea, it may enjoy a
prosperous future.
Azerbaijan is proud of its oil-producing history. Marco Polo wrote about an
oil spring on the Apsheron peninsula as early as the 13th century, which he
noted was 'good to burn', but 'not good to use with food'. The first
commercial wells near Baku were drilled in 1871, but for much of this
century the industry was neglected by Soviet central planners concentrating
on the Volga-Urals and Siberian regions in Russia.
Now, international companies are streaming back into Baku. Amoco, the US oil
major, won Azerbaijan's first international tender in June last year, and is
currently conducting a feasibility study into the development of the
1.75bn-barrel Azeri field in the Caspian Sea.
A final contract is expected to be signed by the end of the year, and
production may begin within 30 months of the signing.
After 16 months which have seen Azerbaijan gain its independence and a new
president, Mr Abulfaz Elchibey, BP-Statoil has signed a similar agreement to
conduct a feasibility study into the Kaverochkin field, 75 km (46 miles)
south-east of Baku in the Caspian Sea, and to explore the neighbouring
Shakhovo More prospect. Kaverochkin, which has undergone two name changes in
the last three days, first to Dostlug (Friendship), and then to Chirag
(Flame) only hours before the deal was signed, is at present estimated to
contain about 1bn barrels, but experts believe eventual recoverable reserves
could reach 2bn barrels.
Mr Rauf Nadirov, an oil expert at Baku's Institute of Geology, says there
are several other known fields in the Azerbaijani sector of the Caspian. One
target for foreign companies may be the undeveloped Kapaz field, thought to
contain about 250m barrels.
Other fields are already producing but may require western technology to
maximise production. Gunashli, formerly known as the 28th of April field, is
thought to have 1.2bn barrels still in place. The Bakhar gas field is
estimated at 2,700bn cu ft, of which only a small proportion has been
extracted.
There is a host of other prospective structures, including BP-Statoil's Shak
Deniz (formerly Shakhovo More), prospect.
Onshore, the biggest field is Balakhani-Sabunchi-Ramani. The site of the
original Baku oil industry, this has already produced 2.25bn barrels. About
750m barrels are thought to be still in place, but the field is fraught with
problems, including obsolete technology, severe water penetration, and
environmental damage from pools of oil forming on the surface. Azerbaijan is
looking for foreign partners to help salvage the field.
Mr Nadirov says 60 per cent of Azerbaijan's territory is believed to be
oil-bearing, and onshore areas already producing include Neftachala at the
mouth of the Kura river, Muratkhandli, and Syazan, on the border with
Georgia.
There is already a pipeline to transport oil through Russia, and Azerbaijan
is a partner in a pipeline consortium with Kazakhstan, Russia, and Oman. The
consortium plans to construct a pipeline to transport oil from Kazkhstan and
Azerbaijan to present or future terminals on the Gulf, the Mediterranean,
and/or the Black Sea.
One idea is a line across Georgia to a new terminal at the Black Sea port of
Poti. Another option is a pipeline to the Turkish Black Sea through Iran and
Turkey.
Azerbaijan has a French-equipped offshore construction yard,
ShelfProyektStroi, south of Baku, which recently completed a Dollars 7.5m
contract from BP to construct four steel piles to be used in the UK North
Sea. It also has a well-established oil equipment industry, although like
much of Soviet industry, this has been hobbled by shortages of parts and
materials, and the breakdown of inter-republican trade.
There was a carnival atmosphere among the thousands of people who greeted
Lady Thatcher, the former UK prime minister, as she arrived in Baku this
week on a visit to President Elchibey - in time to witness BP's deal. If
Azerbaijan can remain politically stable long enough to see the benefits of
its new oil developments, it has every reason to celebrate.

BOVIS CONSTRUCTION (SCOTLAND) has brought the house down at the Edinburgh
Festival Theatre (formerly the Empire Theatre) as part of a Pounds 12m
refurbishment programme to create a world-class opera house in Edinburgh.
Bovis, a P&amp;O company, has started work on the two-year project and is on
schedule for completion in time for the 1994 Edinburgh Festival.
A new front-of-house is to be created to replace the existing facade on
Nicolson Street. Set back from the street, it will feature a 400 ft long
glass enclosure more than three storeys high.
The ground floor will provide an entrance forecourt, box office, cafe bar
and shop. A staircase is to be constructed to take audiences up to further
foyer levels, each with their own bars.
Although one of Bovis' prime tasks is to retain the architectural integrity
of the Victorian theatre, an increased stage area of 9,700 sq ft is to be
created to accommodate international touring companies. Providing more
performing space than any other theatre in Scotland, the stage will be
comparable to that of the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden.
The auditorium is of exceptional design and gives the theatre its Grade B
listed building status. Although it has been out of use as a theatre for
almost 30 years, the circle and balcony remain reasonably intact. The
seating in this area will be restored, while the stalls will be reinstated
and remodelled. Overall the audience seating capacity will be around 1,900
when the theatre re-opens in August 1994.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Construction Contracts: Housing association scheme in Wales
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Work has started on phase two of an initiative by Gwalia Housing Society
which will eventually create 800 replacement homes in a Swansea community.
The Pounds 7.7m project is being designed and built by the South Wales
region of WIMPEY CONSTRUCTION. When the company finishes its work early in
1994, 185 brick-clad homes will have been created on the estate in
Blaenymaes to take the place of concrete post-war housing.
All of the properties on the estate were previously owned by the City of
Swansea Council. But the Government's squeeze on council spending meant
Swansea could not invest the money needed to improve its housing stock. The
Council's solution was to demolish the houses and lease the land to Gwalia
for development.
In its capacity as a housing association, Gwalia obtained grant support from
Tai Cymru to carry out the major improvements which are now under way.
Wimpey is to carry out the work under a design and build contract. The
resulting scheme provides a mix of low-cost housing ranging from
one-bedroomed studio apartments to four-bedroomed semi-detached homes.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Accountancy Column: Dressing the auditor in an umpire's coat
 -Changes needed to ensure greater corporate accountability at the turn of
the century
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER DAVIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUDITING is in need of reform. For once, the profession has been overtaken
by events. The world has changed faster than we would like, while the
profession has tried too long to defend an indefensible status quo.
There is now consensus that the profession needs a new sense of direction.
What is less clear is where it will go: to concentrate on being good score
keepers, the role assigned by the Companies Act, or to take a more active
part in the play?
After the event, it is often said that the auditor is 'not doing enough'.
The public feels more could be done to blow the whistle on bad conduct,
while management wants auditors to focus more sharply on the business risks
in an increasingly complex world.
But that only deals with the present. If the profession is not to be caught
on the hop again, it should look forward to the changed needs for audit at,
say, the turn of the century. I believe a number of demands will change the
shape of audit.
Stakeholders in the audit. Society will have greater demands for
accountability from the corporate community. Employees, financiers, those
with long-term trading relationships, the community in which companies
operate and environmental interests - all will want to be better informed.
They will want confidence in that information. The law is unclear on the
duties of companies and the auditor to the wider community. This needs to be
resolved.
Scope of the audit. The sophistication of financial management techniques
will challenge further the abilities of company directors to keep up with
developments in areas such as treasury management and information
technology. The company director will be more the strategist, without the
expertise in state-of-the-art techniques held by lower levels of management.
And sadly, the fraudster, too, will have acquired new skills. Company boards
will no longer talk about internal controls so much as strategic risk
management.
The auditor will realise that he could be the catalyst for best practice.
The traditional management letter, the familiar by-product of the audit -
which too often resembles the scraps from the production process - will
decline in usefulness. At Coopers &amp; Lybrand, we have in hand a project to
provide directors with a methodical assessment of their management of risk,
with a view to its being summarised in annual reports.
Audit methods themselves will be recognised as something closer to the 'due
diligence' process for an acquisition, both in the way the audit is
approached and in the management report which results.
But let us also look at how the more traditional role of the audit will
change. The auditor will be more concerned with the future. An audit report
solely related to past accounts will not be enough. Company reports will be
expected to give better warning of future risks: of potential cash flow
problems; and of the more vulnerable assumptions made in preparing the
accounts.
The annual report itself will form a smaller part of corporate
communication. Half-year or quarterly information, presentations to analysts
(not to mention City lunches) will increasingly influence share price.
Technology will provide sophisticated global networks of company
information.
The auditor should be able to act as a catalyst for best practice in
presenting company data. The audit will need to be more of a continuous
process than an annual check on accounts.
Skills of the auditor. It follows that the skills of the auditor will need
to adapt, probably quite radically. The technical accounting and auditing
rules of recent years have tended to narrow the outlook. The audit partner
of the future will need to be more of a strategist in assessing business and
financial risks and then in assembling the necessary audit teams.
Audit will increasingly require multi-disciplinary teams, including
manufacturing experts to evaluate inventory, specialists in fraud
prevention, experts in IT strategy, lawyers, and so on. Accounting skills
alone will no longer be sufficient to provide the most cost-effective audit.
But the accounting qualification will remain as relevant, because it
represents the core disciplines of objective enquiry and presentation of
data. General audit experience from storeroom to boardroom will remain
unrivalled as a business primer.
The profession will be wise to continue to recruit high calibre graduates at
least in the numbers to which it has recently adjusted. The reduction in
less skilled work will present new challenges in training, for example
through work shadowing of senior people. Graduate training must remain the
most important investment for accountants.
This thinking is being reflected at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, for example in our
'audit re-engineering project', which is changing the process to achieve
greater cost-effectiveness. But there is little scope for further reduction
in the price of audit without gnawing at its fabric. And we are investing
heavily in information technology to achieve 'first time right' quality.
Standards. One thing will not change. The traditional values of
professionalism, independence and objectivity will remain at the fore. Any
firm which lets these standards lapse will lose business - and deservedly
so. The good auditor will be fearless in the opinions he provides. I also
hope that the sterile debate on non-audit services provided by audit firms
will have been forgotten. It is not relevant to high standards in practice.
The audit will need to be a multi-disciplinary activity provided by
multi-disciplinary firms.
Sanctions. Little of what I have advocated will happen if the ratio of
auditor's risk to reward stays as it is. Any extension of role could mean an
exponential increase in potential liability. The profession must be unique
in its risk/reward ratio. A few claims can represent the entire annual
revenue of the auditing industry.
We need a sensible deal on sanctions for deficient work: a reasonable
limitation on liability (to all stakeholders in the audit), supplemented by
fair disciplinary sanctions by the regulators. Otherwise, the auditor will
have to adopt a similar attitude to the US medical practitioner, who is
disinclined to give a forthright view because of the risks of being sued for
getting it wrong.
This is a substantial agenda for change. Score keeper or player? Maybe
umpire is the best analogy - to see fair play between a company and its
stakeholders.
It would be a serious strategic error for the UK profession not to foresee
that auditing will become more of an international activity. Capital markets
will become more genuinely global and so will regulatory regimes. Different
auditing and accounting standards will be an unacceptable barrier.
The UK profession has a long tradition of providing advice, which naturally
flows from the audit, and has set a lead to much of the world. It is surely
in everyone's interests that we should continue in this tradition and
strengthen the value of audit.
Roger Davis is head of audit at Coopers &amp; Lybrand

FT  10 SEP 92 / Government Bonds: Scandinavian markets struggle through the
confusion
</HEADLINE>

SCANDINAVIAN bond markets struggled through another day of confusion, after
the Swedish central bank raised its marginal lending rate to 75 per cent
from 24 per cent, to stem the outflow of funds.
The move followed Tuesday's decision by the Bank of Finland to let the
Finnish markka float against other currencies.
However, Swedish bond prices held up relatively well, considering the swings
in money market rates. The yield on the 10-year and 11-year Swedish
government bond rose about  1/4 point, on top of Tuesday's half-point yield
increase, while two-year bond yields rose from 13.65 per cent to 14.15 per
cent.
Signs that the rise in short-term interest rates - overnight rates reached
90 per cent - had succeeded in stemming the outflow of funds helped calm
fears of devaluation of the currency, restoring some confidence in the bond
market.
However, the success of the central bank in fending off devaluation may have
negative political consequences, given the dire straits of the Swedish
economy. 'The focus of the bond market will have to shift from the
Riksbank's hawkishness to domestic political implications,' said Mr Richard
Gray, a director of international bond research at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.
Trading conditions remained very difficult, amid widespread confusion over
rate movements. 'It was a very frustrating day,' said one trader. 'It has
been extremely difficult to get hold of paper.'
See Lex
ITALIAN bond prices proved volatile yesterday, recouping losses of more than
 1/2 point to end a point up on Tuesday's close. The market opened lower, on
renewed concerns of a currency devaluation. However, news later in the day
that the government was seeking stronger powers to tackle Italy's economic
problems provided a fillip for the market.
CONCERN about pressures on sterling again pushed down prices in the gilts
market, which ended half a point lower.
Dealers reported selling mainly among foreign investors, exacerbated by
reports that the Bundesbank might favour devaluation of the pound, the lira
and the peseta.
The focus in the gilts market is firmly fixed on currency worries and the
implications of the French referendum on Maastricht. However, attention may
turn back to the domestic economy shortly.
With retail prices and producer prices data due for release on Friday,
followed by a spate of figures including unemployment, industrial production
and money supply next week, bond dealers will, unusually, be looking for
signs of strong economic data.
'Weak data would simply increase the pressure on the government to devalue
the pound,' according to Mr Simon Briscoe, an economist at Midland Montagu.
FRENCH bond prices ended nearly half a point lower after the release of a
second opinion poll yesterday showed a narrow 51 per cent majority for a Yes
vote on Maastricht in the referendum. An earlier poll showed only a slightly
wider 52 per cent Yes vote. Traders said the market seemed to be having
second thoughts about discounting a narrow yes vote.
AFTER two days of strong gains, US Treasury prices fell yesterday as
enthusiasm over the outlook for interest rates fizzled.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  15/16 at
100, yielding 7.244 per cent. At the short end of the market the two-year
note was also lower, down  3/32 at 100 3/8 , yielding 3.834 per cent.
Intermediate-dated paper fared better early on, with the 10-year note
firming to 100 19/32 (yielding 6.284 per cent) as institutions continued to
move out of mortgage-backed securities, fearing the latest drop in interest
rates would trigger refinancings and early repayments of mortgages by
homeowners, and into intermediate-dated Treasury securities. However,
intermediates eventually succumbed and the 10-year ended down  3/16 at 100
3/8 .
The rest of the market was subdued, with investors giving back some of the
gains earned last week.

FT  10 SEP 92 / International Bonds: Upheaval in Sweden prompts postponement
of Eurobond issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE upheaval in Swedish financial markets yesterday prompted Goldman Sachs
to pull a Eurobond issue for a Swedish borrower in what is thought to be the
first such delay of its kind to an underwritten issue.
The postponement, to a Dollars 384m mortgage-backed issue, left other banks
puzzled and concerned that a precedent had been set which could affect
future Eurobond offerings. 'As professionals, we carried on underwriting
deals through the Gulf war. The state of the market shouldn't make any
difference,' said one banker not involved in the transaction.
Goldman Sachs said that the deal, for Osprey Mortgage Securities, a special
vehicle for a subsidiary of a subsidiary of the Skandinaviska Enskilda
Banken, had been postponed with the agreement of the borrower. The deal had
been underwritten before Tuesday's four point rise in Swedish interest
rates, even though it was not announced until later that day, Goldman said.
But it added that yesterday's sharp hike in rates had finally persuaded
those involved in the deal - both investors and issuer - that it would be
better to delay.
However, even banks close to the deal remained puzzled by the on-off nature
of the launch. 'It's all pretty impenetrable,' one said. 'We didn't know it
would be launched yesterday The reasons for doing it then - or pulling it
now - are equally puzzling.'
The move also left bankers trying to remember when underwritten issues have
been pulled in the past. The only transaction of any significance was a
proposed launch for BAT, the British tobacco and financial services group,
at the time of a proposed break-up bid from Sir James Goldsmith. However,
that had been a matter directly related to the company, rather than being a
market-related delay.
Meanwhile, one of the best-trailed issues for some time - a Dollars 500m
10-year deal for Landeskreditbank Baden-Wurttemberg (LKB) - received a
strong welcome.
LKB, the triple-A rated German regional bank backed by the German state of
Baden-Wurttemberg, is working hard to build its profile in the international
capital markets. Along with Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau, the German
agency, LKB is the only credit available in the Eurobond market which can be
viewed as quasi-German government debt.
This message had been hammered home to investors in thorough marketing in
the run up to the issue, ensuring a good take up by institutions across
Europe and Asia Pacific. The bonds were launched at the expected spread of
33 basis points over US Treasuries.
LKB has traditionally under-performed comparable credits in the Eurobond
market. In the past, its borrowings have been opportunistic, with issues in
retail-targeted currencies such as the Australian dollar. However, the need
to fund an ambitious expansion programme, partly fuelled by the financing of
projects in eastern Germany, has lifted the bank's borrowing programme for
next year to as much as DM12bn, of which half will be raised in the
international capital markets.
In the other big event of the day, Merrill Lynch handled a rare back-to-back
deal in the Canadian and Australian dollar markets, though to lukewarm
response.
The Province of Quebec raised ADollars 235m while SECV of Australia raised
CDollars 200m, with the two swapping the proceeds of the respective issues.
The back-to-back arrangement would have saved the borrowers 25 to 30 basis
points on their joint borrowing costs, one bank estimated.
However, the large size of the issues - the ADollars component was said to
have been the largest ever Euro-ADollars bond issue - and the fact that
neither borrower is a top-rated credit meant that both struggled to find
buyers.
After the syndicates had been broken, both settled below their issue prices.

FT  10 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: Italian tax move will lift
funding costs for agencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FUNDING costs for supranational agencies such as the World Bank and the
European Investment Bank are set to rise sharply, following a decision
yesterday by the Italian government to remove their tax exempt status for
Italian residents.
Until now, Italian residents holding Eurobonds issued by agencies of which
Italy is a member have been exempted from paying 12 1/2 per cent withholding
tax. The abolition of this exemption has been expected since early this
year.
The lifting of the tax-exemption is not retroactive, so the decision should
have limited impact on World Bank and EIB bonds trading in the secondary
market.
Eurobonds issued by Italy, and government-backed borrowers such as Ferrovie
will maintain their tax-exempt status.
The World Bank and the European Investment Bank are likely to see their
funding costs in certain markets rise dramatically.
While in some sectors, such as the Eurodollar bond market, the broad
distribution of their paper will limit their impact, their access to
extremely cheap, opportunistic funding in more obscure markets will be
severely curtailed.
For example, the EIB yesterday launched a Pta10bn issue of floating-rate
notes paying interest at  5/8 point below the London interbank offered rate.
Such a pricing would be simply 'out of the question' without the tax-exempt
status in Italy', one banker said.
'It may certainly put up the price of new issues,' said Mr Tom Hackett of
the European Investment Bank after the announcement.
Floating rate note issues were likely to be most affected, he added, though
he said that it was impossible to assess the full impact until the details
of the changes had been studied.
The EIB has been raising Ecu1.2bn to Ecu1.3bn a month so far this year, and
expected to continue its borrowing programme at the same rate.
Yesterday's news puts into question the planned launch today of a Y50bn
issue from the EIB. 'We will take advise from our lead managers on how we
proceed,' Mr Hackett said.
The World Bank, meanwhile, said that the tax change would have only a
limited impact on its borrowing programme. Ms Jessica Einhorn, treasurer,
said that the bank had been aware of the likely move for some time.
'We have for that reason structured a borrowing programme that explicitly
sought not to become too dependent on those types of borrowing.' She
acknowledged, though, that the change would have an effect 'at the margin'.

AMP Asset Management, the fund management arm of AMP, the Australian insurer
has refinanced its short-term debt through a Pounds 290m syndicated loan,
one of the largest such loans this year.
The deal, arranged solely by Fuji Bank, will refinance equivalent borrowings
raised in 1989 to buy Pearl Assurance, the UK insurer. The borrowings are on
behalf of AMP UK.
The transaction consists of a Pounds 140m revolving credit facility and a
Pounds 150m 364-day commercial paper facility. It is priced to yield 20
basis points over London interbank offered rates (Libor) and there is a 10
basis point annual commitment fee.
AMP will issue up to Pounds 300m of sterling commercial paper using the loan
as a backstop credit facility and the securities are expected to carry
credit ratings of A1-plus/P1. NatWest Capital Markets will act as lead
dealer.

<TEXT>
BERTELSMANN, the German publishing, music and commercial television group
expects profits to improve further this financial year after a 6 per cent
gain to DM570m (Dollars 407.1m) in net income for 1991-92.
Mr Mark Wossner, chief executive, said he expected turnover and profits to
rise by about 10 per cent. Bertelsmann had not experienced any of the
domestic weakness in publishing or sales difficulties in Europe that some
companies had spoken of.
Turnover in the financial year to June 30, 1992, rose by 10 per cent to
DM16bn. The net profit was after start-up costs on new projects of DM310m,
sharply up from the previous year's DM183m. Mr Wossner said the increase
partly reflected the need to lift its stake in a Berlin publishing venture
to full ownership after the death of Mr Robert Maxwell whose Maxwell
Communications was an equal partner.
Bertelsmann has been investing in newspapers in east Germany, the Premiere
pay-tv channel in Germany, and new music labels in the US, UK.
Mr Siegfried Luther, financial director, said most of the turnover increase
came from the group's existing businesses and about 2 per cent from new
ventures. Cash flow was 8 per cent higher at DM1.3bn,and net indebtedness
came down considerably from DM363m to DM43m.

NORTHWEST Airlines, the fourth largest US airline, and KLM Royal Dutch
Airlines, the European carrier which owns a minority stake in Northwest,
yesterday filed a request for anti-trust immunity with the US Department of
Transportation - a move which could herald the integration of their
operations.
The airlines said they wanted to open discussions on matters such as common
scheduling and planning, revenue-sharing and integration of sales forces.
The aim, said Mr John Dasburg, Northwest's chief executive, was to develop a
'seamless' service for customers using the carriers to travel from Europe to
the US.
Officials from the two airlines added that the carriers would persist with
dual-branding 'for the time being', but conceded that a 'common brand' could
be introduced.
The formal filing of the anti-trust exemption request with the DoT and the
related signing of a commercial co-operation and marketing pact by the
carriers yesterday, follows last week's 'open skies' agreement between the
Dutch and US governments.
This agreement, the first of its kind, ends most restrictions on flights
between the two countries and permits KLM to fly into any US city. It also
includes a memorandum which says the US would give 'sympathetic
consideration' to airlines from the two countries which wished to integrate
their systems.
KLM invested in Northwest in 1989, when the US carrier was subject to a
Dollars 3.65bn leveraged buy-out, and currently holds a voting stake of
about around 10 per cent.

GROLSCH, the Dutch beer producer, lifted net profit by slightly more than 20
per cent to Fl 14.9m (Dollars 9.3m) during the first half-year, aided by
favourable weather conditions in its home market.
Sales showed a 15.9 per cent increase to Fl 423.9m, with about half of the
rise attributable to the acquisition of Ruddles, the British brewer, in
early 1992. Operating profit rose by 27 per cent to Fl 22.4m.
The premium beer markets in the UK and Germany, where Grolsch made its first
acquisition in 1991 by buying Wickuler, a regional brewer in the Ruhr area,
were affected by difficult economic conditions in both countries. Dutch
sales were 'excellent,' thanks to good weather in the spring.
Exports to other markets were satisfactory on balance, although they varied
considerably from country to country, the company said.
Commenting on the first-half figures, Grolsch said that the same period of
1991 had been weak because of the Gulf war and poor weather conditions in
May and June.
By contrast, results in the 1991 second half were strong, and Grolsch
believes it will be able to match this performance in the second half of
this year. Overall, full-year profit is expected to show a rise.

The bank reported improvements in most operating areas. Interest earnings

interim stage

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CARNAUDMETALBOX, the Franco-British packaging group, yesterday continued to
report steady progress as it registered a 16 per cent improvement in interim
net earnings to FFr549m.( Dollars 115m).
Sales rose by just 1 per cent to FFr12.6bn in the half-year to June 30 in
the face of tough trading conditions but profits improved at a faster rate
due to improved operating efficiencies and cost reductions, the company
said.
CarnaudMetalbox, formerly known as CMB Packaging, was formed three years ago
through the merger of the packaging interests of Metal Box of the UK and the
French Carnaud.
It forms Europe's biggest packaging concern with about 85 per cent of its
sales of plastic and metal packaging materials in Europe. Operating profits
were 8 per cent higher at FFr1.2bn as productivity improved and the profits
margin widened from 9.1 per cent to 9.8 per cent. Net profits were flattered
by a net reduction in exceptional restructuring charges.
Mr Jurgen Hintz, the American chief executive who was brought in a year ago
to ease the frictions that had accompanied the birth of the merged company,
said customers were 'responding to the group's improved quality, service and
marketing performance'.
The company said packaging markets remained generally weak but expected its
results to maintain their progress over the full year.
Capital expenditure was a shade lower at FFr713m and the number of employees
was cut by 6 per cent to 30,740 during the half year. Net debt fell 15 per
cent to FFr5bn.
Sales would have been 3 per cent higher had comparable exchange rates and
company structure applied during both periods, the company added. Earnings
per share rose to FFr6.8 from FFr5.9

FT  10 SEP 92 / International Company News: GM enters US credit card market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL MOTORS yesterday became the latest big industrial company to enter
the US credit card market, with a competitively priced product christened
the GM Card.
The card, which GM says will offer rebates of up to Dollars 3,500 on the
purchase of a GM car or truck, marks an unusual departure for the largest US
motor vehicles group.
Together with other new cards on offer from industrial companies, the GM
plan could signal a competitive challenge for traditional bank issuers of
credit cards.
The GM card, issued in association with the Mastercard network, comes just a
week after General Electric, the US conglomerate, unveiled plans to launch
the GE Rewards MasterCard. Another company busy competing with bank issuers
is American Telephone &amp; Telegraph (AT&amp;T), which offers the Universal Card.
The GE card was criticised by some analysts last week because it carries a
high interest rate of 18.4 per cent and an annual Dollars 25 fee. By
contrast, GM offers a 16.4 per cent adjustable interest rate - current prime
plus 10.4 per cent - and no fee. The average rate being charged to US credit
card customers is 18 per cent.
The GM card was described yesterday by Mr Michael Losh, GM vice-president in
charge of North American vehicle sales and marketing, as 'a powerful and
innovative marketing tool that can help GM and its products stand above the
competition'. Mr Losh said GM would soon launch one of the biggest direct
mail and advertising campaigns in its history, with more than 30m Americans
receiving pre-approved GM card applications by post.
Analysts reckon that GM, which lost Dollars 4.5bn last year and recently
suffered a nine-day strike as it began seeking to pare its workforce,
clearly needs new marketing tools.
Using the GM card, consumers can earn a 5 per cent rebate, of up to Dollars
500 a year, accruable for seven years. This means that in seven years a GM
cardholder could obtain a rebate of up to Dollars 3,500 on the purchase or
lease of a GM vehicle.
In addition, GM cardholders will be able to receive a 10 per cent rebate by
using the card to buy goods or services from a group of GM corporate
partners, such as MCI, the telephone system, Avis, the car hire company, and
Marriott, the hotel chain.
GE also offers rebates for customers who use the GE card for Sprint
long-distance telephone calls or cable television services such as HBO and
Cinemax.

Sales showed little change, moving up to DKr2.24bn from DKr2.18bn. The group
said the DKr98m improvement in the pre-tax result was due to an improved
cost structure and changes in the management and corporate organisation.
The rise was achieved against a deteriorating market, which is not expected
to improve. The outlook for the market for audio and video products is a
further decline of 3-5 per cent over the coming year, said the group.
But with costs under control, management strengthened, and new products
ready, B &amp; O nevertheless expects an improvement in re-sults.
After a loss per share of DKr25, down from DKr60 last year, no dividend will
be paid, said the preliminary statement.

FT  10 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Provisions halve ABP to Pounds 15m -
Severance pay costs Pounds 2m and property write-downs total Pounds 10m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASSOCIATED BRITISH Ports, the UK's largest ports group, yesterday announced
interim profits down by a half after provisions of Pounds 10m for property
developments and Pounds 2m in severance payments.
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 31.7m to Pounds 15.1m in the six months to
June 30. The dividend, however, is raised 5 per cent to 3.25p (3.1p). Sir
Keith Stuart, chairman, said this reflected the group's underlying strength.
Turnover fell to Pounds 108m (Pounds 197m) due to a dive to Pounds 1.8m
(Pounds 94m) in the value of property development disposals.
Trading profit for ports and transport fell to Pounds 35.6m (Pounds 39.3m),
reflecting severance costs and lower margins caused by reduced volumes of
vehicles and construction materials. Overall tonnage handled at the
company's 22 ports increased by 3 per cent to 53m tonnes.
The company said revenues from July and August suggested that the division's
second-half results would be worse.
Property investment, which includes 6,000 acres of land within ports, lifted
trading profits from Pounds 10.1m to Pounds 11.2m, helped by rising rentals.
But property development recorded a loss of Pounds 1.6m (Pounds 4.8m
profit).
There were no significant sales during the period and development properties
held for sale are only 31 per cent occupied.
Development properties' book value within Grosvenor Square Properties, ABP's
property arm, fell to Pounds 124m following the Pounds 10m provision.
Sir Keith said it was too early to tell if further provisions were needed.
No sizeable sale was expected 'in the next few months.'
Interest charges declined to Pounds 20.8m (Pounds 27.6m) as average
borrowings fell, although net borrowings at the period-end stood at Pounds
348m (Pounds 344m). Shareholders' funds increased to Pounds 617m (Pounds
609m).
Gearing increased by 1 percentage point from the year-end figure to 56 per
cent. Including off balance sheet borrowings of Pounds 14m (Pounds 26m),
gearing was unchanged at 59 per cent.
Earnings fell to 5.7p (12p), leaving the dividend covered 1.75 times (3.9
times).
COMMENT
Given its development property problems, ABP could have done without
yesterday's gloomy comments on the second half for its port and transport
arm. Although the division was never expected to be immune from recession,
news that things are getting worse rather than holding even knocked the
shares down 16p to 224p, against a high for the year of 440p. Although ABP's
long-term quality is not in doubt, the company is in a holding situation.
Neither its high borrowings nor interest costs can come down without
significant property sales, which look unlikely in the current market. The
company's reticence to discuss further property provisions or port volume
details worries supporters in the City, who at present equate reticence with
possibly bad news ahead. Full-year forecasts of Pounds 36m, assuming
slightly lower second half provisions, put the shares on 17 times. Until
some of these factors are resolved, the shares are likely to remain
becalmed.

Stat-Plus Group, which retails legal and office stationery, lifted turnover
14 per cent but saw pre-tax profit fall 17 per cent in the first half of
1992.
Trading conditions remained difficult, there was no improvement in the
housing market.
Directors did not anticipate any significant lift during the second half.
Turnover came to Pounds 6.09m (Pounds 5.33m) and profit to Pounds 2.02m
(Pounds 2.43m). Earnings were 6.3p (7.25p) and the interim dividend is 3.56p
(3.125p).

FT  10 SEP 92 / UK Company News: British-Borneo surges to Pounds 2.07m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Against a background of 'difficult trading conditions' British-Borneo
Petroleum Syndicate, the oil and gas exploration company, reported profits
after tax of Pounds 2.07m from total revenue of Pounds 6.61m in the six
months to end-June.
The outcome compares with profits of Pounds 1.43m on revenues of Pounds
3.07m last time.
Mr Alan Gaynor, managing director, said oil and gas operating income had
more than trebled, reflecting the Norsk Hydro acquisition and continued
success in the Gulf of Mexico, while the emerging US business had moved into
profit.
Earnings per share fell to 4.6p (7.96p) as a result of a jump of shares in
issue from 18m to 45m following the placing and open offer in October last
year. The interim dividend is maintained at 2.667p.
The company recently announced it had paid Pounds 21.4m for a 10 per cent
interest in the Victor gas field. With estimated reserves of some 450bn cu
ft, the acquisition reduced the effective cost of exploration in the North
Sea to 17p in the pound.

FT  10 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Sunleigh turnround to Pounds 11,000 profit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Substantial progress was made by Sunleigh, the leisure products group, in
the half year to June 30. It turned round from a pre-tax loss of Pounds
1.33m to profit of Pounds 11,000.
Mr Robert Upsdell, chairman, pointed out, however, that market conditions at
home and abroad showed no sign of improvement.
He said the restructuring and refocusing of Sunleigh as an active leisure
group continued with the acquisition in April of a majority holding in Gaval
Securities, which makes sailing dinghies and catamarans under the Laser and
Dart trademarks.
The acquisition had also advanced the group's strategy to develop a more
international business base, to the extent that some 40 per cent of group
sales were expected to arise from overseas markets.
Turnover came to Pounds 6.97m (Pounds 5.34m). The profit was struck after a
Pounds 51,000 charge arising from stock write-downs and compensation for
loss of office to the former chairman.

<TEXT>
Holmes Protection, the London-quoted US security company, yesterday reported
a return to profits in the first half of the year following its recent
refinancing.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 were Dollars 1.47m (Pounds
730,000) on sales of Dollars 28.3m.
The company said the figures were not comparable with the same period last
year because of changes of accounting policies and adjustments to the
previous accounts that followed a change of management.
Earnings per share after the capital restructuring were 3.3 cents. As
expected, there is no interim dividend.
Sir Ian MacGregor, chairman, said the group planned to take advantage of its
stronger financial condition to acquire subscriber contracts.

FT  10 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Decline of 24% at British Dredging
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In reporting interim pre-tax profits 24 per cent lower, after exceptional
charges, British Dredging said all companies except BDC Concrete Products
were trading profitably.
From turnover of Pounds 16.2m (Pounds 16.1m) in the six months to June 30,
profit fell from Pounds 759,000 to Pounds 578,000 after redundancy costs of
Pounds 85,000.
The number of employees from existing operations had been reduced by 11.5
per cent between January and July.
There were higher profits from Avonmouth Ship Repairers and from the 50 per
cent associate British Dredging Aggregates. The two companies involved in
the distribution of building materials suffered from reduced demand but
achieved slightly higher margins.
Net interest income fell to Pounds 306,000 (Pounds 491,000), about half of
which stemmed from the expenditure on two new investments.
Earnings per share worked through at 2.2p (2.88p) and the interim dividend
is maintained at 2.6p.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Burnfield, the industrial controls and measurement equipment group, turned
in a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.1m for the first half of 1992.
That compared with a loss of Pounds 281,000 after exceptional charges of
Pounds 795,000 in 1991.
Despite the continuing recession, directors expected an increasing level of
profitability in the second half. That was partly the result of normal
seasonal patterns and partly benefit from reorganisation at Budenberg, a
maker of pressure gauges and calibration equipment.
There would also be a first-time contribution from Malvern Instruments, a
manufacturer of laser-based particle characterisation equipment which was
purchased after the half year.
Turnover in the first half rose to Pounds 11.4m (Pounds 8.16m). Earnings per
share were 3.9p (losses 1.3p) and the interim dividend is again 1.65p, but
on increased capital.

A strong contribution from Masterpack, acquired last October, helped British
Thornton report pre-tax profits of Pounds 947,165 in the year to April 30 on
sharply higher sales of Pounds 4.67m.
This contrasted with losses of Pounds 1.04m on sales of Pounds 730,000.
The manufacturer of educational and scientific furniture joined the market
last October.
Directors said the company was involved in implementing an internal
reconstruction aimed at a more efficient tax and commercial structure which
would enable it to pay a special interim dividend, its first since 1985.
Earnings per share were 1.04p (losses of 14.14p).

IN SPITE of lower mortality rates, Great Southern Group, the USM-traded
funeral director, lifted pre-tax profits 10 per cent from Pounds 2.31m to
Pounds 2.55m in the six months to June 30.
Turnover rose to Pounds 14.8m (Pounds 14.1m).
Mr James Smillie, chairman of the West Sussex-based company, said that both
the retail funeral and crematoria and cemeteries operations suffered from
the lower number of funerals, 'particularly in London and other urban
areas'.
However, cost controls, lower interest charges - down from Pounds 859,000 to
Pounds 654,000 - and an increased contribution from ancillary services,
including the Chosen Heritage pre-arranged scheme, helped boost the pre-tax
line.
Gearing at the period-end was 81 per cent, down from 102 per cent 12 months
earlier and 96 per cent at the December. A number of acquisition projects
were currently under consideration, Mr Smillie said.
The interim dividend is raised from 3.3p to 3.6p, payable from fully diluted
earnings of 11.85p (10.7p).

FT  10 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Waterford workers reject plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE MANAGEMENT of Waterford Crystal, the Irish crystal division of Waterford
Wedgwood, may have to add sweeteners to its latest rationalisation plan or
face industrial action and possible closure.
This follows rejection on Tuesday night by the workforce of the plan which
calls for 500 voluntary redundancies from the 1,900 employees by the end of
the year.
An urgently-called round of talks between management and unions was
yesterday adjourned after three hours to allow time for consideration of
each side's position. The company said: 'It is the first step of what will
be a long and difficult negotiation. Both sides have agreed not to make any
statements while negotiations are underway'. Further talks are expected
today.
Mr Paddy Galvin, chief executive of Waterford Crystal, announced the latest
rationalisation plan three weeks ago. Besides the redundancies, the company
is seeking across-the-board wage and piece-rate reductions, a pay freeze
until February 1994 and an industrial peace agreement for a five-year
period.
The crystal division had suffered losses totalling IPounds 72m since 1986,
and although an improvement was made during 1991, a deterioration occurred
again this year - the company reported a doubling of pre-tax losses to
IPounds 6.4m for its 1992 first half. It also warned that rationalisation
costs will again affect the full-year result.
The company had shed 400 of its workforce since a costly strike in 1990. A
further 750 jobs went between 1987 and 1990. The new redundancy plan will
result in the halving of the workforce from its 1987 level, but unions are
concerned that further redundancies are planned, as imported stemware begins
to displace products manufactured at Waterford.
Union leaders have said that industrial action to oppose the plan has not
been ruled out, but Mr Galvin warned last month that the company's survival
is at stake and that if costs cannot be reduced then Waterford faces
closure.

FT  10 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Increased costs behind 20% shortfall at
Nurdin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NURDIN &amp; PEACOCK, the cash and carry wholesaler, yesterday reported a 20 per
cent fall in interim profits mainly due to one-off items.
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 7.34m to Pounds 5.89m in the six months to
June 28. This followed profits of Pounds 29.3m last year.
Turnover increased 8.8 per cent to Pounds 704.1m, in spite of what the
company described as 'exceptionally difficult' trading conditions.
Two new stores were opened during the period, in Manchester and Leeds, which
lifted group sales. Further stores are due to open in Glasgow and Brighton
before the year end.
Mr Richard Fulford, chairman, said the performance was 'creditable' given
conditions on the high street. The company, which is increasing sales of
own-brand labels such as Happy Chef and has almost competed the introduction
of laser scanning, intends to continue to concentrate on controlling costs.
The new store openings contributed to a sharp increase in the cost of sales
to Pounds 693.5m (Pounds 636.4m), and reduced gross profits to Pounds 10.6m
(Pounds 11m).
Rationalisation costs of Pounds 1.3m and losses on property disposals of
Pounds 419,000 also depressed profits. Lower interest rates led to a fall in
interest earnings to Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 1.39m). Rental income also fell
slightly to Pounds 385,000 (Pounds 425,000).
Earnings slipped to 3.08p (3.87p) but the dividend is maintained at 1.96p.

The Guardian and Manchester Evening News group increased pre-tax profits by
25 per cent in the year ended March 28 1992, despite effects of recession.
The profit was Pounds 19.2m (Pounds 15.3m) and came from turnover of Pounds
184.8m (Pounds 190.8m).
Mr Harry Roche, chairman, attributed the improved profit to a reduction in
the cost base. Apart from publishing The Guardian and the Manchester Evening
News, the group is involved in local and specialist consumer publications
and in commercial television.
Mr Roche said the group was well placed to maintain the profit performance
and also to expand its activities.'

FT  10 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Losses from problem Ford dealer take toll
on Evans Halshaw
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOSSES OF about Pounds 400,000 at a Ford dealership which broke head office
rules proved the main dent in Evans Halshaw's first-half results.
Pre-tax profit for the six months to June 30 fell 19 per cent to Pounds
1.51m (Pounds 1.87m) on turnover of Pounds 169.2m (Pounds 173.1m).
Mr Geoffrey Dale, chairman, said the problem dealership, where local staff
had carried out unauthorised trading, was being closed. It had never made
much money.
Against a background of disappointing August new car sales, Mr Dale reported
softness in used car prices and unwelcome evidence that consumers were
deferring car body repairs and servicing.
The shares fell 33p to 201p.
Gloom about the short-term outlook for the motor trade was tempered by a
positive view of the group's longer-term prospects. It was continuing to
invest in new projects, notably multi-franchise sites offering new and used
cars from a variety of manufacturers.
The group is spending Pounds 5m on two of these complexes in the Birmingham
area, one of which will bring together volume cars from Vauxhall, Rover,
Mazda and Toyota.
Rover also gained Mr Dale's approval as 'one of the more enlightened
manufacturers' for its new pricing and stocking policies. Although the
reduced list prices would cut dealer margins and the scope for discounting,
the changes on stocks held, funding and storing would help to reduce costs.
Evans held its new car sales in the first half and added 17 per cent in
August when the national increase was less than 2 per cent. But
profitability remained depressed in a highly competitive market.
Used car sales were 4 per cent down, rather better than the market
contraction of 9 per cent. 'Over the last six to eight weeks there has been
a decline in used car values.'
He criticised manufacturers for selling direct to large customers at a big
discount. A few months later these vehicles were coming back on to the used
car market and causing a glut.
Although contributions from servicing and repairs were in line with last
year, 'people are fighting shy of having dents repaired' and tending to
'keep driving until the car breaks down'.
The Ford operation was under the most pressure in terms of profitability on
used cars and repairs and servicing, although it was holding up better on
new cars.
Earnings per share fell to 4.6p (5.6p). The interim dividend stays at 3.6p.

FT  10 SEP 92 / UK Company News: NFC downgrades 'best view' forecast to
Pounds 90m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NFC, the transport and distribution company, said yesterday it enjoyed
slight increases in turnover and profits during its fiscal third quarter,
helped by improvements in the US market.
As a result, pre-tax profits for the 40 weeks to July 11 increased from
Pounds 63.9m to Pounds 64.1m, while turnover rose 3.3 per cent to Pounds
1.28bn.
However, continued recession in the UK prompted the company to revise its
'best view' forecast for full year profits to the bottom of its earlier
range at Pounds 90m. The shares fell 11p to 218p following the announcement.
Mr James Watson, chairman, said earlier hopes of UK recovery had not
materialised. 'Given the overall economy, the results are satisfactory.
Opportunities are arising overseas, although it is going to remain tough in
the UK,' he said.
The logistic division, which provides transporting and warehousing for
manufacturing customers, increased operating profits 18 per cent to Pounds
33.6m, helped by volume growth and acquisitions in the US. July's purchase
of Trammell Crow Distribution marked the end of the division's US expansion.
The acquisitions lifted gearing from 24 per cent to 40 per cent, and Mr
Watson said total borrowings at the period-end were 'up slightly' to about
Pounds 150m. Interest costs increased Pounds 1m to Pounds 5.8m.
The company is still negotiating the sale of Pickfords and Mr Watson was
hopeful the transaction would be finalised this year.
Earnings fell slightly to 9.2p (9.3p). A third interim dividend of 1.55p is
declared, taking dividends so far this year to 4.25p.

FT  10 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Optimistic mood at Asda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr PATRICK Gillam, chairman of Asda, told shareholders that management had
been 'invigorated with a new sense of purpose' and had already succeeded in
stemming losses of market share.
'Current performance is encouraging against a difficult environment,' he
said.
However, he was gloomy about the general outlook for the food retailing
trade, saying that sales volumes were under pressure following the decline
in retail price inflation.
Asda would be affected this year by a record number of competitor store
openings.
Trading conditions would present a 'constant challenge' but the cost base
had been adjusted to match the new conditions.
Mr Gillam said the first Dales discount superstore continued to perform to
plan and a second one would open later this month in the Midlands. Another
experimental format would go on trial be trialled at Stoke Wolstanton later
this month.
Asda said it was continuing to negotiate with Costco, the US 'warehouse
club' operator, over the sale of a retail site at Trafford Park, Manchester.
Costco, which operates high-discount limited-line stores, has been looking
for sites in the UK for many months.

FT  10 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Portals records 8% improvement to Pounds
12.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PORTALS GROUP, the specialist paper and environmental protection and control
products group, reported pre-tax profits up by 8 per cent, from Pounds 11.7m
to Pounds 12.6m, in the six months to end-June.
The improvement was achieved on turnover down 3.3 per cent from Pounds 94.5m
to Pounds 91.4m.
Mr Michael Morley, chief executive, said the results demonstrated Portals'
'resilience in difficult trading conditions.' He added that the outlook was
'neutral to mildly positive,' but cautioned that with some 60 per cent of
Portals' business derived from overseas, 'any advance for the year as a
whole must depend on a general pick-up in international activity'.
The profit gain reflected a modest advance in the papermaking division and a
recovery in the protection and control business, with a further decline in
interest charges offsetting a reduction in its central division.
The security and specialist papermaking division posted operating profits
3.8 per cent higher at Pounds 10.1m (Pounds 9.73m) on turnover down 2.6 per
cent at Pounds 46.7m (Pounds 48m) reflecting deferred sales which have
slipped into the second half.
Price pressures were offset by efficiency gains and a continuing capital
expenditure programme will see Pounds 14m spent this year compared to Pounds
12.7m in 1991.
The protection and control division posted a 22 per cent rise in operating
profits to Pounds 3.4m (Pounds 2.8m) on turnover of Pounds 44.3m (Pounds
45.6m). The Computer Technology and Bradley Lomas Electrolok businesses
achieved strong profit advances with the former winning important contracts
from the National Rivers Authority and the BBC.
The Houseman air and water hygiene business held up 'reasonably well in
difficult UK trading conditions which placed pressure on its traditional
water treatment chemicals business'.
However, Mr Morley said the performance of Airoil-Flaregas, which makes
low-emission burners for the petrochemicals industry, was still
'unsatisfactory.' Operational difficulties have not been fully overcome and
orders reflected the reduced level of activity in the petrochemical market.
As a result it posted a loss similar to the first half last year.
As expected the operating loss in the central division increased to Pounds
760,000 against a Pounds 445,000 loss last year. The second half is expected
to produce results close to break-even.
Net debt on July 1 stood at Pounds 5.7m, down from Pounds 16.4m,
representing gearing of 5 per cent. The interest charge fell from Pounds
364,000 to Pounds 97,000, reflecting the strong cash flow in 1991.
Earnings came out at 14.15p (13.39p) or 13.97p (13.21p fully diluted. The
interim dividend is maintained at 5p.
COMMENT
Portals' results, as usual, are solid if not inspiring. The group has gained
a reputation as a reliable and defensive company, and the latest results
bear all the fingerprints of a safe pair of management hands. The lower
turnover in the papermaking division is disappointing, as is the continuing
loss at Airoil-Flaregas, although it seems likely this will be resolved one
way or another shortly. In the meantime the capital expenditure programme
should generate further improvements in efficiency in the specialist paper
business. With projected full-year profits of Pounds 27.5m, earnings of
30.2p, Portals is trading on a prospective p/e of 12.4. This is a stock to
hold rather than buy at present levels.

FT  10 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Drinks wholesaling helps Boddington rise
50% to Pounds 11m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BODDINGTON, the pubs, hotels and healthcare group, reported a 50 per cent
increase in profits for the half year to June 27 on the back of a strong
performance from drinks wholesaling.
Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 7.52m to Pounds 11.3m on sales
relating to continued activities of Pounds 111m (Pounds 76.1m).
Mr Denis Cassidy, chairman, said the result vindicated the strategy of
expanding the drinks wholesaling division.
The group is reviewing its 19.5 per cent stake in JA Devenish, the West
Country-based pub operator for which Boddington last year launched an
unsuccessful bid.
Mr Cassidy said: 'We are constantly reviewing our options, which include
making a bid, helping someone else launch a bid, placing the shares or
keeping our stake.'
He indicated that he might resume hostilities if Devenish's full-year
results disappointed the City. 'I will wait with interest to see what
Devenish announces for the year in December.'
Devenish recently increased interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.09m to
Pounds 4.24m, reflecting the effects of restructuring.
In the period under review Boddington's interest charge of Pounds 4.05m
(Pounds 2.33m) reflected borrowings related to its Devenish stake. Debt
remained static at Pounds 99m, representing gearing of 42.4 per cent.
Drinks wholesaling increased trading profit from Pounds 529,000 to Pounds
3.1m. About half the increase was due to acquisitions made last year.
The group's 460 pubs increased trading profit to Pounds 9.2m (Pounds 8.5m)
from 18 fewer outlets. Mr Cassidy said he wanted to expand the estate.
Hotels and restaurants produced pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.38m (Pounds
878,000) as room occupancies rose by 5 per cent to 65 per cent.
Profits from the healthcare division rose to Pounds 1.5m (Pounds 1m) due to
increased demand for nursing homes.
Fully diluted earnings per share rose to 7.3p (5.2p). The interim dividend
is increased from 2.35p to 2.6p.
COMMENT
Boddington's strategy of expanding its drinks wholesaling operations while
diversifying into healthcare has been the subject of much criticism over the
past year. Yesterday's results should go a long way to blunt those
criticisms. Forecast annual pre-tax profits of Pounds 25.8m, giving earnings
per share of 16p, put the shares - which rose 3p to 168p - on a prospective
multiple of 10.5. This is still at a discount to the sector average of 12.3,
reflecting concern that the group might launch another bid for Devenish.
There are obvious temptations to renew hostilities, not least because
Boddington would like more pubs. Yet the cost of bidding and failing in the
short-term is too great a risk. In spite of the Pounds 1.3m net annual
carrying cost of its Devenish stake, Boddington would do wise to bide its
time.

FT  10 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Savoy Hotel losses increase
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE hoped-for improvement in trading failed to materialise at Savoy Hotel in
the first half and pre-tax losses increased from Pounds 674,000 to Pounds
1.75m.
However, tax credits reduced the losses to Pounds 991,000, against a Pounds
1.24m profit previously.
The share price fell 6 per cent, from 473p to 443p.
Sales were 10 per cent ahead in the first quarter, but the continuing
recession and weak dollar reversed this progress in the second quarter and
the interim figure ended unchanged at Pounds 36.8m.
Gross trading profit came to Pounds 1.96m (Pounds 2.98m) but depreciation of
Pounds 3.11m (Pounds 2.99m) turned this into a trading loss of Pounds 1.15m
(Pounds 2,000).
Efforts during the period to control costs contained their rise to just 2.6
per cent at Pounds 35m. The same attention will be applied in the second
half.
The six months ended with losses per A share of 3.5p (4.3p earnings) and per
B share of 1.7p (2.2p earnings).
The company is majority-owned, but not controlled by Forte.

FT  10 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Difficult trading behind Hillsdown fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIFFICULT TRADING conditions facing a number of Hillsdown Holdings'
activities contributed to a 10.8 per cent fall in sales to Pounds 2.12bn and
a 12 per cent fall in operating profits to Pounds 92.1m.
Pre-tax profits rose slightly to Pounds 78.1m (Pounds 77.6m) thanks to a
lower interest charge of Pounds 14m (Pounds 27.1m).
Excluding discontinued operations, sales rose 1.1 per cent to Pounds 2.06bn
and operating profits fell 1.3 per cent to Pounds 86.4m.
Operating profits from the food businesses fell from Pounds 84.7m to Pounds
77m. The main decline was in the fresh meat and bacon division, where
operating profits were down from Pounds 13m to Pounds 7.7m.
Mr David Newton, chief operating officer, said there was severe overcapacity
in the slaughtering industry. This had been expected to be reduced as higher
standards for abattoirs were to be introduced.
However, the industry had been given more time to meet the new standards,
prolonging the overcapacity problem. Hillsdown has closed seven of its 23
abattoirs.
Further there had been a shortage of sheep for slaughter following changes
in the way farmers are paid for sheep, pushing up prices. Pig prices had
risen as abattoirs bought more pigs to offset the fall in the number of
sheep, and it had been difficult to pass on higher prices to consumers.
In the food processing sector operating profits fell from Pounds 58.2m to
Pounds 54.5m, but those from continuing operations rose from Pounds 47.8m to
Pounds 48.7m. Mr Newton said the acquisition of Anglia Canners had brought
benefits, while growth continued in the salads, sandwiches, fish, fruit and
vegetable areas.
Poultry and egg profits rose from Pounds 13.5m to Pounds 14.8m following the
purchase of the JP Wood poultry business in the first half. Mr Newton said
that so far margins in this business had not improved as hoped. Further cost
cutting was planned.
Among the non-food operations, which the group is planning to sell when
conditions are better, furniture profits rose from Pounds 5.7m to Pounds
5.9m despite the difficult state of the market. Housebuilding and property
profits were down from Pounds 16.5m to Pounds 11.9m, though on a comparable
basis profits were up.
Exchange rate movements, mainly the weakening Canadian dollar, had cost
Pounds 1.4m at the operating level in the first half, and Mr Simon Moffat,
finance director, said the effect could be double that in the second half.

FT  10 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Adverse interest swing leaves Caird flat at
Pounds 3.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAIRD GROUP, the waste management company, yesterday reported interim
pre-tax profits almost unchanged at Pounds 3.15m as the interest charge on
debt used to develop landfill sites rose sharply.
Profits rose from Pounds 3.11m to Pounds 3.15m on sales 28 per cent lower at
Pounds 9.5m after disposals in the intervening period.
At the operating level profits rose 27 per cent, despite a sharp
deterioration in economic conditions.
The group suffered a sharp swing in interest from earnings of Pounds 197,000
to a charge of Pounds 545,000 as debt rose to Pounds 15.5m and gearing to 32
per cent following a burst of capital expenditure to achieve permits for
landfill sites.
Mr John Ashton, chairman, said he was uncomfortable with debt at this level
but that gearing would fall next year as capital expenditure fell sharply.
He said the group had not only been affected by the deterioration in
economic conditions but by administrative delays in achieving new planning
consents and licenses.
'Not only can the legislative backdrop be characterised as one of disarray,
with anticipated revisions from both the EC and The UK being delayed or
amended, but also when they are implemented, they are not accompanied by
clear guidelines from the enforcing authorities,' the company said.
Earnings per share fell from 2p to 1.81p after a higher tax charge and the
interim dividend is maintained at 1.33p.
COMMENT
At the operating level these are pretty impressive results, held back only
by the interest charge on debts run up to accelerate the process of
permitting sites. The trouble is that regulation of the industry is
increasingly confused leading to long delays that leave Caird, and others in
the sector, with assets not only not contributing to income but draining
cash. Caird's bulge of high capital expenditure is probably over now and
gearing should begin to fall if not in the second half then in 1993. But it
is suffering from being a small growth stock when small is not beautiful and
growth in the UK is illusive. Nevertheless, if investors believe
management's story, it could be attractive for income, particularly via the
convertible which is yielding something over 17 per cent. Full year profits
are forecast to be about Pounds 7m, giving 4.5p of earnings, and a multiple
of only 8.8.

FT  10 SEP 92 / UK Company News: US trouble cuts Haden to Pounds 2.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHARE price of Haden MacLellan Holdings fell by nearly a third yesterday
to 26 1/2 p after the industrial conglomerate announced a 69 per cent profit
fall and slashed its interim dividend.
Pre-tax profit slid to Pounds 2.43m (Pounds 7.94m) in the first half on
turnover of Pounds 142m (Pounds 173m). The interim dividend is cut by 2p to
1p, covered by earnings of 1.5p (5.5p).
Yesterday's share price fall exacerbated the deterioration which set in in
May, when the price topped 120p. Profits forecasts have been subject to a
string of downgradings.
Mr Mel Hawley, chief executive, said the main problems arose in the US,
where Pounds 2.5m was lost in the paint-spraying equipment business and in
the environmental sub-division.
Soft demand from car makers had squeezed margins 'and the work that we had
won was not executed to budget.' New management had uncovered problems that
had not been disclosed previously.
The North American part of the automated manufacturing systems division lost
Pounds 1.6m, compared with Pounds 495,000 profit. Europe and Australia made
Pounds 3.72m (Pounds 4.34m).
The environmental section, hit as US companies cut pollution abatement
programmes, trebled losses to Pounds 998,000.
Mr Hawley said the group had 'tried to get rid of all the bad news' with
these results. Some improvement was expected in the second half.
Distribution, a UK operation involving machine tools and nuts and bolts,
slipped to Pounds 1.85m (Pounds 2.04m). Manufacturing fell to Pounds 950,000
(Pounds 1.68m).
The results were also affected by a Pounds 550,000 write down in property
values and a few business disposals.
Net cash of nearly Pounds 18m in December, mainly advance payments from
customers, had been used and net debt was expected to be Pounds 10m by the
year-end.
The group also announced the appointment as new non-executive chairman of Mr
Harold Cottam, until recently UK managing partner at accountants Ernst &amp;
Young. He replaces Mr Philip Ling, who built up the group in the 1980s but
who had increasingly taken a back seat.

FT  10 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Organic growth lifts Avonmore to IPounds
9.63m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Avonmore Foods, the Kilkenny-based dairy foods company, reported profits of
IPounds 9.63m (Pounds 9.14m) pre-tax for the half-year to July 4 1992.
The increase from the comparable IPounds 6.62m was achieved on turnover of
IPounds 335m (IPounds 293.5m).
Mr John Duggan, chairman, said the increases 'in difficult markets'
reflected organic growth in the company's international division and
'significant developments' in its meat division.
The pre-tax line also benefited from a reduced interest charge following the
IPounds 31.8m raised in an open offer last November.
Earnings per share emerged at 4.74p (4.3p) and the interim dividend per 'A'
share goes up from 1.35p to 1.45p.

FT  10 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Thorn EMI directors top the pay league
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DIRECTORS of Thorn EMI, the electrical and entertainment group, have
paid themselves on average more than the board of any other quoted company
reporting during the past year, according to the latest issue of the
Performance Rankings Guide issued yesterday.
Average remuneration for directors earning more than Pounds 20,000 in the
company was Pounds 850,000 for the year to March 31 1992.
Next highest was the board of Tiphook, the freight container and trailer
leasing group, which awarded the average director Pounds 616,000 in its most
recent financial year, followed by Lonrho, the international conglomerate,
which paid an average Pounds 597,000.
The figures come from a quarterly guide published by Hemmington Scott, the
corporate information supplier, which analyses dozens of trends revealed in
the most recent annual reports released by 1,802 UK-quoted companies.
Lonrho has the largest differential between the average amount it pays its
directors and that paid to its employees. The difference is 165 times, with
the average director receiving Pounds 597,000 and the average employee
Pounds 3,630, explained in part by Lonrho's large African operations.
It also has the highest paid director, Mr 'Tiny' Rowland, at Pounds 1.6m in
the year to September 30 1991. Five other directors received more than
Pounds 1m a year in their most recent reports: at Hanson, SmithKline
Beecham, Tesco, Glaxo and BOC.
However, the greatest absolute increase in salary of a director was Mr Mike
Hennessy of Kalon, the paint maker. His remuneration rose by Pounds 618,000
to Pounds 784,000 in the year to December 31 last year, thanks to a
performance-related bonus.
The highest average pay for employees was Pounds 70,100 at Candover, the
investment trust. It was lowest at Inch Kenneth Kajang, which grows oil
palms in Malaysia, at Pounds 150 a year.
Sterling Trust, the USM-quoted financial services company, covered its
liabilities by assets by the highest ratio, at 28.3 times, while the lowest
was Jermyn Investment, the shares and property investor, at 0.04.
Jupiter Tyndall, the fund management group, had the greatest liquidity -
measured by the proportion of capital employed in cash and current asset
investments - while Erskine House, the office equipment services company,
had the highest gearing - or ratio of debt to equity - at 17,531 per cent.
The largest growth in earnings per share over the past five years was at
Vodafone, the mobile telephone company, at an average of 291 per cent a
year.
A separate publication also released yesterday by Hemmington Scott, called
the Company Guide, shows that 52 companies have been removed from a Stock
Exchange quotation during the four months period from April to June, and 11
new ones joined. Ten quoted companies were acquired during the quarter, and
22 changed their names.
Among professional advisers, Cazenove and Rowe &amp; Pitman are the stockbrokers
which have both the most quoted clients by number and those making the most
profit. Rowe &amp; Pitman and de Zoete &amp; Bevan have the clients with fastest
growth in pre-tax profits and earnings per share (which meant the smallest
decline for the period).
For solicitors, Slaughter &amp; May and Linklaters &amp; Paines have most quoted
clients and those making most profit. Slaughter &amp; May and McKenna have both
the fastest earnings and profits growth.
Among financial advisers, SG Warburg has the largest number and the most
profitable clients, followed by Lazard Brothers and Schroders respectively.
Robert Fleming and Barings have those with fastest earnings and profits
growth.
For auditors, Coopers &amp; Lybrand has clients making the most profit. KPMG
Peat Marwick has the most stock market clients by number, and Ernst &amp; Young
the clients with fastest pre-tax profits growth.
However, Robson Rhodes - which is only the 14th largest firm by fee income -
had the quoted clients with fastest earnings growth.

The four, who own no shares in the loss-making USM-quoted company which runs

The challengers include Mr Andrew Martyr, who says he has 20 years'

FT  10 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Investment gain helps Pru to Pounds 249m -
Losses from general insurance sharply reduced to Pounds 14m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REDUCED general insurance losses and a bumper realised investment gain,
boosted the half-year result at Prudential Corporation, the insurance and
financial services group.
Pre-tax profits of Pounds 249m represented a 46 per cent increase on the
Pounds 170m achieved in the same period last year and were only Pounds 18m
short of the 1991 full-year profits.
Earnings per share advanced from 5.4p to 9.6p and the interim dividend is
increased to 4.1p (3.8p)
Overall losses from general insurance business fell from Pounds 54m to
Pounds 14m, reflecting premium increases and cost reductions.
In March the group announced that it was withdrawing from commercial
insurance business generated by brokers.
Mr Mick Newmarch, chief executive, said staff numbers at Pru's broker
division had been cut from 1,150 to 450.
Profits from realised investment gains amounted to Pounds 52m (Pounds 1m).
Mr Michael Lawrence, finance director, said a substantial chunk of the gain
was due to a decision to sell UK and US equities - many of which had been
acquired many years ago - and buy D-Mark bonds with the proceeds. In
addition the group had reduced its exposure to US and Canadian dollars by
Pounds 200m.
Overall profits from investment management operations, unit trusts and
personal equity plans, investment income and investment gains rose to Pounds
64m (Pounds 34m).
Profits from the core long-term life insurance business rose to Pounds 199m
(Pounds 190m), although gross life premium income was static at Pounds
3.4bn.
New annual premiums in the UK rose by 6 per cent to Pounds 172m, while
single premiums increased 56 per cent to Pounds 1.06bn.
UK life insurance profits amounted to Pounds 138m. The figure includes a
provision for the potential impact of any reductions in bonus which might be
necessary next March. Prudential reduced the bonus rates on its with-profit
policies last March by 7 per cent (for ten-year policies) and 5 per cent
(for 25-year policies).
Mr Newmarch said that 'with interest rates falling it is reasonable to
expect that bonuses will be reduced.'
In the US, profits from Jackson National amounted to Dollars 44m (Pounds
22.1m). The fall of Dollars 4m was attributed to low interest rates and
difficult market conditions.
The main blackspot was a disappointing performance by Prudential's
reinsurance subsidiary, Mercantile and General.
Pre-tax losses by M&amp;G's general reinsurance business leaped from Pounds 2m
to Pounds 25m. Life reinsurance profits of Pounds 32m (Pounds 24m) partially
offset the deficit.
COMMENT
Even without the realised investment gain which boosted interim profits by
Pounds 51m, the steady growth in pre-tax profits from life and general
insurance operations indicate that the company is coming to grips with the
problems that have undermined its performance in recent years. Following the
sale in 1990 of its estate agencies and the withdrawal from broker generated
commercial risks business in March this year, Prudential's main problem is
the sluggish performance of its reinsurance subsidiary. Although claims from
catastrophes could be a problem, the company is on course to produce profits
of at least Pounds 450m in 1992, giving it ample scope to increase its
dividend at a rate above the market average. On yesterday's closing price of
236p, and assuming the rate of dividend increase is sustained for the full
year, the share is on a yield of 6.8. That is above the average for the
sector and indicates that Prudential could begin to climb towards the
ceiling of its current trading range.

FT  10 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Taylor Woodrow Pounds 16m loss prompts
dividend cut to 0.5p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAYLOR WOODROW yesterday became the second large UK construction company
within 24 hours to announce an interim dividend cut after incurring a
first-half pre-tax loss.
It is reducing its payment from 1.86p to 0.5p following a loss of Pounds 16m
in the six months ended June 30. That compared with a profit of Pounds 25.3m
at the same stage last year.
Turnover fell by almost a quarter from Pounds 759.3m to Pounds 579.8m. The
loss was arrived at after a Pounds 21m provision to cover falling housing
and commercial property prices.
Losses per share were 3.5p, against earnings of 4.9p.
Mr Colin Parsons, chairman, blamed the loss on 'the severity of the deep and
prolonged recession in the UK construction, housing and property
businesses.'
He added that there was 'little reason for optimism about prospects in the
UK economy for the second half of 1992.'
The group planned to achieve a Pounds 20m reduction in overheads by 1993
through cutting costs across all operations.
The company published its results a day after Wimpey, Britain's second
largest housebuilder, announced that it had ran up a Pounds 7.2m first half
loss and was halving its interim dividend to 2p.
Taylor Woodrow's share price, which had fallen by two thirds since it peaked
at 143p in May, dropped a further 19 per cent to 35p yesterday.
Most of its businesses remained under pressure in the first half with no
sign of any slackening in the recession in the UK residential and commercial
property markets. More than Pounds 17m of provisions were against
housebuilding.
Commercial property profits, said Mr Parsons, were depressed by an absence
of disposals, which had earned the company Pounds 18m last year.
It did not provide a breakdown of divisional profits but stockbrokers
estimated that it had made about Pounds 8m from property in 1992. This was
helped by a 15 per cent net increase in rents following reviews and letting
of completed buildings.
Contracting was thought to have incurred a loss of some Pounds 10m after
provisions on overseas operations, mostly against claims for work on the
Euro Disney development in Paris. UK contracting, which broke even, had seen
a sharp drop in turnover as demand for domestic construction fell.
Housing profits were understood to have been no more than Pounds 1m, despite
an increase of worldwide sales from 724 to 819 units. The UK, where the bulk
of the sales increase was thought to have come, operated at a small loss as
margins continued to come under pressure.
North American housing profits, which were underpinned by a solid
performance from Monarch in Canada, were thought to have been in the region
of Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 2m.
Net debt at June 30 of Pounds 167m was Pounds 12m higher than at the year
end when the group reported gearing of 23 per cent. Borrowings since the
half year, however, were understood to have risen to approaching Pounds
200m.
COMMENT
In the middle of a tempest all you can do is batten down the hatches and try
to ride out the storm. To save the vessel, it may be necessary to jettison
anything that is not essential for the rest of the voyage. That is the
position many of Britain's construction companies find themselves in at the
moment, battered by the worst recession to hit the industry for half a
century. Taylor Woodrow is working hard to reduce overheads and preserve
cash for which it deserves credit. The problem is to identify where earnings
growth is to come from once the recession ends. Housing and commercial
property markets, post recovery, are likely to remain dull in low inflation
economy. For this year losses could be about Pounds 10m, or higher if
further provisions are needed to counter falling UK house prices.

FT  10 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Exceptionals cut Invesco MIM to Pounds
0.93m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESCO MIM, the UK-based fund management company, yesterday reported
sharply lower pre-tax profits of Pounds 926,000 after exceptional charges
for the six months to June 30 and cut the interim dividend to 1p.
Last year's profits were restated at Pounds 11.5m when an interim dividend
of 2.3p was paid.
The Pounds 13.8m in exceptional charges include a Pounds 9m write-off
associated with the troubled Drayton Consolidated Trust which is managed by
Invesco MIM, and a further Pounds 2.6m in management and reorganisation
costs.
The company also took a Pounds 2.2m charge for costs incurred in drawing up
plans to spin off its profitable US operations earlier this year.
Mr Charles Brady, the new chief executive who replaced Lord Stevens in July,
said that he believed that further exceptional charges were unlikely.
He said his main priority would be to establish the company's credibility.
Mr Brady said that pressure from directors of Invesco's highly profitable US
operations had been among the factors prompting Lord Stevens' departure.
The US directors are holders of a Dollars 60m convertible loan note which
matures in 1998 and has a conversion price of 105p. Yesterday, Invesco's
shares closed at 55p.
As part of that housecleaning, Invesco will be selling off its own
investment book, much of which includes stakes in companies in which Lord
Stevens was also a director. The cost of those disposals is included in the
Pounds 2.6m charge for management and reorganisation costs. That charge also
included legal fees incurred in the defence against a writ filed in
connection with its management of part of Mirror Group Newspapers' pension
funds.
Mr Brady said that among his priorities will be winning new pension fund
accounts for the company's UK operations.
Funds under management have fallen since the year end from Pounds 9.1bn to
Pounds 8.4bn, reflecting poor investment performance and adverse publicity
attracted by Lord Stevens, much of it in connection with his relationship
with the late Mr Robert Maxwell. US funds under management meanwhile have
grown from Dollars 41.6bn to Dollars 44.1bn over the same period.
'Our investment performance here has not been satisfactory,' he said. With
the problems of Drayton out of the way, fund managers should be able to
concentrate on improving investment performance, he said.
COMMENT
Whether or not Invesco's shares look attractive depends on whether Mr Brady
can clean house effectively and bring back institutional clients. The Pounds
9m charge for Drayton may not be the last and there is considerable
uncertainty about what other expensive skeletons may be lurking in the
company's closet. Meanwhile, several of Invesco's existing pension fund
clients are those of companies for which Lord Stevens is a director. These
may soon depart the Invesco stable as well. However, Mr Brady has run the US
operations effectively and if that performance can be replicated, the
shares, on a yield of almost 8 per cent, could be a speculative buy.

FT  10 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Pension scheme gain helps Sherwood treble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHERWOOD Computer Services reported a 26 per cent gain in operating profits,
from Pounds 974,000 to Pounds 1.23m, in the six months to June 30.
However, a Pounds 522,000 exceptional credit from the reorganisation of the
pension scheme, against a charge of Pounds 280,000 relating to difficulties
in the Lloyd's insurance market, together with sharply lower interest
charges of Pounds 4,000 (Pounds 119,000), enabled the group to more than
treble pre-tax profit to Pounds 1.75m (Pounds 575,000).
Turnover fell to Pounds 10.7m (Pounds 12.1m), mainly reflecting the transfer
of the disaster recovery business into a joint venture with ICL in April
1991.
The joint venture contributed Pounds 132,000 to operating profits.
Fully diluted earnings per share grew to 16.7p (6.6p); the interim dividend
is 1.75p (1.5p).
Mr Richard Guy, chief executive, said the results reflected 'the high levels
of new orders being achieved,' particularly in the Lloyd's insurance market
for the Sceptre underwriting system. Among these the group announced a new
order, worth more than Pounds 1m, from Lloyd Roberts &amp; Gilkes.
The group also serves the retail financial service, local government and
housing association markets with specialist systems. Mr Guy said all market
sectors made a positive contribution to the results.

depressed market

<TEXT>
WILSON (CONNOLLY) Holdings, the Northampton-based builder, saw pre-tax
profits drop from Pounds 13.8m to Pounds 8.77m in the first half of 1992.
The interim dividend is held at 1.27p.
Turnover dipped from Pounds 99.9m to Pounds 97.2m. House sales were slightly
lower. Wilson said it sold 1,250 houses at a net margin of 11 per cent in
the first-half compared to 1,300 homes in the 1991 period.
Mr Lynn Wilson, chairman, said that 'house prices have continued to fall
with a consequential effect on profits,' and it was difficult to see any
recovery in the housing market.
However, he added that,'by careful management of our resources and the
proceeds of our share placing, we are currently cash positive and interest
payments during the period were 14 times covered by pre-tax profits.'
The company said that its property side continued to trade profitably while
its construction company 'continued to perform creditably in a most
difficult and competitive market.'
Earnings per share fell to 3.2p (5.1p), but the unchanged dividend remains
covered 2.5 times.

FT  10 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Further provisions lead to Pounds 20m loss
at MTM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MTM, the fine chemicals company that has suffered a collapse in its share
price this year, yesterday reported a Pounds 28m interim loss that included
further provisions to cover reductions in net asset values.
The results followed the removal late on Tuesday of Binder Hamlyn, the
company's auditors throughout a sorry period that has seen the departure of
Mr Richard Lines, the founder chairman, and the collapse of the shares from
a high of 289p in February to 33p yesterday.
Price Waterhouse has been appointed as the new auditors.
The new provisions of Pounds 18.1m include a Pounds 10m reduction in the
value of MTM's assets in addition to downward revaluation already included
in MTM's delayed 1991 accounts.
As a result the group's net assets are reduced to Pounds 15m against net
debt currently standing at Pounds 100.6m.
Mr Ken Schofield, the chief executive brought in to replace Mr Lines, said
he hoped to have generated about Pounds 20m of cash through disposals before
the year-end but that this would still leave the need for substantial
injection of new capital.
The Pounds 28m pre-tax loss was struck on sales of Pounds 56.5m. Losses per
share were 31.4p and there will be neither an interim nor a final dividend.
The company said comparison with last year's first half would be misleading
because reported profits for that period had been materially overstated.
Mr Schofield, who helped turn round Hickson International, said yesterday
that he was more used to simply running chemical companies and that he had
'never been in this sort of fairy land before'.
He had identified two core businesses in fine and performance chemicals
supported by research, and the group would trim away about half its 18
productive sites.
'This year had been hit dramatically worse than I expected,' Mr Lines said,
referring to the inflated values of assets in the books.
There was however, considerable scope for simple improvements in operating
efficiency and increasing capacity utilisation that would sharply improve
profitability, he added.
COMMENT
Institutions which have watched MTM's share price plunge this year may find
it mildly cheering that their company was so badly run by the previous
management that it now represents a potentially very interesting recovery
situation. They may need every ounce of phlegm in the next few months; if a
slimmed down MTM with half the number of production sites is to emerge from
gearing of more than 500 per cent, investors may have to provide Pounds
35-40m in a 1-for-1 rights issue or worse. Should they decide to throw in
the towel, however, it would be a shame. With only a little additional
productive capital expenditure, greater efforts to increase load factors and
some more focused operational management, MTM could turn around quite
quickly. Investors can also now be certain that with the arrival of Price
Waterhouse as auditors, the old axis of former management, former advisers
and former auditors has finally been broken and there really should be no
more surprises like this period's further increase in asset revaluations.

PRICE Waterhouse, administrator of Maxwell Communication Corporation,
yesterday sold another slice of the empire - Panini, the Italian childrens'
stickers company.
MC Italia, holding company of Panini, which Mr Robert Maxwell tried
unsuccessfully to sell in his lifetime, has been sold to a consortium of
investors led by Bain Gallo Cuneo Capital Investments.
The purchase price was not disclosed.
The sale follows the announcement on Monday that Price Waterhouse had sold
MCC's 75 per cent stake in Nimbus Records, the compact disc manufacturer and
record label.
Mr Jonathan Phillips, one of the joint administrators, said yesterday that
the sale represented a very satisfactory outcome for MCC's creditors.
After the sale of the Nimbus stake the disposal of MCC's non-US business
assets was largely complete.
The Panini deal was conducted through an international auction.
It was the first MCC disposal to require the approval of the US Bankruptcy
Court.
Panini, which produces football stickers, is based in Modena.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Gota to receive Swedish support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN'S centre-right government yesterday promised to support Gota Bank,
the country's fourth largest commercial bank, after it forecast a sharp
deterioration in its financial position and warned that credit losses would
amount to SKr8bn (Pounds 784m) in 1992 - or double its previous forecast.
The government said that Gota's obligations would be met and it promised to
take the necessary measures to maintain the stability of the financial
system.
The announcement coincided with a tumultuous day in Sweden's financial
markets after the Riksbank, the central bank, raised its marginal rate from
24 per cent to 75 per cent to defend the Krona.
Gota Bank said credit losses for 1992 would be SKr7 to SKr8bn, against its
earlier forecast of SKr4bn, and predicted that operating losses for 1992
would be SKr3 to SKr4bn. The bank blamed the combination of high interest
rates and Sweden's recession which have resulted in severe credit losses for
the Swedish banking sector.
The government, which has already been forced to help rescue Nordbanken,
another commercial bank, said it would discuss the future of Gota with its
management and owner, the Swedish insurance group Trygg-Hansa SPP.
It expects to reach a solution within the next few weeks, and is understood
to be considering several options including: stripping out Gota Bank's
non-performing loans and placing these in a separate company; combining
Gota's non-performing loans with those from Nordbanken; and selling Gota
Bank.
Gota's position came to a climax after Trygg-Hansa, which owns 96 per cent
of the bank's shares, said it would not provide further funds for the
troubled bank.
On Tuesday, Trygg-Hansa had to pull a SKr3.1bn share offer - which was
intended to strengthen Trygg-Hansa's capital base - because of turbulence in
the Nordic financial markets.
In June, Gota announced a stop-loss insurance plan which was intended to
protect Gota's shareholder's equity and provide protection against credit
losses and defaults on interest payments.

FT  10 SEP 92 / P&amp;O increase fails to impress market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SLIGHTLY better than expected interim profits from Peninsular and Oriental
Steam Navigation Company failed to lift the company's shares, which fell 9p
to 340p after Lord Sterling, chairman, warned that second-half trading had
deteriorated in some areas and a continuing strong dollar would hit profits.
Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 73.1m to Pounds 101.1m in the six
months to June 30, helped by a lower interest charge - from Pounds 71.7m to
Pounds 53.8m - following last year's Pounds 604m rights issue.
Lord Sterling said economic confidence appeared to have waned again. 'In
this climate . . . people are simply waiting,' he said.
Bovis Homes, the company's housebuilding arm, had a 'disappointing' first
half, although average selling prices were maintained. Sales levels in July
and August were again lower than in the same period last year.
Bovis Construction performed well, mainly due to overseas contracts, and the
company's order book is unchanged from six months ago at about Pounds 3.7bn.
P&amp;O European Ferries continued to perform well and carried record numbers of
passengers.
The ferry and cruise operations weathered recession because customers had
higher disposable incomes, Lord Sterling said, although cruise operations
were vulnerable to the weak dollar.
Operating profits for P&amp;O's divisions were: service industries down 12 per
cent to Pounds 46.2m, passenger shipping up 10 per cent to Pounds 48.1m,
container and bulk shipping up 17.2 per cent to Pounds 36.2m, investment
property up 19.4 per cent to Pounds 38.1m.
Housebuilding, construction and development saw increased losses from Pounds
3.5m to Pounds 13.7m. Most of the losses were incurred before P&amp;O and
Chelsfield restructured their joint venture property company, Pall Mall, in
April. The restructuring brought about Pounds 525m of debt on to P&amp;O's
balance sheet, and lifted net borrowings from Pounds 1.1bn to Pounds 1.6bn,
to take gearing on stockholders' funds of Pounds 2.3bn to 70 per cent.
Turnover and operating profits were barely changed at Pounds 2.46bn and
Pounds 154.9m, respectively. There was an extraordinary gain of Pounds
51.6m, mainly from the sale of part of the company's stake in a Hong Kong
container terminal.
Earnings increased 17.3 per cent to 12.2p while the dividend is maintained
at 13.5p.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Invesco to pay compensation to Drayton from charge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESCO MIM, the fund management group, said yesterday that a portion of a
Pounds 9m exceptional charge to its interim earnings will be paid to Drayton
Consolidated Trust, an investment trust managed by Invesco, as compensation
for having violated investment trust guidelines.
The move is connected with Drayton's investment in Alma Holdings, Scotland's
largest sweet manufacturer, which collapsed earlier this year. Drayton
Consolidated, which concentrated on investments in unquoted companies, had
the value of its assets written down by Pounds 47m earlier this year and is
under reorganisation.
Mr Rattan Engineer, Invesco MIM's finance director, said there were no legal
proceedings connected with the compensation.
The violation which attracted the compensation concerned a rule of the
Drayton trust barring it from holding a stake greater than 15 per cent stake
in any company. While the nominal value of Drayton's stake in Alma, at
Pounds 4m, did not exceed that, Drayton also guaranteed a Pounds 15.8m bank
loan for the company.
Loan guarantees are contingent liabilities and off-balance sheet and these
were not immediately disclosed to shareholders. However, when Alma
collapsed, the loss was crystallised, raising Drayton's stake in Alma above
15 per cent. Analysts expected the compensation to Drayton to be distributed
to shareholders.
Mr Engineer said a portion of the Pounds 9m exceptional charge also included
the effects of further Drayton asset writedowns but he did not expect more
provisions would be needed for Drayton.
Plans for a complete reorganisation of Drayton will be submitted to
shareholders in October. Preliminary plans call for the quoted investments
to be sold and proceeds distributed to shareholders while the unquoted
portion will be managed by Foreign and Colonial as an investment trust.
Mr Engineer said Invesco might have to repurchase a portion of those assets
for its own book to prevent the new trust from violating the ceiling on
holdings in individual companies.

FT  10 SEP 92 / ECC makes surprise Pounds 13m provision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE share price of English China Clays, the world's largest producer of
china clay, plunged almost a sixth yesterday from 446p to 371p after the
company announced an unexpected Pounds 13m provision against its depressed
UK housebuilding and building materials business.
The stock market value of the company fell by more than Pounds 200m as 6.7m
shares were traded, the highest daily volume in the company's shares for
four years.
The provisions, of which Pounds 11.2m were against housebuilding, were
revealed as the company announced a 23 per cent fall in pre-tax profits from
Pounds 53.2m to Pounds 40.8m. There is an unchanged interim dividend of
6.6p.
English China also announced that it would be cutting 400 jobs in its UK
building materials division. Last year the group reduced its worldwide
labour force by more than 2,000 to 10,800. Most of the job losses were in
the UK.
The company has already announced its intention to run down its UK housing
operations by developing or selling its remaining housing land. The market,
however, had not expected the company to make write-downs at this stage.
Mr Andrew Teare, chief executive, said: 'There has been a marked
deterioration in the UK housing market during the past three to four weeks
and this prompted our decision. The fall follows from the ending last month
of government concessions on stamp duty on the purchase price of homes up to
Pounds 250,000.' Following the company's announcement, stockbrokers cut
their pre-tax profits forecasts for English China for this year, from
between Pounds 120m-Pounds 135m, down to Pounds 90m-Pounds 95m.
The company said that first-half profits before the provision were
marginally up at Pounds 54.1m, from Pounds 53.2m, helped by an interest
charge of only Pounds 600,000 against Pounds 11.4m at the corresponding
stage last year.
Net debt of Pounds 128m is mostly in US dollars. The group therefore is
benefiting from very low interest rates in the US as well on currency
translation into sterling.
Profits from china clay, used mainly for fillers and coatings by the paper
industry, slipped from Pounds 48.9m to Pounds 46.5m while building material
profits fell from Pounds 11.3m to Pounds 7.5m. Housing profits fell from
Pounds 8.9m to Pounds 4.5m.
Earnings per share declined from 12.63p to 10.22p. Group turnover fell from
Pounds 511.8m to Pounds 479.4m.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Hillsdown advances after cut in interest charges: Food
group's shares fall despite higher profits and pledge on maintained payout
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HILLSDOWN Holdings, the food group, saw its shares slump 23p to 83p
yesterday in heavy trading, in spite of announcing marginally higher interim
profits and promising a maintained annual dividend, barring unforeseen
circumstances. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 77.6m to Pounds 78.1m, but
the gain was due to a Pounds 13.1m fall in the interest charge to Pounds 14m
following the group's Pounds 280m rights issue a year ago.
A gloomy statement on the second-half outlook persuaded analysts to cut
profit forecasts for the year, even after heavy downgradings in recent
weeks. One said: 'The market is taking nothing on trust.' The shares are on
a yield of 14 per cent on the basis of the dividend forecast, suggesting the
market is not convinced about the payment.
Sir Harry Solomon, chairman, said the first quarter had been reasonable but
profitability declined 'quite markedly during the second quarter'. He said
the group faced 'a difficult second half' with trading continuing to
deteriorate in some areas.
Sir Harry said the group's poultry business was suffering because of imports
of cheap chickens from France. These were not kept in conditions up to the
standards introduced in the UK after the salmonella scare at the end of
1988. He said the group aimed to be the lowest-cost producer of chickens but
could not compete with imports unless 'we are all operating on a 'level
playing field'.'
Mr David Newton, chief operating officer, said given the trading conditions
 -such as food price deflation of 2 per cent and pressure from food
retailers - the businesses were 'responding as vigorously as they can'.
Analysts were concerned by Pounds 88m of debt on the balance sheet following
a change in policy on securitising trade debtors.
Mr Simon Moffat, finance director, said this change increased the group's
gearing by 8.6 percentage points to 26.9 per cent at the end of June. He
said: 'There is no black hole in the cashflow or balance sheet.'
Earnings per share were down 23.3 per cent to 6.96p, due to a higher tax
rate and the increased share capital, and the interim dividend is unchanged
at 2.2p.
The 21.7 per cent fall in the shares set the seal on the removal of
Hillsdown's shares from the FT-SE 100 index yesterday.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Italy bows to foreign bankers over Efim debt
</HEADLINE>

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian government yesterday gave way to sustained pressure from foreign
bankers over the handling of L3,500bn (Pounds 1.65bn) worth of debts of
Efim, the state industrial holding put into voluntary liquidation in July.
The government backed down on its proposal to cover Efim's borrowings by
issuing bonds in lire or Ecus at interest rates below the market. This would
have meant creditors receiving about 80 per cent of their principal and
interest otherwise due.
Instead the Amato government, in an effort to restore its credibility in the
international markets over the two-month-old Efim saga, offered to pay
interest at the same level as when the debts were contracted.
Foreign bankers were angry at the lack of original information when Efim was
placed in voluntary liquidation with debts totalling L8,500bn.
This latest development occurred as the holding company's accounts for 1991
were released showing the financial health of Efim was deteriorating faster
than publicly admitted before the government's decision to place the group
into voluntary liquidation.
Losses for 1991 were L1,181bn against the previous year's loss of L374.2bn;
while estimates up to mid-July suggest losses running at L900bn.
Efim at one stage had talked of the 1991 results holding losses down to
L271bn.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Biggest banks reject proposed watchdog
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S four largest clearing banks have told regulators they will not
participate in the Personal Investment Authority, the proposed
self-regulatory body.
The authority is intended to improve investor protection and spread the cost
of compensation.
The stance being taken by the banks could make it impossible to launch the
authority. Life insurance companies, which provide most funding for the
current self-regulatory structure, have said they will not participate
unless banks and building societies do.
If the PIA fails to get off the ground, the government is likely to review
the self-regulatory structure for the financial services industry, according
to banking sources. 'Sir Brian Hays (chairman of the PIA formation
committee) has been telling the banks that if PIA fails, self-regulation
fails,' said one banker familiar with the talks.
The authority is intended to merge Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the
life insurance and unit trust industries, and Fimbra, whose members are
independent financial intermediaries.
It is intended that unit trust sales forces who are members of Imro, which
oversees the fund management industry, would join the PIA as well. It would
need approval from 70 per cent of Lautro and Fimbra members.
The primary objection voiced by Barclays, National Westminster, Midland and
Lloyds is that they will be forced to increase substantially their
contributions to the Investors Compensation Scheme to cover defaults among
small independent financial intermediaries.
The banks also fear that life insurers, their keenest competitors, will
control at least a third of the votes on the PIA's board. Another fear is
that, if each member is entitled to a single vote on important issues, the
banks will be outvoted by small advisers on critical matters.
Under the Financial Services Act, companies must belong to one of four
self-regulatory organisations (SROs) covering different types of business,
but may not be forced to join any particular one.
They can also seek direct regulation from the Securities and Investments
Board which oversees the SROs. The life insurance and unit trust arms of the
clearing banks are mostly regulated by the SIB, as are some building
societies.
A consultative document outlining the charter of the PIA, designed to
regulate the sale and marketing of all retail financial products, is to be
released on September 24. The document is expected to offer inducements to
encourage all providers of retail financial services to join the planned
authority.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Kohl defiant in face of critics: Chancellor calls for united
action on east Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday shrugged off all speculation about
his political demise, and called on both sides of German industry, the
opposition and the federal states to work out a common programme with the
government to finance economic recovery in the east.
In a belligerent return to the political fray in the Bundestag, Mr Kohl
admitted mistakes in his unification policies and called for agreement on
ways to reduce the high costs of production in both halves of the country.
He put forward no proposals of his own on how to finance the rising costs of
the eastern reconstruction - an issue which has split his coalition - but
put his faith instead in the round table he has summoned to agree on a
'solidarity pact'.
He shrugged off attacks from the opposition Social Democrats about the lack
of precise policies from the government, while admitting that since
unification in 1990, 'we did a lot of things right, but also failed to
achieve many things. We know a lot more of the enormous problems caused by
this extraordinary event than we did two years ago'.
It was essential to maintain the productive capacity of west Germany in
order to finance recovery in the east, he said. Private investment in the
east was still lagging far behind expectations.
He called for measures to provide further encouragement to small and
medium-sized enterprises in the east of the country, and restraint in wage
rises in order to provide a basis for a sustained recovery.
Mr Bjorn Engholm, leader of the Social Democrats, said that a speech 'built
on the motto of faith, hope and charity is no answer to the worries and
needs of the people now. This government is like a ship drifting in heavy
seas without a captain. The crew needs a clear word from the bridge, but the
officers are chatting about the weather'.
Both Mr Engholm and his parliamentary leader, Mr Hans-Ulrich Klose, insisted
that the government had to produce firm proposals and clear forecasts on the
financing needs of east Germany, to make a round-table exercise worthwhile.
They attacked Mr Kohl for his half-hearted condemnation of racist attacks on
foreigners in Germany. Mr Klose said the chancellor gave the critics tacit
encouragement by insisting that the prime cause of the problem was the
number of unjustified applicants for political asylum.
He promised SPD co-operation in finding a solution, as part of a broader
regulation of immigration, provided it preserved the fundamental individual
right to political asylum.

FT  10 SEP 92 / New Lloyd's chief vows to restore market's good name
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Peter Middleton, formally appointed yesterday as chief executive officer
of Lloyd's of London, denied that he had been handed a 'poisoned chalice'.
'Lloyd's is a great institution and a fabulous brand name. Although it may
be a bit tarnished, it will not take long to restore,' said Mr Middleton, a
businessman and former diplomat who is joining Lloyd's after a year of
turmoil unprecedented in the insurance market's 300-year history.
Record losses of Pounds 2.06bn were announced by Lloyd's in June when the
market reported its results for 1989. Further losses are likely in the next
two years when results are reported for 1990 and 1991. Hundreds of the
22,300 individual Names, whose assets support the market's capital, are
already facing financial ruin.
Now 52, Mr Middleton spent 16 years in the diplomatic service before joining
Midland Bank International in 1985. He later led the expansion of travel,
leisure and foreign exchange activities at the bank's subsidiary, Thomas
Cook, before negotiating the group's sale to German interests earlier this
year.
Mr Middleton, who will receive a pay package worth Pounds 250,000, including
pension contributions, said his lack of experience of insurance was
'probably a bonus'.
'My job is to pull together a vision of the future of Lloyd's and how it
will develop over the next three to five years.'
Although Mr Middleton's combination of diplomatic and business experience
may help him to administer the highly complex market, his background and
interests will set him apart from establishment figures at Lloyd's.
A former monk, Mr Middleton studied philosophy at the Sorbonne, speaks
fluent French and professes abiding passions for motorcycles and
Middlesbrough FC, his home-town football club.
He will be the first chief executive of a new market board, being formed to
spearhead efforts to reduce costs, improve the market's professionalism and
reverse the decline in Lloyd's share of international specialised commercial
insurance and reinsurance business.

FT  10 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Sweden
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden continues to reap the consequences of its remorseless monetary
squeeze. But with real interest rates in the mid to high teens, the pressure
on the financial sector seems to be growing unbearable. Just as the central
bank was bracing itself to raise its marginal overnight lending rate to 75
per cent yesterday, it became clear that the government would have to rescue
Gotabanken, the country's fourth largest bank.
It has little option but to do so. A large bank failure would undermine
efforts to maintain the krona exchange rate because it would brutally expose
the economic impact of present high interest rates. Trygg-Hansa, the
insurance company which owns Gotabanken, simply cannot afford to continue
pumping money into its banking subsidiary. Gota's position appears to have
deteriorated at an alarming rate. Its problem loans now exceed by a wide
margin the SKr13.5bn loss insurancetaken out as recently as June.
Trygg-Hansa would be left with capital of only SKr8.4bn after writing off
its investment in Gota and its exposure to Svenska Kredit, the credit
insurance company which collapsed yesterday. It would still have a
respectable solvency margin of 114 per cent on its Swedish property and
casualty business. But the figure would be much lower with consolidation of
its US business and the company has acquired a reputation for lurching from
blunder to blunder.
As long as the monetary squeeze continues, the problems of the financial
sector can only grow worse. The government has already spent SKr25bn bailing
out Nordbanken, another large bank. It looks as though taxpayers will have
to pay for monetary rectitude for years to come. There will be precious
little by way of economic growth to enjoy in return.

FT  10 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: P&amp;O
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At the trading level, yesterday's interim results from P&amp;O seemed to meet
expectations. But significantly, the Pounds 18m reduction in interest
charges came not from the Pounds 600m proceeds of last year's rights issue -
which were largely offset by Pounds 525m of increased borrowings when the
bulk of P&amp;O's stake in Laing moved on to the balance sheet. Instead the cost
of dollar borrowings fell with US interest rates. While the rights issue may
not have been directly used to repair the hole blown in finances by the
Laing adventure, its juxtaposition with the borrowing increase illustrates
where a lot of shareholders' funds have gone.
Of course, those are past mistakes. More chilling was a statement by the
chairman that if the economy and the dollar remain depressed, second-half
figures could be disappointing. P&amp;O has invested heavily through the
recession, and the greater part of its operations are in property and
housing or exposed to the vagaries of consumer confidence. While operations
like shipbuilding require long-term planning, shareholders may be forgiven
for wondering when they will see a return on money spent.
Capital expenditure should decline towards the end of the year, easing the
pressure on cash flow, yet tough trading conditions may leave the dividend
barely covered by earnings. Hence the share price reflects concern over the
payout. Given a classical recovery, P&amp;O would be a screaming buy on a yield
over 11 per cent. In a harder world, it is in for a long sweat.

FT  10 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Hillsdown
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hillsdown looks to be heading for a third consecutive annual decline in
earnings per share. Judged by last night's 14 per cent yield on the shares -
notwithstanding the promise of a maintained final - the market is clearly
concerned that the rot will not stop there.
Certainly the company looks to be locked into a dangerous game of spending
heavily on rationalisation, without any clear sign of how and when the
profits are set to bounce. The trading outlook is bleak in the short term,
and the whole sector is nervous ahead of the crucial Christmas period. On
top of that there are structural problems in fresh meat and poultry, largely
responsible for yesterday's sharp reductions in forecasts.
On the other hand, the eye-catching appearance on the balance sheet of
Pounds 88m of previously factored debt should not be exaggerated. Worse
types of black hole could be imagined, it should not happen again, and it
emphasises the scope for improvement in Hillsdown's working capital
management. Tough management words about imported French fowl admittedly
need to be matched by action. But the market itself may be in danger of
playing chicken.

FT  10 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Clays loses its feet
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The savaging of English China Clays yesterday represents a grim warning for
any company which turns in interim profits below the market's expectations.
Mr Andrew Teare, the chief executive, has certainly blotted a previously
pristine copybook. But it is a bit rich for investors to complain about the
timing of the offending land bank provisions. It would have to have been
made anyway at the end of the year and merely underlines the wisdom of the
original decision to get out of housing.
The accompanying disappointment of low land sales, of course, has dented
ECC's image as a strong cash generator. ECC should still be cash positive
over the year as a whole, but after two years of throttling back on
investment capital expenditure is rising again.
The main concern, however, centres on the 1 percentage point fall in clay
margins and the prospect of that trend worsening over the next six months.
ECC points out that it has seen a Dollars 2 pound in the past, but the
market is understandably worried that even a trickle of cheaper clay imports
will put pressure on European prices. Paper industry customers, after all,
could do with the relief. Compensating volume increases can only be dreamed
of at this stage, while it is hard to see further scope for removing costs.
In some senses yesterday's re-rating is only overdue acknowledgement that Mr
Teare is not infallible. A 7.1 per cent yield, on the other hand, seriously
circumscribes his freedom to make acquisitions with the paper. Shackled to
the economic cycle for the foreseeable future, the challenge for a
fundamentally extractive company must be to avoid a valuation closer to that
of the stricken building sector.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Observer: Mandarin switch
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If any restless mandarins think they're too old to switch careers, they
should take comfort from Peter Middleton, Lloyd's new chief executive.
He was 45 when he quit the foreign office and had never made a loan in his
life. Yet within a year or so of joining Midland Bank International he
headed banking operations, and at 47 was given the job of turning round
Midland's Thomas Cook. While not at Midland long enough to prove whether
he'd make a good banker, he has certainly done well at Cook.
The travel company is again the brand leader, its demoralised management has
been revitalised and it is one asset Midland has been able to sell at a
handsome profit. All this was done with minimum self-publicity and it is a
measure of Middleton that when he announced his resignation a few weeks ago,
he said he wasn't sure that his colleagues would notice he had gone.
Admittedly, he has been helped by friends in high places. Sir Michael
Palliser, a former head of the diplomatic service and Midland director,
smoothed his path, and Frenchman Herve de Carmoy, a suave ex-Midland banker
with a high opinion of himself, used Middleton as a guinea pig. De Carmoy
wanted to see if it was possible to take British civil servants and teach
them another job in the private sector, as often happens in France.
It was one of de Carmoy's better experiments at Midland Bank. Middleton has
proved that ex-civil servants can make effective managers as opposed to
non-executive directors.

Despite the British broadcasting industry's state of controlled hysteria,
the race for the network controller's post at ITV has reached the home
stretch.
An overseas choice looked on the cards when the company's bosses approached
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's Ivan Fecan about the job of
commissioning and scheduling Pounds 500m worth of programming yearly, under
the watchful eyes of ITV chief executive Andrew Quinn. But Fecan has decided
against.
That leaves two obvious front-runners, both holding director of programmes
jobs. One is Steve Morrison. The problem for him is that he works for
Granada, where Quinn himself was chief executive. So the appointment of
Morrison might mean Granada had too much central power. The same applies,
albeit more remotely, to outside chance Jonathan Powell, controller of BBC
1, who was previously a Granada drama-producer.
So the favourite must be second front-runner Marcus Plantin of London
Weekend Television. If he wins, however, LWT would look to be gaining what
Granada is being denied. For the chairman of the ITV association is LWT
chief executive Greg Dyke.

Volcanic fire clearly lies concealed by the mild manner of cheerful Poul

according to his foreign minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, once the volcano
erupts, no political force on earth can keep it in check.
The two Danes had an exhausting schedule one day during the country's
chairmanship of the European Council five years ago. They began with a
morning session in Portugal, lunched in Rome, and arrived for an evening
meeting at 10 Downing Street where Lady Thatcher, then still in her pomp,
immediately began laying down the law.
Suddenly Schluter roared, 'It's my turn', then reduced her to stunned
silence with a real telling-off.
'I must say I was proud of my prime minister,' Ellemann-Jensen says.

There may well be more sense than Singapore's industry minister is aware of
in his worry that his country is over-producing lawyers.
Its present stock, which works out at one lawyer for every 1,266 people, is
admittedly far short of the US's one for every 418. With 200 law students a
year entering its national university, however, Singapore's count is rising.
Minister Lee Hsien Loong hopes to absorb the mounting numbers by encouraging
them to work in business companies. But he should beware of the link between
lawyers and economic progress chanced upon by US industrialist Norman
Augustine.
He happened to notice that nations' rates of productivity increase reflected
the density of lawyers in their populations. The trouble was that the
correlation was negative - the greater their gain in productivity, the fewer
lawyers they had on hand.
The sole exception was the UK where, given its small legal profession, the
productivity-gain should have been four times greater. The explanation
probably lies in the UK's remarkable density of accountants. Taking all
sorts together, it is not far behind the US lawyer count, at one for every
423 men, women and children in the land.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Letter: Lending institutions and planners can stimulate
rented housing sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NORMAN W BOWIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, John Willman's article clearly indicates that the government wishes to
revive the private rented sector.
Ministers need to understand that for too many decades the supply side has
been tightly controlled by all governments through the planning system and
the demand side subsidised by the tax reliefs given to owner/occupiers by
way of mortgage interest and freedom from capital gains tax. Houses are a
commodity and a fair balance between supply/demand, which existed in Britain
in the 1930s and now in many European countries, has to be restored.
The best answer is to release more land for housing in areas where people
wish to live rather than where government thinks they should. If this is too
politically sensitive, then do not give more subsidies, as suggested, to
owners/developers but to tenants. Why not balance mortgage interest relief
with income tax relief for occupiers paying a rent of, say, up to Pounds
3,500 a year?

FT  10 SEP 92 / Letter: Lending institutions and planners can stimulate
rented housing sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr SIMON RANDALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, John Willman sets out all the main reasons why the private rented
sector needs to be revitalised ('A welcome mat for rental markets',
September 8). But while there have indeed been recent signs that the
government agrees there is a housing crisis in Britain because we have huge
owner-occupation and social housing sectors, with nothing in between, much
needs to be done.
Private renting has in the past been a significant source of low-cost
housing and, with the large amount of empty property in London and the
country as a whole, it needs to be encouraged. Not only do private landlords
need a level playing field in which to operate - which means an end to the
current tax discrimination and the introduction of worthwhile financial
incentives - but they also need to know that the political support is there.
In the past the lack of all-party political support has tended to discourage
potential new landlords from entering the market. Further efforts to
encourage them may well result in banks, building societies and other
institutions taking on the role of landlords.
Mention must be made of equity-sharing, which has largely been ignored by
the big lenders as a means of helping hard-pressed borrowers to stay in
their homes. The LBA has urged the government to encourage lenders to take
the option more seriously. Meanwhile, perhaps lenders will consider leasing
repossessed homes to local authorities and housing associations so that they
can be put to a useful purpose. Simon Randall,

FT  10 SEP 92 / Letter: Insured have no say on medical costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr M LAWRENCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In looking into the question of private medical fees ('MMC to examine
medical fees', September 9), the Monopolies and Mergers Commission should
not ignore the practices of the insurers themselves, which contribute to
poor control over costs.
For example: it is common practice, 'in the interests of efficiency', for
hospitals to bill the insurance company direct. The patient, the consumer
who pays in the end with his premiums, is not invited to approve invoices
and query charges for treatments, drugs, dressings, etc, which he may not
have received. He is regarded as too ignorant to be of help.
It is also now becoming too common for patients to refer themselves to
consultants, without prior involvement of their general practitioner, and
for the same consultants' signatures to be accepted by the insurers for
claim purposes.
Meanwhile we, the insured, are prevented from voting with our feet and
transferring custom to another insurer. If we do, we will find that medical
conditions arising during the previous policy will be excepted, and we are
thus forced to stay with our present insurer. This is nothing less than a
restrictive practice.
Only if consumers and their GPs can become more involved will there be
day-to-day pressures to bring inefficiencies, abuses and costs under
control.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Letter: Commission's 'worrying step' on oligopolies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROMANO SUBIOTTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Ms Rachel Brandenburger's article ('EC merger regime defies
expectations of critics', September 3) states that Nestle's bid for Perrier
is likely to be remembered as the recognition that the European Merger
Control Regulation applies to oligopolistic (or collective) dominance as
well as to single firm dominance.
This is not so clear to me. I do not contest the possible need for the
Commission to have the power to control the creation or alteration in the
structure of certain oligopolistic markets. Rather, I question whether the
Commission's mere wishes should be permitted to expand, without further ado,
the powers which the member states have given it to review concentrations
with a Community dimension. After all, the regulation enables the Commission
to prohibit only the creation or strengthening of a dominant position which
could significantly impede effective competition in the Community.
The use of the term 'dominant position' is not a coincidence. The European
Court of Justice has for many years defined it as a position of economic
strength enjoyed by one undertaking which enables it to hinder the
maintenance of effective competition on the relevant market by allowing it
to behave to an appreciable extent independently of its competitors and
customers and ultimately of consumers.
The Court held in 1979 that a dominant position must be distinguished from
parallel courses of conduct which are peculiar to oligopolies in that in an
oligopoly the courses of conduct interact, while in the case of an
undertaking occupying a dominant position the conduct of the undertaking
which derives profits from that position is to a great extent determined
unilaterally.
The limits of the Commission's powers under the regulation therefore seemed
clear. It has now decided to go beyond. No one seems to be questioning this.
Yet this would appear to be a worrying step in the building of a Europe
based on the respect for the rule of law.

   From Mr D S RIDOUT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I refer to the article 'Warburg ends trade in stocks of 362 companies'
(September 5). I am sure that the irony of Lord Parkinson not being able to
obtain shares in the company he has recently become a director of, namely
Usborne, will not be lost on many of your readers.
It was, after all, Lord Parkinson, in those days known as Cecil Parkinson,
who was responsible for the legislation relating to 'Big Bang'. In some
respects it would, therefore, seem entirely appropriate that he should be
one of the people suffering from the shambles which has resulted from that
legislation.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Economic Viewpoint: Case for Danish No and French Yes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If I could vote in every European referendum on the Maastricht treaty, I
would have voted No in Denmark but would vote Yes in France.
This is because the Danish vote was a useful shot across the bows. A French
No vote would, however, mean something very different. It would put in
jeopardy the real achievements of the European exchange rate mechanism in
bringing down inflation and reducing currency fluctuations in western
Europe, without necessarily bringing any offsetting gains in growth.
The hard ERM, in which parities are very rarely changed, can be justified on
its own terms. Unfortunately the effect of the treaty and the negotiations
leading up to it was that too many people have come to see it mainly as part
of the drive to European monetary union (Emu) and to the political structure
which Emu would supposedly need.
Psychological links are, however, not everything. The position of
Scandinavian countries that have been informally shadowing the ERM is quite
different from that of full members which have unlimited short-term credits
if their currencies are against the bottom.
The gamble that Bengt Dennis, governor of Sweden's central bank, has taken
in raising overnight interest rates to 75 per cent might yet come off if it
convinces the markets of Sweden's seriousness in maintaining the exchange
rate as an anti-inflationary anchor. What can be lost has been shown in
Finland, which was all set for a wage pact with a zero overall pay increase
 -now shelved.
The wider importance of Scandinavia for the rest of the world is not the
exchange rate tensions themselves, but what it reveals of the underlying
weaknesses of banks, which may have to be tackled in their own right.
Meanwhile the financial talking classes are dangerously underrating the
determination and ability of central banks and governments to maintain ERM
core existing parities. Whatever happens to the Italian lira, these core
parities include the sterling/D-Mark as well as the franc/D-Mark rate.
The main result of a French No vote would be to increase the chances of an
increase in interest rates outside Germany. This is the opposite of what is
required, but would still be better than jumping from the ERM ship into the
cold water of sinking rates and competitive devaluation.
The impact of the French referendum on the treaty, although in the direction
I have suggested, might be smaller than supposed. 'Decisive' events often
are. The foreign exchange markets have already gone through a phase in which
the balance of probabilities has appeared to be No. On the other hand, a Yes
vote would not resolve the conflict between those who wish to stay in the
ERM and the black-red coalition of flag-waving Conservatives and
inflationists of all hues who assert against all past evidence that the
British government could do better in splendid isolation.
The full significance of the British Treasury's Pounds 7.3bn syndicated
borrowing has still not been fully appreciated. Of course, it is no more a
triumph than the many rescue packages for sterling in the mid-1970s. But
like those packages it can buy time.
It puts, however, British leaders squarely in the firing-line. For if
sterling were to be devalued, the sum would have to be repaid at a loss, as
occurred when sterling was devalued under the Wilson government in 1967.
The swap arrangement differs from that of the 1970s in important ways. The
UK government is committed to drawing the D-Marks in the course of the
present financial year. This means that even if sterling were to recover,
the funds would still have to be drawn; and their conversion into sterling
would tend to push the pound up within the grid.
Commentators have also misinterpreted sterling's position near the bottom of
the grid. So long as the central parity can be maintained, speculators
against sterling now face a one-way risk. For the pound can only move
upwards, in which case they would lose money. The whole point of negotiating
a wide grid for sterling (as previously for the lira and the peseta) was to
give this additional weapon to the Bank of England. Indeed my main query was
why the Bank had not allowed sterling to fall to the bottom much earlier.
Moreover, the new swap line is only one part of the reserves available to
defend the parity. The published reserves themselves amount to Pounds
23.7bn. In addition, the central banks of the stronger currencies have an
obligation to provide unlimited assistance for up to three months to
currencies against the lower limit of the grid
There is also quite an unnecessary mystery about the position of Helmut
Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president. As far as he can see, Germany does
not need an interest rate rise and he has tried to help his EC colleagues in
sticking his neck out in saying so. It would be astonishing if he went
beyond a slight hardening of what he has already said in Germany.
There is another point about which it is best to be frank. Prof Schlesinger
happens, as an economist, to believe in floating exchange rates, as is his
privilege. As a constitutionalist, he knows that the choice of exchange rate
regime is one for the German government; otherwise the ERM would never have
come into existence. As an economist, he has no objection to other countries
linking their rates to the D-Mark, so long as the adaptations are made by
these countries and he is not expected to inflate the German money supply to
accommodate them.
There is a good technical argument that because of the sharply inverted
yield curve and the temptation for holders of short-term deposits to move
from dollars to D-Marks, that the German monetary indicator, M3, is giving
misleading signals. The case was made by Prof Ronald McKinnon in the
Financial Times on Sept 7. I doubt, however, if the Bundesbank will stick to
M3 for scholastic reasons, once it decides that recession is a greater
threat than inflation.
This brings me back to the question behind the UK overseas borrowing: 'Buy
time for what?' Immediately, for the French referendum campaign. Looking
further ahead, for German interest rates to subside and for the dollar to
reach the bottom of its trajectory.
But most important of all, it is to buy time for the entrenchment of the
lower UK inflation rate so precariously achieved. As Andrew Burrell points
out in the August London Business School Economic Outlook, recession has
brought inflation down to a lower level than that of a decade ago; 'but the
effect will only be confirmed if the present realism is continued into the
cyclical upswing'.
It is precisely to guard against the temptation to relax overall financial
policy when the going gets rough and before the goal has been secured that
the ERM is valuable. The real argument against British membership is that
against stable prices itself and I welcome the fact that this has now come
into the open.
Anyone who believes after the experiences of the past decades that giving up
on inflation control will promote growth has, like the Bourbons, forgotten
nothing and learned nothing. Of course, I have also been thinking about how
to counter any threat of worldwide or UK deflation. But crying 'wolf' before
it has happened, or likely to, is not a good counsel.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Closed skies over Europe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HEALTH of the world airline industry has been a commercially delicate
issue for years. It is now becoming very delicate politically as well. Last
week's 'open skies' agreement between the US and the Netherlands, whereby US
and Dutch airlines have unrestricted access to each other's airports, might
seem an outbreak of common sense in a notoriously over-regulated industry.
Viewed in a wider context, it is a step backwards.
The history of air transport is bedevilled by ingrained notions of national
interest. In reality, security of the skies and national flagship carriers
are no longer live issues. But the vestiges remain. The typical national
airline is state-owned and subsidised accordingly. The slots which give
access to national airports are carved up on a nakedly anti-competitive
basis.
Meanwhile, the world airline industry is in financial crisis, partly as a
result of deregulation. The solution lies in rationalisation and merger.
Ultimately, the newly merged global carriers would benefit greatly from
being true multinationals, sourcing their staff, aircraft and services
freely from around the world. The counterpart is that they should operate in
free global markets in respect of their customers.
It is in this context that the EC is trying to assemble a common external
policy on aviation by the end of this year, in time for the introduction of
the single market. Member states accept the general principle, if only to
strengthen their hand against corresponding blocs which are emerging
elsewhere in the world, partly in response to the perceived threat of a
Fortress Europe.
But member states remain prey to atavistic twinges of self-interest. Germany
and France are at loggerheads with the US over the claimed dumping of extra
capacity by bankrupt US carriers operating under Chapter 11. The Netherlands
has seen the opportunity of establishing itself as Europe's airport at the
expense of its neighbours. Meanwhile, since any bilateral deals have to be
struck before the arrival of a common EC policy, the US is luring individual
states with the bait of access to its market while the opportunity lasts.
It would be naive to deny that the EC's main motive in seeking a common
policy is protecting its own interests. But if freedom of the skies is ever
to be achieved on a global basis, the fewer parties negotiating it the
better. And while the EC is deeply protective towards such industries as
motors or electronics, there is little evidence that it feels quite the same
way about airlines. Ultimately, the world industry needs to be put on an
economically sensible basis. A common EC policy is a step towards that.
But it is not a panacea. The continued use of subsidies to support
state-owned European carriers is a legitimate grievance to non-EC
competitors. The Europeans point in reply to the institution of Chapter 11,
which allows US airlines to continue operating after they have gone bust.
But while Chapter 11 may aggravate the industry's problems at the point of
transition, it is a temporary expedient. If a US airline is truly not
viable, it will go under eventually. Lufthansa and Air France will keep
going for as long as their governments care to support them. In such a
context, the US can scarcely be blamed for fishing in troubled waters. But
until true liberalisation is achieved, a lot of people are going to go on
losing a lot of money, Americans included.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Captain leads from below deck: Germany's ruling coalition is
beset by political indecision and economic malaise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is hard these days to find anyone in Bonn, or in the rest of Germany for
that matter, with a good word to say about Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
The Unification Chancellor, barely three weeks away from celebrating his
10th anniversary in office, not to mention 19 years as leader of his
Christian Democratic Union (CDU), seems to be under attack as never before -
from inside the ranks of his own party, and from outside.
He is accused of indecision and lack of leadership. Normally supportive
conservative newspapers such as the Frankfurter Allgemeine (FAZ) and Bonn's
General-Anzeiger talk of alarm and confusion in government ranks.
There are rumours on all sides of a Grand Coalition - an alliance of the CDU
on the right and the Social Democrats (SPD) on the left - to preside over
the painful process of uniting Germany. It is a coalition that Mr Kohl has
stated flatly he will never lead.
Bild Zeitung, the country's one genuinely popular and influential newspaper,
with a circulation of more than 4m, is convinced there is a conspiracy
afoot. It accuses none other than Mr Wolfgang Schauble, the chancellor's
right-hand man and the CDU leader in parliament, of seeking to overthrow his
mentor.
True or not, the reports and rumours are indications of a malaise in the
ranks of the German ruling coalition, and in Mr Kohl's own CDU, of troubles
that the summer holiday has clearly failed to dispel, but rather caused to
flourish.
Is it the beginning of the end for the chancellor, or merely a large hiccup
in the uneasy life of a German coalition government facing an unprecedented
array of political, economic and external problems?
On Sunday night, the chancellor hosted an emergency meeting of coalition
leaders to resolve their differences. It focused on a very public
disagreement over how to finance the growing costs of subsidising the east
German economy.
Mr Schauble and a large part of the parliamentary CDU, especially from the
east, wanted a compulsory bond or levy to finance future unity costs, to be
paid by high-income earners. Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister and leader
of the Christian Social Union, wanted no more than a voluntary German bond,
tax-free, but low interest-bearing. Mr Otto Lambsdorff and the Free
Democrats appeared to want nothing at all but stricter savings measures, and
allowing market forces to take their course.
They failed to agree on any new initiative at all, and slunk away into the
night after midnight through a side-door in the chancellor's office  - well
away from the waiting eyes and ears of the press.
On Monday, Mr Kohl produced an idea of his own or, at least, a revived idea
from somebody else - to summon a round table of employers, trade unions,
local government, his own coalition and the opposition. They should sit down
and hammer out a consensus on financing unification, he declared - a
solidarity pact in which everyone would agree to make sacrifices.
The idea was first proposed almost a year ago by Germany's five leading
economic institutes, and rejected primarily by Chancellor Kohl, although the
trade unions themselves were also unwilling to bind themselves into a
wage-restraining pact. The chancellor's advisers argue that now everyone is
aware of the need to make sacrifices, and particularly to restrain wage
rises in the east. The most recent figures put eastern productivity at the
end of last year at 32 per cent of the western level, while wages stood at
52.7 per cent.
At least Mr Kohl's invitation was enough to buy time, to face down the
dissenters in his party ranks, and gather his strength. All his fair-weather
friends, including a chastened Mr Schauble, pledged continuing support. It
was clear there was no alternative in sight.
Yesterday the chancellor was back at the rostrum in the Bundestag, his same
old belligerent, truculent self. Mr Kohl mocked his detractors, saying he
had been promised an anniversary present of a collage of newspaper headlines
predicting his imminent demise over the past decade. He planned to hang it
on his office wall.
He warned his own dissidents to stay in line, and failed yet again to give
any clear signal of leadership or direction. It was a classic, unhelpful,
even deliberately confusing, performance from one of German politics' great
survivors.
Mr Kohl's message seemed to be: 'Steady as she goes', even if others regard
the direction as decidedly unsteady. Mr Bjorn Engholm, an increasingly
self-confident leader of the SPD, accused him of deserting the bridge on a
rudderless ship of state in a gathering gale.
The question is whether Mr Kohl's imperturbable insistence on leading from
below decks is going to be enough to cope with the complex of reefs and
shallows now surrounding the German vessel. The immediate problems are
fourfold. The greatest is the cost of rebuilding the east German economy,
and of cushioning the bitter blow of unemployment for a very large
proportion of its inhabitants.
The second is the challenge of reviving the west German economy, now
teetering on the edge of a recession, without any prospect of a recovery in
exports to pull it back.
At the same time, the instability of eastern Europe and the former Soviet
Union is compounding the problems, both economic and political. Almost all
traditional exports from eastern Germany to its eastern neighbours have
dried up, removing the one small hope from eastern industry. Orders from
abroad in the east were down 28 per cent in May and June combined.
That instability is also the prime cause of an upsurge in immigrants
claiming political asylum. The total is likely to exceed 400,000 this year,
compared with 256,000 last year. They are the excuse for the current rash of
racist attacks by young skinheads on foreigners.
Finally, the traditional sheet-anchor of German external policy, commitment
to integration of the European Community, is being called into question -
not in Bonn, but in the country at large. The Danish vote against the
Maastricht treaty unleashed a welter of pent-up concerns, above all at the
prospective loss of the D-Mark in a single European currency. Chancellor
Kohl can no longer reliably fall back on the European theme as the one great
national unifier.
It is the sudden awareness of the daunting costs of unification that has
brought the crisis in the coalition to a head. A rebellion by the eastern
MPs in the CDU - aware both of a disastrous loss in their political support
at home and the catastrophic financial position of their own state and local
governments - demanded a big new injection of cash from Bonn: an extra
DM30bn (Pounds 10.7bn), on top of the DM92bn promised in next year's budget.
The CDU won the last election thanks to its support in the east, itself a
vote for Mr Kohl's promise of relatively painless unification. In the latest
opinion poll published by the FAZ yesterday, CDU support in the former GDR
is down to 22.5 per cent, against an election-night total of 41.8 per cent.
Mr Schauble, for reasons still unclear, was persuaded to back the
dissidents, and proposed the blunt instrument of a 'compulsory bond' to be
foisted on the better-paid. He has acute political instincts, and he knows
that the popularity of the coalition is at a low point across the country.
(The CDU is now trailing the SPD in the west as well, by 34.8 to 37.3 per
cent.) If he has been manoeuvring towards a Grand Coalition (he denies it)
then one incentive would be to share the pain of a very difficult period
ahead.
The need to find further funds for the east has also been driven by the
belated admission in government ranks of the size of the black hole in
public spending which looms around 1995. That is the year in which the
exchequer must take responsibility for the German unity fund, the Treuhand
privatisation fund and former East German government debts. Between the
three, that means an estimated extra DM440bn to be added to the debt of the
federal and state governments.
Overall, public sector debt is expected almost to have doubled between 1990
and 1996 from DM1,225bn to DM2,386bn, according to Deutsche Bank
calculations. The economy is in danger of getting locked into a cycle of
slow growth and high interest rates, dragged down by the burden of borrowing
for the east.
The economic collapse of eastern Germany and the bleak job prospects for its
school-leavers have caused profound alienation among young people - and they
are the very ones now attacking asylum-seekers' hostels.
Chancellor Kohl stands accused of having failed to react swiftly or firmly
enough to the rash of violence against foreigners. His emphasis throughout
has been on providing a reason for the attacks, rather than in condemning
any violence.
Until now, the government has refused to see asylum-seeking as part of a
basic immigration problem, insisting that Germany is 'not an immigration
country', although it has traditionally used large numbers of migrant
workers from Turkey and the former Yugoslavia. It is a matter of
distinguishing genuine asylum-seekers (estimated at no more than 3 or 4 per
cent of the total) from job-seekers who must be deported, the government
says.
The failure to deal with the issue has failed to discourage the racist
violence, and a steady rise in support for the extreme right-wing parties,
such as the Republicans. In the latest poll they have 8.0 per cent support
in the west, and 4.4 per cent in the east.
After a gloomy assessment of the problems on all fronts, Mr Kohl yesterday
fell back on Europe and the need for a whole-hearted commitment to political
as well as economic union in the EC as his rallying cry for unity. Yet even
that has a hollow echo. Germans are very much aware that the other EC member
states are no longer so enthusiastic about European union. If France votes
in a half-hearted way for Maastricht, even if it does not vote No, it would
encourage the doubters in Germany.
Mr Kohl is not going to call a referendum. It would have no constitutional
basis, and anyway he knows the decision would probably come down to the
D-Mark. The answer would be No. So he will rely on the Bundestag to swallow
its reservations, and ratify the treaty by the end of the year. It will
hardly be an enthusiastic endorsement.
The same could be said for the coalition's support of the chancellor: hardly
an enthusiastic endorsement. But for the time being, a captain who lingers
below the decks and hopes for a fairer wind seems better than no captain at
all.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Country life
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THAT YESTERDAY'S report on the problems of country life in the UK was
produced by the Duke of Westminster will strike some as an irony. Landowners
like the duke are among the wealthiest individuals in British society - and
far from the image of rural despair and deprivation which the report
highlights.
However, if the duke's report were to spark off a debate about how best to
conserve and develop Britain's countryside, it would have performed a
valuable service. The rural economy is coming under great strain, not least
as a result of changes in the EC's Common Agricultural Policy, which may
take 1.5m acres of farmland out of production. Tourism and leisure
activities could replace much of this activity, but at the cost of changes
which many will judge undesirable.
This decline occurs at a time when better private transport has made most
English countryside an economic and social extension of the town. Villages
within easy travelling distance of large cities become dormitory suburbs for
commuters or weekend retreats for town-dwellers. Shops and banks are no
longer viable and jobs are scarce. New arrivals are often more anxious to
preserve the countryside as they find it than to see the sort of dynamic
economic development which in previous centuries shaped today's rural
landscape.
Rejuvenating the rural economy means bringing new businesses to the
countryside, in the same way as urban policy seeks to encourage private
investors to look anew at the inner cities. The duke is right to suggest a
review of planning controls, since these often unreasonably impede the
development of rural industry and commerce.
The report also reminds us that there is real poverty behind the Laura
Ashley images of village life. A quarter of rural households are below the
poverty line. Many are trapped in villages by the lack of public transport:
one rural household in five has no car. Young people who want to work in the
country find few employment opportunities; housing is also difficult, with
wealthier buyers from the city outbidding locals.
The duke is, however, weaker when it comes to solutions, especially his
desire for the government to provide extra funds for the countryside. The
case for increasing the amount of land under forestry can be made, less so
that for tax incentives. Arguments for subsidising forestry are not as good
as those for subsidising coal mining.
Nor are greater subsidies for rural public transport more defensible: many
people living on urban housing estates suffer at least as much from poor bus
and train services. And while small rural schools might be supported in an
ideal world, keeping them open with unviable rolls absorbs educational
resources which could be better used elsewhere.
The report commends the subsidies which the government demands of the
utilities for their rural customers, who pay the same charges irrespective
of any greater costs. This, however, is hardly a model to be recommended.
Rural poverty and unacceptably poor basic services are best dealt with by
clearly targetted benefits or subsidies.

BRIGHT AIR, BRILLIANT FIRE: On the Matter of the Mind By Professor Gerald
Edelman Allen Lane, Pounds 20, 280 pages
Putting the mind back into nature' is the slogan of Professor Gerald
Edelman's crusade. One of the world's leading brain scientists, and winner
of a Nobel prize in 1972 for his work in immunology, he has turned to the
philosophy of science to address what he calls a 'series of crises' in the
science of the brain and nervous system.
The problem he sets himself is to explain, in biological terms, how people
came to have minds. By 'minds' he means not brains, but self-consciousness -
awareness of ourselves. It is a question that has occupied philosophers for
centuries. He makes grand claims: 'We are at the beginning of the
neuroscientific revolution. At its end, we shall know how the mind works,
what governs our nature, and how we know the world.'
He argues convincingly against recent theories that the brain is built like
a computer. Neuroscientists who use the model of a circuitboard to explain
the activity of 'the most complicated object in the universe' will find
accurate predictions of its behaviour elusive, he says.
Far from being 'hard-wired' like a computer, the connections between the
10bn neurons in the cortex of the brain are constantly changing. New paths
are forged and strengthened by experience and patterns of behaviour. Edelman
describes this adaptation of the maps inside the human brain as 'neural
Darwinism'.
Edelman has the gift of explaining difficult scientific concepts clearly and
quickly. A well known advocate of popularising science, he begins his public
lectures by reciting Keats and Emily Dickinson, and scatters his text with
pictures of startled frogs and mutant flies, quotes from Woody Allen and
anecdotes from Manhattan life.
But his book fails to make the bridge between biology and soul in the way he
intends. And while his populist style is entertaining, it depends on
metaphors which promise much but are eventually insubstantial or inexact
when he departs from neuroscience and comes to the crux of his argument.
For a start, as one of his rivals has commented, the parallel he draws with
Darwinian evolution is unconvincing. Darwin argued that species evolved by
mutation and the survivors were 'selected' by fierce competition. Neural
structures, however, do not reproduce or compete in the same way as animals.
To say that they do is almost to start to ascribe consciousness to their
parts.
Similarly, an early chapter on the spectacular successes of genetics in
'reading' the characteristics of an organism from a strand of DNA is not
woven into his case that it may eventually be possible to 'read' thought and
morality from the structures of the brain.
The awkward metaphors multiply as the book moves from science to philosophy.
Edelman briefly quotes and then dismisses many philosophers who have
grappled with the problem of the nature of consciousness and the self,
notably Descartes and Kant. Past writers could not have known what we now
know about the structure of the brain, he says, with the patronising air of
the chief detective summing up at the end of the thriller.
But he discusses few of the philosophers who would have dismissed his quest.
Notably, he gives little space to Wittgenstein and his followers, who would
have argued that Edelman's speculation about whether a lobster has
self-consciousness was meaningless. Some philosophers would argue that a
lobster shows none of the signs of what we mean by self-consciousness. Only
by distorting the way the term is normally used would one be led like
Edelman into examination of its nervous system to see whether it is
conscious.
Edelman's bending of ordinary language increases in later chapters. In one
definition he says: 'To clarify the issue, let us agree that . . . memory is
the ability to repeat a performance'. That is a peculiarly limited version
of what we normally mean by memory, but it allows Edelman to build a robot,
called Darwin III, which he argues shows 'memory'.
Edelman's theories will comfort those who feel that science leaves no place
for the soul, and that scientists cannot tell jokes and do not read Keats.
His ideas also deserve attention because of his conclusion that 'every
psychiatric illness has a biological cause'. He makes no secret of his dream
of finding the neural answer to many types of mental distress, and he and
his fellow-thinkers are likely to attract thousands of dollars of research
money in pursuit of that goal.
But, by the end, his book does science few favours. Darwin's original theory
of evolution may be a poor model for brain development, but it is a good one
for the growth of scientific knowledge, which emerges gradually as competing
hypotheses are tested and eliminated. Darwin's own theories have, more or
less, survived that demanding test in the past 130 years. So probably will
Edelman's contribution to immunology and to brain science. His excursions
into the philosophy of mind, however, show fewer of the characteristics of
fitness to survive.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Lloyd's choices
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A TOP job at Lloyd's of London, the insurance market that has been weighed
down by losses and scandals, is the very opposite of a bed of roses. Yet Mr
Peter Middleton, the banker and one-time diplomat whose appointment was
yesterday approved by the ruling council, has at least one consolation as he
sets about his new job. Things have been so bad that they could hardly get
much worse; and Lloyd's fortunes might just conceivably be on the turn.
The revolt of the Names, who provide capital to the market, appears to be
dying down. Indeed the risk may now be that the council's reformist
inclination may lose some of its impetus. Mr Middleton should pre-empt
criticism on this score by indicating his priorities. The report of the
Lloyd's Task Force, published in January, provides a convenient menu from
which to choose.
One of its central recommendations was to strengthen the capital base.
Lloyd's has been encouraged on that score by the prospect that fewer than
2,000 Names are expected to resign this year.
Yet this understates the damage, since many more would-be deserters are
locked into syndicates where accounting years remain open with unresolved
long-term liabilities. A vigorous attempt to close those years through some
form of reinsurance would be sensible. So, too, would renewed efforts to
settle outstanding litigation.
But the key to Lloyd's future, apart from conditions in the insurance market
generally, must lie to a large extent in eliminating the perception that the
balance of risk and reward at Lloyd's is unfavourable to outside Names.
Leaving aside the regulatory issues that are outside Mr Middleton's remit,
this points to the urgent implementation of the Task Force's recommendations
on cutting costs.
In 1988 and 1989, when Lloyd's losses were Pounds 511m and Pounds 2.06bn
respectively, syndicate expenses rose by 40 per cent or more. That looks
like the definition of a death wish.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Arts: Booker Prize shortlist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By J. D. F. JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE annual Booker ballyhoo got going again yesterday when the judges for
this year's Pounds 20,000 prize for British (and Commonwealth) fiction
announced the shortlist.
The Prize (courtesy of Booker plc, the food and agri-business group) is no
longer the richest literary award but it guarantees great prestige, and
sales, for the winner, and, say its admirers, helpfully brings The Novel to
public attention.
Its critics say that the autumn brouhaha distorts the annual fiction
industry and the intense media hype of the shortlisted authors does a
disservice to the hordes of other gifted but unlisted writers.
This year's shortlist contains no surprises. London's litterati have for
weeks been betting on Michael Ondaatje's The English Patient - those of them
who have seen a proof copy because it is not officially published until next
week. Last night the bookmakers William Hill made it the 5-2 favourite.
The shortlist is:
Serenity House by Christopher Hope (MacMillan Pounds 14.99). Black comedy by
a master South Africa-born specialist in the trade. Set in a Highgate
'eventide refuge' where euthanasia is an unspoken word and its senior
citizen, Max Montfalcon, turns out to be a geriatric Nazi scientist. The FT
review next Saturday will describe it as 'surreal farce .. scabrously
enjoyable ..'
The Butcher's Boy by Patrick McCabe (Picador Pounds 14.99). An Irish
murderer, a soft-in-the-head orphan jailed for life, recalls his life in
grisly detail. The FT reviewer said that 'the misery and deprivation of
working class life have never been so brutally evoked ..'
Black Dogs by Ian McEwan (Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 14.99). McEwan's fiction
is uniquely disturbing - some would say deliberately offensive. He is the
novelist of misanthropy. This is the tale of a failed marriage, episodically
told, and the black dogs of evil are both metaphorical and literal.
The English Patient by Michael Ondaatje (Bloomsbury Pounds 14.99). The Sri
Lankan poet and novelist Ondaatje, who lives in Canada, has followed 'in the
skin of a lion' with an extraordinary book about four characters in a Tuscan
villa in the closing months of the last war. The central metaphor is bombs -
disposal of, and then Hiroshima. The 'English patient' is a central mystery
around which the others' stories orbit: he fell out of the sky in flames;
who is he? The FT review on Saturday will hail it as a masterpiece.
Daughters of the House by Michele Roberts (Virago Pounds 14.99). The
surprise contender because it is not yet published. Roberts comes from an
Anglo-French Catholic background and this informs her new novel with a
strong rural-Normandy atmosphere. Two cousins, one pious, one worldly.
Shades of Saint Therese of Lisieux. Lots of action in the kitchen; something
is hidden in the cellar.
Sacred Hunger by Barry Unsworth (Hamish Hamilton Pounds 15.99). Unsworth's
massive novel about the 1750s slave trade came out early this year to
widespread critical praise. The shipboard detail - the horrors of the trade
 -are brilliantly done. The judges will have to rule on the characterisation
of the European protagonists who go off to found a Utopia in Florida.
The judges this year, who will include Independent journalist Mark Lawson
and John Coldstream, literary editor of The Daily Telegraph, will be chaired
by the biographer Victoria Glendinning.
The winner will be named at a Guildhall dinner on Tuesday October 13.
Last year the prize was won by Ben Okri, for his book The Famished Road.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Arts: Dedicated provider of a public service - Andrew Clark
talks to Hugues Gall, director of Geneva's opera house
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASK Hugues Gall, director of Geneva's Grand Theatre, why there are no star
singers in his opera programme, and the answer is unequivocal. 'We're
handling public money. We're providing a cultural service, so the aim is to
satisfy our public with a balanced policy, not to make big splashes.
'We're not interested in singers flying in for three or four performances,
for which we have to charge gala prices. We want consistency throughout the
run. We want a repertory balanced between the 17th century and the present,
and a policy which makes each season a link in the chain between past and
future. This is our mission culturelle.'
As Europe's opera managers prepare for the onslaught of a new season, many
wish they could follow Gall's approach. After 12 years in Geneva, Gall, 52,
commands international respect for the quality of his programme. His
cast-lists are full of young, talented singers, but he still attracts
top-rank artists for lower fees than they receive elsewhere. His
widely-spaced stagione programme means that each production is properly
rehearsed.
With no resident music director or ensemble, he has complete personal
control over choice of repertoire, cast and production team. He has a 98 per
cent attendance record, with more than 50 per cent of seats sold in
subscriptions before the season begins - reducing his dependence on safe
repertoire. The top seat price is less than Pounds 50.
Gall, a self-effacing Frenchman who served his apprenticeship under Rolf
Liebermann at the Paris Opera in the 1970s, is the first to admit that
Geneva conditions cannot and should not be reproduced elsewhere. He points
to the different artistic traditions and political circumstances of leading
companies.
His prescription for success is simple: 'First, you need complete political
support from the government which subsidises you. Then you need a strong
management team with a clear vision of how they want the institution to
develop.' With 75 per cent of his own budget coming from the Geneva
taxpayer, Gall is a firm believer in culture as a public service.
Like most of his continental colleagues, he was appalled by the erosion of
government support for the arts in Britain during the 1980s, and says the
international reputation of the Royal Opera has suffered as a result.
'British companies deserve less criticism for the struggles they have,
because their ratio between quality and public subsidy is better than in any
other country.
'What British companies have achieved with limited resources is incredible.
You can make up for money to some extent with imagination, talent and
management skills, but that limit has long been passed at Covent Garden.
National institutions should never be obliged to find so much private
money.'
Gall is no disinterested observer: an unashamed Anglophile, he was the only
foreigner invited to contribute to the Priestley report on Covent Garden,
commissioned by the Thatcher government in the early 1980s. Nor does he
reject sponsorship - 'as long as it is only icing on the cake. As soon as
you increase your dependence on private funding, by raising seat prices or
giving blocks of tickets to sponsors, you change your public. It becomes
less democratic and often less discerning.'
'We don't despise sponsors, but they're not a 'spontaneous' public - if it
was free, you wouldn't see 1 per cent of these people. That's what I mean by
mission culturelle: in Europe we've achieved a lot of things better than
other parts of the world, and that includes the way we pay for the arts. The
state provides not just for our physical health but our cultural
well-being.'
But in these recessionary times, can any opera company escape the financial
squeeze? Gall acknowledges that when governments cut spending, culture
budgets are often the first to suffer. The best defence for opera companies,
he says, is to show the breadth of their appeal - one reason why Geneva has
reluctantly embraced surtitles. 'If I was running a major festival like
Glyndebourne or Salzburg, I would stick to my convictions and resist
surtitles: people who can afford that sort of time and money should also
have time and money to do their homework. But I accept surtitles in my own
theatre because we want to make it easy for people to join the club, to open
our doors to a wider public.
'Two or three generations ago, people were born into the club, it was in the
family, you didn't need to tell the story of Manon because the opera public
learned it at home. Today, opera companies have to provide political
justification for the money they receive.'
As far as singers are concerned, Gall bemoans the fact that most national
operatic schools - France and Italy included - can no longer adequately cast
their native repertory with native talent. That is one reason why he admires
Britain. He speaks of British singers' professionalism and artistry, of
their ability to adapt to other traditions and styles; the list of British
singers regularly invited to Geneva is proof of his faith.
He welcomes the increased mobility of singers in the jet age, but has no
sympathy for the minority who abuse it. He has successfully sued artists who
broke their Geneva contracts to pick up better-paid work elsewhere. Not that
he begrudges the stars their astronomic fees. 'Gold is gold, and the
pleasure of hearing a unique voice like Pavarotti's can never be measured in
terms of money. Today's stars are no more nor less concerned about money
than Caruso, Melba or Tamagno were. Fortunately, such artists are not
crucial for an opera season. In Geneva, we hire singers not because they
sell well, but because we think they'll be good.
'When everything works - when sound, singing and staging are in harmony. . .
people forget how much they've paid for their ticket.'
Gustave Charpentier's Louise, conducted by Armin Jordan and staged by
Christian Aeby, opens the 1992-3 season in Geneva tomorrow. The production
runs till September 27

Two notable series return at 8.30. The familiar and often excellent current
affairs programme This Week begins its last series on ITV. After 36 years it
will disappear at the end of this run, victim of ITV's Thatcherisation.
Today's programme investigates the growth of vigilante groups up and down
the country.
Waiting For God (8.30 BBC1) is among the best contemporary comedy series.
Graham Crowden and Stephanie Cole star as a couple of shrewd, bolshie
inmates of an old people's home. This, with its very high standard of acting
and direction, is what we shall extol in 20 years time as one of the marvels
of the good old days.
C4's documentary series about Nomads (9.00) began exceedingly well last week
with an extraordinary blend of anthropology and soap opera in Mauritania.
Today's subject is the Mongols and particularly the Xilinhot Nadam where
10,000 gather to watch archery, horse racing and wrestling. ITV screens the
last in the politically oh-so-correct American legal soap opera LA Law
(9.00) and BBC2 shows the first of nine 60-minute documentaries about how
the recession is affecting people, Present Imperfect (9.30).

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HERE'S a twist: not another musical to lift the spirits during the
recession, but a well turned play about creating popular music which enables
the cast to enjoy a song and dance finale and the audience to leave the
theatre smiling.
June Moon was the only collaboration between Ring Lardner and George S
Kaufman and was a Broadway hit during the Great American Depression. It
surfaces brightly at Hampstead with hopes of a West End transfer and its
snappy dialogue, racy characters, and boy gets girl plot are all in its
favour.
Fred (charmingly played by Adam Godley) is an aspiring lyric writer from
Sennectady. On the Pullman to New York he meets Edna (Maria Gough) who is
his perfect match in naivety and ordinariness. With the lovelight in his
eyes, Fred suddenly realises that June rhymes with moon, and, can you
believe it, so does spoon. Edna helpfully adds macaroon. Fred is a Holy
Fool, totally in tune with popular taste, and 'June Moon' is an instant hit.
But Tin Pan Alley is a treacherous place and Fred's innocence is threatened
by Eileen (Susannah Fellows) who knows how to spend his advance. With the
help of the wise cracking Maxie (Frank Lazarus) who plays Cupid, the plot
twists to a happy ending.
What lifts June Moon above an enjoyable PG Wodehouse style yarn is the
setting. Tin Pan Alley in 1929 was a factory at full capacity, with song
writers in their cubicles churning out songs like 'Ain't Misbehavin',
'Singin' in the Rain' and thousands more that never made it.
Lardner and Kaufman lay bare the hard cheerless graft of it all, with Paul
(Neil McCaul) living off the glory of his one hit 'Paprika' and the aspiring
Benny (Clive Walton) playing his novelty number 'Hell Tokio' to the window
cleaner for want of an audience. Behind the optimistic numbers and the
sentimental numbers, the marriages of the writers crack up and the power of
the publisher corrupts.
Designer Michael Holt, helped by a revolve, makes the tiny Hampstead stage
seem quite spacious. Godley, all nervous body language and guilless charm,
is a good foil to the New York sophisticates, and Lazarus, the in-house
pianist, has all the best lines. 'The tune's easy to remember and if you
forget, it doesn't make any difference' is his laid back reaction to most
new songs.
Director Alan Strachan has effectively scaled down June Moon to a chamber
musical play. There seemed to be plenty of moist eyes to go with the lifted
spirits at the end, which should be a winning combination.

BOB ROBERTS Tim Robbins
LES AMANTS DU PONT NEUF Leos Carax
IMMACULATE CONCEPTION Jamil Dehlavi
HOUSESITTER Frank Oz
CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS: THE DISCOVERY John Glen
BOB ROBERTS, written and directed by its star Tim Robbins, is an awful
warning about American politics. 'Who needs a large-screen warning when the
small screen assaults us daily with the gladiatorial fatuities of Bush
versus Clinton?' I hear you ask.
Be comforted. Bob Roberts has nothing to do with the real world and much to
do with a film star turned film-maker who fancies himself as the Orson
Welles de nos jours. Physically, Robbins, last seen as the movie mogul hero
in The Player, has the young Welles's baby-fat features and loose,
commanding presence. Artistically, though, the resemblances are more
sketchy.
This tale begins Citizen Kane-style with a newsreel resume of our senatorial
contender hero's career to date - ex-rock singer, leader of the anti-drugs
crusade Broken Dove, 'crypto-fascist clown' according to some - but goes on
to trade the provocatively freewheeling for the progressively facile.
We know Bob Roberts is a Bad Thing, because the film keeps telling us.
Politically he is somewhere to the right of Michael Douglas's Gordon Gecko
in Wall Street. 'We're marching for self-interest. . .' sings Miss Broken
Dove at a rally for the Roberts faithful; and if that does not get us
hissing another early scene will. Our (anti-)hero is rudely put in his place
by a TV interviewer. 'I wouldn't vote for you if my life depended on it,'
she snaps just after they have been on air: 'she' being black and a woman,
which is two strikes for political correctness right there in reel one.
Soon Gore Vidal is wheeled on as Senator Brickley Paiste to drawl out
liberal barbs. And as a black reporter for 'Troubled Times' (equals Rolling
Stone), Giancarlo Esposito is given the film's gadfly franchise, whining and
stinging around Robbins/Roberts until he (Esposito) is arrested after a
rigged assassination scuffle.
But if the movie is an essay in lay-it-on liberalism, cloned from the likes
of The Candidate and Robert Altman's TV series Tanner 88, it is oddly
enjoyable. Brisk acting and bright editing help, but the real rescue act
comes from the background details and the cameo walk-throughs by the famous.
TV news shows are briskly satirised, with players like Susan Sarandon, Fred
Ward and James Spader putting the boot into folksy anchorpersons.
Gore Vidal purls epigrams through pursed cheeks, a patrician treat as the
opposition. And with dark glasses and barely a line of dialogue Alan Rickman
even suggests Mephistophelean evils in our hero's campaign adviser. Like
many shallow films, Bob Roberts is fun to splash around in as long as one
does not expect to be able to dive in from the high board.
                          *      *      *
Les Amants du Pont Neuf is a film about excess - both romantic and
cinematic. It is the tale of a homeless street performer (Denis Lavant) and
a young artist (Juliette Binoche) who has taken to the gutter after learning
that she is going blind. They meet sleeping rough on Paris's Pont Neuf and
are soon having a passionate affair that involves varying amounts of sex,
intoxication, tenderness and thievery.
Writer-director Leos Carax throws all caution to the wind in telling the
lovers' story, moving recklessly from one daring set-piece to another. He is
not afraid to have his couple water ski down the Seine as fireworks cascade
from above, or show the nearly sightless Binoche breaking into the Louvre to
run her fingers over a Rembrandt. Contrasted with these lyrical moments are
distinctly earthy scenes, such as documentary footage shot in a refuge for
the homeless or a midnight romp on a beach with an erect Lavant prancing
through the surf like a naughty Greek deity.
Despite Carax's flair and commitment, his film fails to grip the emotions
the way it does the eyes and ears. Binoche and Lavant are so relentless they
seem like automata whose directional switches are stuck on 'passion'. Carax
has said he wanted to show love in its 'raw' state, without the 'trappings'
of bedrooms or small talk or, alas, laughter. Unfortunately, he seems to
have succeeded.
Writer-director Jamil Dehlavi's Immaculate Conception is another film
dealing with the weightier aspects of love-making. James Wilby and Melissa
Leo play a young Western couple who, while working in Pakistan, visit a
fertility shrine run by eunuchs in an effort to have the child they have
always wanted. After being drugged and unofficially inseminated by the local
stud, Leo has her child, only to have her marriage fall apart when her
sceptical husband insults the eunuchs and then cheats on her. All the while,
the nation around them is in turmoil, with the Rushdie riots and the death
of President Zia adding a further sense of danger to their predicament.
The best thing about the film are the insights it provides into modern
Pakistani culture, but Dehlavi is unable to carry through his complex story,
complicating it with pointless subplots and relying too often on ham-fisted
melodrama.
Romance receives a far more antiseptic treatment in Housesitter, an amusing
and only occasionally vapid farce, starring Steve Martin as a lovelorn
architect who joins forces with good-hearted con woman Goldie Hawn to win
back the girl of his dreams. No points for guessing the outcome. Director
Frank Oz keeps things enjoyable by minimising Martin's mugging and letting
the resourceful Hawn do most of the work.
Which brings us to Christopher Columbus: The Discovery, a woefully inept
effort which is best left undiscovered. The makers must have intended the
film to be a good old swashbuckling epic, though the whole thing comes
across as an uninspired parody of the genre. It is hard to know what to
single out for criticism here, though Mario Puzo's cliche-ridden script
should be used as a 'how-not-to' manual for budding screenwriters. The
acting, which features such castaways as Tom Selleck as King Ferdinand and
Rachel Ward as Queen Isabella, is uniformly bad, with the exception of
Marlon Brando as Torquemada, who chooses not to act at all in his ten
minutes on screen, thereby inoculating himself against assessment.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Arts: Boris Godunov
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR an opera rich in panoply and set in a variety of imposing locations,
Boris Godunov is seen in concert form with surprising regularity.
Musorgsky's historical narrative must be thought sufficiently strong to
stand alone with minimal sets and costumes to provide further adornment.
Although Boris Godunov itself has visited the Proms before, the performance
of the opera on Tuesday marked the first appearance in any Promenade season
of Opera North. The company was bringing the production which has served it
well over the last three years. For the purposes of this outing it had two
specific advantages: this was the shorter 1869 version (easier on the feet
of those standing) and it was being sung in English.
The latter is a point of some importance. The details of Russian history,
often expounded in lengthy passages of narration, need to be grasped easily
by listeners new to the opera. A decent proportion of the sung words was
audible at this performance and the rest could be filled in by looking at
the complete text printed in the programme.
It also sounded as though the conductor, Paul Daniel, was striving to allow
his singers to be heard. He galvanised the English Northern Philharmonia
into more dynamic and accurate playing than it had managed for the company's
recent Tchaikovsky double-bill. The Chorus of Opera North made a strong
impact.
The cast was much the same as for the revival earlier this year. Matthew
Best was a dignified Pimen, wanting a degree of verbal bite. Ann Howard and
Brian Bannatyne-Scott did not overplay the humour of the scene between the
Hostess and Varlaam. Melanie Armitstead and Ann Taylor-Morley, as Xenia and
Feodor, were the two refreshing women's voices. Graeme Broadbent and Stephen
Gadd were notable among the basses.
Above all, however, dominated the Boris of John Tomlinson, a voice and a
personality several times larger than any other on stage. After a summer at
Bayreuth, he arrived with Wotan still in his soul and it was sometimes
difficult to reconcile his outgoing and physically active Boris Godunov with
that of tradition. Every word, though, so forcefully declaimed, must have
carried to the furthest reaches of the Albert Hall.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Technology: Life's little ups and downs - Escalators may
have a humdrum role but building the longest in western Europe has proved to
be no easy task
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER and BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The diary of Richard Burbage, manager of Harrods in 1898, recalls that
shoppers overcome by the experience of travelling on Britain's first
escalator were revived with brandy or sal volatile dispensed by an attendant
positioned at the top.
Burbage, according to the Shell Book of Firsts, had 'an unreasoning dislike
of lifts,' and persuaded the Knightsbridge store to instal the 40ft-long
Reno Inclined Elevator, patented by Jesse W. Reno of New York just six years
earlier.
Nearly a century later, would-be passengers on the longest escalators in
western Europe, at the new Angel station on the London Underground, might
feel they deserve similar resuscitation after the problems of the past
month.
Dogged by difficulties, the three 60m-long escalators are still not
functioning properly, delaying the opening of the long-awaited Pounds 70m
new station for Islington's commuters. But an end to their long wait is in
sight.
The delay has been irritating for passengers, who have been shuttled around
by bus while the new station stays closed, and embarrassing for both the
London Underground and Construction Industrielle de la Mediterrannee (better
known by its logo CNIM), the big Marseilles-based company which designed and
built the escalator.
But the saga has also been embarrassing for the escalator industry, which is
not used to having the reliability of its products questioned. Escalators,
after all, are relatively simple people movers which are built to last, and
normally do.
Some of the London Underground's escalators are now being replaced after as
much as 60 years of sterling service. 'These escalators are very heavy duty.
They take a hell of a beating,' says one producer.
Switched on in the morning, and off late at night - or occasionally left on
permanently - escalators simply keep on going, requiring routine maintenance
but rarely any fundamental rebuilding during their working lives.
The basic technology is tried and tested. The first step-type escalator with
a comb-plate landing device was introduced commercially in 1921 by Otis, the
US lift and escalator producer which is now part of United Technologies, and
the basic combination of an electric motor driving a chain held by two
sprockets has not changed since then.
There have, naturally, been developments in escalator safety circuits, such
as systems to stop the motor if a passenger's hand goes too far down the
handrail at either end, and in the use of materials. Again safety has been
the prime consideration, with wooden escalators now seen as a fire risk
following the King's Cross disaster in 1987.
There have been innovations such as energy-saving stop-start mechanisms  -
approach an apparently resting escalator on the Munich subway and it will
start rolling just before you step on it - and gimmicks such as helical
escalators, which are both technically daunting and commercially dependent
on booming markets for swanky offices and department stores.
In general, though, escalators, because of their humdrum, continuous task,
have missed out on the major developments in lift technology introduced by
the same big producers over the past 20 years - variable speed drives,
talking lifts, lifts with memories and remote monitoring techniques.
This is what makes the Angel saga so frustrating for commuters. Things
happen in lifts, because the relationship between the passenger and machine
is much more complex, but escalators are simply not expected to break down.
Angel Station first started having capacity problems in the mid-1980s, when
Islington became an increasingly popular place to live, and passenger volume
rose about six-fold when volumes elsewhere were shrinking.
At that time the station had no escalators, only three lifts, each with
capacity for about 30 people, and which were slow and unreliable. The
station serves 8m people a year (about 20,000 a day) so the lifts were
clearly inadequate.
Reconstruction of the station started in 1989, and preliminary work on
construction of the escalators started more than a year ago.
Everything went according to plan until the last few days before the
escalators were due to come into service, on Sunday August 9. Safety
regulations require a commissioning test, when the escalators must run for
24 hours continuously with no problems. This was carried out on Friday 7 and
Saturday 8 August, when the first problems emerged with the power supply.
The supply in the area was not sufficient to serve the whole station and the
escalators at the same time.
While adjustments were carried out, the opening was delayed until Wednesday
August 12. The station was then open for a day and a half, after which
further problems emerged with the control electronics, partly related to the
earlier power supply problems, causing the escalators to cut out when fully
loaded.
A faulty chain brake switch was erroneously signalling that the chain was
sagging as soon as passengers got on the escalator, thus bringing it to a
stop. The glitch was corrected, and a final extensive test carried out on
August 18, when some 400 LU employees travelled up and down the escalator to
ensure it was running smoothly.
This was crucial for safety reasons, as the sudden stopping of a fully-laden
escalator - about 180 steps with two people on each one - could be
potentially disastrous by causing a human avalanche. The escalator passed
that test, but in the process engineers discovered gaps between the steps
and the skirtings of as much as 9mm in total on both sides, large enough for
a child's finger to become caught, or for small objects to slip down into
the machinery. The opening was delayed once again.
London Underground and CNIM will not go into detail about the causes of the
problem, but industry observers suggest some possibilities. First, the
Underground traditionally specifies a fabricated step, which is welded
together from pieces of steel and then has an aluminium alloy tread bolted
on top. It says this lasts much longer than the one-piece die-cast step used
on other metro systems.
There is some debate about how much more durable the fabricated step is, but
at about 45kg it is three times heavier than a die-cast step and much harder
to manufacture to very tight tolerances because of the welding and
subsequent cooling which distort the steel.
Die-cast steps, in contrast, can be milled to very high levels of precision,
says one escalator producer. And LU requires the gap between the steps and
the skirting to be no more than 5mm in total over both sides - tougher than
the 7mm British Standard recommendation. With wear and tear, the gap will
widen, so the tighter specification gives LU some leeway.
The features of a fabricated step become particularly important on a long
escalator, which is like a bicycle chain on two sprockets. The weight of so
many fabricated steps may have contributed to the earlier power problems,
and the longer the chain, the more opportunity there is for lateral
movement. That could have increased the gaps between the treads and the
skirtings.
Historically, escalators have simply been 'side-guided' - the skirting keeps
the train in line on the track - but a number of guidance systems are now
used, such as a lipped edge to the track, or a ridge into which the chain
interlocks. CNIM says that the guidance system it is using at the Angel is
the same as it uses on all its escalators, long or short.
The French company has been given three weeks to sort out the gaps, and the
deadline elapses next Thursday. But yesterday London Underground said it was
hopeful of being able to run a further 24-hour test to ensure that the
problem has been resolved, and open the escalators to the public, before
then. The gap is now down to about 6mm, spread over both sides, and the
target is 4mm.
Islington's long-suffering commuters will then have their new station, but
that might not be the end of the affair. LU will reportedly claim hundreds
of thousands of pounds compensation from CNIM, but says officially that
seeking compensation will depend on the final length of the delay. Its
managers, meanwhile, might be forgiven for resorting to the Burbage remedy
for escalator angst.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Technology: Designers check out the chip library - A quick
way to produce 'mixed signals'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the electronics industry, last year's product is already a dinosaur. The
market lifetime of many types of electronic products is shrinking rapidly,
forcing manufacturers to accelerate design and development cycles.
One bottleneck has been the development of custom semiconductor chips;
devices that are designed to meet the specifications for a particular
product.
In the digital world of computers, several short-cut 'semi-custom'
approaches to chip design are well established. But bridging the digital and
'real world' of analogue signals is more difficult. Demand for such 'mixed
signal' chips is rising with the use of increasingly sophisticated
electronics in, for example, cars, household appliances and industrial
control applications.
The automatic breaking systems found on some cars and the control devices
used in washing machines require both digital and analogue circuits. Home
automation, lighting control and any type of motor control also span the
digital to analogue divide.
Producing such combinations of digital, analogue, power and memory circuits
on a single chip, to provide lower cost, smaller and more reliable devices,
is one of the most challenging tasks facing the semiconductor industry.
Doing so fast enough to keep pace with accelerating product life cycles is
even more demanding.
Taking a new approach to the problem, Texas Instruments, the leading US chip
maker, has devised a new design method it calls Prism based upon 'reusable
engineering'.
In concept, Prism methodology can be likened to a library that has
integrated circuit elements on its shelves instead of books. When a customer
outlines a need for a new semiconductor, the TI design team does not have to
create it from scratch.
Instead, the engineers can go to the 'library', find predefined modules and
re-use them to meet the customers' needs.
The techniques make it easier to customise semiconductors, meaning designers
can add unique capabilities to their products more quickly than their
competitors, providing a critical time-to-market advantage. The chip design
time can be cut from a year to as little as three months, and full
production can be achieved in just six months, TI claims.
Prism also permits a new level of integration - combining multiple
semiconductors with different functions on a single chip - thus decreasing
the component count in new electronic systems by as much as 50 per cent.
'Prism methodology addresses a number of our customers' most important
concerns,' said Tom Engibous, senior vice-president of TI's semiconductor
group.
'It shortens time-to-market, reduces development cost, lowers component
count and makes it easier to design the end products. Current customers in
automotive electronics have been pleased with the results enabled by Prism
methodology, and we are expanding its use into other areas.'
Another important element of the Prism approach is that it permits reuse of
test programs and qualification data, meaning new test procedures do not
have to be redefined for each product. This represents a significant step
forward in reducing the time required to get a new chip to market.
The Prism concept also extends to the manufacturing process, which is
segmented into modules so that only the steps that are needed to produce a
specific chip are used.
An important advance achieved by TI has been to squeeze power transistors,
used in high-voltage applications, into the same miniature geometries that
are standard for digital circuitry.
For the end user, faster development of more highly-integrated chips
promises lower prices and more features. In the automotive market, for
example, automatic breaking, cruise control and other features found mostly
on top-of-the-line expensive cars can be expected on lower cost models.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Saatchi steps into a
brave new world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The acronyms are becoming ever-more labyrinthine. Yesterday the Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi group announced that two of its agencies - the north American
Campbell-Mithun-Esty (CME) and the London-based KHBB - are linking up from
October 1 to create an international agency network, to be known as
CME-KHBB.
The group already has two international networks: Saatchi &amp; Saatchi
Advertising Worldwide (SSAW) and Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide (BSB).
Each competes against the other as well as against non-Saatchi group
agencies, and each has outposts round the globe offering the whole range of
advertising services.
In contrast, the new network will offer a distinctly different service,
eschewing domestic advertising and clients and pitching solely for
multinational business.
According to Stuart Bull, who will head up CME-KHBB, the new network's
multinational-only approach is driven by the accelerating cultural
convergence between countries and regions. This convergence has been speeded
by increased travel, improving communications technology, global fashion
trends, and - in the EC - by legislation.
As a result, a more homogeneous world is presented to producers of consumer
goods. Multinational corporations are therefore seeking to market themselves
regionally and globally, with a single, consistent cross-border advertising
message.
Bull argues that advertising agencies will, in future, need to be
'transnational', serving transnational clients; alternatively, they will
need to remain much smaller, operating on a domestic plane, with
domestic-sized revenues to match.
He supports his thesis by research from the Saatchi group, which purports to
show a significant mismatch between what advertisers want and what they get
from a multinational agency. Saatchi asked 1,000 large companies in the
Asia-Pacific rim, the US and Europe how they viewed their global advertising
campaigns.
The survey found that 75 per cent looked for strategic consistency - the
same message aimed at the same type of audiences - in their campaigns, but
just 18 per cent felt they achieved that goal.
The Saatchi group is prepared to invest up to Pounds 20m in the new network
over 10 years, funding generated from the network's own cash-flow. But
unlike the acquisition-driven (and debt-laden) growth of the group in the
1970s and 1980s, it is intended that the CME-KHBB network grows organically.
Organised on a 'hub and spoke' system, the first hubs to open are in London,
Paris, Toronto and five US cities. In theory, the hubs will operate as
full-service agencies, being the command centre for strategic campaigns.
The spokes (five in Europe, 22 in north America and one in Hong Kong) will
provide input to the planning decisions at the hubs, but exist primarily as
low-cost outposts, tailoring the strategic marketing decisions to local
demands and dealing with more diffuse areas of marketing such as promotions,
display, customer care and direct mail.
The financial spine of the new network is also a new departure. One of
advertising's sacred cows - widely under attack today - is the 15 per cent
commission fee paid by advertisers to their agencies. CME-KHBB's clients
will pay by negotiated fee, with incentives and bonuses for achievement of
pre-agreed targets.
Another taboo is salaries, which represent 50-60 per cent of Saatchi group
costs; CME-KHBB promises to cut that to 40-45 per cent. And while most large
agencies are currently struggling to achieve margins of 7 per cent, CME-KHBB
hopes to hit the road with margins of 10 per cent, aiming for a group target
of 12 per cent margins by 1994, set by Charles Scott, Saatchi group chief
operating officer.
Peter Mead, chairman of a rival agency, Abbot Mead Vickers, believes that
CME-KHBB should have a good future: 'They were very good agencies in
themselves and it makes a lot of sense, as good agencies draw strength from
being associated with each other.'
Will the new network set the champagne popping? Its underlying 'logic' is in
tune with these cautious times. On the other hand, the Saatchi empire
wholeheartedly backed the 'logic' of the ferocious acquisition-bent 1980s -
and came a cropper.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Banking on nice
little earners / A look at selling financial services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the last decade, Britain's high street banks and building societies
have stopped thinking of themselves as suppliers of services and begun to
call themselves retailers.
As a result savings accounts, insurance policies, mortgages, and credit
cards are all routinely referred to as products. But if they are products
being sold to the public by retailers, should they have their own brandings?
Unlike most retailers, banks and building societies normally sell only their
own products and the primary purpose of their marketing is to attract
consumers to a particular organisation. That at least is the classical view.
One of its strongest defenders is Halifax, the UK's largest building
society.
'The society's marketing is designed to ensure that each product contributes
to a central theme and that they do not have a life of their own which may
create confusion in the consumer's mind,' says Dick Spellman, Halifax's
general manager of marketing.
Spellman's strategy concentrates on a strong central branding designed to
convey the message that Halifax is the industry's giant and that as far as
savers are concerned, there is strength and safety in numbers.
'For us, the brand can only work if it is recognised by large numbers of
people over time,' he says.
Halifax tries to instil consumer recognition by giving its products names
with an 'X' in them. 'We try and imbue the 'X' into product names such as
Apex, Extra, and Maxim, and get them to feed off each other,' says Spellman.
Nationwide, the second largest society, last year made a much more radical
attempt to stand out from the pack. Its excursion into designer advertising,
to create brand awareness for the organisation as a whole, was short-lived.
The television-watching public was baffled by black and white shots of a son
travelling by bus through Fiji while reading a letter from his father back
in England. 'The campaign increased awareness for us but it was unexpected
from a building society,' Nationwide says.
Subsequently it has concentrated on trying to build up its image as a
friendly provider of home loans, and does not try to encourage specific
brand names for its products. Its latest advertising campaign is modestly
entitled 'Our Customers'.
'There is a number of good name brands in financial services but none of
them can do without the name of the home organisation in front if it,' says
Nationwide. However it concedes that some strong sub-brand names have
succeeded and points to Barclaycard as one of the best.
Flexaccount, the cheque book current account Nationwide launched in 1987,
came close to developing into a brand in its own right, but that reflected
the fact that Nationwide was promoting the first mass-market,
interest-bearing cheque book current account which required an especially
emphatic marketing drive.
Most other large building societies have followed the same course. Woolwich,
Alliance &amp; Leicester, and Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester do little more than
promote awareness of their names. National &amp; Provincial has gone slightly
further by adopting a mascot, a cheerful but sightless bee, to symbolise it.
Building societies generally like to promote a slightly antiquated and
changeless corporate image to signal to potential customers how secure they
are.
However, one building society has struck out on a different course. Leeds
Permanent, Britain's fifth largest building society, believes in developing
strongly branded products. In complete contrast to the solid images others
are promoting, Leeds Permanent has utilised the appeal of wide-boy Arthur
Daley in its advertising.
Alongside its own corporate branding and logo, relaunched two years ago, it
has promoted a savings brand name - 'Liquid Gold', a current account which
combined high interest rates with instant access.
'Our share in the savings market for Liquid Gold is something like twice our
overall market share,' says Chris Chadwick, commercial director at Leeds
Permanent.
Leeds Permanent's other savings products 'are merely products with a name
and have not been developed,' he says. About Pounds 20m has been spent over
five years developing Liquid Gold. The society is now planning to spend more
than Pounds 3m promoting Homearranger, a mortgage with a range of back-up
services intended to make life easier for the customer.
The clearing banks have had a mixed experience with the branding of
products. Midland Bank has quietly retreated from the high profile branding
of the late 1980s for its Vector, Meridian, and Orchard current accounts.
The credit card world provides a particularly striking illustration of the
way in which strong product brandings can come into conflict with changes in
the market.
When the credit card market opened up in the late 1980s, Barclaycard began
to issue MasterCard products as well as Visa. Barclays was able to launch a
new Barclaycard MasterCard product without much difficulty, but Connect, the
Barclays debit card, does not belong to the family.
The consortium of high street banks which issue the rival Access brand hit
even greater problems. The Access branding distracts from the card-issuer's
identity. The banks have greatly increased the prominence of their logos on
both the credit cards and the monthly statements to customers, but some
Access customers still do not realise that their card is part of their
banking relationship with NatWest, Lloyds, Midland or Royal Bank of
Scotland.
Access is also a UK-only branding: outside the UK, customers have to learn
to respond to the MasterCard global brand name or in countries such as
Germany, to the Eurocard brand name.
Worst of all, the shared Access branding means that the public cannot
differentiate between the services being offered by each individual member
bank.

FT  10 SEP 92 / People: Cottam takes over at HML
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The conservative new chairman of Haden MacLellan Holdings could hardly
present a greater contrast to Philip Ling, his 46-year-old entrepreneurial
predecessor with a penchant for heli-skiing and drag hunting. Former Ernst &amp;
Young UK managing partner Harold Cottam, 53, has arrived to 'bring some
stability and create a better image in the City', according to Mel Hawley,
HMH chief executive.
Ling, the consummate 1980s wheeler-dealer, had at the beginning of this year
agreed with the board to distance himself from the company he took public
just weeks before the 1987 stock market crash, becoming non-executive
chairman this April. At that time, it was already envisaged he would resign
when the company found a suitable successor, Hawley explains. Among a
growing number of non-executive activities, Ling is chairman of the venture
capital arm of Invesco MIM.
Cottam, who sat in on Tuesday's board meeting to approve the half year
figures announced yesterday, explains that the mood of the company has
changed - it is focusing more on core activities, and has only made three
acquisitions in the past two and a half years. As if to emphasise the break
with the past, Cottam has not even met Ling, who did not attend the meeting.
Hawley says that Cottam's industrial experience is 'somewhat limited' but
his experience of managing the merger between Ernst &amp; Whinney and Arthur
Young counted for a lot, as did his good City contacts. 'He is a very
conservative guy with a very wise head.' Ironically, some of his industrial
experience comes from a job with Simon Engineering Consortium Group in Spain
in the late 1960s - long before, however, Ling made his disastrous
management buy-in bid for Simon Engineering.
Although non-executive, Cottam thinks he will be spending 'quite a lot of
time restoring confidence and going to see a lot of people'.

Niall FitzGerald, the 46-year-old chief of Unilever's detergents' business,
has been appointed a non-executive director of the Prudential Corporation,
Britain's biggest institutional investor.
FitzGerald's appointment comes less than a month after Andrew Teare, English
China Clays' chief executive, was appointed to the board and is another sign
that the Prudential is intent on bringing in a new generation of younger
non-executives as the older ones retire. When FitzGerald takes up his
directorship on January 1, the Prudential will have six executive and 10
non-executive directors.
Irish-born FitzGerald is one of a group of younger Unilever directors who
are regarded as possible candidates for the Unilever chairmanship.
He joined the main board in May 1987 and is currently in charge of a radical
restructuring of Unilever's detergents. Industry analysts believe that if he
makes a success of his latest challenge he will be a contender for the
chairmanship of Unilever at some stage.
In some respects FitzGerald is not a typical Unilever man. He is more
flamboyant and outspoken than many of his colleagues and whereas most of
them devote their life to Unilever, he has started to collect outside
directorships. As well as the Pru, he also sits on the board of the Bank of
Ireland.

FT  10 SEP 92 / People: Luke Rittner moves to Sotheby's
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Luke Rittner, who two years ago quit as boss of the Arts Council on a matter
of principle, has at last found a worthwhile job. He is moving to Sotheby's
as its first director of communications.
Rittner, 45, appointed by the then Mrs Thatcher to bring a monetarist
approach to arts spending, became an enthusiastic advocate of subsidy and
objected to moves to make the Council a poodle, with the Arts Minister of
the day making all the important decisions.
He suffered for his beliefs, and, apart from work as a consultant on the
British arts events at Seville's Expo 92, has been under-employed. But Lord
Gowrie, an Arts Minister with whom he worked well, is now chairman of
Sotheby's Europe and, while he is on the road bringing in new business, he
felt the auction house needed a safe pair of hands to deal with clients and
governments, as well as the press.
By coincidence, Rittner's deputy at the Arts Council, Richard Pulford, who
in 1986 quit to become general director of the South Bank Arts Centre, is
also moving. He is off to the US for personal reasons. The artistic director
Nicholas Snowman takes on Pulford's responsibilities; there had been a
feeling that the tandem at the top was no longer necessary but Pulford's
departure is generally regretted.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): New generation
tastes take teacup by storm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's tea market, cool in recent years because of competition from other
drinks, is being warmed up by the development of new products.
A new generation of teas has begun to change the nation's traditional
tea-drinking habits, fuelling a 6 per cent growth in retail sales last year
to Pounds 662m.
A survey* published today estimates that sales of speciality products
increased 50 per cent in 1991. They now account for 9 per cent of total
sales, worth Pounds 60m. Forecasts suggest the sector will be worth Pounds
100m by 1995.
For the past five years, the industry has poured resources into development
of new products. The biggest impact has been made by instant teas. The
brands introduced by Brooke Bond, Lyons Tetley, and Premier Teas, the
industry leaders, have captured a Pounds 33m share of the market.
For the health-conscious, decaffeinated or low-caffeine teas have grown
rapidly as improvements have been made in taste and prices have been
reduced. Organic teas became available in 1989 when Ridgways launched the
first product developed for environmentally-conscious consumers. Lyons and
several multiple retailers have also introduced organic brands.
For the traditional tea-drinker, the Extra Fresh extension of Premier Teas'
Typhoo brand last year claimed improved flavour from vacuum-packing the tea
on the estates where it is grown.
Retailers own-label brands are now helping to build the category.
For more adventurous, up-market consumers, herbal and fruit infusions are
becoming more attractive.

'This is a career move,' says Robinson of his departure from the UK's second
largest clothing retailer that has been beset by management changes and
eroding profit margins.
Ranald Noel-Paton, John Menzies' group managing director, says that Robinson
'seemed to us to have the strengths, in depth, in the areas necessary for
the retailer of the 1990s. The complexities of the market mean you have to
be very numerate these days. He is also a tremendous team leader.'
Robinson, 45, will replace Bob Black, who has been managing director of John
Menzies Retail since 1983. In that time Black has refocused the chain from a
preponderance of corner stores to concentrate on high street outlets; he has
presided over the acquisition of a chain of stores from the Martin Retail
Group; and recently set in train an important systems overhaul.
Black, who is taking early retirement at the age of 58, was appointed to the
main board in 1984. His successor, however, does not immediately join the
board.
Joining Burton in 1979 as finance director of the retail division, Robinson
became a director of Debenhams before moving on to Principles for Men, then
Top Shop and Top Man, in both cases as managing director. He had taken up
the same position at Champion Sport just last December.
Meanwhile, moving north of the border should be easy enough for Leeds-born
Robinson, who is married to a Scot and worked for Vickers in Edinburgh,
where both his children were born, before he transferred to Burton.

<TEXT>
TOUCHE ROSS, liquidators of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce
International, yesterday won a High Court order for the Serious Fraud Office
to disclose documents seized from three former senior executives with the
bank, John Mason writes.
The documents were obtained by police from the London homes of Mr Agha
Abedi, BCCI's founder, and Mr Swaleh Naqvi, a former BCCI chief executive,
and from a safe deposit box in the name of Mr Zafar Iqbal, a former BCCI
deputy chief executive.
Many of the documents are thought to relate to work done by Price
Waterhouse, BCCI's auditors, for an investigation set up by the Abu Dhabi
government. The flight log of the BCCI jet will also be handed over to the
liquidators.
The order, which was unopposed by the SFO, follows unsuccessful attempts by
Touche Ross to obtain documents from the three men themselves.
Large creditors of Bank of Credit and Commerce Hong Kong Ltd (in
liquidation) have endorsed a repayment scheme.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Race body calls for tougher rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMMISSION for Racial Equality called on the government yesterday to
compel all employers to carry out ethnic monitoring as a part of a package
of measures to tighten up race laws.
The commission's second review of the 1976 Race Relations Act also calls for
a framework of legislation with equality of opportunity as its objective and
a duty on employers to adopt goals and timetables where appropriate.
Ethnic monitoring is the only way in which discrimination can be
systematically detected, the commission says.
The home secretary should also be given powers to introduce ethnic
monitoring of recipients of public-sector services such as housing and
education.
Sir Michael Day, commission chairman, said the 1976 act had made a
substantial contribution to good race relations, but there was continuing
evidence of widespread discrimination.
He warned the government to give 'a better response' to the second review
than it did to the first, published seven years ago.
Among measures the commission is seeking are:
A special discrimination division within the industrial tribunal system with
power to award victims up to Pounds 30,000 in compensation.
Legal aid for discrimination cases in tribunals.
The tightening and extension of the definition of indirect discrimination.
Laws against racial discrimination in Northern Ireland. The introduction of
a specific law against incitement to religious hatred.
Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, said: 'The commission . . . is right
to draw attention to the enormous problems still faced by many in the ethnic
community.'

FT  10 SEP 92 / Directors' rises held down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECESSION has held down top management's base pay rises this year,
according to figures published yesterday by Monks Partnership, the
independent remuneration advisers.
Rates of increase for the base salaries of main board directors fell from a
median of 14.3 per cent for the year to July 1991 to 7.7 per cent during the
present year to July, according to a survey based on data from more than 600
companies.
Senior managers of parent companies below board level saw their salary rises
decline from 9.3 per cent last year to 5.3 per cent this year.
The rates of pay increases of subsidiary company executives also fell,
although less dramatically.
Mr Tony Vernon-Harcourt, managing director of Monks, said: 'If we consider
what has been happening in recent months, top pay is no longer moving ahead
faster than the pay of the workforce as a whole. We would expect
differentials to narrow in times of recession.'
Most companies, he said, were expecting pay rises for senior executives of
about 5 per cent during the forthcoming year.
Pay rises for senior managers have evidently fallen more sharply than those
of the workforce generally, with government figures showing average earnings
increasing by about 7 per cent in a similar period, compared with 9.2 per
cent in the previous year.
Performance bonuses are a main component of senior managers' pay packages,
and those have also been restricted by the recession. During the past year,
the survey finds, 43 per cent of parent-company chief executives and 42 per
cent of the other main board directors who were eligible for a bonus did not
receive one because corporate performance fell short of minimum target
levels. That compares with 30 per cent and 33 per cent respectively for the
year to July 1991.
The proportion of eligible senior managers below board level in parent
companies who failed to receive bonuses rose from 37 per cent to 46 per
cent. Management Remuneration in the UK. Monks Partnership, Debden Green,

FT  10 SEP 92 / Finance takes a hard look at self-regulation: Norma Cohen
sees obstacles to creating a new structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SELF-regulation, the battle cry of the financial services industry half a
decade ago, is now seen as dispensable by some who were once its staunchest
advocates.
The threat of US-style regulatory supervision once prompted competitors in
retail financial services to make compromises with each other. Now, those
competitors are suggesting that proposed reforms to self-regulation may be
so onerous and expensive that it is hard to imagine statutory regulation
being any worse.
Plans for a new super-body for retail financial services are coming under
attack from many of the businesses it was intended to cover.
The plan envisages merging Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the
insurance and unit trust industry, with Fimbra, the regulator for
independent financial advisers, and moving about one in three members of
Imro, the regulator for fund managers, into a new Personal Investment
Authority.
Imro members, though, have made clear that they are reluctant to join the
new body, and the life insurance companies have said they will not join
unless all their competitors join as well.
The life companies' main targets are the banks and building societies, most
of which have opted to have their retail financial services arms regulated
directly by the Securities and Investments Board.
Under the Financial Services Act, businesses may choose their regulator.
Such absence of compulsion has been the greatest obstacle to getting the new
authority off the ground.
Sources familiar with a consultative document to be released on September 24
say it contains a number of carrots and sticks designed to solicit as many
members as possible.
One stick will be a provision that marketing of unit trusts is specifically
an activity regulated by PIA - that is aimed at forcing many of Imro's
financial intermediary members into the new body. While Imro regulates their
affairs, it lacks the specific authority to make rules regarding the sale of
unit trusts.
The document proposes that the burden of contributions to the Investors
Compensation Scheme will be limited for those businesses which are not
independent financial advisers or which do not rely on such advisers to
distribute their products.
Members of the PIA's formation committee have suggested to the banks a
structure for funding the scheme which could limit their exposure to losses
from the large number of one-man-band Fimbra members who account for the
largest category of claims.
Claims of up to Pounds 50m a year will fall to independent advisers and
those who rely on them for product sales; other PIA members will only have
to pick up claims above that. The Pounds 50m ceiling is higher than that for
which that category of member is responsible now. Claims above a second
ceiling will be charged to all financial services groups. But banks say that
falls short of the sort of protection they want.
If plans to form the PIA are scrapped, it will leave un-answered the central
question that prompted its consideration in the first place: how to fund the
government's compensation scheme for small investors.
In 1991-92, large insurance companies paid Pounds 14m to the compensation
scheme on behalf of the small independent financial advisers that sell their
products but cannot afford to pay their levy. Insurance and unit trust
companies paid an additional Pounds 27m on their own behalf and have said
they are not prepared to continue to bail out their smaller members. Unless
new, richer groups can be made to pay more into the scheme, it cannot
continue, they say.
Banks and others say that in talks with the PIA's formation committee there
has been little to encourage them to join. For instance, Imro members sought
a rule to require the PIA to vet all members, even those transferring from
Fimbra and Lautro, hoping to drive out of the industry the businesses that
account for the largest number of claims on the compensation scheme. If such
vetting were made a condition, though, the PIA may not win the support of
the 70 per cent of Fimbra members which it needs to approve a merger.
Banks and building societies have been seeking a cap on the amount they can
be asked to pay into the scheme - a move likely to be anathema to the
insurance companies.
The banks also sought representation on the board of the PIA equal to the
one third expected to go to independent financial advisers. That would
require either that the board be expanded beyond its already unwieldy 24
members or that consumer representation be cut - both unpalatable to the
formation committee.
In the face of what may prove intractable disagreements, the
financial-services industry is increasingly coming to the view that
government regulation is unlikely to be worse than the system now in place.
'Most of our members believe the Financial Services Act hasn't worked at
all,' said one building society representative. A switch to statutory
regulation is not likely to be any worse, he said - a view increasingly
voiced by the life insurance industry as well.
The financial services industry is increasingly adopting the view that
failure of self-regulatory bodies to prevent the theft of more than Pounds
400m from pension funds controlled by the late Robert Maxwell has thrown the
entire system into doubt. In the words of Mr Christopher Sharples, chief
executive of the Securities and Futures Authority, self-regulation is
drinking in 'the last chance saloon'.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Civil servants accept pay deal

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEMBERS of three Civil Service unions have accepted offers that will lead to
salary rises of between 4 per cent and 4.5 per cent and a significant
extension of performance pay.
The decisions by the IRSF tax union, the IPMS specialists union and the FDA
top civil servants' association mean that only one Civil Service union has
yet to settle this year.
Most members of the NUCPS accepted the advice of their leaders to accept the
pay offer, but reject plans for performance-related pay and devolving pay
bargaining to departments.
The Treasury subsequently withdrew the offer. Talks with the union are
continuing on what will happen next. Senior members of the union, who are
covered by a separate arrangement, have voted for acceptance.
The decisions by the IPMS, FDA and IRSF were all carried by overwhelming
majorities.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MOTHER Teresa, the 82-year-old winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, went
house-hunting yesterday in Birmingham, where she plans to open a new branch
of her order, the Missionaries of Charity.
Mother Teresa, who won the Nobel Prize in 1979, arrived from Calcutta on
Friday. Nuns from her order have run missionary houses in London, Liverpool
and Glasgow since the 1970s, and almost 3,000 nuns carry out her work in
nearly 100 countries.
She told the Roman Catholic auxiliary Bishop of Birmingham, the Rt Rev
Philip Pargeter: 'Silver and gold I have not to give you, but I am sending
my sisters.'
The original plan was for the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Birmingham,
Maurice Couve de Murville, to take Mother Teresa on her property-viewing
tour, but he is on holiday.
Meanwhile, Buckingham Palace confirmed that the Princess of Wales had a
secret meeting with Mother Teresa in London at the weekend.
The palace said Mother Teresa had requested the meeting to thank the
princess for her visit to Rome in February.

FT  10 SEP 92 / ITV poised to raise Pounds 15m in sponsorship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDEPENDENT Television is likely to raise about Pounds 15m this year through
sponsorship deals, reaching about Pounds 50m a year by 1995-96, according to
Mr Alan Chilton, chairman of the ITV sponsorship committee.
Mr Chilton presented results yesterday from four examples of ITV sponsorship
deals in the past 12 months:
Beamish Stout, owned by Courage, sponsored Inspector Morse, the detective
series from Central TV, for Pounds 750,000 from January to April this year.
Beamish said its market share of stout sold in pubs increased from 4.8 per
cent to 6.4 per cent over the period of the series. Sales of Beamish in cans
increased by 145 per cent during the same period compared with the
corresponding period last year.
Croft Port, owned by International Distillers and Vinters Morgan Furze
division, paid Pounds 300,000 to sponsor the Thames TV courtroom drama
series, Rumpole of the Bailey, between October and December last year.
According to the ITV sponsorship committee, Croft's sales increased by 50
per cent during the period. Barclaycard sponsored the Thames TV travel
programme Wish You Were Here between December last year and March this year
for Pounds 500,000. Viewer awareness of Barclaycard increased significantly.
Sega, the electronic games manufacturer, paid Pounds 2m to sponsor ITV
coverage of the European football championship in June. ITV research found
that 70 per cent of all males aged between 10 and 25 who watched seven or
more matches were aware that Sega had sponsored the programmes.
Mr Chilton foresaw expanded interest by advertisers in using ITV sponsorship
avenues. He said the company was looking to follow the French model and to
achieve 2 per cent of net advertising revenue from sponsorship.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Dispute over EETPU re-entry eases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEARS of a damaging inter-union split over the re-admission of the EETPU
electricians to the TUC appeared to be fading last night.
The National Union of Journalists was considering whether to go ahead with a
motion seeking to impose tough conditions on the reaffiliation talks.
However, its failure to agree with other unions about the wording of a
compromise means that few unions are likely to support its motion if it is
debated today.
The TUC's general council decided last night to oppose the motion if the NUJ
tables it.
The TUC's general council last night voted unanimously to ask the National
Union of Journalists to withdraw its motion.
If the journalists' union refuses, the general council will oppose the
motion.
TUC general secretary Norman Willis said: 'We have a very good general
council statement which shows the way forward and we do not need this
motion.'
Some unions, including Nalgo, which had previously planned to support the
NUJ, decided yesterday to vote against it.
The EETPU was expelled from the TUC in 1988. The negotiations on its
re-entry follow its merger with the AEU engineers earlier this year to form
the AEEU. TUC leaders hope they will be readmitted next year.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Test for public services' resolve: The perceived threat of
the Citizen's Charter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN the prime minister launched his Citizen's Charter last year it seemed
to some public-sector unions that they had at last found a sympathetic ear
in government.
Since 1979 the public services had faced privatisation, pay restraints and
cuts in staffing. Union protests that such measures led to a deterioration
in the quality of services had cut no ice. Mr John Major's desire to raise
the quality of public services so that they stood comparison with the best
in the private sector seemed a welcome step forward.
Yesterday's TUC debate on the public services showed that any honeymoon
period with Mr Major has been brief. The unions have found much that is
attractive in setting service standards, giving more information to
customers and making services user-friendly. But Mr Major's agenda contains
much more than that. He wants to link pay much more closely to performance
in ways that would fragment national pay bargaining, and his programme to
expose the public services to competitive pressures threatens to undermine
union organisation, which has remained relatively intact in spite of the
ravages of Thatcherism.
Within days of the launch of the charter it became clear that it involved
much more than just name badges and complaints procedures. Mr Norman Lamont,
the chancellor, announced that he wanted to renegotiate Civil Service pay
agreements to increase performance pay and allow departments and agencies to
negotiate their own pay scales. Both measures, he said, would encourage
better service for the public.
For the unions, the desire to renegotiate pay agreements that had been
running for only three years came as an unpleasant shock. The objective of
increasing payment by results was hardly more acceptable. That is anathema
to union leaders, not least because it places more emphasis on individual
performance than on collective bargaining.
The plan to devolve pay responsibilities to the 30 departments and 70
executive agencies also posed a threat. Instead of half a dozen national
agreements covering most of the 550,000 civil servants, pay negotiations
would now fragment into more than 100 separate settlements, each needing
time and support from union head offices. As one general secretary put it:
'We will be very stretched by that.'
Much more subversive for the unions, however, was the government's white
paper on market testing, Competing for Quality, published last year. That
proposed putting a large segment of government services out to tender,
promising cost savings of up to 20 per cent that could be used to improve
service quality.
Ministers gave assurances that market testing would not inevitably lead to
contracting-out. Staff would be invited to put in bids for their own work.
However, the experience of local government, where compulsory competitive
tendering is well established, is that the process leads to a loss of
members and a weakening of union strength.
Nalgo, the public-sector white-collar union, has members working in
local-government sport and recreation departments that are now subject to
competitive tender. While the union remains opposed to tendering, it is
prepared to offer members advice on preparing a bid. That can, however, lead
branches to ask if they can make concessions on nationally agreed terms and
conditions to make their bid more competitive.
Ms Christina McAnea, a local government negotiator for Nalgo, said: 'We're
against that, naturally, but we have to be pragmatic if the branch wants to
go ahead. Guaranteed hours-of-work agreements and unsocial-hours payments
are most vulnerable.'
If the contract goes to an outside bidder, the chances are slight that the
new employer will recognise Nalgo - still less concede negotiating rights.
But the union tries to keep staff who transfer to the contractor in
membership, pointing out that it can still offer some protection and
services even if there are no negotiating rights. There is always the chance
that the contractor will lose the contract and the work will again be
internal.
Most of the Civil Service unions are adopting a three-pronged strategy
against market testing:
Campaigning against contracting-out particular jobs. The Inland Revenue
Staff Federation is making much of the threat to taxpayer confidentiality in
plans to contract out tax office typing.
Helping members to prepare winning bids if jobs are put out to tender. Two
Civil Service unions are talking to consultants about this. Recruiting staff
and securing negotiating rights if the work goes to outside contractors.
The last tactic will be easier for those unions whose members have already
faced the process of privatisation - such as IPMS, which represents
specialist civil servants.
Mr Bill Brett, IPMS general secretary, said: 'My membership - 100 per cent
Civil Service 20 years ago - is now one-third private sector. We have
members in GEC, Babcock &amp; Wilcox and British Aerospace and none of them has
ever left the union to join another.'
However bullish the unions are, contracting-out threatens to erode their
membership base at the same time as the fragmentation of pay negotiations
requires additional resources in time and staffing. The public services
remain almost 70 per cent unionised in spite of the unfavourable climate for
unions in the 1980s. They will do well to emerge from the 1990s with their
strength intact.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Campaign calls for action to reduce unemployment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACTION by the government to stimulate growth is not constrained by the
Public Sector Borrowing Requirement, the TUC yesterday argued. It said that
a targeted increase in public spending would reduce the PSBR as a percentage
of national income.
Launching a three-year campaign for full employment and debating the
economy, the TUC said the Treasury's computer model shows that an increase
of Pounds 2bn in public spending would increase employment by more than
100,000. 'The government is not helpless to act. There are projects up and
down the country which could be started very quickly', says a TUC report on
unemployment.
The projects include Pounds 480m in building projects identified by
Birmingham City Council, releasing the Pounds 9m in unspent capital receipts
that a local authority is prevented by the government from using in spite of
having 5,500 families on its housing waiting list, and a school maintenance
programme identified by Lothian Regional Council.
The TUC argues that the government should have two priority objectives - to
secure a co-ordinated cut in interest rates across the European Community
and to stimulate the domestic economy through targeted public spending. It
accepts that unemployment of between 2 per cent and 3 per cent is
unavoidable and that inflation must also be kept under control.
Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary, said that Mr Howard Davies, CBI
director-general who addressed the TUC on Tuesday, made a 'serious
underestimate of the mess we're in'. He questioned the enthusiasm of some
union leaders for devaluing sterling, warning that it might lead to higher
interest rates.
One of the motions carried commits the TUC to a new policy on takeovers
which would require companies to demonstrate the positive benefits of a
merger rather than just the absence of negative effects.
LABOUR yesterday high-lighted the difficulties in finding a job that face
people who are unemployed, with a survey of job vacancies compared with the
numbers of those without work, Alison Smith writes.
In some areas of London, there are more than 280 people registered
unemployed for every job vacancy, while in the worst-hit areas more than 100
people chase each vacancy.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Accountants look to managers to survive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY half Britain's accountancy firms would like to employ a manager from
business to help them survive the recession, according to a survey published
yesterday.
Most are concerned about cashflow and property and staff costs. They also
expect profits to fall in the coming year.
The analysis of 587 small and medium-sized accountancy firms (with up to 20
partners) was conducted by Inform Corporation, a London information
technology consultancy.
In spite of their role as business advisers to companies, 45 per cent of the
firms said appointing an experienced business manager would make the biggest
single contribution to resolving their own trading and development
difficulties.
The admission contrasts strongly with the traditional hold that qualified
accountants have kept on management of their practices.
The survey showed that 52 per cent of firms expected partners' pay - and
thus profits - to fall in the coming year.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Greater accountability for regulators urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TUC made its first serious contribution to the national debate on the
regulation of utilities yesterday by calling for greater accountability for
the regulators and less favouritism for business customers.
Moving a motion on the regulation of public-service industries, Mr Tony
Young, general secretary of the NCU communications union, said: 'For too
long we have ignored the role that regulators have to play. We've seen them
as agents of the Tory government, instead of realising that they could just
as easily work for the country as a whole.'
The call is a response to the government's sale of about 25 per cent of
British Telecom shares last year which ruled out the prospect of a return to
state control of the company under any future Labour government. Hitherto,
the possibility of renationalisation has prevented the NCU from entering the
regulation debate.
The motion urges new responsibilities for the regulators which would protect
the needs of all regions of the country, promote training and research and
ensure that both business and individual customers benefit from new
technology.
Mr Young criticised bodies such as Oftel, the telecommunications regulator,
for focusing on promoting maximum competition in public-service industries
and ignoring the national public interest.
He said that BT had reduced prices for business after privatisation, but
that average domestic bills had fallen very little.
The NCU also believes regulators should be made more accountable, through
more open decision-making and effective scrutiny by parliamentary select
committees.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Abolition of wages councils opposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Trades Union Congress is hoping to exploit differences between
government ministers and among employers in the campaign to retain the wages
councils, which set minimum wages for 2.47m workers.
The TUC fears that abolition of the councils - which are most important in
shops, hotels and the clothing industry - will feature in the next round of
trade union legislation this autumn. But officials believe Mrs Gillian
Shephard, the employment secretary, is more reluctant to press ahead than
some of her colleagues.
'Mrs Shephard is likely to have qualms about removing protection from 2m
women workers and supporting a measure which is likely to discourage
training,' one official said.
The TUC hopes that retailers will be too busy with the campaign tp legalise
Sunday trading to seek abolition of wage councils. The Confederation of
British Industry does not support complete abolition but 'sector-by-sector
review'.
An NOP poll commissioned by the TUC has found that nine out of ten people
support continued protection for people on low pay.
The TUC argues that abolition would not create jobs and claims that 400,000
people are already illegally being paid under the minimum level. It also
said that abolition would lead to a large increase in Family Credit
payments.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Treasury spells out preference for private sector: Unions
attack competitive tendering - Full employment campaign launched / Pressure
on utility watchdogs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CIVIL SERVICE departments tendering for government work may lose to the
private sector even when they can do the job as well and as cheaply, it
emerged yesterday.
Treasury advice to departments on competitive tendering says the
government's policy is to restrict the size of the public sector. 'In
general the presumption is that services should be provided by the private
sector, rather than the public sector,' the advice says.
'The fact that a public body can provide a service as quickly and as cheaply
as an outside contractor is not in itself a reason for extending
public-service activity,' it continues.
Contents of the memo were leaked by Civil Service unions yesterday as they
launched a campaign to publicise what they see as the harmful effects that
will result from competitive tendering.
Mr Bill Brett, general secretary of the IPMS Civil Service union, said 400
services in 28 departments were covered by market-testing arrangements
launched a year ago to pave the way for competitive tendering. Some 50,000
jobs in government departments were at risk, he said.
The unions believe their members may be forced to accept inferior conditions
in order for the departments to compete and they plan to warn the public
that they too will suffer.
Mr Brett said that if parts of the Health and Safety Executive were
contracted out, its ability to hold multi-disciplinary operations - for
example in the wake of disasters such as the King's Cross fire - would be
reduced.
Mr Clive Brooke, general secretary of the IRSF Civil Service union, said
contracting-out in the Inland Revenue would mean that companies' tax records
would be handled by other companies and possibly competitors.
The unions said market testing was proving expensive. In the Home Office, a
budget of Pounds 1.6m had been set aside and 40 people were working on
market testing.
Included in what the unions say is a comprehensive list of areas being
tested for marketing are large parts of the Ministry of Defence and the
armed forces and the private-letter section of the Foreign Office.
The TUC yesterday backed a resolution to campaign to 'ensure our members are
in the best position to fight the threats to all public-sector jobs'. The
resolution commits the TUC to make a campaign against privatisation and
contracting-out a 'top priority'.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Promise of the '80s turns sour: Calls for more protection
for holidaymakers - No redundancy plans / The background to this week's
collapse of the Mowat holiday group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER and DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR a thrusting 1980s company, there could not have been two more promising
businesses than property and leisure. The seemingly unstoppable rise of the
former made consumers feel wealthy enough to lavish increasing amounts of
disposable income on the latter.
For the Mowat Group, the attempt to marry property and leisure ended
yesterday morning when receivers Touche Ross arrived at the company's
Hertfordshire headquarters to take control of the business.
Mr Brian Dunlop, Mowat's chairman, insists that there was nothing wrong with
the company's leisure businesses, which included 11 holiday camps as well as
cruises on the Norfolk Broads.
The 13 banks that decided to call in the receivers on Tuesday night agree.
Mr Ian Birch, regional director of Lloyds Bank Commercial Services, which
led the negotiations, says Mowat's demise stemmed from the downturn in the
property market.
Mr Dunlop announced last April that the group wanted to dispose of its
property interests to concentrate on the more promising leisure sector.
Mowat's property arm had built homes, mostly in Staffordshire and Cheshire,
as well as commercial and industrial facilities.
By that stage, however, the company was already in serious trouble. In the
15 months to the end of September 1991, Mowat recorded a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 1.97m. Its share price, which regularly topped 50p in the late 1980s,
traded at less than 4p for much of the summer. When the shares were
suspended at Mowat's request last Tuesday, they stood at 2 1/2 p. Mr Dunlop
put the group's total debt at Pounds 54m.
Receivership was all the more bitter for Mr Dunlop because he had rescued
the company from near-collapse before. Originally a tanning company, Mowat
moved into property, making it one of the stock market stars of the 1970s.
By 1979, however, profits had collapsed, and in 1984 the company's stock
exchange listing was cancelled. A year later, dissident shareholders led by
Mr Dunlop ousted the board. The company was floated on the Unlisted
Securities Market on Christmas Eve, 1987.
Mr Dunlop insisted that this week's receivership could have been avoided.
His bankers make clear that their patience had run out.
Ten of the banks had their loans to the company secured by property business
assets. Mr Dunlop says that accounted for Pounds 30m of the debt. The 10
banks had agreed in principle to attempt to dispose of the properties
concerned. Three banks - Lloyds, the Cooperative Bank and Banque Indosuez -
had lent the company money to meet its working capital requirements, and
they were less happy.
Mowat and the banks reached an agreement that it would raise Pounds 6.5m in
new investment by August 27 to fund its remaining leisure business. Mr Birch
says that by that deadline the company had received firm pledges for only
Pounds 1.9m. The two sides agreed to extend the deadline until September 7,
by which point Mr Birch says the company told the banks it had a sum
approaching Pounds 2.5m.
Mr Birch says: 'The other problem was that the professional fees incurred in
this equity issue would have added Pounds 300,000. There was also a fresh
forecast at that time that there would be a need for new working capital of
Pounds 2.5m before the pre-1993 season. We were not prepared to take that
risk.'
Touche Ross says it has no immediate plans to make any of Mowat's 740
employees redundant. The immediate task is to secure the holidays of the
more than 60,000 people who hold Mowat bookings for the rest of this year.
Few of those holidays are thought to be protected in any way. Neither Mowat
nor its holiday subsidiaries - Holimarine, Pennant Parks and Pennant Boats -
were members of the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) - only
customers who booked their holidays through Abta travel agents will benefit
from the organisation's protection scheme.
Mr Nigel Atkinson, one of the receivers, says he will try to find one or
more buyers for Mowat's holidays camps, which compete with resorts such as
Butlin's. There is already a buyer for the Norfolk Broads cruise operation -
last July, Mowat said it was selling the business to Broads Tours, a private
company, for Pounds 1.9m in cash and Pounds 2m in property.

FT  10 SEP 92 / September bookings safe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TENS OF thousands of people who booked autumn holidays with Mowat, the
failed property and leisure group, will have to wait several days to find
out whether their money is safe, receivers Touche Ross said yesterday.
Touche Ross, which took control of Mowat yesterday morning after a syndicate
of 13 banks decided to put the company into administrative receivership,
said all bookings for holidays until October 3 would be honoured.
Mr Nigel Atkinson, one of the receivers, said he had not yet calculated how
many holidays had been booked for the period. Earlier this week, however, Mr
Brian Dunlop, Mowat chairman, put the number of bookings for the rest of
September at 20,000. He said there were an additional 43,000 bookings for
the remainder of the autumn season.
Mr Atkinson said two help-lines set up to provide information to Mowat
customers were busy throughout yesterday. Mowat owns 11 holiday parks in
England and offers cruise holidays on the Norfolk Broads. The helpline
numbers are: 0902 880800 (Holimarine) and 0692 670100 (Pennant Boats).
Mr Ian Birch, regional director of Lloyds Bank Commercial Service, which led
the syndicate, denied a claim by Mr Dunlop that the banks had acted too
quickly in calling in the receivers.
He said the banks had agreed to allow the company to continue operating if
it could raise Pounds 6.5m in new equity capital by August 27. That was
subsequently extended to last Monday, by which point Mowat had received firm
pledges for less than half that sum.
'If they had raised that Pounds 6.5m equity, I'm sure in my own mind that
the business would have continued,' Mr Birch said.
Mowat was not a member of the Association of British Travel Agents and its
holidays were not protected by a bond. The company's demise prompted further
calls yesterday for the government to protect holidaymakers.
Mr Mike Grindrod, Abta president, said he would be seeking a meeting with
Baroness Denton, consumer affairs minister, to discuss whether all travel
companies that take pre-payments should be licensed. Another unbonded
company, Land Travel, collapsed in July, leaving more than 40,000 people
with no prospect of recovering their money.
Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour consumer affairs spokesman, said the Department
of Trade and Industry should liaise with Abta on which travel companies
might be in trouble.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Crash blamed on property snags
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE director of the East Anglian tourist board, Mr Procter Naylor, said
yesterday that the collapse of Mowat was brought about by difficulties with
property concerns rather than with its three holiday centres in the region.
Mr Naylor expected that the sale to Broads Tours of Pennant Holidays,
Mowat's boat hire business, would still go ahead. Pennant Holidays' 175
cruisers and 38 day launches make up about 10 per cent of all hire boats on
the Norfolk Broads, where there are about 70 boat hire yards.
Mr Naylor, who said he was 'very sad' about Mowat's demise, said bookings
for its chalet and caravan sites had held up well in spite of the recession,
and receivers should have little difficulty in finding a suitable buyer.
Mr Len Funnell, chairman of Broads Tours, said he had held discussions with
Mowat's receivers yesterday and hoped the deal would still go through.
Boat hire bookings on the Norfolk Broads this summer were about 20 per cent
down on last year. Tourist operators estimated that Pennant Holidays'
bookings dropped even lower, in spite of a 30 per cent discount, partly
because it acted as its own boat holiday booking agent.
'I don't think it was the bad season that brought Mowat down,' Mr Funnell
said.
The Mowat group's Peerglow division had built homes primarily in
Staffordshire and Cheshire, with commercial and industrial developments
around the M25.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Survey of 3,000 teachers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY one in five teachers in England and Wales expects to leave the
profession within the next five years, but the great majority of teachers
are satisfied with their positions, according to an independent survey of
teacher motivation published yesterday.
The survey of more than 3,000 teachers, conducted by a University of London
research team, found four fifths of teachers dissatisfied with their status
in the community, and two thirds complaining of an unmanageable workload.
Almost half wanted to see a reduction in their working time outside school
hours.
The survey response rate was only 36 per cent, and the report warns that the
survey may give undue weight to the opinions of the disaffected. However,
the report gives little encouragement for government plans to extend
performance pay for teachers. Only 3 per cent of the teachers surveyed
believed it would have a significant positive impact on morale and
motivation. The majority said the most important factors for their
motivation were good relations with pupils and colleagues, management
responsibility and helping pupils to achieve.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Schools inquiry launched to boost Queen's English
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government's mission to put Shakespeare, the Queen's English and
traditional teaching back into the classroom took a significant step forward
yesterday with its decision to establish a full inquiry into English in the
national curriculum in England and Wales.
The inquiry, to be conducted by the National Curriculum Council, a
government quango, will concentrate on the teaching of 'standard English',
the reading of 'great literature', and the mastering of 'basic writing
skills'.
Ministers have repeatedly urged teachers and examination boards to give
those aspects greater emphasis, but the new curriculum orders set to result
from the review are likely to force them to do so.
Mr John Patten, education secretary, said he 'strongly supported' the NCC's
objectives 'of encouraging pupils to develop the habit of reading, critical
judgment, and an understanding of the love of English'.
He added: 'Children must develop a proper grasp of the essentials of grammar
and spelling and of the skills of using language competently and
appropriately if they are not to be seriously disadvantaged in many aspects
of their lives.'
Mr Patten also accepted recommendations from the School Examinations and
Assessment Council, another quango, that from next year English tests for
14-year-olds should include questions on three Shakespeare plays - Julius
Caesar, A Midsummer Night's Dream and Romeo and Juliet.
Justifying the inquiry, Mr David Pascall, chairman of the NCC, pointed to
reports by the schools inspectorate indicating that up to a third of English
lessons were 'unsatisfactory'.
He emphasised the desirability of a traditional curriculum. The present
curriculum was 'too general', he said, because it listed only the Bible,
William Wordsworth, Jane Austen, Charles Dickens and the Brontes as examples
of classic works, with Shakespeare the only author whose work was required
study.
Mr Pascall emphasised that he wanted children to be taught standard English,
which he defined as 'grammatically correct but which can be spoken in any
accent'.
The review is to be completed by February.
The announcement of the inquiry was met by a hostile reaction from moderate
teachers' unions. Mr Peter Smith, general secretary of the 140,000-strong
AMMA union, said: 'Teachers will be grossly insulted by the innuendo that
they are not concerned about spelling, grammar, punctuation and clear
expression.'
Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, accused the government of
'hastily forcing change without due consideration for the views of teachers,
parents or pupils'.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Anger at EC product safety rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH industry has been told by the government to implement EC
product-safety directives immediately, even though that may double the cost
of the changes and most community countries are behind the UK in introducing
them.
The directives on child-resistant caps for containers of toxic material such
as creosote, paint stripper and adhesives sold through retail outlets were
supposed to come into force on August 1.
The retail, paintmaking, adhesives and aerosols industries were advised by
government officials not to retool their production lines until the Health
and Safety Executive had drawn up parallel domestic regulations.
The complexity of drafting the regulations meant that the August 1 deadline
was missed, and the Department of Trade and Industry has put the date for
implementation of the regulations back to November 1. Manufacturers say that
means millions of pounds worth of stock already produced will have to be
taken back and their containers scrapped. The industries were expecting a
six-month transition period.
Mrs Moira McMillan, director of the Paintmakers Association, said yesterday:
'We are all in favour of making the changes, providing it is the same for
all of us, but this will double the cost for the paint industry alone from
Pounds 6m to Pounds 12m. The other industries are going to be similarly hit.
'It's a terrific example of the government shooting its own industry in the
foot. As if things were not bad enough already with the recession.'
There is also confusion about which types of bottle tops will comply with
the regulations. Mrs McMillan said some companies that had started tooling
up for designs approved by the British Standards Institution had discovered
that the directive dealt only with internationally approved systems, and the
two were not the same.
A delegation from all the industries this week failed to persuade DTI
officials to change their minds.
The delegation was particularly annoyed that only the Netherlands and
Denmark have the directives fully in place so far. France implements them on
October 1, but with a three-month transition period. Germany's date is
January 1, with a six-month transition.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Major stands firm on Europe and economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR has signalled his determination to ride out a threatened
winter of discontent among Conservative MPs over the economy and Europe.
The prime minister, who will spell out his strategy in a speech to the
Confederation of British Industry in Glasgow tonight, has told colleagues
that his critics have completely underestimated his commitment to the
permanent defeat of inflation.
The speech, which will include a further reaffirmation of his support for
closer European co-operation, coincides with intense discussions among
senior ministers on the best strategy to outflank Tory critics of the
Maastricht treaty.
In spite of growing unease on the Tory back benches about the high level of
interest rates needed to preserve sterling's parity in the Exchange Rate
Mechanism, Mr Major has flatly rejected suggestions that he will be forced
eventually to devalue.
The prime minister is convinced that the duration of the recession is linked
much more closely to the rapid slowdown in the world economy than to
sterling's rate against the D-Mark.
He is also pointing to the turmoil that has engulfed Nordic currencies to
refute the argument of those arguing that sterling could be insulated from
large-scale speculation outside the ERM.
Colleagues say that Mr Major is under no illusions that the combination of a
row over Maastricht and the depth of the recession threatens a stormy few
months on the Tory back benches. But he is said to be as adamant in private
as in public that he will not jeopardise his central objective of defeating
inflation by yielding to short-term pressures.
Senior ministers, meanwhile, are discussing a range of options for the
return to the House of Commons of the legislation to implement Maastricht if
the French referendum endorses the treaty on September 20.
A Yes vote in France is expected to be followed within two weeks by the
promised Danish white paper outlining the Copenhagen government's options as
a result of the treaty's rejection in a June referendum.
Ministers argue that Mr Major will then face strong pressure to hold a
'paving' debate on the principle of Maastricht as soon as the Commons
returns from its summer recess in mid October.
Party managers are far less certain about whether the government could then
risk holding the detailed line-by-line debate that would be necessary to
turn the bill into law.
Mr Major is said to be anxious to be able to demonstrate to his European
colleagues by the time of the Edinburgh summit in December that he can
guarantee the passage of the legislation.
But with hundreds of amendments already tabled by the Euro-sceptics, party
managers estimate that it might take three weeks or so of day-and-night
debates to get the legislation through. That is prompting some ministers to
urge a further delay until early next year.

   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE round-table talks on the political future of Northern Ireland hung in
the balance last night after a walkout by the Democratic Unionist leaders
the Rev Ian Paisley and Mr Peter Robinson.
The DUP leaders abandoned the 'strand two' talks at Stormont Castle, which
are being attended by the four constitutional parties in Northern Ireland
and the British and Irish governments.
They were complaining that two articles of the Irish Republic's
constitution, which establish a territorial claim to Northern Ireland and
which the Unionists wish to see dropped, should be a priority in the
negotiations.
After the walkout, Mr Paisley said: 'The Irish government has persuaded the
other people at the talks that articles two and three are not to be given
priority, and so they have put them at the bottom of the agenda. As long as
that prevails we will not be there.'
The DUP did, however, keep two junior representatives at the negotiating
table to monitor the discussions, and it is understood that Mr Paisley told
the other participants that he and Mr Robinson would return to the
negotiations once articles two and three are discussed.
In reaction to the walkout, Mr John Hume, the nationalist SDLP leader, said
that Mr Paisley seemed to want only to discuss his matters on the agenda and
no one else's.
He added: 'It doesn't seem to give any great commitment to try to have
genuine dialogue, which is about discussing other people's attitudes as well
as your own.
'What is being discussed are the obstacles which lie in the way of
north-south relations. Everybody has put forward a list of what obstacles
they see. I am quite prepared to discuss everybody's attitude but I would
not confine myself to my own.'
The DUP warned last night that it would respond to any statements made by
other participants to the talks, raising fears that the entire process begun
last April may be on the verge of breakdown amid a public exchange of mutual
recriminations.
The strand two talks are scheduled to continue up to September 28, with one
round at Stormont next week and the final round taking place in Dublin.
A 'strand three' meeting, between the British and Irish governments, is
scheduled for London this Friday.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Call for more resources to be given to rural areas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC and social change in Britain's rural areas is creating poverty,
deprivation, distress and unemployment which have been largely ignored by
the government, according to a report published yesterday by the Duke of
Westminster.
The report calls for the government to launch programmes similar to those
devoted to inner-city regeneration. Government and EC policies should be
directed towards keeping farmers in business to maintain the landscape, it
says. Action is needed to encourage the forestry industry and the growth of
small business.
The duke also calls for more resources for the countryside, particularly for
schools, public transport and inexpensive housing.
He says; 'Everyone knows about the problems of inner cities, but people
suffering much the same difficulties in rural areas get precious little
attention. People in the countryside may not be rioting, but they do more
serious things like killing themselves.'
The report opens with a letter to the prime minister signed by the duke and
44 leading figures from the business, public and voluntary sectors calling
for a recognition of the needs and difficulties of country dwellers. It
calls for action to maintain a socially stable and economically viable rural
society and to conserve the rural landscape.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Initiative over late payments
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Department of Trade and Industry is to give Pounds 30,000 each to the
Federation of Master Builders, the Mechanical and Metal Trades Association
and the Walsall Chamber of Commerce and Industry as part of an initiative to
tackle the difficulty of late payment of debts.
The money will be used to provide counselling and training in credit
management and debt recovery and to promote codes of practice.
The government's aim is to fund pilot projects that can be used as models of
good practice which may be adopted by other trade associations and which can
become self-financing.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Sellafield halts reprocessing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Nuclear Fuels has halted reprocessing at its Sellafield plant in
west Cumbria because of a malfunction in the plutonium evaporator, an
element in the reprocessing operation.
BNFL said yesterday that reprocessing of fuel from Magnox reactors, which
stopped on Tuesday, was unlikely to resume before next week as the fault had
not been detected. It said that no radioactivity had escaped and nobody was
injured.
The evaporator is used in the conversion of plutonium liquor into powder.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Commons defence group recalled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE cross-party defence committee of MPs has taken the rare step of deciding
to meet during the parliamentary recess, to take evidence about the
deployment of British forces in the Gulf and in the former Yugoslavia,
Alison Smith writes.
Just a week after Mr John Major dismissed a request from the Labour
leadership to recall the Commons to discuss such issues, along with the
economy, the Tory-dominated committee announced that it planned to question
Mr Archie Hamilton, the armed forces minister, later this month.
Meeting in the recess is not unprecedented for a Commons committee, but it
is an unusual move which reflects the concern among MPs over the deployment
of British troops.
Sir Nicholas Bonsor, the Tory chairman of the committee, denied that its
decision was a criticism of the prime minister's refusal to bring MPs back
to Westminster to debate foreign affairs. It was important for the committee
to keep on top of the issue.
Six British Tornado aircraft began taking part in the United Nations
enforcement of the 'no fly' exclusion area in southern Iraq late last month.
Some 1,800 British troops are ready to leave for Bosnia when the UN gives
the signal.

FT  10 SEP 92 / BMA knew it risked complaints over fees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Medical Association leaders yesterday admitted that they had
realised they risked complaints to the Office of Fair Trading by publishing
guideline charges for doctors' private work.
Mr Richard Marcus, a surgeon and vice-chairman of the BMA's consultants
committee, said that the association had nonetheless decided to go ahead
with publication because it had believed its action was justified.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director general of fair trading, asked the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission on Tuesday to investigate the way in which
consultants set fees for private work.
Concern over the BMA fees guidelines, which first appeared in 1989 and have
just been republished, gave rise to the decision.
The BMA emphasises that its schedule of rates is merely advisory, and that
consultants should always discuss fees they charge with their patients.
In its most recent set of guidelines, it says: 'It is essential to stress
that this document is only to be used by practitioners as a guide.
Consultants must always decide themselves on what the appropriate fee is for
the service provided.'
The annual report of the consultants committee contains a similar message,
saying that 'it is, of course, always for individual consultants to
determine their own professional fees and the BMA guidelines are intended as
a helpful source of reference'.
Mr Marcus pointed out that the medical profession had a responsibility to
the public to try to avoid total chaos in private medical charges, and the
guidelines were intended to help achieve that.
He said: 'The government has seen the difficulties involved in trying to
have a free market in health care during its reforms of the National Health
Service, and talks now of wanting a managed market. The thinking behind the
guidelines is quite similar to the managed market notion.'
Mr Tim Baker, business development manager with Norwich Union Health Care, a
private health insurer that has welcomed the MMC investigation, said: 'There
is no competition in a downwards direction on fees. People do not take
consumerism into health care. It is not quite the done thing.'
He said that private rates being highlighted by the BMA guidelines were
excessive because they were based on historical information from a period
when private medicine contributed a far smaller proportion of consultants'
income than it does now.
The BMA does not accept that the guidelines prevent downward pressure on
fees. Mr Marcus said that the development of the guidelines was providing an
opportunity to restructure suggested prices to reflect developments in
medical practice.
The MMC yesterday announced the appointment of the four remaining members of
its inquiry team, which will be headed by Mr Peter Dean, a deputy chairman
of the commission and freelance business consultant. They are:
Mr Alexander Ferry, general secretary of the Confederation of Shipbuilding
and Engineering Unions. He is also a non-executive director of Harland and
Wolff shipbuilders and a member of the Employment Appeal Tribunal and the
Engineering Training Authority.
Mr Nigel Matthews, group secretary of J. Sainsbury, who previously worked
with the CBI, the Association of British and Irish Flour Millers and was a
law lecturer at Dundee University.
Mr Patrick Minford, professor of applied economics at Liverpool University,
a guru of monetarism and an adviser to a number of government departments.
Mr John Montgomery, fellow and tutor in economics at Oriel College, Oxford,
and former economic director at the National Economic Development Office.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Pressure builds over coal deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is stepping up pressure on the electricity industry and
British Coal to reach an early agreement on new coal supply contracts to the
power generators.
Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, is believed to have held talks this week
with the two biggest power generators, National Power and PowerGen, as well
as with representatives of the 12 regional distribution companies of England
and Wales.
Further talks are scheduled at the Department of Trade and Industry today.
Speculation that the generators, particularly National Power, are facing the
strongest pressure to yield ground and break the deadlock helped to depress
shares yesterday. National Power shares closed down 4 1/2 p at 234 1/2 p.
According to one market report, Mr Eggar has given the electricity companies
and British Coal until September 16 to come up with an outline agreement.
That is to enable the government to formulate a position on the
privatisation of British Coal in time for the Conservative Party conference
which starts on October 5.
The DTI refused to comment on Mr Eggar's meetings with energy company
representatives, saying that they were a commercial matter.
British Coal said: 'We're close. But we've been close to the finishing line
before.'
The new long-term coal supply contracts, due to run from next March, are an
essential precursor to the privatisation of British Coal, which is planned
for the end of this year.
The contracts will determine the size and potential profitability of British
Coal because they will replace the subsidised prices that the UK coal
industry has been enjoying with ones based on world prices.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Labour confusion on ERM deepens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISARRAY within the Labour party over UK membership of the European exchange
rate mechanism deepened yesterday as Mr David Blunkett, shadow health
secretary, called for the opposition to support a currency realignment.
Mr Blunkett's words came the day after Mr Bryan Gould, shadow heritage
secretary, launched a sharp attack on the Maastricht treaty and on the
deflationary nature of the ERM.
Speaking in Sheffield, Mr Blunkett welcomed the measures the party had
already outlined, but added: 'The benefits which were gained 25 years ago
when belatedly sterling was realigned, could provide the basis for our
economic recovery today.'
Although Mr Blunkett's words are more cautious than the statement from Mr
Gould, they intensify pressure on the party leadership to ensure that there
is a full and open debate on the stance it should take over the impact on
the domestic economy of the high interest rates needed to support the pound
in the ERM.
'If interest rates are not to rise with further damage to industry and
millions of families with mortgages, then realignment within the ERM would
appear to be a necessity,' Mr Blunkett said last night.
He argued that a comprehensive realignment was vital for the survival of
manufacturing, but did not say whether he thought the UK should act
unilaterally if there were not enough support for a general realignment.
Mr Gould yesterday refused to rule out resigning from the shadow cabinet
over Europe.
'That is, I suppose, in theory always open to any member of the shadow
cabinet on any issue,' he said on BBC breakfast news when asked about
Maastricht.
He added, however: 'I have no reason to suppose that when the shadow cabinet
reaches a decision it won't be one I cannot support.'
He went on to make clear that he 'did not think for a moment' that there was
a damaging split in Labour's leadership.

FT  10 SEP 92 / World Trade News: China threatens US with retaliation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA's outrage at the US sale of F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan threatened
yesterday to spill over into already testy trade negotiations.
Beijing warned that it would slap punitive tariffs on US goods including
computers and aircraft if the US carried out its threat to impose tariffs on
Dollars 3.9bn of imports from China unless China relaxes its import regime.
The US has set a deadline of October 10, and its negotiators are due in
Beijing at the weekend to seek an agreement on market access. Chinese
officials had previously indicated that they were willing to loosen and
clarify import restrictions.
China remains furious at President Bush's decision, announced last week, to
allow the sale of up to 150 fighters to Taiwan.
It says the sale would violate the 1982 Sino-US communique under which
Washington undertook to limit and eventually phase out arms sales to Taiwan.
It also accused the US yesterday of bad faith in the market access talks.

FT  10 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Protest over Intelsat tender
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MATRA MARCONI SPACE, the Anglo-French joint venture, has protested to
Intelsat, the Washington-based international telecomm-unications consortium,
alleging it changed the rules in a Dollars 200m tender contract in a way
that favoured US satellite makers.
Intelsat will confirm in the next few days it has awarded the contract for
the first of a new generation of satellites to the lowest bidder, GE-Astro,
part of the US company GE.
Matra Marconi alleges GE Astro only had a lower bid because it was able to
cut its initial price in an unprecedented second round of bids.
The Intelsat decision will be confirmed in a series of board meetings
starting today and lasting until September 16. The Intelsat 8 communications
satellites will be delivered from 1995 onwards.
Four companies tendered earlier this year for the contract: Hughes Aircraft
and GE-Astro at a little more than Dollars 200m, Loral at Dollars 240m and
Matra Marconi Space at Dollars 198m.
After these four bids were received, Intelsat eliminated Loral and announced
a second round of bidding. In this round, GE-Astro cut its price by one
third to about Dollars 145m.
'We are very disappointed at the way Intelsat has conducted the bidding,'
said Mr Claude Goumy, chairman of Matra Marconi Space, which is 51 per cent
owned by Matra of France and 49 per cent by GEC of the UK. 'We had it in
writing that there would be one set of bids.'
Another of the bidders confirmed that two rounds of bidding was 'unusual'.
It said: 'Intelsat has previously only considered one round of bids and then
chosen a lead contractor and a number two.'
Intelsat replied to the criticisms saying it had an obligation to buy from
the best value bidder and had used a two-round method in other contracts.
'We couldn't be happier with the way the procurement process has been
conducted. We don't feel that anyone has been short-changed,' said Intelsat.
Mr Goumy said he would be asking European Intelsat partners, which include
France Telecom, British Telecom and Deutsche Telekom, to push the European
satellite-making cause at the Intelsat board meetings.

FT  10 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Talks fail to resolve EC banana quotas row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TALKS between the European Community and a group of Latin American banana
producers over proposed EC import barriers to bananas ended in failure
yesterday. The talks were a first step under the disputes settlement
mechanism of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), and could go
to an arbitration panel.
The seven exporters - Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama,
Colombia and Ecuador - claim existing national trade barriers are
discriminatory and that the EC plan, which extends import quotas and customs
duties to all 12 member states, could halve their exports to the Community
of 2.5m tons a year. The bulk of this goes to Germany, the EC's biggest
banana consumer, where bananas enter duty-free.
Mr Roberto Rojas, trade minister of Costa Rica, said afterwards the group
would raise the issue at the next meeting of Gatt's governing council on
September 29. It would also be asking Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt's
director-general, to call an urgent meeting of the surveillance body of the
Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks to rule whether the EC proposals
violated a commitment not to introduce new protectionist measures.
Gatt procedures do not allow panels to be established until the rules being
challenged have been adopted. Thus a request for a panel on the new
proposals would have to await their endorsement by the council of ministers.
The plan drawn up by the European Commission would impose a basic banana
import quota of 2m tons next year, with a 20 per cent tariff on bananas from
the so-called 'dollar region'. Higher-cost bananas from Africa and the
Caribbean would enter duty-free under the EC's Lome Convention.
Mr Rojas said the scheme could cost the seven countries about Dollars 500m a
year.

BOEING yesterday announced a Dollars 470m order for 737 twin-engined jet

The deal, announced at the Farnborough Air Show, includes seven firm orders
and options on six more.
The aircraft will be powered by CFM56 engines developed by General Electric
of the US and Snecma of France.
New aircraft orders have been rare at the Farnborough Air Show this week,

FT  10 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Beechcraft a contender forBAe division
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BEECHCRAFT, the business aircraft division of the US Raytheon group, has
emerged at the Farnborough Air Show as a strong contender to buy British
Aerospace's corporate jet division.
BAe announced earlier this year it intended to sell a majority stake in its
corporate jet division activities, which include the BAe 125-800 and
125-1000 jets, as part of its overall restructuring programme.
The UK group will unveil details of its latest restructuring on September 23
when it announces its financial results for the first half of this year.
The industry is expecting details of the eventual sale of the corporate jet
division, as well as of the future of the company's loss-making regional jet
operations.
BAe is considering withdrawing from the regional jet market if it fails to
secure a partnership to ensure adequate capital resources to remain a
significant competitor. It has been holding active talks with Taiwan on a
partnership.
Details of a Beechcraft offer for the corporate aircraft business have not
been revealed, but it is believed that the BAe activities could fetch about
Pounds 200m and would complement Beechcraft's own executive aircraft
products.
Beechcraft is the leader in the turbo propeller executive aircraft market
and the BAe division would help the US company expand into the larger
business jet market.
Two other potential buyers, including Dassault of France and Bombardier of
Canada, indicated yesterday they had no interest in the BAe corporate jet
activities.
Mr Serge Dassault, chairman of the French group, said his company wanted to
develop its own products in the business jet market rather than buy other
activities.
Mr Laurent Baudoin, chairman of Bombardier, said yesterday that BAe's
corporate jet activities did not fit with the Canadian company's product
line.

FT  10 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Brave investors size up 'the next tiger' -
Vietnam could be the Asian opportunity of the 90s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE uncertain allure of Vietnam for foreign investors is aptly summarised in
the title of today's conference at the London headquarters of the
Confederation of British Industry: 'Vietnam - Asia's next tiger?'
There are plenty of reasons for that question mark, including the recent
suggestions by the Vietnamese army newspaper that 'imperialist and
reactionary circles' are bent on subverting the country and that foreign
investment could bring with it espionage and AIDS.
Even if potential investors were comforted by the subsequent reassurances of
the communist government's economic reformers, they could hardly fail to
notice that a hardline army was only one of a multitude of obstacles facing
those who seek to do business in Vietnam.
Bureaucracy, corruption and smuggling are widespread, and the legal system
rudimentary. After decades of war and mismanagement, transport and
communications networks are hopelessly inadequate. The more business-minded
southern half of the country, to which 80 per cent of foreign investment is
directed, has been plagued by electricity shortages.
Attempts to improve the infrastructure are severely curtailed by the US
embargo dating back to the Vietnam war. The US has blocked multilateral aid
from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
'If our economy is to take off we need a lot of co-operation with the
international financial institutions and foreign companies,' says Mr Le
Bang, a foreign ministry official. 'We need funds and know-how to take off.'
As in eastern Europe, even the most enthusiastic foreign investors are hard
pressed to find state enterprises which are worth buying; most are
unprofitable, over-manned and under-equipped.
Two of the three investment funds established by foreign financial
institutions have folded, and official figures showing foreign investment
approvals of more than Dollars 3bn in the last four years are less
impressive when one realises that less than half that amount has actually
been invested.
Even the expanding oil industry now faces unwelcome concerns about Chinese
claims to parts of the South China Sea also claimed by Vietnam and earmarked
for exploration.
And yet American businessmen - who can visit the country but not strike
deals - can barely hide their frustration at their government's embargo; the
Thais worry that a dynamic Vietnam of the future will tempt away their
investors and undercut their exports; and the few bold British entrepreneurs
working in Saigon, the southern capital officially called Ho Chi Minh City,
believe their compatriots are missing out on the great Asian opportunity of
the 1990s.
There are, in other words, as many reasons for optimism in Vietnam as for
pessimism.
Vietnam has a substantial domestic market of 67m inhabitants, most of them
hard-working and literate. It is not uncommon to see the poorest
tricycle-taxi drivers reading books or serious newspapers on the streets of
Saigon.
The lack of infrastructure represents opportunity as well as discomfort for
foreign investors. The American embargo is being eased, and could be lifted
after the US elections. A list of investment needs drawn up by the United
Nations and the Vietnam government identifies nearly Dollars 7bn of
projects.
Japan and Singapore have lucrative trade relations with Vietnam, while
Taiwanese and Hong Kong companies have won the lead in foreign investment,
taking stakes in everything from the construction of export processing zones
to mushroom-processing factories.
Giving a typical example of the potential for business in Vietnam, Mr
Raymond Eaton, an Australian who heads the trading company Export
Development Trading Corporation, told a seminar in Bangkok this month that
Vietnam's average per capita consumption of pharmaceuticals amounted to only
a dollar a year, a tenth of the average for the developing world.
Given political stability and access to funds, he said, there was virtually
no reason 'why Vietnam cannot ultimately achieve the same type of impressive
growth results as Thailand and other Asian 'miracle economies''.

'That must not happen,' Mr Iskandarov, the parliamentary chairman, told
reporters at celebrations marking the first anniversary of Tajikistan's
declaration of independence from the Soviet Union. 'I can state with
complete certainty that no one is raising that question. That is impossible.
Even if anyone wanted to do that, he would not be able to.'

The six Gulf Arab states and principal Arab allies Egypt and Syria began a
two-day meeting yesterday, but were expected to put aside controversial
Egyptian proposals for military co-operation, according to diplomats, Reuter
reports from Doha.
'The first priority of the Damascus Declaration (signed by the eight states
last year) is political co-operation,' Qatari foreign minister Sheikh Hamad
bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani, the conference chairman, said.
Egypt, however, is seeking a chain of rapid deployment forces that could
respond to a request from any of the eight states - Saudi Arabia, Bahrain,
Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Egypt and Syria.

The Chinese are recommending part of the estimated HKDollars 21bn (Pounds

FT  10 SEP 92 / Thailand to get offshore banking
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE THAI cabinet has approved the establishment of a Bangkok International
Banking Facility, which will allow foreign and local banks to set up
offshore banking units (OBUs) with the initial aim of channelling funds to
investments in the developing countries of Indochina.
It was one of the last decisions of the interim government of Mr Anand
Panyarachun, who has introduced numerous economic liberalisation measures
during his two terms as prime minister. A general election is being held on
Sunday.
The cabinet approved a plan permitting OBU licences and tax incentives for
an unlimited number of local and foreign banks with branches in Thailand,
and to as many as 20 foreign banks with no branches in the country.
Some Bank of Thailand officials regard the OBUs as a first step in an
ambitious project to make Thailand into a regional financial centre, but
others in Bangkok expect a slow start.
Dollars held by Thais overseas could probably be lured into the new system
but only if the Thai OBUs offer interest rate premiums over their
competitors, the bankers say. And on the lending side, Indochina is still
regarded as a very high-risk market.
Several international banks have expressed an interest in the project. Those
with branches in Thailand will divert business to their OBUs for tax
purposes, and banks not represented in the country are likely to see an OBU
licence as a chance to enter a restricted banking market. 'New banking
licences are like gold dust, especially in the developing world,' said one
banker yesterday.
Among the benefits of the OBU licence will be a corporate income tax rate of
10 per cent instead of the usual 30 per cent, a waiver of the 3.3 per cent
turnover tax, and a waiver of the 10 per cent withholding tax on interest
payments (although this last incentive does not apply to loans directed into
the Thai domestic market).
Detailed regulations are expected to be announced soon, and a joint
committee headed by the Bank of Thailand, the central bank, will screen
applications.
'This is basically to make Thailand more at par with other financial centres
where tax privileges are enjoyed,' Mr Pisit Leeahtam of the central bank
said yesterday.

THE foreign ministers of Vietnam and China gave assurances yesterday that
their dispute over the Spratly islands in the South China Sea would not
escalate into armed conflict, Reuter reports.
Nguyen Manh Cam, Vietnamese foreign minister, said in New Delhi that Vietnam
had repeated its demand that China stop prospecting for oil in what it
called Vietnamese territorial waters. The area for which China has signed a
drilling contract with a US company was on the continental shelf of Vietnam,
and Hanoi has asked China to cancel the contract, Mr Cam said.
But he added: 'We decided at our summit meeting that relations would not
come back to the period of the past 10 years.' Vietnam and China fought a
border war in 1979 and their navies clashed briefly over the Spratly Islands
in 1988.
In Bangkok, Qian Qichen, Chinese foreign minister, said the dispute would
not affect normalisation of ties between the two communist neighbours. 'In
our view, once the issue comes to peaceful negotiations, it is not difficult
to reach agreement, or at least it will not lead to confrontation,' Qian
said.
Cam said Vietnam had proposed that the dispute be resolved through a
regional effort by the six countries which have a total or partial claim on
the Spratlys - China, Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan.
China's industrial production jumped 19 per cent in the first eight months
of 1992 compared with the same period last year, the Xinhua news agency
reported yesterday, AP-DJ reports from Beijing.
The State Statistical Bureau said that heavy industry output climbed 21.3
per cent from January to August and light industry 16.3 per cent to push
total industrial production to 1,792bn yuan (Pounds 165bn).

President FW de Klerk yesterday called for an urgent meeting with Mr Nelson
Mandela, the African National Congress (ANC) president, to deal with the
violence which he said was blocking resumption of constitutional talks,
reports Patti Waldmeir.
Mr de Klerk said his government would not resume the talks until agreement
had been reached on how to tackle the violence, and on the ANC's campaign of
mass protest which he said was exacerbating unrest.
He was responding to Monday's shooting of at least 23 people in the Ciskei
black homeland during an ANC march.
His threat to suspend constitutional talks appeared largely empty, as the
ANC had already halted such talks over an earlier massacre.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Federalism also divides S Africa: Debate over the future
form of government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS MARCHERS of the African National Congress (ANC) lay dying in the dust on
Monday after a protest aimed at forcing the South African government to
abolish the Ciskei black homeland, government experts in Pretoria were
unveiling plans to do just that: to merge Ciskei and the nine other black
homelands into a federal South Africa.
President F W de Klerk was addressing a conference of pro-government parties
on the subject of federalism: what Mrs Helen Suzman, the veteran
anti-apartheid campaigner, calls the 'f' word.
She has captured the vehemence of the debate over whether South Africa -
surely one of the most ethnically, racially, culturally and linguistically
divided nations on earth - can best be governed as a federal or a unitary
state.
There is no more difficult issue in South African politics; and when
negotiations eventually resume on a new constitution, this debate will be
the toughest to resolve, for it goes to the very heart of how political
power will be shared in the new South Africa.
Federalism might seem an obvious solution for the problem of diversity and
conflict. As Oxford political scientist R W Johnson points out, writing in
yesterday's Johannesburg Star newspaper, 'nowhere else in the world has the
democratic government of so large and various a population even been
attempted without resort to federalism'.
Unfortunately for those who favour a federal solution in South Africa - the
government, the powerful Inkatha Freedom party, and the liberal Democratic
party - the very concept has been discredited by decades of apartheid, which
was itself a demented version of federalism. For the guiding principle of
apartheid was that each of South Africa's peoples - white, coloured, Indian,
Zulu, Xhosa, Sotho, Swazi, etc - should be granted the right of
self-determination in their own nation state.
Accordingly, 10 black tribal states were created (now known as homelands).
Each was to have gained independence (four did accept independence, while
the other six are known as 'self-governing' states), as part of a
confederation of regional states including white South Africa.
Given that background, it is scarcely surprising that the ANC views the
government's plans for a federal South Africa as a renewed attempt to
'divide and rule'. And in a sense, it is right.
The government sees devolution of power to regional and local levels as the
best means of preventing domination by an omnipotent black government ruling
from Pretoria.
Independent constitutional experts argue that if ethnic and tribal
minorities feel they have no chance of ever winning power, they will have
little time for democracy. If they see a chance to exercise power at
regional level - with all the patronage and privileges that that implies -
they are less likely to revolt.
But the ANC is deeply suspicious of this argument. Its goal has always been
to create a colour-blind South Africa where tribal divisions are subsumed in
a single nationhood.
But the main complaint voiced by the ANC is not that the government would
use federalism to build anti-ANC regional power bases, but that it would be
used to preserve white privilege. 'The struggle was aimed at fighting white
privilege,' says Mr Zola Skweyiya, head of the ANC's constitutional team,
'but the National party's regional policy is designed to ensure white
privilege is preserved. What black government can accept that?'
The government counters that none of its proposed seven federal provinces
would have a white majority, so white domination of regional government
would be impossible (though it acknowledges that the Western Cape province
could be ruled by non-Africans, because whites and coloureds, the mixed race
people who share a language and culture with Afrikaners, would be in the
majority there).
But at the local level protecting whites is clearly one of Pretoria's aims.
The aim is that crucial issues such as education and health should be
handled at local authority level and, after decades of residential
segregation, these authorities will not become integrated overnight.
The ANC does not dismiss devolution out of hand. Indeed, it pays lip service
to the need for regional governments to bring democracy 'closer to the
people'. ANC constitutional experts say central government in South Africa
should have roughly the same powers as those in Germany. But they make clear
that the goal of their regional policy is developmental, not political. They
want to redistribute resources from richer regions to poorer ones, and
insist that central government must have the power to achieve this.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Iraq denies attacks in south
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IRAQ was quick to deny US reports yesterday that it was attacking villages
in the south of the country in defiance of UN Security Council resolutions
and warnings from President George Bush.
The Pentagon reported that there was sporadic shelling by Iraqi forces in
the marshes area north of Basra and several villages had been burned. Mr
Pete Williams, the Pentagon spokesman, said President Saddam Hussein had
more than 60,000 troops deployed south of the 32nd parallel, where the air
forces of the US, Britain and France have been policing an air exclusion
zone since August 27.
He added: 'The Iraqi military is continuing its counter insurgency campaign
in southern Iraq. They continue to make efforts to build a causeway through
the marshes.
'They're burning some villages and there continues to be sporadic shelling,'
he said.
President Bush has stressed repeatedly in the past few weeks that Iraq must
obey UN Resolutions to the letter and few senior officials in Washington
appear to doubt that he is prepared to sanction air strikes if Saddam
Hussein's defiance continues.
Perhaps with this in mind, Baghdad yesterday denied there was any shelling
and claimed that prime aim of the US reports was to combat the boredom of
its pilots operating the air exclusion zone.
Iraq also claimed that its deployment of armoured vehicles close to the Iran
border was to stop infiltration by subversives.
Similar reports of villages being burned in the south were made last week by
Tehran. Iraq said it had begun arming tribesmen in the south so that they
could protect themselves against Iranian marauders.
US pilots reported making regular radar contact with Iraqi aircraft close to
the exclusion zone but they have have not made any attempt to cross the 32nd
parallel.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Peres bullish on peace talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, concluded a three-day visit to
London yesterday full of optimism about closer ties with the European
Community and about the chances of progress in the Middle East peace talks.
He said Israel wanted to open a new chapter in relations with the EC
following the victory of the Labour-led coalition in the country's June
general election. Mr Peres was recently in the Soviet Union as part of a
broader Israeli programme aimed at repairing old friendships bruised by the
years of the previous Likud government and to begin new diplomatic contacts.
During talks with Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Douglas Hurd,
the foreign secretary, Mr Peres failed to win an immediate lifting of the
British arms sales embargo imposed in response to Israel's 1982 invasion of
Lebanon. But Britain had promised to review the embargo, said Mr Peres.
The Israeli foreign minister also expressed his hopes that the multilateral
Middle East talks dealing with issues such as water and economic
co-operation could be restructured so that all committees met at a single
venue.
He suggested the creation of a new bank for the region along the lines of
the Euro-pean Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
As for the bilateral peace talks, Mr Peres declared that the recent
negotiating session with Syria in Washington represented the best 10 days in
the history of the two countries.
However, Mr Peres would not commit Israel to eventual withdrawal from the
Golan Heights which it occupied in 1967 and said that the future for the
Palestinians should be expressed in confederation with Jordan.
Mr Major has promised that Britain will do all it can to speed up the peace
process, although there has been little evidence of European input during
the six rounds of negotiations since last October.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Labour plans a radical path for Israeli economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER two months in office, Israel's Labour-led coalition government has
this week set out its first broad policy initiative to tackle an economy
weighed down by the cost of immigration and the double-digit unemployment
the influx has fuelled.
A near Shk100bn (Pounds 21bn) budget for 1993 approved by ministers on
Tuesday represents a cautious but marked shift away from the policies of the
previous Likud-led coalition. Potentially much more radical is a package of
structural reforms that, if implemented, would considerably undermine the
big hold on the economy that the state has always exercised in Israel.
The spending plans slash overblown construction projects by more than half,
including the Likud's controversial Jewish settlement building in the
occupied territories. Instead, a Shk2bn schedule of infrastructural
investment in Israel 'proper' has been drawn up and room has been made for a
Shk800m tax cut. The budget deficit of Shk5.5bn, or 3.2 per cent of GDP, is
on track for eliminating the deficit by 1995.
Conspicuous by their absence from the budget proposals are the Dollars 10bn
in loan guarantees which Israel now expects to win from the US later this
year. These are meant to help finance immigration absorption. However, the
government's strategy is to keep borrowing backed by the loan guarantees out
of projects directly funded by the state. Instead the guarantees will be
used to finance private investment in the economy.
Mr Jacob Frenkel, governor of the Bank of Israel, said ministers should have
gone further on investment and tax relief by opting for bigger housing cuts
and cuts in the big defence and social service budgets. But the central bank
also praised the budget as a step towards generating private sector growth
that will eventually absorb Jewish immigration from the former Soviet Union.
This now stands at more than 350,000 and, despite a sharp fall in influx
rates this year, officials have estimated a further 120,000 may arrive in
1993.
Latest figures suggest the economy is picking up after a dismal performance
last year when per capita growth was negligible despite a construction boom.
Exports look set to grow by 10 per cent in 1992. Inflation for the year is
set to be at its lowest for more than a decade at about 10 per cent. But
such is the burden of immigration that the government says unemployment will
drop by less than half a percentage point next year to 10.7 per cent of the
workforce.
To help achieve faster growth, the government has adopted reform proposals
that range from accelerating privatisation, through import liberalisation
and capital market reforms to cutting the state's monopoly in areas such as
land sales and telecommunications.
Many of these measures have been on the books for several years and may yet
not see the light of day. But the government insists that it is serious.
But a bigger test lies in those areas which cut across the influence of the
Histadrut trade union federation to which the Labour party is closely
allied. Already the two are grappling over the heavily state-subsidised
Kupat Holim health insurance system to which most Israelis belong and which
is run by the Histadrut.
Many economists - and probably most Kupat Holim members - argue that it
should be removed from Histadrut control and integrated into a reformed
national health system incorporating state-provided and private medical
services. The government has so far not committed itself to this.
The government has said it will end a system of providing high-interest
state bonds for the Histadrut pension funds - which are also in deep
financial difficulties. But it has hedged this by saying it will replace the
system with direct state subsidies. Proposals to break the Histadrut's
public transport monopolies did not appear in the government's reform
package - not surprising, as the transport minister was until earlier this
year the Histadrut secretary general.
Israeli governments have to date delivered much less structural reform than
they have promised. The new government has set itself a formidable target by
promising more than any other before it.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Rafsanjani China visit raises N-arms fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran arrived in Beijing yesterday
accompanied by his defence minister, amid western speculation that the three
days of talks will include discussions on nuclear weapons co-operation.
The Iranian defence minister, Mr Akbar Torkan, will meet his Chinese
counterpart, Qin Jiwei, today, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said.
The US has been concerned for some time about long-term Iranian plans to
develop nuclear weapons with Chinese help. US officials believe China has
supplied equipment to the Iranians which could make enriched uranium for
nuclear weapons.
China dismisses the US fears and claims the mini-reactor and nuclear
technology it has supplied to Iran are for peaceful purposes only. Iran also
rejects US charges.
In July Beijing said it had started negotiations with Iran, Egypt and
Bangladesh to export Chinese-made 300MW nuclear power stations.
Mr Rafsanjani's visit returns one made by Chinese President Yang Shangkun to
Iran and Pakistan last October, a trip dogged by controversy over China's
arms sales to both Islamic countries.
President Yang's visit pointed to the emergence of an embryonic alliance
between Pakistan, Iran and China. All three have a common concern over the
domination of the post-cold war world by the US, and particularly its
expanding presence in the Middle East following the Gulf War.
Persistent speculation points to substantial Chinese assistance to
Pakistan's nuclear weapons programme. Beijing denies nuclear military help,
but it is building Pakistan a nuclear power plant.
Early this year China admitted that it had transferred M-11 tactical range
missiles to Pakistan.
Iran and China both have interests in the newly independent central Asian
republics and their Islamic revival movements.
Iran is jockeying with Turkey for spheres of influence in the region.
China's extensive border with the central Asian republics give it, too, a
substantial strategic interest. And the existence of its own Moslem
populations makes China wary of the spread of militant Islamic influences
from the former Soviet Union.
The issue of Chinese arms sales to the Middle East is of growing
international concern in the light of China's threat to withdraw
co-operation from UN Security Council disarmament talks following President
Bush's decision to free sales of US F-16 fighters to Taiwan.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Tsongas puts deficit in centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW GOWERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A HIGH-PROFILE campaign to place the federal budget deficit at the centre of
the US political agenda is being launched next Monday by an influential
cross-party group of politicians, led by defeated Democratic presidential
contender Mr Paul Tsongas.
This Concord Coalition will be unveiled in New York by Mr Tsongas and
Republican Senator Warren Rudman, both of whom have made a demand for
candour over US economic problems a central plank of their political
platforms.
By working on public disaffection, it aims to force President George Bush
and Governor Bill Clinton, his Democratic challenger, to focus during the
election campaign on the deficit, on welfare entitlements and on strategies
to encourage investment. It also intends to keep trying to mobilise support
and pressing the successful candidate on the same issues after the poll in
November.
'This is an attempt to bring together those people who believe that more of
the same isn't going to work,' Mr Tsongas, a former senator from
Massachusetts, said in an interview in London with the Financial Times. 'We
think there will be a role for us whoever's president; and whoever's
president is going to find us very irritating.'
The Concord Coalition (after Concord, Massachusetts, where the first shot
was fired in the US War of Independence), also includes Mr Peter Peterson, a
Republican and former commerce secretary, and Mr Lloyd Cutler, the
Washington lawyer who was President Jimmy Carter's White House counsel.
It will not advance specific policy proposals at first. Instead, it will
concentrate on carrying forward the baleful campaign message which won Mr
Tsongas sizeable support during the presidential primaries this year,
underlining the need for Americans to make painful sacrifices so as to
return the US to economic health.
In addition to the progressive elimination of budget deficits, which he says
are sapping the US economy and international strength, Mr Tsongas favours
imposing a cap on welfare entitlements and favours increased investment in
infrastructure and in education.
He is targeting the educated young, worried business people, and the
sometime constituents of Mr Ross Perot, the Texas entrepreneur and
quasi-candidate who attracted brief but large support last spring on vague
promises to cut the deficit and combat the political establishment.
Mr Tsongas's support for Mr Clinton is lukewarm; he is critical of the
Democratic candidate's proposals for a tax cut for the middle classes, for
example. However, what he says about his own party's candidate pales by
comparison with his withering condemnation of Mr Bush since the latter's
acceptance speech at the Republican party convention in Houston.
This, Mr Tsongas said yesterday, was devoid of substance. 'Bill Clinton will
win because there is no rationale for four more years (of Mr Bush).'

FT  10 SEP 92 / The French Referendum: Oui campaign is one of them and us
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE campaign for a Yes vote in France's referendum on European monetary and
political union has brought together some odd allies, stretching across both
sides of a normally warring political establishment.
To optimists in the pro-Maastricht camp, their campaign shows a healthy
diversity. To the pessimists, the Yes campaign is nearly as fragmented as
the anti-treaty alliance, and is in danger of losing credibility by offering
different audiences conflicting reasons for voting Yes on September 20.
On the one hand, there is the mainstream of the Socialist party, which is
taking up President Francois Mitterrand's theme that the treaty will protect
the weak against the costs and dangers of European development.
On the other, there are the Yes campaigners in the divided RPR and UDF
right-wing opposition parties, which portray an economically liberal
post-Maastricht Europe, likely to alarm working class Socialist voters.
Also in the Yes army are most of France's leading industrialists; a
300-strong committee of artists - many heavily subsidised by the state  -
intellectuals, sports personalities and assorted celebrities; and the
Catholic bishops' conference.
Mr Andre Billardon, the Socialist party's Maastricht campaign manager, and
vice-president of the National Assembly, believes that the Yes camp's
diversity could be an advantage. Accordingly, the Socialists, Gaullists and
UDF have agreed to campaign separately to give them maximum freedom to
appeal to their individual electorates' concerns, he explains.
'Maastricht is only a judicial framework, so we each have different
explanations of the European policies our political parties will follow
after the treaty is ratified,' says Mr Billardon.
The Socialists have brought their full campaign machinery to play, as if it
were a national political election - a FFr13m (Pounds 1.36m) budget and
15-hour working days for Mr Billardon and his colleagues. The party is
campaigning separately from the government, though it naturally devotes the
free television and radio time it and other parties are allowed in the final
two weeks to Socialist ministers.
Mr Billardon's main campaign worry is not that the Yes campaign might appear
incoherent, but that it might not get through at all. Some polls indicate
that the public has been taking very little notice of the deluge of
propaganda put out by political leaders in both camps over the past month,
he says. 'Things have improved since Mr Mitterrand made his television
appearance . . . that at least made people better informed. But I don't
think Mr Chirac is much followed by voters or even his own followers. Local
politicians have also kept very quiet,' he complains.
So just who do the Yes campaigners think they have to convince? Mr Billardon
believes the Yes vote is strongest among the young and retired people and
weakest among the 30 to 55 age group. 'It is the economically active who
feel they have something to lose.'
By class, he sees solid support for Maastricht among intellectuals,
executives and in the public administration. Opposition is chiefly among the
working class, hit by high unemployment, and farmers, suffering from
European Community price cuts agreed by their government and its EC partners
in the summer. These are the people the Yes campaign team needs to convince
over the next 10 days. 'We need to appeal more to average citizens, to calm
their fears,' says Mr Billardon.
It will be a hard job because farmers tend to be loyal to the right-wing,
where the anti-Maastricht lobby is strong, while the Socialist government's
rigorous economic policies have lost it votes among the working class.
Mr Billardon has no illusions that the final result on Sunday week will be a
close run thing. Personally, he puts his money on a Yes majority of a mere
52 per cent.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Private investors wary of former Soviet republics
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRIVATE investment in the republics of the former Soviet Union is likely to
remain slow for some time, according to the International Finance
Corporation (IFC), the World Bank arm that specialises in private sector
financing.
Sir William Ryrie, IFC executive vice-president, said yesterday that private
sector money had begun to flow into countries such as Czechoslovakia and
Hungary in eastern Europe, but that investment in the former Soviet Union
was likely to take longer to pick up.
'It's going to take a little while before private investors are going to
commit serious money,' he warned.
The IFC last year won agreement from its members for a Dollars 1bn capital
increase over the next five years to help it expand its activities in
eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics. The latter, however, have
not yet completed the membership process, and the IFC's role has so far been
limited mostly to advice and technical assistance.
'What we are looking for is opportunities to do something which will really
be catalytic,' Sir William said, citing the successful privatisation of more
than 2,000 shops and small businesses in Nizhny-Novgorod as a good example.
Building on this experience, the IFC is now undertaking the privatisation of
the entire trucking business in the Nizhny-Novgorod province, and has
written a manual on small-scale privatisation to be used elsewhere in
Russia.
Overall, the IFC boosted its financing of private sector projects in the
developing world by 15 per cent last year to Dollars 1.77bn (Pounds 880m)
and Sir William said he expected to maintain this rate of growth - somewhat
faster than projected at the time the Dollars 1bn capital increase was
agreed - over the next few years.
By attracting co-financing from other investors and lenders, the IFC was
able to help raise nearly Dollars 6 for every Dollars 1 it invested in the
167 projects it took part in during the financial year ending June 30.
Sir William said his group had managed to maintain profitability, despite
problems with its Dollars 408m of investment in the former Yugoslavia and
some deterioration in its African portfolio.
Net profits climbed by 9 per cent to Dollars 180.2m, but the IFC had to
boost its reserves against loss substantially, making a new provision of
Dollars 101m and writing off Dollars 26.8m of investments.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TOP US chief executives are markedly less confident about the economic
outlook than they were three months ago, the Conference Board, a business
analysis group, said yesterday.
The board's index of business confidence fell from 70 to 62 between the
second and third quarters.
The index is based on a survey of chief executives at leading companies.
The drop in business confidence follows a series of disappointing economic
reports which culminated last Friday in a surprise announcement of a steep
fall in employment in August.
The deteriorating sentiment in boardrooms is another blow for President
George Bush, because it suggests that the US economy is unlikely to show
visible signs of recovery before the presidential and Congressional
elections, come November.
The fall in the board's index reversed an increase between the first and
second quarters. The proportion of respondents saying conditions had
improved in recent months dropped to 48 per cent, compared with 80 per cent
in the second quarter.
Chief executives in insurance, the retail and wholesale trades, and in heavy
manufacturing, were among the least upbeat.
Top business people, however, are still markedly more confident than at the
trough of the 1990-91 recession, when the board's index hit a low of 33. A
reading above 50 indicates that optimsts have outnumbered pessimists.
The erosion of boardroom sentiment has begun to close a surprising gap
between business and household confidence.
Consumer confidence has been hovering near record lows for much of the past
two years, in part because of worries about job security.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush may be narrowing Governor Bill Clinton's lead in the
national opinion polls, but still appears in trouble with suburban voters in
the big US states which will determine the presidential election in
November.
The Washington Post/ABC poll, run on September 2-6 and published yesterday,
has Mr Clinton ahead by 53:38 per cent among registered voters and by 53:41
per cent among those most likely to vote. This compares with 55:36 and 56:36
respectively in the previous survey, a week before.
The national polls have been very volatile for two months. They now give Mr
Clinton, the Democratic candidate, a lead of anything from five to 15 points
and the acknowledged softness of Mr Clinton's support gives the Bush
campaign hope, even though there is little evidence that the president is
winning greater respect or confidence.
However, at the local level in the nine biggest states, where 257 of the 270
electoral college votes needed for victory are at stake, the trends - as
shown by polls, interviews with 'focus groups' and much media reporting -
are still against Mr Bush.
California and New York, the two biggest states, are now almost universally
considered certainties for Mr Clinton. Texas, the next largest, is reckoned
a toss-up in the latest Dallas Morning News poll. Most pundits still prefer
Mr Bush in his adopted home state but Mr Ross Perot, the local billionaire,
is on the ballot and may draw votes from the president.
Mr Bush was also favoured in Florida, the fourth largest, but calculations
there are difficult after Hurricane Andrew.
The rust-belt swathe - Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and New Jersey
 -is seen by both camps as critical. In their suburbs and working-class
districts lives the bloc, known as Reagan Democrats, that has voted
Republican in the last three elections.
This week, both the Washington Post and Time magazine carried extensive
reports from representative suburban counties in the critical states. Time,
which also covered counties in the important swing states of Georgia and
Missouri, revealed only one of five (Montgomery County in Ohio) where Mr
Bush was level with Mr Clinton.
The litany of complaints from the suburbs was about the local economies, the
lack of opportunity for the rising generation, falling property values and
sharp disagreement with the Republican party's definition of family values.
The net result, according to the Post's conversations with about 2,800
registered voters, is that only about one Democrat in ten would vote for Mr
Bush, while Mr Clinton could get the support of one Republican in six.
Of the Democrats who voted for Mr Bush four years ago, 58 per cent now say
they will support their party candidate, against 32 per cent for Mr Bush and
10 per cent undecided.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Brazilian privatisations 'still on schedule' despite
political crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL'S head of privatisation said this week that the denationalising of
state industries was on schedule, despite the political crisis around
President Fernando Collor.
Mr Eduardo Modiano, president of the national development bank, BNDES, said
in an interview that the programme was not being accelerated, or slowed by
the crisis. By end-November, auctions for three more government fertiliser
companies were due.
Meanwhile, in early October, evaluations should be received for the
remaining state-controlled steel companies, most of the petrochemicals
sector and the aerospace company, Embraer. Auctions for these were due
before the end of next March, although agreement by banks and debenture
holders of Embraer had to be secured for a recapitalisation.
Mr Modiano declined to be drawn on prospects for privatisation if the
president leaves office. Vice-President Itamar Franco is thought less
sympathetic to rapid privatisation.
The BNDES chief said he believed that, so far, the crisis had not affected
prices paid for the 15 companies privatised so far - Dollars 3.4bn, most of
it in various forms of government debt - but conceded conditions were far
from ideal to maximise prices.
'We have no foreign capital coming in, slow economic activity, inflation of
20 per cent a month and nobody has any cruzeiros because of tight monetary
policy,' he said. 'If any of these conditions had been different, prices
would be different, but that doesn't mean we should wait.' Delays would mean
the government would be incurring growing losses.
He defended the decision to accept debt from state entities, much of which
is not being serviced, as payment for privatised companies. He argued that,
if payment in the government's short-term debt were accepted, this would
reduce pressure on Congress to pass essential fiscal reform.
BNDES has proposed changes which would mean that 10 per cent of the payment
for privatised companies would be in cash, to be directed to a social fund.
That move, however, would require Congressional approval, Congress having
stipulated that proceeds from privatisation must be used to pay off debt.
The use of domestic debt has been highly controvesial. Brazilian newspapers
yesterday said businessmen who met Mr Franco on Tuesday had reported the
vice-president saying he favoured privatisations only for cash.

OPPOSITION parties in Brazil are demanding that all government expenses be
subject to Congressional authorisation until after the vote on impeachment
of President Fernando Collor, to prevent any attempts at vote buying.
The timetable for impeachment has set the vote for the last week of this
month.
The opposition claims that Mr Collor's political advisers are using
government money to fund projects so as to solicit the votes of the 168
Congress members needed to fend off the impeachment initiative.
The financial markets have reacted enthusiastically to the timetable, which
they hope will mean an early end to the crisis. The main Sao Paulo stock
exchange index rose 3.5 per cent early yesterday, after a 7.5 per cent rise
on Tuesday.

<TEXT>
DOUBTS about the future of Maastricht need not delay the talks to enable
Sweden, Finland and Austria to join the European Community in 1995, Mr John
Major said yesterday.
At a private meeting with MEPs from the European People's Party (a grouping
which includes Christian Democrats and Conservatives in the European
parliament) in London, the British prime minister emphasised his hope that
some of the informal negotiations for their entry could take place during
the UK presidency.
In the summer, ministers agreed at the Lisbon summit that formal
negotiations should not begin until after Maastricht had been ratified.
However, Mr Major insisted yesterday that talks could be started on the
assumption that the agreement on European union would be approved by all 12
member states.
According to the UK's preferred timetable, the negotiating mandates would be
agreed at December's Edinburgh summit, with the negotiations taking place in
1993, and the countries' entry to the Community being ratified in 1994.
Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, also told the MEPs that in looking
forward to a Community of some 20 members, it seemed unlikely that
Maastricht would be the final stage of institutional change. Both Mr Major
and Mr Hurd highlighted the importance they attached to the forthcoming
report from Brussels to clarify the term 'subsidiarity'.
Support for a Yes vote slid to a bare 51 per cent in the latest opinion poll
carried out by the CSA institute between September 8 and 9, writes Robert
Mauthner in Paris. This represents a fall of 1 percentage point since the
last poll conducted by the same organisation a day before. Those intending
to abstain or to submit blank voting papers still make up 29 per cent of the
electorate, though this represents a fall of 4 points since the last survey.

<TEXT>
The Former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing who is the leader of the
centre-right UDF party.
MR Giscard d'Estaing is the government's main hope for roping in
pro-Maastricht votes from supporters of the right-wing opposition.
His party is also divided over Maastricht, though less so than the
Gaullists. However, Mr Giscard d'Estaing, 65, a veteran in European
Community politics, has never hidden his pro-treaty views and is accepted as
the most authoritative French protagonist of the treaty outside the
government.
He has done more than anybody in the Yes camp to try to soothe the fears of
Maastricht opponents that the treaty offers the European Commission an open
ended opportunity to legislate on matters of purely national interest. He
has proposed that EC member states should, after the ratification of the
treaty, draw up a list of where the Community can and cannot intervene, so
as to settle the argument over subsidiarity.
His critics suggest that this idea looks very like a renegotiation, even
though Mr Giscard d'Estaing has stressed that it is not politically feasible
to rewrite the Maastricht plan.
He is ill at ease campaigning alongside Mr Chirac since they are the main
rivals for the opposition's future presidential candidacy.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Chirac, the president of the neo-Gaullist RPR party, who is
hoping to succeed President Mitterrand
SEEN as a weak link in the Yes camp, Mr Chirac, 59, initially refused to
commit himself either way on European union, inhibited by the deep divisions
in his party.
Faced with the knowledge that the RPR would split over Europe whatever he
did, this former prime minister eventually climbed off the fence in July and
said he would vote in favour of European union, but leave the party rank and
file free to go their own way.
The result has been a surreal RPR television campaign, in which the party
has divided its air time equally between arguments for and against European
union.
He is campaigning on the theme that France will be stronger in a
post-Maastricht Europe than it is now.
He also argues that General de Gaulle would have believed the same.
'There is no serious alternative to the unity of nations. Maastricht is the
continuation of an action desired by General de Gaulle,' he told his opening
campaign rally earlier this week.
Socialists, however, suspect that the Gaullist idea of a Europe of loosely
co-operating sovereign states and the pooling of sovereignty proposed in the
treaty are incompatible.

Mr Jack Lang, minister for education and culture and organiser of the
government's yes campaign
THE modish Mr Jack Lang, 53, star guest of a thousand Parisian dinner
parties, has been given the task of bringing the arid details of the treaty
alive to the public.
His campaign style has been controversial and Yes campaigners on the
right-wing have criticised him for not doing enough to bring heavyweight
businessmen, economists and trade unionists into the centre stage.
Mr Lang's main coup so far has been to conjure up a Comite National pour le
Oui of 300 assorted celebrities. They include eight Nobel prize winners -
none economists - Yves Saint Laurent, the fashion designer, the chef Paul
Bocuse and Johnny Hallyday, the pop star.
In fact, the committee is a good mixture of stars and intellectuals, but it
has received sometimes sarcastic treatment in the French press, perhaps
because of Mr Lang's own image as the embodiment of fashionable bourgeois
Socialism, or la gauche caviar. He has added to his reputation for a
weakness for gimmicks by distributing postcards proclaiming that Napoleon
would have voted for Maastricht, and planning a pop concert to rally Yes
voters two days before the referendum.

<TEXT>
THE United Nations last night signalled a tougher line to safeguard the
lives of peacekeeping troops in Bosnia-Hercegovina, amid growing outrage at
the killing of two French officers in a relief convoy ambush at Sarajevo on
Tuesday.
Responding to calls for troops to return fire if attacked, the Security
Council said there was urgent need for 'reinforcing the security and
protection' of UN personnel in Bosnia. Members nations were ready 'to adopt
without delay measures to this end.'
The Council condemned the relief convoy attack, which the UN peacekeeping
force blamed squarely on the largely Moslem forces of the Bosnian
government. The UN force also accused Moslem fighters of carrying out three
other recent attacks on peacekeepers.
Reflecting growing frustration and anger in the UN force, its commander
called on Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic to dispense 'immediate and
salutary justice' to those responsible for the killing of the French
officers.
The UN also confirmed that an Italian relief plane that crashed near
Sarajevo last week was shot down. The aircraft, whose crew of four died, was
flying over an area controlled by Croats, but the UN did not say who was to
blame.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, Britain's defence secretary, said UK troops about to go
to Bosnia-Hercegovina should be allowed to return fire.
He condemned as 'repulsive' Tuesday's machine gun and mortar attack on the
UN relief convoy near Sarajevo airport. Although two French peacekeepers
were killed and three wounded, the UN troops did not fire back at the forces
ambushing it.
Mr Rifkind said, however, it was a 'crucial requirement' for any soldier to
be able to defend himself.
Mr Rifkind's remarks reflect growing calls from the countries contributing
to the 16,000-strong Yugoslav peacekeeping force for their lightly armed
troops to use force if attacked.
The French government earlier yesterday implicitly accused Bosnian Moslem
forces of being responsible for the death of the soldiers.
Until now, the UN and members of the peacekeeping force have been reluctant
to single out Serbs, Moslems or Croats for blame in Bosnia.
Condemning the attack, Mr Roland Dumas, the French foreign minister, said it
underlined the urgent need to find an answer to the UN peacekeepers'
security problems.
Philip Stephens adds: The UK cabinet is today expected to give the formal
go-ahead for despatch of up to 1,800 British troops to Bosnia. Whitehall
officials said the troops, on stand-by in Germany, could be sent as early as
next week.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD, the US car maker, is considering setting up its first automotive
components joint venture in Poland.
It is negotiating the setting up of a plant near Warsaw to make seat covers
for use in its west European car assembly plants. If agreed, the project is
expected to involve an investment of about Dollars 50m (Pounds 25.1m).
Ford made its first move into component manufacturing in east Europe in
1990, with an Dollars 80m investment in Hungary for a plant to produce
ignition coils and fuel pumps. This plant, which began production earlier
this year, also supplies Ford vehicle assembly plants in western Europe.
The negotiations in Poland are part of a wider study undertaken by Ford of
Europe into the restructuring of its seat manufacturing operations. It is
considering contracting out seat assembly to an outside supplier to replace
its present in-house operations.
A decision is expected before the end of the year.
If Ford opts for an outside supplier, it is expected that the seat-making
operations would still be located close to the existing vehicle plants to
ensure quick delivery.
In the UK a move to out-source seat making would affect 220 jobs at Ford's
Dagenham plant and 270 at Halewood.
Honda of Japan is to build a plant in Belgium to supply aluminium intake
manifolds to its engine and car assembly plant in the UK.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Austria told to cut car plant grants: Chrysler in subsidies
dispute
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission has given Austria three weeks to cut state subsidies
to a Chrysler plant near Graz or face duties of 10 per cent on minivan
imports into the EC.
Commissioners will call for the imposition of duties after September 30 if
they are still unhappy with the Austrian stance. A final decision would be
taken by EC member states.
The issue is highly sensitive for Austria, but Commission officials say it
is in the government's own interests to co-operate. 'Since they have applied
to join the EC they must accept that sooner or later they will have to fall
in line with Community rules,' said a Brussels trade official yesterday.
Vienna has offered to cut subsidies from 33 per cent to less than 20 per
cent of the Sch4.2bn (Pounds 213m) cost of the factory.
But the Commission would like the level of state aid brought down to 8 per
cent, in line with rules on state aid applied to the wealthiest EC
countries. That would involve the US car-maker reimbursing some of the
Sch693m of subsidies which have already been paid. Austrian trade officials
said yesterday such a solution would be unacceptable.
They pointed out, however, that, if subsidies for the final phases of the
factory were blocked, the overall level of state aid for the project would
fall to about 16 per cent. Austrian experts will start talks with the
Commission today.
The Graz factory is a joint venture between Chrysler and Steyr Puch, which
will manufacture 13,000 Voyager family vans this year. Most will be exported
to the EC to compete with the Espace van made by Renault and Matra.
The 1972 free trade agreement between Austria and the EC outlaws subsidies
which distort competition in the Community.
This would be the first and probably the last time that duties would be
imposed under the agreement. It will be replaced at the end of the year by
the European Economic Area (EEA) - a free-trade zone between the EC and the
European Free Trade Association.
The EEA agreement includes similar safeguard clauses, but Austrian and EC
officials said yesterday it was unclear whether the existing duties would
have to be renegotiated at the end of the year.
The level of duty suggested is the same as that imposed on Voyager vans
imported direct from the US.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Polish prime minister, Ms Hanna Suchocka, yesterday unveiled plans to
involve the trade unions and workers in a new social pact aimed at
restructuring and privatising state enterprises.
The initiative follows industrial unrest in the coal and copper mines in
August and a continuing stoppage at the FSM car plant in southern Poland.
The strikes, which were partly fomented by inter-union rivalries,
highlighted labour disenchantment with falling real incomes and uncertainty
about the future of their industries.
The FSM strike, now in its sixth week, has stopped production of the new
Fiat Cinquecento model, delayed the company's takeover by Fiat and damaged
Poland's image among foreign investors.
The pact signals a new approach by the government towards state industries
which have been left to fend for themselves. This has led to rising
indebtedness and a sharp drop in output and investment.
The new policies will ease central wage controls and link wages more closely
to profits and productivity. Workers and management will be given three
months to choose their own privatisation plans from five alternative models.
These range from selling the enterprise to a foreign investor to
privatisation by worker or management buyout.
The main responsibility for implementing the pact lies with Mr Jacek Kuron,
the labour minister and former Solidarity activist.

<TEXT>
THE Irish government is to reorganise its Industrial Development Authority
(IDA) - which spends about IPounds 120m (Pounds 114m) a year in grants and
subsidies to overseas and local manufacturing companies - to give more
emphasis to the development of Irish industry.
Mr Des O'Malley, industry and commerce minister, said this week the
reorganisation followed criticisms in an industrial policy review published
earlier this year that Ireland had become over-dependent on foreign-owned
enterprises in developing its industrial base.
'The balance needs to be redressed to achieve greater output and employment
growth in the indigenous sector. Existing policies and promotional
arrangements have not succeeded in doing this,' he said.
He announced the IDA was to be merged with two manpower training agencies -
FAS and EOLAS - and would then be split into two divisions, one promoting
overseas investment and the other promoting local industry.
Each would have its own boards and management, budgets and performance
targets.
The intention was to develop 'a clear and separate focus of policies and
organisational effort on the promotion of both indigenous industry and
inward investment'.
Mr O'Malley also emphasised the need to adopt other recommendations made
under the policy review, which included sweeping tax reform, increased
emphasis on vocational training, and more investment in transport
infrastructure. The recommendations have yet to be considered by the
government.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Markets keep sharp eye on Bundesbank: Sweden's interest rate
increase draws currency dealers from D-Marks to krona

DOUBTS about the durability of the Bundesbank's weekend commitment not to
raise German interest rates sent further nervous ripples through the foreign
exchanges yesterday.
The Bank of Sweden's decision to raise its marginal interest rate to 75 per
cent forced currency dealers to sell D-Marks and buy krona.
The effective devaluation of the Finnish markka on Tuesday had sent hot
money, or mobile capital, out of Scandinavian currencies and into the D-Mark
and Swiss franc. But the Swedish authorities remain committed to the policy
of pegging the krona to the Ecu- a crucial part of Sweden's preparations to
join the EC later in the decade.
Sweden's high short-term interest rates will help to ensure short-term
currency operators get a good return for holding the Swedish currency.
The move had a strong impact on foreign exchange trading inside the European
Monetary System. The D-Mark, which rose strongly on Tuesday against all
currencies, eased yesterday morning as the moves were announced.
However, the weakening of the D-Mark proved to be temporary, and was checked
by two other factors:
Sweden's overnight rate of 75 per cent will attract short-term speculators,
but longer-dated money rates are still at levels that dealers consider too
low. The cost of borrowing krona for 6 months, for example, is 15 1/2 per
cent. 'This is not enough to offset fears that Sweden will devalue,' said Mr
Jim O'Neill, head of research at Swiss Banking Corporation in London;
There is lingering uncertainty over the German Bundesbank's policy on
interest rates.
At the meeting of EC finance ministers in Bath at the weekend, Mr Helmut
Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, said there would be no rise in
Germany's Lombard rate 'in current circumstances'.
This remark led Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, to claim this was the
first time the Bundesbank had committed itself publicly not to increase
rates, and that this was 'a significant outcome' of the talks.
However, German economists said yesterday that Mr Schlesinger's comments
simply repeated remarks the Bundesbank president had already made after the
meeting of the central bank's policy-making council last Thursday.
Mr Schlesinger this week himself played down the impression that he bowed to
foreign criticism about the Bundesbank's high interest rate policies,
'There was really nothing new in what Mr Schlesinger said in Bath,' said Mr
Thomas Mayer of Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt yesterday.
Foreign exchange dealers were also dismayed by the Bundesbank's decision to
drain a massive DM17bn (Pounds 6bn) from the German money market, a move
which pushed call money rates up to 9.7 per cent, narrowly below the Lombard
rate level of 9.75 per cent.
The markets get nervous whenever German call money rates rise near to the
Lombard rate level. The Bundesbank's policy is to raise the Lombard rate if
call money rates rise above it - otherwise banks are tempted to borrow money
through this emergency window and sell it at a premium.
The Bundesbank is also under pressure to tighten liquidity in the German
money market to get monetary growth back in line with its annual target of
3.5-5.5 per cent.
Attempts to meet the target are being undermined by recent interventions to
support sterling and the lira on the foreign currency markets, which have
pushed more D-Marks into the financial system.
Sweden's dramatic rate rise and the Bundesbank's unwillingness to cut rates
may put even more pressure on the UK in the next few days.
Mr Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at Bank of America in London,
said: 'The currency markets have been given another example of a struggling
European country which is prepared to raise interest rates whatever the cost
to the domestic economy. They are now asking themselves whether Britain is
prepared to do the same.'

FT  10 SEP 92 / EC to propose common air pacts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission will next month launch proposals for the European
Community to negotiate as a bloc the civil aviation agreements which each of
the 12 member states now arranges bilaterally with non-EC countries.
The plan has acquired urgency in the light of last week's bilateral 'open
skies' agreement between the Netherlands and the US, which senior Commission
officials believe could distort the EC's own air transport liberalisation
programme and complicate restructuring of the depressed airline industry.
The idea of a common aviation policy was mooted over a year ago by Mr Karel
Van Miert, the EC transport commissioner, and floated by transport ministers
of the 12 in July.
The EC finalised most of its own 'open skies' programme in June. As part of
the single market that starts next year this will liberalise air fares and
open up routes across Europe hitherto dominated by national flag carriers.
Mr Van Miert said yesterday he could 'not criticise the Netherlands for
getting the maximum advantage out of the existing situation', enabling KLM,
the Dutch flag carrier, to obtain virtually unrestricted access into the US
market. But he warned that the US was trying to divide and rule EC aviation,
and the question was whether this would lead to 'discrimination between
ourselves in our own market'.
The commissioner also suggested the US was considering whether it would be
better to negotiate certain agreements with the EC as a whole, particularly
as airlines in Europe will be forced by increased competition to merge and
regroup on a European scale.
KLM, for example, is still thought likely to seek a European partner, so it
could be a much strengthened company to which the US has opened its market.
Mr Van Miert added that he did 'not think Community carriers are going to
get cabotage rights in the US unless we unite our efforts'. Cabotage is the
right to ply another country's internal routes, when the flight does not
originate outside that country.
He stressed, however, that the Commission would not propose that it
negotiate all external aviation accords, much less renegotiate all bilateral
agreements between EC member states and third countries, of which there are
nearly 800.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Minister over markka's float
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Iiro Viinanen, Finnish finance minister, confirmed yesterday it would be
'a matter of months' before Finland could revert to a fixed exchange rate,
after having floated the markka on Tuesday, writes Robert Taylor in
Stockholm.
Mr Viinanen told the Financial Times the decision to float the currency was
taken in preference to a straight devaluation, in order to reassure the
European Community.
'Floating was not designed to be aggressive,' he said. 'I hope the EC will
understand our situation.' On Tuesday the European Commission said it
'regretted' the Finnish move.
There was some concern in Helsinki yesterday that formal negotiations over
Finland's EC membership might be delayed as a result of the floating markka.
Mr Viinanen acknowledged that the country would 'face hard terms' in the
talks, due to start early next year.
He was bewildered by how quickly the value of the markka deteriorated
because of the huge outflow of capital that threatened to deplete the
country's capital reserves. The international swap arrangements made in the
spring with European central banks were used but proved insufficient.
'On Monday night it was impossible to stop the flow. The position was
hopeless,' he said.
'It would have been too expensive for the country to use up all its
resources to defend the markka.'
Mr Viinanen said further cuts would be made in government spending over the
next three fiscal years, to persuade money markets that the burgeoning
budget deficit could be brought under control. It could reach FM200bn
(Pounds 22.5bn) this year. Next year cuts will total about FM20bn, with a
further FM22bn-FM30bn in 1994 and 1995.
So far this year Mr Viinanen has assembled three separate cuts packages but
they have failed to restore the market's credibility in the government's
economic strategy.
The new cuts are expected to include swingeing reductions in agricultural
subsidies, regional grants, and transfer payments to local authorities. But
painful reductions can also be expected in the value of Finland's
wide-ranging social welfare benefits.
'We can no longer afford the benefits we now have,' the minister said.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Yeltsin delays long-awaited trip to Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin of Russia yesterday called off a long-awaited trip
to Japan just four days before the visit was due to have started.
Mr Yeltsin told Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, yesterday
morning that he had to delay the talks because of various 'domestic
problems'. A Japanese spokesman said Tokyo regretted the postponement of a
meeting which could 'have marked a new step in relations'.
Mr Yeltsin also postponed a visit to South Korea which was to have followed
the Japanese trip. The 'postponement' of the visit may, on the face of it,
have been inspired by a wish on Mr Yeltsin's part to avoid a failure to
achieve progress in a bitter territorial dispute over the Kurile islands
which has dogged the two nations since 1945.
Tokyo is demanding the return of four small islands off the Japanese
northern coast that were seized by Soviet troops at the end of the second
world war.
Japan has refused to consider large-scale economic aid to the Russians in
the absence of substantial progress in negotiations over the islands. Mr
Yeltsin has also been under pressure from nationalists at home demanding
that Russia retains sovereignty over the territory.
It was feared in Tokyo that if Mr Yeltsin were unable to make substantial
concessions during the planned visit, relations between the two countries
could deteriorate further. The assumption in Tokyo was that the visit was
cancelled because of the intractability of the dispute.
The Russians had accused the Japanese of inflexibility, but the Japanese
government believed it had substantially softened its position earlier this
year.
Until May the Japanese official position was to demand immediate reversion
of the islands to Japanese control, but this was changed to a demand that
Russia merely recognise Japanese sovereignty over the islands, with details
for reversion to be negotiated.
A Foreign Ministry official in Tokyo said yesterday the issue was so
politically sensitive that the Japanese cabinet could not survive if it
extended large-scale aid to Russia without first solving the dispute. This
position was made clear to the Russians during a recent visit to Moscow by
Mr Michio Watanabe, the foreign minister.
The postponement of Mr Yeltsin's trip sends a signal to Japan that there are
limits to how much Moscow can concede in its bid to win billions of dollars
in economic assistance. But it could make a solution far more difficult.
Dr Viktor Rosin, an expert at the Institute of World Economy and
International Relations, said the dispute with Japan could affect Russia's
policy towards the rest of the world. The visit had offered Russia an
opportunity to finally turn its back on its old-style foreign policy and
confirm its 'active involvement in the world community'. This opportunity
had been thrown away.
Mr Yeltsin may also have given ammunition to his critics. Having scented
blood on this issue, conservatives, joined by democrats turned ardent
nationalists, would find other opportunities to demand changes in other
areas of both foreign and domestic policy.
A great economic opportunity for Russia may also be at risk. Although
Russian leaders today have fewer illusions about the value of outside help,
the task of switching to a market economy will be more difficult without
substantial financial transfers from one of the few western powers with cash
to spare.
Japan also has a powerful voice in international gatherings, such as the
Group of Seven, which is trying to co-ordinate assistance for Russian
reforms, in particular a response to requests for a debt rescheduling.

FT  10 SEP 92 / German unions 'favour wage limits in east'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, European Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MS Birgit Breuel, president of the German Treuhand privatisation agency,
said yesterday that trade unions now favoured wage restraint in east Germany
to boost faltering economic growth there.
'If you talk to trade unions, they know there will have to be changes,' she
said in London, where she is presenting the agency's borrowing plans to
banks and investors.
Ms Breuel stressed she did not want to interfere in wage negotiations
between employers and workers but added that trade unionists could now
'easily see that, the higher the wage rises, the more you will lose jobs'.
Lower wage increases in the east would involve shelving plans to achieve
east and west German wage equality in key industry sectors by 1994.
This proposal has, however, been submitted under plans for a 'solidarity
pact' which Chancellor Helmut Kohl is negotiating in an attempt to remedy
Germany's growing economic difficulties.
High wage rises in east Germany since monetary union in July 1990 have been
blamed for exacerbating unemployment east of the Elbe. This in turn has
increased the need for substantial financial transfers, now running at a net
DM150bn (Pounds 53.7bn) a year - which is the main factor behind high German
interest rates.
Concerning the agency's borrowing plans, Mr Paul Hadrys, Treuhand's chief
financial officer, said it planned DM100bn-DM130bn in capital market
borrowing over the next few years.
Terms for a first bond issue of between DM8bn and DM10bn will be set next
week.
Mr Hadrys said the international bond market would provide 'the main
pipeline' through which the Treuhand would conduct its overall borrowing
programme.
Ms Breuel said the 3,800 or so companies still in the Treuhand's portfolio
were suffering from falling export orders from the former Soviet Union. But
this gave them a greater incentive to adjust efficiency to meet standards
required on western markets. 'This can be brutal - but there is no
alternative.'
She defended the agency against charges that it had shown complicity with
former members of the East German Communist party, who have allegedly
profited from some sell-off schemes.
She said the Treuhand was under fire from critics suggesting that it
employed too many ex-communists and those complaining its operations were
virtually run by west Germans. 'It's very difficult to steer a middle
course.'
Earlier this summer Mr Wolfram Krause, the last east German on the agency's
board of directors, left the Treuhand. This followed controversy over his
former links with the Stasi, the East German secret police.
Critics have charged that Mr Krause left because of an internal power
struggle. But Ms Breuel said the former director departed of his own
volition after publicity about his contacts under the communist regime. 'He
said he could no longer stand being in the newspapers every day.'
The Treuhand had dismissed 500 managers in companies under its wing, and 25
of its own employees, after discovering they previously worked for the
secret police. Cases of alleged 'Stasi connections' were always extensively
discussed with individuals before action was taken, Ms Breuel said.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Italy embarks on road to electoral reform
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S two houses of parliament yesterday took the first step to reforming
the country's ossified institutions and unworkable electoral system by
agreeing to the formation of a 60-strong all-party commission.
The joint commission, headed by Mr Ciriaco de Mita, the former Christian
Democrat prime minister, will have six months in which to draw up
recommendations. A law will then be submitted to parliament conferring
powers on the commission to draft specific proposals for constitutional
change.
This will turn the commission into a mini-constituent assembly and give it
authority. Lack of power to make specific proposals undermined a previous
attempt at reform in 1983.
The commission results from an initiative by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro.
In his inaugural address on May 28 he urged parliament to give immediate
attention to a commission, to prevent state institutions falling into
further discredit.
But all parties have recognised that the 1947 constitution was geared to a
country emerging from fascism into the cold war at a time when social and
economic conditions were profoundly different to now.
The system of proportional representation was designed to protect minority
parties and discourage the control of monolithic groups like the Communists
or disbanded fascists.
However, elections this year demonstrated that this system merely encouraged
a plethora of small parties and produced unstable coalition governments.
The commission will examine the workings of parliament, the nature of the
presidency and whether the incumbent be chosen through direct elections, the
role of regions and magistrates, direct elections of mayors, and electoral
reform.
Some of the most prestigious names in parliament were chosen for the
commission alongside Mr de Mita, including Ms Nilde Iotti, deputy of the
former communist Party of the Democratic Left, who was part of the
commission formed in 1946 to write the present constitution.
But one notable absentee was Mr Mario Segni, the reformist Christian
Democrat who heads the movement to change Italy's institutions by
referendum.
He argues that parliament is too slow and divided by petty differ-ences to
be able to agree on funda-mental reform.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA hopes a new set of debt rescheduling proposals to clear arrears on
the former Soviet Union's Dollars 70bn (Pounds 35.1bn) foreign debt will win
favour from Group of Seven officials in Paris today.
Mr Peter Aven, Russia's minister for foreign economic relations, said
yesterday the proposals were based on newly available balance of payments
projections by the International Monetary Fund, giving a clearer picture of
the amounts Russia could afford to pay.
He said a figure of Dollars 2.5bn-Dollars 3bn quoted by Mr Alexander
Shokhin, the deputy prime minister and his immediate superior, as an
estimate of what Russia could afford to spend on annual debt repayments was
not necessarily the last offer. 'If somebody can prove we can pay Dollars
6bn then we'll pay Dollars 6bn,' he said.
'We would like to fulfil our obligations after signing a long-term
rescheduling agreement, and not to be in a position like today where we have
signed something but still accumulate arrears,' Mr Aven said.
'If you pay just part of your debt you have to choose who to pay. You have
to make priorities and that's absolutely wrong,' he added, referring to the
practice whereby payments are made only to countries which lend Russia more
money or when Moscow is faced with the suspension of key imports.
Credit lines with dozens of countries have been frozen because of arrears
exceeding Dollars 4bn on debts excluded from a deferral of principal
payments on medium-term debt already granted by the Paris Club of creditor
nations.
A final decision on debt rescheduling may be taken by the Paris Club, which
is due to meet at the end of the month.
Mr Aven claimed that capital flight was about Dollars 3bn, and not the
inflated figure given in some estimates. But such flight had reduced
resources for debt repayment and contributed to the rouble's weakness.
Further confidence-building measures, such as increasing interest rates on
rouble deposits within Russia, would be needed before state-owned
enterprises could be persuaded to bring back currency from abroad.
Mr Aven said that forcing enterprises to sell 100 per cent of their hard
currency earnings in order to boost the thin foreign currency market - as
suggested by Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the acting central bank chairman -
would worsen the problem. 'We will do this only when we manage to defend a
stable exchange rate and bring down inflation,' the minister said.
Mr Aven expects differences with Mr Gerashchenko over economic policy reform
to be sorted out.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Russia, Ukraine in reactor pledge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA and the Ukraine are determined to press on with nuclear power and to
make their reactors safe, with or without western help, the heads of the two
countries' nuclear programmes said yesterday.
Speaking on the eve of the Uranium Institute's annual conference in London,
Mr Erik Pozdyshev, president of the Russian nuclear utility Rosatomenergo,
and Mr Vladimir Fuks, his Ukrainian counterpart, expressed exasperation that
no western financial aid had reached them yet, after three years of
discussion.
'If western governments will stop just talking and will give real
assistance, then we will not reject that help, because it will enable us to
solve the safety matters more quickly,' Mr Pozdyshev said.
'But if the help is always delayed, we have the capacity to provide the
necessary level of safety for our nuclear stations ourselves.'
Russia plans to keep its Chernobyl-type RBMK reactors running well into the
next century, after making the necessary safety changes, he said. The
Sosnovy Bor plant near St Petersburg - where a radiation leak caused
wide-spread alarm last March - will operate at least until 2003.
At the same time Russia will open new PWR-type VVER reactors, starting with
a 1,000MW unit at Balakova which 'we plan to commission within the next six
months'.
Mr Fuks said the Ukrainian utility Ukratomenergoprom wanted to complete and
commission three new VVER reactors - at Zaporozhe, Rovno and Khmelnits.
These would provide new generating capacity after the final closure of
Chernobyl, which is planned for next year.
The Ukraine currently has a moratorium on new nuclear plants but Mr Fuks
forecast that parliament would vote next year to commission the three
reactors 'if energy prices continue to rise and if this winter is cold
enough'.
Mr Armen Abagyan, director-general of the All-Union Research Institute for
Nuclear Power Plants, said the Russian nuclear industry was spending
precious hard currency on computers and safety monitoring equipment from the
west - in particular from the US and Germany.
'They talk about Germany paying money to us - but in fact we're paying money
to Germany,' he said.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Italian PM seeks emergency powers over economy: Amato may
rule by decree during a crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY's embattled government is to seek emergency powers from parliament
which would allow it to rule by decree in the event of economic emergency.
The two-month-old coalition led by Professor Giuliano Amato, the prime
minister, also announced a series of economic measures yesterday as it tries
desperately to establish credibility in the face of a foreign exchange
crisis.
Prof Amato said the special powers would include the right to halt approved
government spending or borrowing plans without parliamentary approval, to
alter taxes and to speed investment in areas of the economy where it was
considered necessary.
After a long cabinet meeting, the government announced it would sell off
shares in Credito Italiano, one of the country's top five commercial banks,
and Nuovo Pignone, the heavy engineering company controlled by ENI, the
state oil concern.
The cabinet also approved a series of measures to tighten budgetary control
and tax evasion, plus the abolition of tax exemption on Italian purchase of
bonds issued by multilateral financial institutions such as the World Bank
and European Investment Bank. For all future purchases, a 12.5 per cent tax
will apply.
With the Italian currency under persistent pressure for weeks on the foreign
exchange markets, Prof Amato in a press conference last night stressed his
government's commitment to defend the lira within the European Monetary
System and reduce the country's huge budget deficit. Industrialists and
bankers had pressed the government - following last week's 1.75 point rise
in the discount rate to 15 per cent - to generate confidence by announcing a
privatisation.
The cabinet meeting was brought forward by two days in an attempt by the
four-party coalition government to demonstrate to nervous financial markets
evidence of a will to act.
The government's intention to avail itself of special powers for quick
action in the event of an economic crisis could have potentially
far-reaching consequences. The proposal marks a recognition that Italy's
existing parliamentary procedures are too slow for the necessary rapid
decision-making at a time of financial turbulence. The law would permit the
government to act by decree to, for instance, raise revenues once a
'neutral' party - defined as the governor of the Bank of Italy - accepted
there was an economic crisis.
Before the measures were announced, the lira slipped slightly against the
D-Mark to close at L764.55 compared with L764.14.
The Milan bourse rose nearly 2 per cent, while shares in Credito Italiano,
buoyed by press leaks ahead of the announcement, jumped nearly 14 per cent,
forcing trading in its stock to be suspended.
'The markets have been baying for blood, and maybe the government has given
them a little of what they wanted,' said one banker. The decision on the
privatisations was taken rapidly and the details of the sell-offs will take
time to emerge.
Credito Italiano is 67 per cent controlled by IRI, the state holding company
which last month became a joint stock company. The bank, with total assets
of L94,347bn at the end of 1991, has seen its shares rise 23 per cent in the
last three days in what had been an otherwise depressed bourse. The bank
earned net profits last year of L297bn.
But investors were taken by surprise by the inclusion of Nuovo Pignone in
the government's sell-off plans. The company last year turned in profits of
L32bn on turnover of L1367bn.

STERLING last night touched a new low against the D-Mark in the European
exchange rate mechanism, amid continuing investor nervousness about a
possible realignment of weak ERM currencies.
In late European trading, the pound hit DM2.7808, a little more than a
quarter of a pfennig above its DM2.7780 ERM floor, after a news agency
report cited the German Bundesbank as saying the currency was a candidate
for devaluation. Sterling gained ground later to DM2.7850, after the
Bundesbank denied the content of the report.
At the close of London trading, the pound had closed unchanged on the day at
DM2.7875, a level it maintained in New York.

SWEDEN RAISED its lending rate to banks to 75 per cent yesterday and
announced heavy foreign borrowing to protect the krona as Nordic financial
markets suffered a second successive day of unrest.
The unprecedented rise in the Bank of Sweden's marginal lending rate, which
governs bank deposits and borrowings with the central bank, stabilised the
exchange rate but sent shock waves across the Swedish stock market. The rate
was increased from 16 per cent to 24 per cent on Tuesday.
Share values fell by 2.2 per cent on the Stockholm bourse to 888.3 on the
Veckans Affarer index. The insurance and banking sector were particularly
hard hit.
Trading in the shares of Trygg Hansa and Skandia, Sweden's two biggest
insurance companies, were suspended after Svenska Kredit, a credit insurance
group controlled by the two companies, announced it had halted payments for
lack of liquid funds.
The Swedish government, however, pledged to support Gota Bank, the country's
fourth largest commercial bank, after it forecast a sharp deterioration in
its financial position and warned that credit losses would amount to SKr8bn
(Pounds 784m) in 1992.
Mr Bengt Dennis, governor of the Bank of Sweden (Riksbank), said the
interest rate increase was designed to 'send such a strong signal that no
one can doubt our commitment to defend a fixed exchange rate'.
The action was accompanied by news of a plan for the Riksbank and the
National Debt Office to raise up to Ecu31bn (Pounds 22.5bn) in foreign
borrowing to support the Swedish currency.
The total volume is three times the borrowing to support sterling announced
by the British Treasury last week. Other market interest rates rose
yesterday. Nordbanken announced that its rate on home loans was going up by
5 percentage points to 22.5 per cent. Short-term property loans rose by 3.5
percentage points to 21 per cent.
Mrs Anne Wibble, Sweden's finance minister, said the centre-right government
was prepared to see the Riksbank's interest rates rise still further if
necessary. 'The sky's the limit,' she said. 'The fixed exchange rate of the
krona is the most important cornerstone of our entire economic policy . . .
We will do what it takes to convince the outside world that we are not going
to devalue.'
Mrs Wibble said the Social Democratic opposition party, business
organisations and trade unions all rejected devaluation. 'There is a
national consensus and that ought to convince the international markets.'
Detailing the borrowing plans, the Riksbank said it would add currency worth
up to Ecu16bn to its foreign exchange reserves using borrowings both on its
own behalf and by the National Debt Office. The sums would be used for
intervention in foreign exchange markets.
A 'substantial part' of the Ecu16bn had already been raised, Mr Dennis said.
The Riksbank has formal swap agreements with the other Nordic central banks,
and has called on 'certain other central banks' for assistance in supporting
the currency.
The National Debt Office is using separate standby credit facilities
amounting to Dollars 3.4bn. In addition, Sweden is drawing on its US and
Euro commercial paper programmes to raise a further Dollars 2bn. The
government has told the National Debt Office to look at means of borrowing
another Ecu15bn on behalf of the Riksbank if necessary.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Major calls for overhaul of G7 summits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR has called for a radical overhaul of the Group of Seven's
annual summits to re-establish their role in shaping effective leadership
among the rich industrial nations.
In a confidential letter to the leaders of the US, Japan, Germany, Italy,
France and Canada, the prime minister has proposed they shed the vast
bureaucracy that has built up around their annual gatherings.
Instead, he has suggested that the summits return to the original 'fireside
chat' formula devised by Mr Valery Giscard D'Estaing and Mr Helmut Schmidt
when the then French and German leaders called the first in 1975.
One idea is that the G7 should abandon the long pre-drafted communiques
covering all aspects of world economic and political developments in favour
of a concise statement of priorities.
A more radical proposal floated in Whitehall is that the foreign and finance
ministers, who often dominate the working sessions at the summits, should be
banished.
Ministers in the UK and elsewhere have recognised that recent summits have
failed to get to grips with the failing world economy and the turmoil in the
former communist bloc.
Both Mr Major and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, believe that the
summits - which also bring together hundreds of officials from the seven
countries - have become too stage-managed.
The detailed preparations have reduced the talks among heads of state to
carefully rehearsed statements of previous positions.
Mr Major has been particularly frustrated by the failure of two consecutive
summits - London in 1991 and Munich in 1992 - to achieve a breakthrough in
the stalled Uruguay round of trade talks in the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (GATT).
He believes that uncertainty over the future of the world trading system has
contributed greatly to the slowdown in economic growth.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Shares fall in building companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH construction and building material shares fell steeply again
yesterday as bad news continued to pour out of the housebuilding sector.
The share price of English China Clays, the world's largest producer of
china clay, dropped almost a sixth to 371p after the company announced an
unexpected Pounds 11m provision against its UK housebuilding division.
Taylor Woodrow's share price, which had fallen by almost two-thirds since
May, fell a further 18 per cent to 35p after the company announced it had
made a Pounds 16m first-half pre-tax loss.
On Tuesday, Wimpey, Britain's second largest housebuilder, announced it was
halving its interim dividend.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Martini agrees to sell large stake to Bacardi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BACARDI believes it has found the right one. The Bermuda-based international
rum company is to take a substantial stake in Martini &amp; Rossi, the Italian
vermouth and wines group, according to industry sources.
The alliance between the two privately owned drinks companies, each with
sales of between Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 750m) and Dollars 2bn a year, will
form the fourth largest group in the global wines and spirits industry.
General Beverage Corporation, Martini's Geneva-based holding company, said
yesterday that no directors were available for comment. Bacardi
International said Mr Eduardo Cutillas, chief executive, was abroad and no
one else could comment.
Martini is known to have been searching for some time for an international
partner. General Beverage, which has been advised by Mr Jacques Gelardin, of
Colker Gelardin, a private investment banking firm based in London, is
believed to have held talks with a number of companies, including
Allied-Lyons of the UK.
A deal with Bacardi, which is reported to have been advised by JP Morgan,
the US investment bank, would mark a further substantial step in the
consolidation of the international wines and spirits industry.
Leading drinks groups have been strengthening their competitive positions in
the past few years by extending their brand portfolios and distribution
networks through a series of acquisitions and joint ventures.
Guinness, for example, has followed its joint venture with LVMH, the French
champagne and cognac group, by buying Asbach Uralt, the German brandy
company, and Pampero, the Venezuelan rum company. Grand Metropolitan
acquired Cinzano, Martini's rival vermouth company, earlier this year.
Bacardi and Martini already have joint distribution companies in several
markets. In the UK, they are partners with Bass, the brewer, in Westbay
Distributors.
Bacardi rum is the world's biggest-selling brand of any type of spirit with
sales last year of about 22m cases. Its sales volume is nearly 10 times
greater than that of its closest rival, Pampero.
The group, has maintained an impressive growth record. But its reliance on
the single drink category has been regarded as a weakness.
Martini, founded in 1863, is the sixth biggest worldwide producer of wines
and spirits. It dominates the vermouth market with sales of more than 17m
cases a year and has built a brand portfolio that includes Otard, the
sixth-ranked cognac, Benedictine liqueur, William Lawson Scotch whisky,
Eristoff vodka and a range of sparkling wines.

FT  10 SEP 92 / Efim figures show rapid downturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FINANCIAL health of Efim, the Italian state industrial holding, was
deteriorating faster than publicly admitted before the government's decision
in July to place the group in voluntary liquidation.
This has emerged from the release of Efim's accounts for 1991 and estimates
for this year up to the time the liquidator was called in.
Meanwhile, the government yesterday agreed to foreign bankers' demands for
full repayment of their Efim debt. Until now the government has insisted on
paying in lira or ecu denominated bonds at lower than market rates.
But yesterday the government agreed to pay the banks interest at those rates
in force when the debts were contracted. Foreign bankers have fought hard
for full repayment and to insist on the principle that Efim debt be treated
as sovereign debt.
Losses for 1991 were L1,181bn (Dollars 1bn) against the previous year's loss
of L374.2bn, while estimates up to mid-July suggest losses running at
L900bn. Most of these were generated by Alumix, its aluminium company, and
Augusta, the aerospace group centred on helicopters.
Efim at one stage had talked of the 1991 results holding losses down to
L271bn and returning to a modest profit of L99bn in 1994. In the spring,
when press reports suggested the 1991 loss would be around L800bn, Mr
Gaetano Mancini, the then president, said the figure would be nearer L600bn.
Overall turnover was also down in 1991 from L5,088bn to L4,532bn. The
accounts show total net debts of L7,654bn at the year-end. But total debt at
the time of the liquidation move was L8,500bn of which L3,500bn was owed to
foreign banks.
The Efim accounts should have been completed by the end of August. No
explanation was given for their not being signed by the outgoing board until
Tuesday.
According to the July liquidation decree, Mr Alberto Predieri, the
liquidator, has 60 days from the formal approval of the accounts to draw up
a plan to settle the group's affairs.

FT  10 SEP 92 / UN troops in Bosnia 'should return fire'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LONDON, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR MALCOLM RIFKIND, the British defence secretary, yesterday called for the
nearly 2,000 UK troops due to leave for Bosnia-Hercegovina to be given the
right to return fire, amid growing outrage at the killing of two French
United Nations peacekeepers.
As the situation on the ground grew increasingly difficult Mr Rifkind said
it was a 'crucial requirement' for any soldier to be able to defend himself,
condemning as 'repulsive' the machinegun and mortar attack on the UN relief
convoy near the airport in the besieged Bosnian capital.
Mr Rifkind's remarks reflect growing calls from the countries contributing
to the 16,000-strong peacekeeping force for their lightly armed troops to
use force if attacked.
Meanwhile, Brigadier-General Hussein Ali Abdul Razek, commander of the UN
peacekeepers in Sarajevo, blamed the mainly Moslem Bosnian forces for
Tuesday's attack on a UN convoy which left two soldiers dead and five
wounded.
He said: 'Irresponsible elements failed to respond to the local Bosnian
commander's orders and attacked the convoy at a range of less than 100
metres.'
The French government yesterday implicitly accused the Bosnian Moslem forces
in Sarajevo of being responsible for the death of the soldiers.
This is the first time that a contributor country to the UN peacekeeping
operations in Bosnia has blamed one of the warring factions in the conflict
between the Serbian, Moslem and Croatian communities of Bosnia.
Vigorously condemning the attack, Mr Roland Dumas, the French foreign
minister, said that it underlined the urgent need to find an answer to the
security problems arising out of the UN protection force's operations in
Bosnia. Mr Dumas stressed that the UN Security Council's resolution 770 of
August 13 specifically provided for effective military protection of
international aid convoys.
He said he had asked Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, 'to
activate' these measures.
The attack on the convoy dealt a further blow to the 380,000 battered people
trapped in Sarajevo. There is little food and no aid following the closure
last week of the airport and possible shooting down of an Italian relief
flight over territory controlled by Moslems and Croats.
After yesterday's meeting of the London Conference steering committee in
Geneva, it appeared unlikely that aid flights would be resumed before next
Tuesday.
The overland convoy attacked on Tuesday was en route from Belgrade, the
Serbian capital, to Sarajevo in an attempt to compensate for the suspension
of humanitarian flights to the Bosnian capital. Sarajevo has been besieged
for five months from the surrounding hills by Serb forces opposed to Bosnian
independence.

<TEXT>
FRANCE'S Socialist government, mired in scandals over party finances,
yesterday proposed a ban on all business donations to political parties in a
drive to fight corruption, Reuter reports from Paris.
The draft bill, to be considered by parliament next month, is part of a
crackdown on graft pledged by Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy when he took
office in April.
While allowing individuals to donate up to FFr30,000 (Dollars 6,270) to
political parties, the bill bans funding by companies and reinforces control
over public tenders to combat influence peddling. 'Only a ban on company
funding can guarantee honesty in politics,' said government spokesman Martin
Malvy.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE'S manned space shuttle is heading for fresh cost cuts and delays but
will seek technology co-operation with the Russian space programme, the
European Space Agency (ESA) announced yesterday.
The ESA will propose a diminished future for the Ecu4.4bn (Dollars 6.3bn)
Hermes shuttle programme at a meeting of technology ministers of its 13
members in Spain next month, said Mr Jean-Marie Luton, the agency's director
general.
Mr Luton, speaking a day after a meeting of the ESA's governing council,
said the agency would propose a slowdown in work on Hermes over the three
years to 1995 and an Ecu231m reduction in its budget. He denied reports that
the ESA was preparing to scrap Hermes.
If accepted by ESA members, this will mark a reprieve for the shuttle, in
which France is the leading partner, contributing 43.5 per cent of its
budget. Germany successfully demanded at the last ESA ministerial, last
November, that any decision on the continuation of Europe's manned space
programme should be delayed for a year.
France is a staunch supporter of Hermes, which it sees as the spearhead of
Europe's hopes for autonomy in space, but Germany - the second biggest
partner with 28 per cent of the budget - is keen to defray the costs by
seeking international co-operation. Bonn has argued that Russia has
technology to offer from its cash-strapped space programme.
Both the two leading Hermes partners' government spending has come under
pressure over the past year, from the costs of German unification and French
budget austerity.
Separately, he announced that the ESA would take part in the development of
Russia's latest generation of space stations, the MIR-2, due to be put into
orbit in 1996.

HUNGARY is making a last attempt to stop Slovakia diverting the river Danube
into an environmentally controversial barrage along their common border.
Mr Jozsef Antall, the Hungarian prime minister, yesterday persuaded Mr
Vladimir Meciar, his Slovak counterpart, to set up joint commissions to head
off confrontation over the Bos-Gabcikovo hydroelectric project.
The timetable for agreement is tight because construction is approaching the
point of no return. Slovakia plans in mid-October to force much of the flow
of Europe's largest river into a 25km channel elevated up to 18 metres above
the surrounding plain and bigger than the Suez canal.
The Hungarian prime minister said in unequivocal terms yesterday that
Hungary would consider the diversion of the river a 'territorial violation'
and an infringement of the post-war peace settlement.
Despite the agreement on further talks, yesterday's meeting between the
prime ministers in Budapest left the two sides as far apart as ever.
The Hungarian government can ill-afford to give in for domestic political
reasons. The democratic opposition which toppled the former regime was born
out of hostility to the communist-inspired dam. Slovakia, on the other hand,
remains adamant it cannot afford to halt project. The Bratislava government
says the work is too far gone and 20bn korunas (Dollars 746m) has already
been spent on the dam, which will supply 10 per cent of the country's energy
needs.
Bilateral relations, already poisoned by the intractable dispute over the
Gabcikovo barrage, are troubled further by disagreement over the status of
the 800,000-strong Hungarian minority in Slovakia.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD IS today unveiling heavily-revised versions of its Escort/Orion car
range (the Ghia version is shown above) just two years after the previous
generation was launched at a cost of Pounds 1bn. The exercise, which Ford
acknowledged yesterday involved further 'substantial' investment, follows
sharp criticism - mainly in the UK - of the styling and other aspects of the
cars at their original launch in October 1990.
Mr Ian McAllister, chairman of Ford of Britain, said: 'We listened to what
was being said about the last versions of the cars, married these comments
with our own on-going (development) programme and introduced changes.'
Ford insisted that the most extensive - and expensive - changes involved
re-engineering to improve crash protection and other beneath-the-skin
specifications.
Adverse comment has had relatively little affect on sales. About 1.1m of the
controversial models have been sold in Europe. The Escort/Orion range was
Europe's second best-selling car behind Volkswagen's Golf last year.

FT  09 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tractor makers pay heavy price
for reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK tractor market is likely to decline further over the next four years
as farmers realise they will have to pay the heaviest price for the reform
of the European Community's common agricultural policy.
A market that 20 years ago saw annual sales of 25,000 to 30,000 units has
fallen sharply since 1988, when 22,521 units were sold, and will continue
downwards to 13,000 units in 1996, according to a study by the London-based
Corporate Intelligence Group.
'Arable farmers will be farming less land and accepting a cut in the price
which they gain for their produce. Fixed costs will have to be reduced and
there will be more intensive use of the available machinery by means of
machinery rings and contractors,' it says.
On a worst case basis, it adds, most farmers could probably farm 25 per cent
more land with their available machinery.
Although farm amalgamations will be slowed by recent moves to make
inheritance taxes more lenient, there will still be a trend to farm in
larger units, spreading good quality 'lean management' over more hectares.
On the other hand, the study says, the fiscal changes will probably be
relatively small and there will be ways of reducing the damage from the CAP
reforms, for example by moving into other crops.
The study says farmers have seen their net incomes fall every year and have
become increasingly disinclined to invest for the future.
With a huge pool of existing tractors to fall back on, they have to be
attracted by unusual factors if they are to buy a new machine. One of the
best could be a real advance in features such as more gears or better
controls in the cab.
The UK is still one of the largest tractor markets in Europe, with a
preference for relatively large, sophisticated machines. The average
horsepower of a tractor bought last year was 88.6, up from 83 hp in 1987,
mainly reflecting a rise in importance of tractors over 100 hp.
According to the study, Ford - now part of the Fiat-controlled NH Geotech,
was market leader with a 23 per cent share last year, followed by
Massey-Ferguson (19 per cent), John Deere and Case IH (18 per cent each).

FT  09 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold group warns low price may
force closures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
ANGLO AMERICAN Corporation of South Africa will have to start closing down
some of its marginal gold mining capacity in four months time unless the
local price of gold - now at its lowest level for five years - improves,
according to Mr Clem Sunter, chairman of Anglo's gold and uranium division.
So far Anglo, widely believed to be among the most efficient South African
gold producers, has avoided cutting output. However, its gold mining
workforce fell from 210,000 to 170,000 over the past four years.
Mr Sunter said yesterday that if the present gold price of R30,000 a
kilogram (about Dollars 340 a troy ounce) persisted for a year, many more
marginal South African mines would be forced to close. Anglo believed that a
gold price of Dollars 500 an ounce was needed to keep South Africa's output
stable while at Dollars 400 the country's annual production would drop by
100 tonnes over the next ten years from about 600 tonnes. A price of Dollars
600 an ounce was needed if South African production was to increase, he told
the Association of Mining Analysts in London.
Mr Sunter suggested gold 'is no longer the doomsday metal', or a hedge
against world disasters, but an industrial metal which would move up in
price as economies in the industrialised countries improved next year. 'And
we genuinely believe the gold price will improve next year.'
He said the industry would be better off promoting gold jewellery sales
rather than shutting capacity.

NICKEL prices recovered some of their earlier losses during kerb trading on
the LME in a rally away from 2 1/2 -year lows, but the market still ended
weak. Dealers said nickel was undermined by depressed fundamental and
negative technical factors, with investment fund and stop-loss selling
outweighing producer support and Chinese demand. There is little physical
interest or merchant activity at the moment, and with prices having fallen
below Dollars 7,000 a tonne, declines towards Dollars 6,000 a tonne on
technical considerations are possible. Three-month ZINC breached downside
support below Dollars 1,380 as last week's upside momentum petered out.
London's robusta COFFEE prices continued to edge towards the top of their
recent Dollars 770 to Dollars 800 a tonne range in nearby November, although
in quiet conditions. 'We just seem to be slowly and regularly moving
upwards. The question is how we manage to get over the Dollars 800
resistance level,' one dealer said. New York arabica coffee was slightly
lower at midday. Nymex PLATINUM futures remained higher at midsession
following Monday's violence in South Africa, the world's biggest platinum
producer.

FT  09 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: India faces oilseeds deficit
despite bumper crop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CALCUTTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA EXPECTS to harvest a bumper oilseeds crop of 20m tonnes or more in the
1992-93 season, up from 18.7m tonnes in the previous year, following good
rains since the start of August. But industry officials still expect the
yield of edible oils to fall short of the country's annual demand of about
7m tonnes by at least 1m tonnes.
The size of Indian imports of edible oils will depend on the availability of
foreign exchange and behaviour of prices on the domestic market - a serious
foreign exchange crisis restricted imports to 177,000 tonnes last year,
compared with 540,000 tonnes in 1990-91.
In the current year India is receiving a donation of 50,000 tonnes of
soyabean oil from the US Agency for International Development and on top of
this it has decided to import 150,000 tonnes of palm olein (the liquid
portion of the oil) from Indonesia. The country also retains the option to
buy 300,000 tonnes of palm oil from Malaysia in the next two years.
India's per capita consumption of edible oils, about 7 kg, is half
Malaysia's.
The federal government aims to make India self-sufficient in oils, which
will call for production of oilseeds to be raised to 26m tonnes a year. The
extra 6m tonnes will have to come from increasing the area under the crops
as well as raising yields, industry officials say. Since 1989-90, the area
under oilseeds has increased from 21.67m hectares (53m acres) to about 25m
ha but productivity has stagnated at about 800 kg a hectare.
Industry representatives are urging that the government should encourage the
cultivation of sunflowers and the planting of red oil palm, both late
entrants to the Indian edible oils sector.
Led by ITC some big Indian companies are promoting the cultivation of
sunflowers, a low irrigation crop that can survive drought and floods.
Farmers in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh are already producing
sunflowerseed, which has an oil content of about 35 per cent, in a big way
and their success has encouraged large scale planting in other states like
Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. As a result Indian production
is expected to rise to 3m tonnes from the present 750,000 tonnes in the next
few years.
The industry is also showing increasing interest in oil palm, plantations of
which could be developed over an additional 575,000 ha in nine Indian
states, including Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, according to a
recent study. Some success with this crop has already been achieved in the
Andamans and Kerala.
During the eighth national plan period (1992-1997), the government proposes
bringing 800,000 ha under oil palm. Use of hybrid seeds and improved
agricultural practices could give a yield of up to 5 tonnes of oil a
hectare, experts claim.

FT  09 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Hungary increases farm export
pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HUNGARY, EVEN after sacrificing a fifth of this year's harvest to drought
and heat, is increasing the pressure on west European producers.
Mr Gyorgy Rasko, state secretary at the ministry of agriculture, yesterday
forecast that Hungary's agricultural exports would double to Dollars 5bn
within five years. He said that Hungary was 'the cheapest producer in the
world' because of the large average size of farms, low wages and the
country's naturally fertile plains.
Hungary estimates that its farms, once they are run with fewer
administrative overheads, can produce wheat at a cost of Dollars 50 a tonne
compared with the west European level of about Dollars 120 a tonne.
Counting the cost after the hottest August on record, the government
yesterday forecast damage of Dollars 500m or 20 per cent to crop output in
1992.
'We have enormous losses,' said Mr Rasko warning that they could grow even
further over the next two weeks. Yields are forecast to decline most for
maize, by about 30 per cent from the average of 1989-91, prompting Mr Rasko
to forecast that less than 500,000 tonnes would be exported this year.
The ministry has granted licences for only 1m tonnes of wheat exports,
compared with capacity for 2m tonnes and last year's 2.5m tonnes.
But Mr Rasko said that the biggest surprise was that Hungarian agricultural
exports, largely to the European Community, far from falling, had risen
20-25 per cent in the year to the first half of 1992. The state secretary
predicted that total agricultural exports in 1992 would reach Dollars 2.5bn
despite the drought, about the same as last year.
The government ascribes the export performance partly to the association
agreement with the European Community, which expanded Hungary's quotas and
reduced the tariffs and levies to which deliveries were subject. 'The EC is
not as protectionist as many people thought,' commented Mr Rasko.
Exports have grown too because 300 private trading companies have set up
since the state-owned trading houses that used to conduct Hungary's
agricultural trade lost their monopolies. The new traders are far more
flexible and enterprising than their predecessors.

FT  09 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Diamond cartel 'needs sales
boost'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DE BEERS' rough (uncut) diamond sales will have to rise to about Dollars 5bn
a year before the South African group, which controls about 80 per cent of
world trade, can start to whittle away at stocks that are growing at an
alarming rate, analysts believe.
This compares with its record sales of Dollars 4.17bn in 1988 and the
second-best level of Dollars 4.16bn in 1990.
Mr Graham Roberts, research director at Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, part of the
Banque Indosuez Group, pointed out yesterday that De Beers' Central Selling
Organisation (CSO) had contracted to buy about Dollars 4.4bn of diamonds
from producers next year. Another Dollars 300m of rough diamonds would be
left with producers this year because De Beers had told them it would take
only 75 per cent of their output from September onwards - as permitted under
the terms of the CSO contract.
The CSO attempts to stabilise the rough diamond market by stockpiling excess
gems during times of market weakness and then releasing them as conditions
improve. So, assuming that smuggling from Angola, Russia and other areas
continues but at a reduced rate, there may be a further Dollars 400m of
rough diamonds to be mopped up if De Beers wants to maintain a stable
market.
Mr Roberts suggested De Beers' rough diamond sales would be about Dollars
3.4bn this year, that its cash balances would be seriously reduced and that
'it might even have to borrow money.'
The worrying aspect of the present situation was that many of the problems
De Beers faced were structural and outside its control, he added.
Meanwhile, a special report today from the Economist Intelligence Unit
suggests that De Beers diamond sales 'could exceed Dollars 5bn by 1996,
assuming no major disruptions to production and no supply or price shocks.'
It predicts that world diamond production, which rose by 19 per cent from
89.6m carats to 106.7m between 1986 and 1990, will grow by a further 15 per
cent, from 108m carats to 119m between 1992 and 1996.
Ironically, De Beers' own Venetia mine, near Messina in the northern
Transvaal, which is now building up production towards its expected annual
capacity of 4m carats, is the main contributor to the production increase.
The report says De Beers will have to absorb more diamonds into its buffer
stock and the market imbalance will be most marked in relatively low
quality, small diamonds which have already been accumulating at the CSO and
cutting centres since 1990.
The EIU expects the diamond cartel to survive, however, and even suggests
that its most testing time will come after the market revives 'and with it
the incentive for producers to break with the cartel, or at least to seek a
degree of independence.'
Diamonds to 1995; a cartel and its future. Pounds 95 from the EIU, 40 Duke
Street, London W1A 1DW, UK.

FT  09 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK poultry losing out to
low-cost competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH POULTRY producers face a gloomy future as imports from countries
with laxer legislation and lower costs eat into the UK market, according to
a report published yesterday.
Food from Britain, which promotes British products both at home and abroad,
estimates that the cost of UK legislation over and above European Community
regulations on the industry is adding more than 4p a bird to UK costs,
making the UK one of the highest cost producers.
The trade deficit between exports and imports, which rose from Pounds 22m in
1989 to Pounds 83m last year, was Pounds 63.3m for the first half of this
year alone. Imports could take 20 per cent of the UK market for the whole of
this year, Mr Paul Judge, FFB chairman, said yesterday.
He called on the government 'to act quickly to ensure the poultry meat
industry can compete effectively and equally with its major competitors'. In
addition, British producers should identify and exploit niche markets
overseas. UK exports in 1991 amounted to 88,000 tonnes worth Pounds 123m.
Mr Judge asserted that the UK industry faced much higher charges for
compliance with EC legislation than did competitor countries, which stuck to
the minimum prescribed levels. 'Even more important is the distorting effect
of UK legislation which was mainly put in place with the laudable aim of
protecting the British consumer.'
The industry fully supported this aim, said Mr Judge, but the government did
not apply the same standards to poultry imports, some of which were produced
to standards that 'would be seriously illegal in this country'.
Mr Robert Haynes, chairman of Buxted Poultry, part of the Hillsdown group,
warned that the British poultry industry, which has retail sales of Pounds
1.4bn a year, was in danger of going 'the way of British motorcycles,
British textiles and British fishing'. It had already suffered substantial
closures and redundancies in the last two years, and 'I fear we have not
seen the last'.
He pointed out that the EC had reduced the levies on chickens from Thailand,
Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland, and had ended the levy on US imports -
'all for political rather than agricultural reasons'.

<TEXT>
MR ALEXANDER Shokhin, the Russian deputy prime minister for foreign economic
relations, said yesterday that the government had 'lost control' over
state-owned oil exporters and that it wanted to recentralise purchases to
meet obligations to foreign states.
He was responding to a query about a report that Rosnefteprodukt, the state
exporter of oil products, had suspended deliveries to Japan and Western
Europe. An official told the Reuters news agency that deliveries had been
suspended because fuel was needed for Russia's far north and to collect the
harvest.
Mr Shokhin said the state wanted to buy oil, 'hopefully for roubles', direct
from producers so it could meet deliveries to former Soviet republics and
further afield. He did not give details of how a new system would differ
from the old. But he said that the government was not receiving all the oil
it was to supposed to obtain under the present state procurement system.

The workforce will be cut by up to 10 per cent as a result of the changes.
The carrier said it will stop flying to Istanbul, Moscow, Copenhagen and

TWA said the 'reallocation' of its resources, coupled with implementation of
agreements calling for a 15 per cent wage and benefit cut and work-rule
concessions by all US employees in exchange for a 45 per cent equity stake
in the airline, would result in a 'revitalised' TWA.

<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; York, the ailing Canadian developer, is turning over ownership of
its biggest New York office building to the property's bondholders.
The deal, which involves a 53-storey building at 55 Water Street in
Manhattan's financial district, marks a rare vote of confidence in the
future of the New York office market which has been plagued for the past
four years by high vacancy rates and tumbling rentals.
Besides exchanging their Dollars 548m in secured notes for a 100 per cent
equity stake in the 3.3m sq ft building, the bondholders have agreed to
invest an extra Dollars 21m in preferred shares. The deal is expected to be
finalised early next year.
The biggest bondholder, the Retirement System of Alabama, has expressed a
willingness to buy out the remaining investors as well as to contribute
their share of the preferred share issue.
Mr Wilbur Ross, senior managing director at Rothschild, which has advised
the bondholders, said this commitment could require an investment of up to
Dollars 140m by the Alabama pension fund. Mr Ross interpreted the pension
fund's commitment as a major vote of confidence in the New York property
market. 'This is not some real estate speculator doing it on borrowed money.
This is a very serious investor,' he said.
Mr David Bronner, chief executive of the Alabama Retirement System, added
the pension fund believes 'the New York real estate market provides
excellent long-term opportunities.'
Following completion of the transaction, the building will be debt-free. Mr
Ross said the new owners will have considerable room for manoeuvre to
attract new tenants and to pay for the improvements required over the next
few years.
O&amp;Y will continue to manage the building pending further negotiations with
the new owners. O&amp;Y made an interest payment on the Water St bonds as
scheduled on June 30, but warned rental income from the building would not
be sufficient to meet debt-service payments beyond the middle of 1993. It
said up to Dollars 200m would also be needed for tenant refurbishment,
brokerage commissions and asbestos removal.

<TEXT>
THE New York Times will record an after-tax charge of about Dollars 35m, or
45 cents a share, in its third quarter results, reflecting the cost of
shutting down The Gwinnett Daily News, a daily newspaper operating in the
suburbs of Atlanta, Georgia.
Cox Enterprises, the regional media group, has agreed to buy some of the
paper's fixed assets.
The New York Times bought the Gwinnett newspaper in 1987 for an estimated
Dollars 88m. The paper had a circulation of 50,000 and was popular with its
readership, but annual losses have continued at about Dollars 4m.
Mr Bill Adler, a spokesman for the New York Times group, said the newspaper
was a victim of recession and stiff advertising competition among Atlanta
dailies: 'The key is that things were not getting any better. The situation
was getting worse,' he said.
Mr Adler said the New York Times hired a broker last summer to try to sell
the paper, but none of the 40 prospective buyers was interested.
Although cash flow will be increased by the money to be paid to the Times by
Cox for offices, equipment, subscription lists and a new printing press, the
New York Times is still likely to suffer a net loss. Analysts had been
expecting a third quarter net profit of about Dollars 8m before the news of
the special Gwinnett charge.
For the first six months of 1992, the New York Times group's net income was
Dollars 29.2m, against Dollars 10.5m in the first half of last year.
Revenues were Dollars 888.5m, compared with Dollars 857.3m in the first half
of 1991.

HOPEWELL Holdings, the Hong Kong property and construction group controlled
by local entrepreneur Mr Gordon Wu, yesterday announced a 126 per cent jump
in net profits to HKDollars 1.62bn (USDollars 209.6m)for the year to June,
compared with HKDollars 718.9m a year earlier.
The bulk of the rise in earnings was from one-off property sales and
interest income from the proceeds of last year's HKDollars 5.8bn rights
issue; their combined contribution came to more than HKDollars 900m.
The figures were in line with expectations, boosted by the sale of the
group's Broadwood Road luxury residential development site just before the
year end. This helped nudge up earnings per share by 1 cent to 42 cents.
Hopewell is going through a lull. Investors await returns from its
infra-structural projects in China and Thailand.
Earnings are expected to increase in 1993, but only through further property
disposals; and then in 1994, it will receive the first returns from its
long-awaited Shenzhen-Guangzhou super-highway.
The company said the first phase of the toll road would be open to traffic
next year. This would ensure a sizeable early completion bonus equivalent to
the toll revenue up to the contract completion date of June 30 1994.
Analysts believe this could contribute HKDollars 500m.
Hopewell is developing commercial centres in 10 of the interchanges on the
first phase.
Hopewell will pay a final dividend of 16 cents, making a full-year payout of
30 cents.

FT  09 SEP 92 / Sales of commercial vehicles rise 9.5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK SALES of new commercial vehicles were 9.5 per cent higher in August
compared with August last year, halting the decline that has seen the
commercial vehicle sector suffer its steepest slide into recession in the
post-war period.
New commercial vehicle registrations rose to 31,704 from 28,946 in the same
month a year ago, according to figures from the Society of Motor and
Manufacturers and Traders.
This was the second monthly year-on-year increase in the last three months.
The tentative sign of recovery from a very low level follows a period in
which demand weakened for 32 consecutive months up to the end of May.
Higher sales than a year ago were achieved in all the main sectors of the
industry last month for the first time since the steep decline started in
the last quarter of 1989.
New truck registrations (above 3.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight) rose 7.3 per
cent in August to 4,097. Sales of medium vans, such as the Ford Transit and
the Volkswagen Transporter, rose 22 per cent year-on-year to 15,156.
Sales of small vans, such as the Ford Escort and Vauxhall Astra car-derived
vans, showed a 1.2 per cent rise, while registrations of buses and coaches
rose 12.9 per cent to 184.
Truck sales were higher than a year ago for the second successive month,
following a year-on-year increase of 6.7 per cent in July. The truck sector
has been hardest hit during the recession with sales at the lowest level
since 1954.
Commercial vehicle sales of 142,098 in the first eight months of the year
were still 6 per cent below the very depressed level of a year ago.
Registrations have fallen 46.5 per cent in the last three years.
Truck sales of 20,633 in the first eight months were also 6 per cent below
the level of a year ago, although sales of heavy trucks (above 15 tonnes) at
10,588 have fallen only 0.7 per cent from the very low level of last year.
The main demand in the heavy truck sector is still coming from private
hauliers for heavy tractor units for articulated trucks. Demand for rigid
trucks, most importantly from the construction industry, remains very
depressed.
The Iveco group, the commercial vehicles subsidiary of Fiat of Italy which
includes Iveco Ford and Seddon Atkinson, has narrowly regained the lead in
the UK truck market in its see-saw struggle with Leyland DAF, the UK
subsidiary of DAF of the Netherlands.
In the first eight months Iveco has captured a share of 24.7 per cent of UK
new truck sales, just ahead of the 24.3 per cent held by Leyland DAF.
In the heavy truck sector the strongest performances have been achieved by
Mercedes-Benz, Volvo and ERF, which have benefited from the higher demand
for heavy articulated truck units.
Mercedes-Benz heavy truck sales in the first eight months of the year were
12 per cent higher than a year ago, while ERF has boosted its UK sales in
this segment by 9.9 per cent and Volvo by 8.5 per cent.

FT  09 SEP 92 / Study of council redundancy plans
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DISTRICT AUDITORS in England and Wales are to study recent local authority
redundancy payments to decide whether they are lawful, in the light of a
test case High Court ruling on North Tyneside council's enhanced severance
scheme.
The Audit Commission confirmed yesterday that Mr Tony Childs, its solicitor,
was preparing guidance, to be sent to all district auditors within the next
month, to enable them to decide whether any enhanced payments made by
councils exceeded their powers.
The commission said that since the ruling councils had 'fought quite shy' of
offering enhanced redundancy terms. Now the judgment had been upheld after a
legal challenge from North Tyneside, the commission was to issue advice on
this complex area.
North Tyneside council, which made enhanced payments to 332 redundancy
volunteers in 1990-91, has been advised by Mr David Allsop, district
auditor, that it should consider seeking to recover the money.

FT  09 SEP 92 / Queen Mary bids narrowed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE field of bidders for the ocean liner Queen Mary has been narrowed to six
contenders from 18, the Long Beach Board of Harbour Commissioners said last
night.
The rejected bidders failed to post a Dollars 100,000 (Pounds 50,000) bond
required of all parties wishing to operate or purchase the vessel. Sea
Containers, the Bermuda-based shipping group, last month offered to pay one
sovereign for the liner. It is not one of the rejected bidders.
The Queen Mary, which has been moored in the southern California port city
since 1967 as a tourist attraction, was put up for auction earlier this year
after the Walt Disney Company decided to terminate its lease as the tour
operator. The ship-board hotel is scheduled to close on September 30.
The city of Long Beach paid Cunard Dollars 3.45m for the liner after it was
taken out of service, and has since spent Dollars 66m refurbishing the
vessel.

FT  09 SEP 92 / Toyota engine plant starts up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOYOTA of Japan, the world's third-largest vehicle maker, yesterday started
production at its Pounds 140m engine plant at Deeside, north Wales - the
first of a wave of Japanese automotive plants set to be commissioned in
Europe by the end of the year, Kevin Done writes.
Toyota is building up to a production rate of 200,000 engines a year at
Deeside - its first wholly-owned production plant in Europe - by the second
half of the 1990s. Output in the first phase is set to reach 100,000 a year
by 1995.
Output of 25,000 1.6-litre petrol engines is planned at Deeside next year
for supply to the company's Pounds 700m car-assembly plant at Burnaston,
near Derby, which starts production in December. A 2-litre petrol engine is
expected to be added in the second phase.
The engine plant is starting with simple assembly operations but will
machine important engine components during the next two years, including the
block, cylinder head, crankshaft, camshafts and con-rods.
Eventually all the main engine components will come from European suppliers
with the exception of the aluminium cylinder heads, which Toyota plans to
continue to import from Japan.
The plant will have 45 European suppliers with about half from the UK.
Of Pounds 131m investment presently committed at Deeside, about 56 per cent
has been sourced from Japan. Of the remainder Pounds 17.2m of equipment and
installation spending and Pounds 41m of construction work has come from
European suppliers.
The Deeside workforce of 74 is set to rise to 200 in 1995 and 300 at full
capacity.

FT  09 SEP 92 / Canadian economy 'needs more reform'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CANADIAN economy requires further structural reforms to reverse the
slide in its international competitiveness over the past two decades, the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development says in its latest
report on the country.
While the OECD gives credit for some initiatives since the mid-1980s, it
concludes that 'improvement of Canadian productivity performance remains
elusive'. Greater attention should be given to education and training
policies, research and development, and to removal of remaining domestic and
external trade barriers.
The report notes that recent progress in lowering inflation and maintaining
fiscal discipline has set the stage for the next economic recovery. But the
upturn will be sluggish.
Gross domestic product, which contracted by 1.7 per cent in 1991, is
forecast to rise by 2.3 per cent this year, accelerating to 4.3 per cent in
1993. Exports and housing are expected to be the mainsprings of the
recovery.
Despite the upturn in demand, considerable slack will remain in goods and
labour markets.
The OECD expects Canada's inflation rate will be about 2 per cent both this
year and next, easily beating targets set by the government last year.
But it cautions that expectations of lower inflation, in the form of more
moderate wage demands, have yet to be firmly established.
The organisation notes that the impact of Canada's sliding productivity is
evident in the deteriorating trade balance and historically low profit
margins.
It suggests that improvements in the much-criticised education and R&amp;D
effort require a reallocation of existing resources, rather than additional
spending.

FT  09 SEP 92 / Bush taken to task over Nafta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and DAMIAN FRASER

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR Democratic senators have taken President George Bush to task for
endangering the North American free trade agreement's chances of passing
through Congress by seeking to use it as a campaign issue.
Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, a staunch supporter of the Nafta
negotiations between the US, Canada and Mexico, complained yesterday that Mr
Bush was 'deliberately politicising' the agreement.
Mr Bush and other Republicans have accused Governor Bill Clinton, the
Democratic presidential candidate, of equivocation by saying he is in favour
of free trade but refusing an outright endorsement of Nafta.
'Politicising this agreement will not help its prospects in Congress,' Mr
Bentsen warned, adding that Mr Clinton could not be expected to decide on
the 2,000-page agreement when its full text had only just been made
available.
Senator Max Baucus of Montana went a step further and accused the
administration of rushing Nafta through in time for last month's Republican
convention in Houston - giving short shrift to concerns over environmental
protection and job displacement.
Mexico's trade deficit deteriorated sharply in the first half of this year
to Dollars 9.4bn (Pounds 4.72bn), more than double that in the same period
last year, according to the Finance Ministry, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico
City.

   BRASILIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Brazilian Congress has instructed President Fernando Collor, who has
been linked to a multi-million-dollar corruption scandal, to present a
defence for an impeachment request against him on September 15, sooner than
originally expected, Reuter reports from Braslia.
The Sao Paulo stock market rose 7 per cent on the news.
Mr Ibsen Pinheiro, president of Congress, who is responsible for setting the
timetable for the impeachment process, said Mr Collor had been informed of
charges against him. The president's spokesman later said an appeal against
the decision would be made to the Supreme Court today.
Mr Pinheiro said the vote on the impeachment request would require the
approval of two-thirds of the lower house and would be open.
His decision sparked protests from pro-government congressmen. The
government had intended to delay the procedure and believes the president
stands a better chance of blocking the request if the vote is kept secret.

FT  09 SEP 92 / Sarajevo 'soon out of supplies'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOOD stocks in Sarajevo are dwindling rapidly and the city could run out of
supplies by the end of the week, the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees said yesterday.
However, UN officials warn that international relief flights to the Bosnian
capital, suspended last Thursday after the loss of an Italian transport
aircraft, are unlikely to be resumed in the next few days.
The UNHCR has stepped up road convoys to Sarajevo from Split in Croatia to
offset the airlift suspension. But a shortage of trucks and drivers means
the city is receiving only half its daily food needs of 190 tonnes. Ms
Sylvana Foa, for the UNHCR, said yesterday that only 100 tonnes of flour and
90 tonnes of rice remained in its Sarajevo warehouses.
Ms Foa said 200 trucks were needed to transport the 14,400 tonnes of food a
month needed for nearly 1m people in southern and central Bosnia, including
the 380,000 residents of Sarajevo. To transport other essential supplies,
including shelter materials for the winter, would require 500 trucks and
drivers. The UNHCR has fewer than 50 trucks, though more have been promised.
Representatives of the three warring factions in Bosnia-Hercegovina will
today give UN officials in Geneva their response to proposals to improve the
security of humanitarian flights. These include a ban on military flights,
better co-ordination on the ground to ensure relief flights are correctly
identified, putting all anti-aircraft weapons under UN supervision and
expanding the UN weapons monitoring zone around the airport.
However, Mr Fred Eckhard, spokesman for Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen,
co-chairmen of the international conference on ex-Yugoslavia now permanently
in session in Geneva, said it was 'probably unrealistic' to assume that the
meeting would result in an immediate resumption of the airlift. Any
assurances given by the combatants would first have to be weighed by the 19
governments involved in the airlift operation.

FT  09 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RENEWED pressure on sterling caused a retreat in stock index futures after
early strength on the back of a squeeze, writes Joel Kibazo.
Having opened higher at 2,390, the September contract on the FT-SE was
squeezed forward, reaching 2,402 within the first half-hour of trading due
to demand from a leading US broker. This proved to be the high of the day,
the sharp move forward soon runnning out of steam as events in the currency
market took centre stage.
With sentiment further weakened by the poor performance in the fixed
interest markets, September continued to drift lower for the rest of the
day, with a poor Wall Street opening only serving to increase the selling of
the contract. Some big trades were dealt towards the close. For most of the
afternoon the future traded in line with the cash market.
September eventually closed at 2,339, just 2 ahead of the underlying cash
market, with turnover reaching 9,811 lots.
Volume in traded options remained dull, totalling 20,963, only slightly
above Monday's level. The FT-SE 100 option traded 7,320 contracts. Hillsdown
was the busiest stock option on 1,852 lots, followed by Fisons on 1,766.

FT  09 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy trade in Steel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TURNOVER in British Steel rose to 18m shares, making it the day's most
actively traded stock as it came under further pressure, easing 3 to 46 1/2
p, after analysts began downgrading profits estimates further following a
visit to the company's Teesside plant this week.
Continued weakness in steel prices, with little prospect of recovery in the
short term, was blamed for the downgrades. Mr Ian Lowe at Smith New Court, a
long-time bear, is now predicting a current year loss of between Pounds 135m
and Pounds 140m, against his previous estimate of a loss of Pounds 125m.
Another analyst was moved to say: 'The visit just confirmed our worst
fears.'
The latest round of downgrades reflects increased worries about the dividend
and there are now suggestions that the final dividend may once again be
reduced, or even omitted altogether.
A line of around 10m shares was said to have been on offer early in the
session, but heavy turnover in the ADRs (American Depositary Receipts) early
in the New York session suggested that this stock might have found a home.
Wimpey gloom
The gloom overhanging the building sectors deepened yesterday as BZW
disclosed a downgrade of the entire building materials area, and George
Wimpey, the housebuilder/contractor, confirmed the market's worst fears by
halving its interim dividend.
Wimpey shares, under continuous pressure since May this year, when they
reached 188p, plummeted to 65p yesterday before stabilising to close at 71p,
down 6p or almost 8 per cent on the day.
Most building sector analysts had expected Wimpey to record a loss over the
six months and to cut the dividend. But there was general unhappiness at
what was viewed as a less than forthcoming post-results briefing by the
company.
Fisons retreats
Troubled pharmaceuticals group Fisons was one of the most heavily traded
stocks in London yesterday. The shares showed the biggest percentage fall in
the FT-SE 100 Index on gloomy consideration of the group's first-half
results. Fisons dropped quickly after the start of trading and was off more
than 30p well before the market began to slide. It eventually stood a net 24
down at 150p after very heavy turnover of 16m shares.
The headline profit figure was predicted to be bad and at Pounds 40.4m,
against Pounds 95.2m last time, was around the high end of expectations.
However, the company's meeting with analysts after the figures were
announced proved disappointing and most people came away to cut their
forecasts.
Agency broker James Capel was near the bottom of the range with Pounds 100m
for this year, and Capel analyst Mr Robin Gilbert said: 'It was abundantly
clear that there was no immediate solution to production problems.'
Hoare Govett was more optimistic, coming down from Pounds 140m to Pounds
125m for this year but still around the top of the range. Forecasts for 1993
were also lowered, with one house predicting that Fisons would only make
Pounds 120m.
The series of swingeing reductions in profits estimates in the building
materials sector by BZW cut the ground from under the sector's leading
stocks. Analysts at the investment bank said they had lowered estimates to
accommodate a more bearish macro review of the ecocomy. BZW cut its current
year forecasts by 20 per cent and those for the next year by 15 per cent.
The reductions encompassed Redland, RMC, Blue Circle, Tarmac and Evered
Bardon, while steep downgrades at the so-called 'light end' of the industry
included Meyer and Travis Perkins. RMC and Redland dropped 20 apiece to 419p
and 348p, Blue Circle 6 to 149p, Tarmac 3 to 56p, Meyer 10 to 188p and
Travis 16 to 108p.
The appalling Wimpey figures spooked Taylor Woodrow, the shares taking the
wooden spoon as the market's worst performer, falling 14 per cent, or 7p, to
43p, the lowest level for more than a decade, ahead of today's interim
numbers. These are expected to see the company cut or even eliminate the
dividend and post losses of around Pounds 3m, compared with a Pounds 25m
profit last year.
Both classes of BT shares came under pressure as the market responded to
suggestions that a leading UK broking house was preparing a sell note.
However, there was no evidence of any new bearish circulars, and specialists
said the stocks had been depressed by sporadic bouts of profit-taking,
inspired by speculation about the timing of the sale of the UK government's
remaining 22 per cent stake in BT, equivalent to around 1.3bn shares.
Analysts expect the government to sell its remaining shares around the
middle of next year. BT 'old' settled 11 off at 335p, while the 'new' fell
10 1/2 to 234p. Turnovers were relatively low at 4.2m and 2.5m shares
respectively.
CE Heath, recently highlighted as a strong buy by County NatWest, outpaced
the rest of the insurance brokers, closing 14 higher at 253p.
Legal &amp; General dipped 4 to 308p, with the market fretting about the
possibility that the company will have to top up its provisions against
domestic mortgage indemnity losses.
Condom maker and photograph processor London International Group suffered
from a savage forecast cut. The shares fell 12 to 161p as UBS Phillips &amp;
Drew knocked its current year estimate by Pounds 6m to Pounds 38m.
Glaxo failed to benefit from good news that came out of an Imigran
conference in London yesterday and the shares dropped 14 to 750p. The news
had already been discounted, although one analyst suggested that the market
should now be on 'red alert' for approval of injectable Imigran in the US.
Bank note printer De La Rue, which is expected to enter the FT-SE Index
after trading ends today, weakened 24 to 541p. Hoare Govett turned slightly
more cautious, although it believes the company is fundamentally solid and
has maintained its Pounds 95m forecast for the current year.
Talk that the company's broker had cut forecasts on Reed International
prompted the shares to slip 10 to 501p.
The prospect of a visit for brokers and institutional investors to ICI's
paint works in Slough on Friday did nothing for the shares, which retreated
28 to 1062p. Conglomerate Hanson was heavily traded, losing 5 to 193p on
8.4m turnover.

FT  09 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Currency worries depress equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SUDDEN wave of adverse developments in European currency markets,
reflected in a setback in the pound, brought a vicious reversal in the UK
stock market, which fell heavily yesterday afternoon. Led downwards by a
collapse in stock index futures, the FT-SE Index closed a net 34.5 points
off, a turnround of more than 50 points from the opening minutes of the
session. Gloom deepened at the close on reports of a negative Maastricht
opinion poll in France.
Increased Seaq volume reflected hectic trading between marketmakers as they
struggled to avoid taking on positions in what has become a very dangerous
market. Pressure from stock index futures, where the September contract on
the Footsie was at a discount to the cash market at one time, provided the
driving force for equities. But there was no doubt that it was the interest
rate worries provoked by currency markets which did the damage .
Equities opened higher and the Footsie showed a gain of nearly 17 points in
early trading. Euphoria quickly vanished as Finland effectively quit the ERM
and devalued its currency, Sweden raised interest rates and Italian
repurchase rates jumped to record highs - all acting to protect their
currencies and leaving sterling in the firing line.
As sterling dropped below the important DM2.80 level again, UK share prices
quickly turned back. By late afternoon, the pound was within a pfennig of
its permitted ERM floor and the Footsie had plunged by more than 35 points.
A very modest rally brought a final reading of 2,337.7, down 34.5.
Sentiment was further discouraged by some, at least, of the day's corporate
reporting statements. Shares in Fisons, the pharmaceuticals group, fell
sharply on lower profits, the stock extending the substantial loss suffered
earlier in the year when concerns about the trading outlook first surfaced
in the market.
The rest of the drug share sector declined cautiously while awaiting further
trading news from leading names. Glaxo, reporting full-year figures on
Thursday, receded after the firm performances of recent sessions.
The renewed worry over sterling, and therefore over domestic interest rates,
hit hard in the building sector as brokerage houses again downgraded the
leading stocks. A reduced dividend payment, together with lower profits,
from George Wimpey hurt the housebuilding sector. But store shares held up
fairly well, helped by the increased consumer debt levels reported on the
previous day.
Seaq volume finally totalled 418.1m shares, comparing favourably with the
299.8m of the previous session. But Monday's total, which reflected retail,

FT  09 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow lower as market reflects
on jobs data

Wall Street
US SHARE prices weakened across the board yesterday as investors continued
to digest the implications of Friday's disappointing employment news, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 21.34 down at 3,260.59, near the
day's low. The market was closed on Monday for Labor Day. The Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 declined 2.64 to 414.44, while the American SE composite slipped
1.49 to 383.36 and the Nasdaq composite lost 2.27 to 571.17. Turnover on the
New York SE was light at 161m shares.
The ramifications of last week's announcement by the Labor department that
non-farm payrolls had fallen 83,000 in August, against analysts'
expectations of a rise (analysts had been expecting a solid increase in
payrolls), continued to dominate market sentiment.
The main focus of attention was on monetary policy, and whether the Federal
Reserve would follow Friday's  1/4 percentage point reduction in the Federal
Funds rate to 3 per cent with a similar, or bigger, cut in the more
important discount rate. Speculation has also centred on the possibility of
additional fiscal stimulus for the economy.
HJ Heinz fell Dollars 1 in early trading after the food group appeared to
disappoint the market with fiscal first-quarter profits of 55 cents a share,
down sharply from the 95 cents earned at the same stage a year ago. Analysts
later hailed the figures as a solid result, once one-off factors were
excluded, and the shares ended a net Dollars  3/8 off at Dollars 41 1/2 .
Banks were lower on concern that they would gain little from lower interest
rates and that this year's rally in the sector could be over. Chemical
retreated Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 31 1/2 , Chase Manhattan Dollars  3/4 to
Dollars 22, BankAmerica Dollars 1 to Dollars 42 7/8 and Citicorp Dollars
7/8 to Dollars 15 1/2 .
The repercussions of Hurricane Andrew, now deemed the worst natural disaster
in US history, continued to afflict certain stocks. Sears Roebuck dipped
Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 40 3/4 in active trading after Wall Street
securities house Salomon Brothers cut its 1992 earnings estimate for the
company from Dollars 4.20 a share to Dollars 3 to reflect the greater than
expected losses that Sears' Allstate Insurance subsidiary expects to incur
because of hurricane damage in south Florida and Louisiana.
Genentech climbed Dollars 1 to Dollars 33 1/2 after broking house Smith
Barney upgraded the stock to a 'buy' in the expectation that new product
introductions will spur a sharp rise in earnings for the California biotech
company.
Carriage Industries jumped Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 12 1/4 on news that the
carpet supplier and manufacturer's chairman and his affiliates plan to sell
their 46.5 per cent stake to textiles group Dixie Yarns for Dollars 13.25 a
share in cash. Dixie Yarns fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 9 1/2 on the Nasdaq
market.
Canada
THE Toronto market stayed within a narrow range all day in spite of the
downward pressure exerted by the lower Wall Street values.
The TSE 300 index eased only 4.9 to 3,451.9, while overall advances held a
small lead over declines by 267 to 252 after volume of 29.4m shares valued
at CDollars 308.8m.
Seagram receded CDollars  5/8 to CDollars 34 3/4 . The board has renewed the
company's authorisation to buy up to 5 per cent of its common shares, a
maximum of 18.8m shares.

FT  09 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei extends its
losses as investors take profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PROFIT-taking by investment trusts and dealers, combined with a lack of new
buyers, depressed share prices, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average closed 157.76 easier at 18,282.42. It rose to the day's
high of 18,756.32 on arbitrage-related buying and speculative short-term
trading, but fell later to a low of 18,279.41 on profit-taking. Traders said
activity was led by arbitrage-linked trading ahead of this Friday's
settlement of September futures and options contracts.
Volume remained flat at 400m shares, against 402m. Declines outscored
advances by 713 to 290, with 145 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all
first section stocks shed 18.70 to 1,391.86, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50
index dipped 2.49 to 1,117.94.
Individual investors took profits on short-term holdings, while institutions
remained inactive. 'Prices have moved too fast recently,' explained a fund
manager at Dai-Ichi Life.
Traders said the upward momentum in share prices seemed to have come to a
temporary halt, although underlying sentiment remains firm. Last week, long
margin positions continued to increase, reflecting bullish sentiment.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange said the balance of long positions on the stock
exchanges in Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya increased by Y93.5bn last week to an
outstanding Y1,754.9bn. Margin selling rose by Y48.4bn to Y573bn, as some
investors became cautious after the recent sharp gains.
Banks were easier on profit-taking. Industrial Bank of Japan lost Y30 to
Y2,930 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Y50 to Y1,800. Brokers were also weaker,
with Nomura Securities off Y10 at Y1,720.
Individuals and dealers took profits on speculative theme stocks. Nippon
Zeon, the most active issue of the day, gained ground on the 'Aids' theme in
the morning session, but finished a net Y3 down at Y767 on profit-taking.
Some issues remained firm on margin buying, Meiji Milk Products adding Y10
at Y1,140 and Green Cross Y10 at Y1,730.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone lost Y14,000 to Y585,000, falling for the
third consecutive day. Traders said investors who had bought the issue at
lower prices were realising gains.
In Osaka, the OSE average receded 198.13 to 19,936.49 in volume of 20.6m
shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, declined Y100 to Y10,700.
Roundup
LOCAL issues dominated trading among the region's markets yesterday.
TAIWAN fell heavily on news that a warrant had been issued for the arrest of
Mr Oung Ta-ming, head of the Hualon Group. The group controls a number of
speculative stocks, which fell steeply, dragging the rest of the market
down. The weighted index weakened 93.89, or 2.4 per cent, to 3,758.38 in
turnover of TDollars 21.07bn.
Sentiment was also hit after a number of banks said they would reduce
lending to electronics companies.
SYDNEY lost further ground to close at its lowest level since June 1991. The
All Ordinaries index, which fell below 1,500 in early trade, closed 13.1
down at 1,501.8 in turnover of ADollars 209.8m.
Banks again led the market lower, with Westpac and ANZ under pressure
following a broker's downgrade. Westpac shed 3 cents to ADollars 2.80 while
ANZ declined 10 cents to ADollars 2.98.
HONG KONG firmed ahead of today's resumption of talks between China and the
UK, aimed at breaking the deadlock over the financing of the new airport.
The Hang Seng index moved forward 36.18 to 5,700.59 but turnover fell to
HKDollars 1.14bn from HKDollars 1.32bn.
Hopewell Holdings appreciated 15 cents to HKDollars 5.15 prior to releasing
better than expected final results after the close.
SEOUL was subjected to profit-taking, the composite index ending 4.24 lower
at 553.35 in turnover of Won365.15bn. Companies with links to China gained,
following the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two
countries. Falls outnumbered rises by 514 to 271, with 105 issues unchanged.
MANILA closed little changed following light trading. The composite index
lost 0.80 to 1,412.90 in combined turnover of 216m pesos. Oil shares firmed
in late trading in anticipation of the start of commercial drilling at the
West Linapacan oil field next month.
KUALA LUMPUR extended its gains ahead of today's national holiday. The
composite index put on 1.77 to 586.61 but volume remained low, while
SINGAPORE was dominated by trading in Malaysian companies as the Straits
Times Industrial index rose 11.61 to 1,377.20 in turnover of SDollars 64.7m.
NEW ZEALAND's NZSE-40 index finished 14.65 weaker at 1,472.78 in low
turnover of NZDollars 12m.
BOMBAY's BSE index fell 25.06 to 3,201.46.

FT  09 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Finnish move puts pressure on
Sweden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRICE of the profligate 1980s, which has plagued Nordic equity markets
over the past twelve months, came back to upset Finland and Sweden
yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
STOCKHOLM dropped to a year's low as the krona came under pressure from
Finland's decision to float the markka. The Swedish central bank raised its
key marginal rate to 24 per cent from 16 per cent in order to protect its
currency. The Affarsvarlden General Index dropped 22.5 or 3 per cent to
728.2 in turnover of SKr456m after SKr197m.
The insurance group Trygg-Hansa cancelled its capital-raising plans because
of the turbulence. Its B frees fell SKr5 to a new year's low of SKr27.
The forestry sector was one of the main losers. Stora B frees fell SKr17 to
SKr205 and SCA B frees lost SKr7 to SKr79. MoDo B frees fell SKr25 to SKr125
on fears that SCA might sell its 16 per cent stake in MoDo.
In HELSINKI, the Hex index jumped 27.4 or 5.1 per cent to 568.4 in an
initial reaction to the central bank's decision to stop defending the
markka, a move which should make Finnish companies more competitive, in the
short term at least.
FRANKFURT retreated from early highs after the Bundesbank president, Mr
Helmut Schlesinger, said again yesterday that he saw no room to lower German
interest rates. After a 5.20 rise to 609.85 in the FAZ index at midsession,
the DAX closed 3.92 higher at 1,544.55. Turnover fell to DM5bn from DM3.4bn.
The car sector saw solid gains. Volkswagen recovered DM5.20 to DM319,
probably on short-covering following Morgan Stanley's earnings downgrade
late last week; Daimler added DM3.50 to DM633.50 and BMW DM6 to DM513.
Allianz rose DM34, or just under 2 per cent to DM1,757 after DB Research
changed its recommendation to 'neutral'.
Karstadt led retailers lower with a DM13 fall to DM534 possibly anticipating
poor German retail sales figures later this week.
PARIS drifted lower, but individual shares were active. The CAC-40 index
dropped 15.63 to 1,763.67 in moderate turnover of FFr1.6bn.
Bancaire rose as high as FFr334, following the publication of its interim
results, before closing FFr14 or 4.6 per cent higher at FFr322. The share is
in demand with investors wanting to increase their weighting in interest
rate-sensitive stocks.
Carrefour bounced back FFr24 to FFr2,100 after the previous day's slump, as
did Accor which rose FFr12 to FFr532. But dealers expect Accor to fall back,
since the chairman's gloomy profit forecast should prompt downward revisions
of 1992 earnings forecasts.
L'Oreal was busy on speculation about Nestle's intentions towards the
haircare products group. The stock ended FFr8 lower at FFr991.
MILAN closed broadly firmer in a technical rebound, but came off the day's
highs on news that Mr Giovanni Agnelli, the chairman of Fiat, expected the
group's turnover to be hit by last week's discount rate increase. The Comit
index rose 3.95 to 365.48 in turnover estimated at around Monday's L73.3bn.
Fiat was fixed L24 higher at L3,595, while one of the session's best
performers was Banca Commerciale Italiana, which rose L154 to L2,470 on
renewed speculation that the bank would soon be privatised.
AMSTERDAM slipped further with the drinks sector again providing most of the
interest. The CBS Tendency index closed 0.3 weaker at 109.0.
Bols lost Fl 1.00 to Fl 42.40 before reporting a 3.6 per cent increase in
interim earnings and forecasting a higher 1992 net profit, after the close.
Grolsch, which publishes its first half figures this morning, fell Fl 1.00
to Fl 219 while Heineken was down Fl 1.80 at Fl 165.20.
The financial and publishing sectors went against the trend with Wolters
Kluwer up 30 cents at Fl 79.60 and AMEV 80 cents higher at FL 55.40.
ZURICH was flat overall, the SMI index easing 0.3 to 1,788.1, featuring a
SFr13 decline in Ciba-Geigy to SFr612 because of the lower dollar and a drop
of SFr90 to SFr1,460 in Ascom on worries over its 1992 earnings.
BRUSSELS lacked direction at the start of the new account and the Bel-20
index finished 1.90 higher at 1,068.66 in low turnover of BFr480m.
Delhaize advanced BFr19 to BFr1,515 on news that it hopes to develop
supermarket chains in Czechoslovakia and Greece while UCB, the chemical
group, gained BFr450 or 2 per cent to BFr22,350 ahead of tomorrow's interim
results.
VIENNA climbed nearly 2 per cent as the ATX index rose 14.81 to 759.98.
Radex, in mining and fireproof materials, led the market higher, rising
Sch19, or 4.5 per cent to Sch443.
MADRID retreated further on profit-taking while the banking sector came
under renewed pressure. The general index fell 2.86 to 212.70.

FT  09 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets: Argentina falls victim to forced
selling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Latin America provided the best and worst performers among the emerging
markets in August. According to data provided by the IFC, part of the World
Bank, Argentina fell by 13.7 per cent and Venezuela rose by 9.9 per cent in
dollar terms.
Analysts say Argentina was driven lower by forced selling by leveraged
domestic operators so that they could meet their margin commitments.
However, they note that the market has bounced back by around 5 per cent
since the start of September.
The prolonged liquidation of positions last month was accentuated by
below-average daily turnover of around Dollars 50m, and the lack of
institutional buyers meant that there was virtually no support on the
downside.
The market's drop was compounded by selling by disappointed domestic
investors, who had speculated that foreign investors were about to return.
Mr Marc Wenhammer, an in-house fund manager at Latin American Securities,
says there was no fundamental reason for the fall in Argentina. In fact,
there have been some good corporate results which have prompted selective
buying since the end of the month.
Venezuela's advance was more due to an absence of bad news, which encouraged
the more intrepid investors, mainly specialist US funds, to pick up
bargains. Lower interest rates also prompted a switch into equities.
Positive developments on the macro-economic front - GDP rose by 8.5 per cent
in the first half of 1992 from the year-ago period - as well as some good
company results contributed to the short term stability.
The second best performance in August came from South Korea, up 9.6 per cent
following the implementation of long-awaited, market-boosting measures and
the country's signing of diplomatic ties with China. The market has also
been encouraged by the recovery in the Tokyo stock market.
India came a close third, up 9.3 per cent on hopes that a government package
to stimulate the economy will boost equity values, which have languished
since a securities scandal broke early last May.
A more detailed article on Argentina's stock market by John Barham, our
correspondent in Buenos Aires, is scheduled to run on this page later this
week.

FT  09 SEP 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Devaluation drives up D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOTH THE dollar and sterling weakened further against the D-Mark yesterday
after Finland broke the markka's link with the Ecu, sparking fears of a
devaluation of the weaker currencies in the European Monetary System, writes
James Blitz.
Although it is not an EMS currency, the Finnish markka had been informally
linked to the Ecu as part of Finland's strategy of applying for European
Community membership. However, the overvaluation of the markka had led to
high interest rates and a reduction in Finnish foreign currency reserves
through intervention.
The Bank of Finland devalued the currency by 14 per cent last November by
floating it on the foreign exchanges for one day. Yesterday it repeated the
move, but this time the bank's governor said it would take 'much longer than
days or weeks' to see exactly what value the markka would have.
By last night, the markka had effectively devalued by 13 per cent from its
previous close against the Ecu. Its exchange rate was quoted at DM31.60 per
100 markka at the end of European trading, against a fixing on Monday of
DM36.30.
Finland's devaluation highlighted how small the global currency village has
become. Sweden's central bank was immediately forced to put up its most
important lending rate by 8 percentage points to protect the Swedish krona,
which traders see as the next prime target for devaluation. Several analysts
warned that the Swedish authorities cannot sustain such high rates for long.
The devaluation also upset trading in an already troubled EMS. Sellers of
Finnish markka mostly opted for D-Marks. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the
Bundesbank president, also drove the D-Mark upwards by saying there was
nothing new in a statement he had made at the weekend that the German
central bank will not raise short-term interest rates again.
Sterling fell to a low of DM2.7850, less than a pfennig above its ERM floor
of DM2.7780, before finishing at DM2.7875, down  3/4 pfennig on the day. The
dollar closed more than a pfennig lower in Europe, at DM1.3915, but in New
York it picked up to end at DM1.3940. Traders anticipate a cut in the
Federal Reserve's discount rate following last week's unexpectedly low
figure for US non-farm payroll in August, and believe that the dollar could
test its historic low again.
In the short term, the pound remains well underpinned against the D-Mark,
after the UK government's announcement last week that it is borrowing
Ecu10bn to convert into sterling on the foreign exchanges. But the Treasury
must be disappointed to see its borrowing plan overshadowed by so many
ill-timed tremors in the currency markets.

FT  09 SEP 92 / Money Markets: Futures fall sharply
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING futures fell back sharply yesterday, reflecting new fears of a rise
in interest rates, after turmoil in Scandinavian markets led to a new bout
of investment in the D-Mark.
Finland's decision to float the markka yesterday morning triggered a run on
the currency and a new bout of investment in D-Marks, pushing sterling below
DM2.79 for most of the day.
Money market dealers remain certain that the Bank of England will defend the
currency if it needs to by means of heavy intervention, helped by last
week's substantial D-Mark loan from international banks. But the dollar's
continued fall against the German currency and the forthcoming French
referen-dum on Maastricht may make the next few weeks tricky for central
banks.
If the French vote No in their referendum, the consequences for interest
rates could be serious: Sweden's decision to push up short-term interest
rates by 8 percentage points to 24 per cent was a frightening example of
what central banks in other parts of Europe might have to do to staunch
further flows into D-Marks.
The December short sterling contract reflected the underlying nervousness.
It opened at 89.68 and promptly fell to a low of 89.44 in the early
afternoon. It closed the session at 89.46. Trading in the September contract
was less volatile because the contract matures next Wednesday. Yest-erday
the September contract ended 17 basis points below its opening level, at
89.51.
There was thin trading in the cash markets, where three-month money, an
important indicator of where the market thinks rates are moving, firmed to
an offered rate of 10 7/16 per cent at the end of the day from a previous
close of 10 1/4 per cent.
The Bank of England forecast a small shortage of Pounds 500m in the morning,
but it took most of the day to remove. The overnight rate hovered below 10
per cent for most of the day, so clearing banks borrowed short term money
instead of offering the Bank bills.
The Bank purchased Pounds 41m of Band 4 bank bills at 9 per cent. The
forecast was revised to Pounds 550m and the Bank bought Pounds 197m of Band
1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent. Late assistance was Pounds 330m.

FT  09 SEP 92 / Government Bonds: Flotation of Finnish markka causes
investor confusion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Nordic government bond markets were dominated by Finland's decision to
allow the markka to float freely against other currencies, abandoning its
link with the Ecu.
The markka fell by about 13 per cent against the Ecu yesterday, and
short-term interest rates jumped in Finland, Sweden and Norway.
Dealers in Helsinki said trading in the Finnish government bond market was
'extremely hectic' as investors were in a state of confusion about the
implications for bond yields.
Bond yields rose initially, but fell later in the day to end lower. The 11
per cent bond due June 1995 opened at a yield of 14.13 per cent and ended at
13.62 per cent, while the 11 per cent bond due January 1999 saw a drop in
yield from 13.12 per cent to 12.76 per cent.
The Swedish Riksbank, the country's central bank, was forced to raise its
marginal rate from 16 per cent to 24 per cent in an attempt to prevent a
massive outflow of capital.
There were rumours in the financial markets that some SKr30bn flooded out of
Sweden in the morning, although the Riksbank would not comment on how much
had left Sweden.
The marginal rate, which sets the terms for Swedish banks' borrowing with
the Riksbank, had been raised to 16 per cent from 13 per cent only two weeks
ago in an attempt to reverse capital outflows from Sweden.
Swedish bond yields soared with the 10 1/4 per cent bond due 2003 yielding
10.80 per cent at the close, against 10.51 per cent at the end of the
previous trading day. At the short end, the yield on the 11.2 per cent bond
due 1994 rose from 12.85 at the opening to 13.65 per cent.
OUTSIDE Scandinavia, the impact of Finland's decision to float the markka
was most keenly felt in European markets which are seen as potential victims
of currency devaluation. Prices in gilts and Italian bonds were the hardest
hit, as the realisation that the Finnish central bank appeared to be using
up its currency reserves to no avail further undermined confidence in the
ability of the UK and Italy to defend their currencies in difficult market
conditions.
Italian bond prices bore the brunt of growing fears about potential currency
devaluation, due to an increasing awareness of the scale of structural
problems in the Italian economy. Ten-year Italian bonds fell more than a
point yesterday as the lira came under renewed pressure, despite Friday's
discount rate rise to 15 per cent. Yesterday's short-term repo rate was set
at over 20 per cent, up nearly 2 1/2 points from Friday.
The gilts market lost close to a point yesterday, with the gilts market
closing at 96.26, down  31/32 point, as the news from Scandinavia put
sterling under renewed pressure.
'Foreign investors decided that maybe last week's brilliant package (the
Treasury's Ecu10bn loan designed to support sterling) was not so brilliant
after all,' said Mr John Kendal, economist at Baring Sterling Bonds. 'Some
of the benefit of that news has been unwound.'
The German bond market out-performed most other European bond markets
yesterday, to end just slightly lower on the day. The yield spread between
10-year gilts and bunds widened substantially from 160 basis points to 174
basis points. The bund market is providing a safe haven for many investors
ahead of the Maastricht referendum in France on September 20, since it is
likely to be well underpinned whatever the outcome of the vote. Further,
although the Bundesbank is still not expect to cut official interest rates,
hopes of some easing of money-market rates soon are growing.
The French market continues to track the constant flow of opinion polls on
the outcome of the Maastricht referendum. The OAT future on the Matif, the
Paris futures exchange, closed 10 basis points lower, but lost further
ground after the latest polls showed a narrower lead for the yes camp than
other recent surveys have suggested.
Dealers said a slim yes vote is now discounted in the French bond market,
but the market is likely to continue to fluctuate as conflicting poll
results emerge.
US Treasury prices yesterday retained the firm tone they adopted last week
following an unexpectedly bad August employment report. A big move out of
mortgage-backed securities and into intermediate-term government paper was
also behind the market's big gains.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  27/32 at 100
13/16 , yielding 7.211 per cent. At the short end of the market the two-year
note was up  1/8 at 100 27/32 to yield 3.786 per cent.
Dealers and investors remained optimistic about the outlook for the market
in the wake of the big decline in August non-farm payrolls and the Federal
Reserve's subsequent easing of monetary policy, which came in the form of a
quarter-point cut in the Fed funds rate to 3 per cent.
Speculation centred on whether the Fed would follow that with a cut in the
discount rate, but the consensus of opinion was that no further easing was
likely, partly due to the continued weakness of the dollar.

FT  09 SEP 92 / International Bonds: Council of Europe and LKB dollar issues
meet strong demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE market for fixed-rate US dollar Eurobonds, comatose in recent weeks, was
shaken back into life yesterday with strong demand for large issues from the
Council of Europe and the Export Development Corporation of Canada.
With a third big dollar issue promised for today from Landeskreditbank
Baden-Wurttemberg (LKB), the continuing weakness of the US currency appears
to have done little to dent the interest of investors willing to believe the
dollar is near its bottom.
The Council of Europe's Dollars 250m deal, launched at a spread of 32 basis
points over US Treasuries, met good demand equally from the far east and
Europe.
The joint lead managers, which took Dollars 164m between them, reported a
sell-out soon after launch.
Although there was reported to be stronger demand for five-year paper, the
Council of Europe's seven-year bonds found a ready home and were trading
late in the day at a slightly narrower spread, despite a rally in
Treasuries.
The proceeds were swapped into fixed rate yen: however, at least one other
big issuer is planning to come to the Euroyen sector directly. The European
Investment Bank is reported to be planning a Y50bn, five-year issue, perhaps
before the end of this week.
The second large dollar deal of the day from a top-rated borrower, EDC,
caused some surprise in being pitched at a maturity of 12 years, against the
general view that most demand was for shorter-dated bonds. However, several
banks reported good demand for the issue, which was formally announced after
the close in the far east.
Meanwhile, barring a disaster in the US dollar market, LKB is due tomorrow
to launch its much-trailed Dollars 500m, 10-year issue.
The spread over Treasuries will be set at 33 to 35 basis points, said JP
Morgan, which is leading the issue.
IN a rare mortgage-backed issue from a continental European institution,
Svensk Fastigetskredit, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Skandinaviska
Enskilda Banken, announced plans for a Dollars 384m deal through Goldman
Sachs.
The third issue of its type through the special purpose vehicle Osprey
Mortgage Securities, the AAA-rated bonds, issued in four tranches, will be
priced today.
The first two tranches, totalling more than Dollars 160m and with average
lives of 3 years and 3.9 years, will be priced to yield 77 to 80 basis
points and 61 to 65 basis points over US Treasuries respectively, Goldman
said.
The remaining tranches are being placed privately.

FT  09 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: Italy ready to open new
domestic bond exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S domestic bond futures market is finally ready to open on Friday,
after several delays caused by technical problems.
The new exchange - the Mercato Italiano Futures (MIF) - will have to compete
with the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange's
successful BTP futures contract, which records an average daily volume of
more than 16,000 contracts.
Liffe has already seen off competition from a rival contract on the Matif,
the Paris-based exchange.
The timing of the launch - a week ahead of the French referendum on
Maastricht - has caused some raised eyebrows among traders.
The Italian bond market has been one of the worst victims of Denmark's
rejection of the Maastricht treaty in June.
Last Friday, the Bank of Italy hiked the discount rate to 15 per cent and
fears of a currency devaluation continue to undermine the bond market.
But the high level of volatility in the Italian government bond market could
attract some market participants.
In practice, the new market will have to count on attracting domestic
participants, many of which have not been active in the Liffe contract - or
any other futures contracts.
However, such a base could take some time to build.
MIF has been added to Italy's existing Telematico system, a screen-based
government bond trading system.

FT  09 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: Liffe abandons plan for
second gilt future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange has
abandoned plans to launch a second gilt future, following a survey of market
participants which revealed a lack of confidence in the market's ability to
sustain two liquid gilt contracts.
Instead, Liffe has decided to amend the contract terms of its existing gilt
future, in order to meet growing international demand for a contract which
mirrors other European government bond futures.
From the June 1993 delivery month, gilts will qualify as deliverable only if
they have a maturity of 10 to 15 years and a single redemption date.
The existing contract, known as the long gilt contract, is based on gilt
issues which mature between 2003 and 2009.
'On balance, the market felt we should stick with what we have, but modify
the structure,' said Mr Philip Bruce, head of non-equity product development
at the exchange.
Other European government contracts are based on 10-year bonds, which
facilitates spread-trading between different European markets.
Although the new contract terms specify a 10 to 15 year maturity range, in
practice the future will be priced off the 10-year gilt, because the
shortest maturity will be the cheapest to deliver, unless the shape of the
yield curve changes.
Liffe had considered introducing a second gilt futures contract - based on
gilts maturing in 15 years or more - in order to meet growing demand for a
means of hedging longer-dated gilts, following the launch earlier this year
of new gilts maturing in 20 and 25 years.
Ironically, Liffe's medium gilt contract introduced in 1987 - which was
based on 10-year gilts - failed to take off and was suspended in 1990.
The exchange will review the potential for the introduction of a
longer-dated contract once the amended contract has established itself, but
a significant boost in confidence among market participants will be needed
before plans for a second contract are revived, Liffe said.
The existing long gilt future has an average daily turnover of 50,000
contracts.

FT  09 SEP 92 / International Company News: Federal Mogul to seal TRW deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DETROIT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FEDERAL Mogul, the US vehicle components manufacturer, says that it is to
pay Dollars 213m to acquire the automotive aftermarket business of TRW, the
US technology group.
Federal Mogul also plans to take a Dollars 14m charge in the fourth quarter
of 1992 to cover job cuts, relocations and asset disposals connected with
the deal, Reuter reports from Detroit.
Federal Mogul, which announced the acquisition on August 23, disclosed the
information in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Federal Mogul also said that it estimated that total expenses for the
rationalisation of the purchase would reach about Dollars 28m.
The remaining Dollars 14m which was not taken in the fourth quarter charge
would be capitalised, the company declared.
The expenses relate to the costs of eliminating duplication between the two
companies' aftermarket parts operations in the areas of personnel,
warehousing, information management, shipping, marketing and administration.
Federal Mogul also said it believed that by eliminating such duplication it
could achieve cost savings of about Dollars 21m a year during and after
1995, with about 95 per cent of that figure realised during 1994.
The deal for the TRW aftermarket parts distribution business, which has
annual sales of more than Dollars 300m, also includes a long-term supply and
trademark agreement.
That agreement makes Federal Mogul the exclusive supplier of TRW-brand
engine and chassis parts to the independent automotive aftermarket business.
The transaction is expected to close by the end of October.
Federal Mogul said it would finance the acquisition with a combination of
equity and bank debt but the company had not determined the amount of each.
Chemical Banking had agreed to provide senior bank financing under a term
loan, Federal Mogul said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BOMBARDIER, the Canadian transport equipment maker, is creating a single
business unit to sell its new Canadair Regional Jet and the de Havilland
Dash 8 commuter aircraft.
The combined marketing effort arises from Bombardier's purchase earlier this
year of a controlling interest in Toronto-based de Havilland, which was
previously owned by Boeing, the US aircraft maker.
Bombardier also owns Short Brothers of Belfast, and the US business jet
maker, Learjet.
The 50-seat Regional Jet (RJ), an expanded version of the Canadair
Challenger, is due to enter service next month with Lufthansa's CityLine.
Bombardier currently has 36 orders and the same number of options for the
RJ, more than half from Comair, a US regional airline.
De Havilland has delivered 329 Dash 8 aircraft and the company has orders
for another 54.
Combining sales and customer support services will enable Bombardier to
reduce costs and to offer customers a wider variety of products in the
highly-competitive commuter aircraft market.
Bombardier said Boeing exercised an option with Bombardier worth CDollars
70m (USDollars 58.8m) for the continued manufacture of Boeing 767 rear
fuselage sections by Bombardier's Canadair unit, Reuter reports.
This option allowed Canadair to continue deliveries until the first quarter
of 1996.
Canadair has manufactured the 31 ft rear fuselage section since 1979.

<TEXT>
NORMANDY Poseidon, the Australian resources group, yesterday reported a 46
per cent rise in net profits to ADollars 33.6m (USDollars 24m) for the year
to June 30, up from ADollars 23m a year earlier, AP-DJ reports from
Adelaide.
However, the company noted that comparisons with the previous year were not
meaningful, due to new accounting standards and the merger between Normandy
Resources and Poseidon in May 1991.
Sales advanced to ADollars 680.9m from ADollars 58.5m. Earnings per share,
however, were down 33 per cent at 6.8 cent compared with 10.1 cents and the
dividend is being cut by 27 per cent to 5.5 cents a share from 7.5 cents.
Normandy Poseidon said that the comparisons with the previous year were
distorted by new accounting standards on consolidation and by the fact that
the former results included the merged Normandy and Poseidon groups for only
two months: 'The group believes that this is an excellent result in a year
which saw significant diversification through acquisition and internal
reorganisation aimed at providing a sound base for the future.'
Normandy Poseidon is controlled by Mr Robert Champion de Crespigny. It
controls Poseidon Gold, an Australian goldmining concern, and Gold Mines of
Kalgoorlie, which owns half of the Super Pit gold mine in Western Australia.
It also controls Mt Leyshon Gold Mines.
Normandy Poseidon also has diamond and oil interests.

FT  09 SEP 92 / International Company News: Genting takes an overseas gamble
/ Examining the Malaysian group's move on Lonrho
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Drive 35 miles out of Kuala Lumpur into the hills and you come across one of
the most successful money making ventures in modern Malaysia.
In the cool air, 6,000ft above sea level, is the Genting Highlands resort: a
complex of hotels, condominiums, sporting and amusement facilities. Most
people do not go to Genting to enjoy the mountain air or play tennis - they
go to gamble at Malaysia's only casino, a 60,000 sq ft emporium - one of the
biggest such centres in East Asia, patronised by about 10,000 punters daily.
The resort is owned by Genting Group, one of Malaysia's biggest and richest
companies, which last month confirmed it and associate companies had spent
MDollars 150m (USDollars 60m) building a 5.83 per cent stake in Lonrho, the
troubled UK conglomerate. Genting's move on Lonrho has prompted speculation
about a possible takeover bid: analysts point to Genting's cash hoard
estimated to be about MDollars 1bn. Genting has said it made the Lonrho
share purchases for 'investment purposes'.
Lonrho has been at the centre of controversy since it sold a one-third stake
in the UK-based Metropole Hotels group for Pounds 177.5m (Dollars 353.2m) to
the Libyan Arab Finance Company, the main investment vehicle of Colonel
Muammer Gadaffi, the Libyan leader.
The US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) recently
warned Lonrho could be placed on the US government's list of banned
companies if Libya acquired a shareholding giving it significant influence
in the running of a Lonrho company. This has concerned Lonrho's
second-biggest shareholder, Fidelity Management Research, the US mutual
institutional investor. Lonrho's shares yesterday closed at 68 1/2 p close
to its eight-year low of 65 1/2 p.
Genting is a diversified group involved not only in gaming and leisure
activities but also in plantations - manufacturing palm oil and rubber
products, paper mills, property and financial services. But the Genting
Highlands casino is Genting's core business, a cash cow viewed with envy by
many a corporate rustler.
Genting's main companies, listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange, are
Genting Berhad, the group's investment holding company, Resorts World, which
looks after the gaming and hotels business, and Asiatic Development, which
oversees the plantations sector. Genting is one of Malaysia's biggest
corporate tax payers and employers and as a group accounts for more than 6
per cent of the total market capitalisation of the Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange.
In the year to December 1991 Genting Berhad's pre-tax profits came to
MDollars 581.5m, a 22 per cent increase on 1990. Resorts World contributed
MDollars 459.7m or nearly 80 per cent of that figure, almost all of it
believed to have come from gaming activities.
Genting is what Malaysian analysts describe as 'a highly sensitive company'.
Malays, who make up over 50 per cent of Malaysia's population and dominate
government, are Moslems. In Islam gambling is 'haram' or unlawful.
While the Genting resort is a magnet for thousands of Chinese who flock
there from Malaysia, Singapore and elsewhere in Asia, Malays are not
supposed to enter the casino complex.
Genting Berhad was formed in the late 1960s with the stated aim of
developing the highlands above Kuala Lumpur into an integrated hill resort.
In 1971 Genting was granted the sole licence in Malaysia to run a casino.
Recently large sums have been spent by the group in efforts to attract what
are called 'high roller' gamblers from the increasingly affluent East Asia
region.
Genting is controlled by Mr Lim Goh Tong, the Malaysian-Chinese
multi-millionaire and his family. Like Mr 'Tiny' Rowland, head of Lonrho, Mr
Lim is in his mid-70s.
Both men share a highly personalised approach to running their businesses.
But while Mr Rowland is known for his flair and what at times is deemed to
be his rather eccentric corporate behaviour, Mr Lim is part of the tradition
of family orientated Chinese businessmen.
A member of the Hokkien Chinese dialect group Mr Lim is known as one of
Malaysia's cleverest property developers. Mr Lim and one of his sons, runs
Genting tightly: he rarely appears in public and although he and other
Genting directors were recently awarded handsome retirement gratuity
payments, Mr Lim is not known for following a lavish lifestyle.
Apart from his Genting interests, Mr Lim has other ventures. He recently
gave a Dollars 55m loan to an American Indian tribe - the Mashantucket
Pequot - to build a casino on reservation land in Connecticut. Mr Lim is
also believed to have secured substantial mining rights in Vietnam.
Many of Malaysia's corporate elite are questioning the rationale behind
Genting's move into Lonrho. With a positive cash flow of about MDollars 300m
per year Genting is actively looking at investment opportunities. But moves
overseas are hampered by domestic political considerations.
The Malaysian government, on whom Genting depends for the quarterly renewal
of its gaming licence, might not look kindly on a leading Malaysian company
investing overseas substantial amounts of capital generated within the
country.
It appears there are those in Genting who feel Lonrho's third-world
connections have been treated unfairly by the western financial
establishment and media: Lonrho, they feel, is undervalued. The government
of Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister, sees itself as a
leading spokesman of the third world. Lonrho's extensive connections and
business interests in the under-developed regions might make a Genting
investment more politically acceptable at home.
Others say Genting is chasing a trading opportunity. In the late 1980s it
purchased a substantial stake in Cooper's Tires, one of the US's biggest
tyre producers. There was speculation then about a takeover bid. In the
event, Cooper's shares rallied and Genting sold at a considerable profit. A
similar strategy might be under way at Lonrho.
The Malaysian corporate community has not given a friendly reception to
Genting's latest foray. 'They have been very good on their own home
territory but I doubt their ability to mix it with the big boys overseas,'
said one leading Malaysian financier.
But no one doubts the shrewdness of Mr Lim and his close circle of advisers.

FAI Insurances, the Australian financial services group, remained in the red
in the 12 months to June, but reduced its net losses by 76 per cent to
ADollars 48.7m (USDollars 37.4m), from ADollars 204.2m a year earlier.
Mr Rodney Adler, chief executive, expects a further improvement in the
group's performance this year, although it is still budgeting for
underwriting losses.
He said the main reason for the lower losses was a reduction in the group's
underwriting deficit to ADollars 79m, from ADollars 191m. 'This improvement
has not come without cost, and our premium income, net of reinsurance, has
dropped from ADollars 651m to ADollars 518m,' he said.
'The insurance market remains very difficult, and despite the withdrawal and
merger activities of various underwriting companies both here and abroad,
premium rates remain generally insufficient.'
FAI in passed its dividend.
The latest losses came on a fall in revenue to ADollars 1.03m from ADollars
1.07m. Tax took ADollars 3m against a credit of ADollars 84.1m, while
depreciation was ADollars 31.6m, against ADollars 24.6m.

HONG Kong and China Gas, the local monopoly supplier of piped gas, yesterday
announced a 21.5 per cent increase in net profits to HKDollars 472.2m
(USDollars 61.1m) for the six months to June, writes Simon Davies.
The results for the company, which is better known as Towngas and is
controlled by Mr Lee Shau-kee's Henderson Land, were in line with stock
market expectations.
Turnover increased 12 per cent to HKDollars 1.53bn. Mr Lee said he was
confident of further increases in sales for the full year. In the past year,
Towngas has connected 65,057 new customers.
The company's expansion of its Tai Po plant is proceeding according to
schedule, and upon completion in the first quarter of 1993, it will double
overall production capacity.
It will 'be adequate to meet Towngas demand into the next century', said Mr
Lee. The new plant will leave another site redundant and available for
redevelopment into a residential property complex.
The company will pay an interim dividend of 36 cents. This compares with the
payout of 36 cents in 1991, adjusted for the company's bonus share issue.

at Hopewell Holdings

HOPEWELL Holdings, the Hong Kong property and construction group controlled
by local entrepreneur Mr Gordon Wu, yesterday announced a 126 per cent jump
in net profits to HKDollars 1.62bn (USDollars 209.6m)for the year to June,
compared with HKDollars 718.9m a year earlier.
However, the bulk of the rise in earnings was from one-off property sales
and interest income from the proceeds of last year's HKDollars 5.8bn rights
issue; their combined contribution came to more than HKDollars 900m.
The figures were in line with expectations, having been artificially boosted
by the sale of the group's Broadwood Road luxury residential development
site just before the year end. This helped nudge up earnings per share by 1
cent to 42 cents, despite the dilution from the rights issue.
Hopewell is going through a lull, while investors await returns from its big
infra-structural projects in China and Thailand.
Earnings are expected to increase in 1993, but only through further property
disposals; and then in 1994, it will receive the first returns from its
long-awaited Shenzhen-Guangzhou super-highway.
The company said the first phase of the toll road would be open to traffic
next year. This would ensure a sizeable early completion bonus equivalent to
the toll revenue up to the contract completion date of June 30 1994.
Analysts believe this could contribute about HKDollars 500m.
Hopewell is developing commercial centres in 10 of the interchanges on the
first phase. Meanwhile, it is finalising negotiations for the second stage
of the highway which will stretch from Guangzhou to Zhuhai.
The size of Hopewell's Shajiao 'C' power project was recently expanded from
two to three 660MW units, as a result of soaring demand for power in
Guangdong Province; the turnkey construction contract has just been signed.
Power stations, transport networks and related property projects have become
the three core operations of the group; other non-core assets will be sold
to fund the company's aggressive expansion programme and provide some profit
in the interim period.
Hopewell will pay a final dividend of 16 cents, making a full-year payout of
30 cents.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Asta Medica, the pharmaceuticals subsidiary of the Degussa metals and
chemicals group, made an acquisition in the state of Saxony, it went one
step further than other companies expanding into east Germany. So taken was
it with Arzneimittelwerk Dresden that it decided to shift its headquarters
there.
In fact, Asta, which plans to float a minority of its shares on the
Frankfurt stock market in 1993, had been contemplating moving from its
narrow site in Frankfurt. The purchase of AWD, the biggest pharmaceuticals
concern in east Germany, from the Treuhand privatisation agency last
December gave it the opportunity to do this and also to be close to the
extensive scientific, research, and medical facilities in and around the
Saxony capital.
Since Asta had been looking to expand its research activities, the purchase
of AWD, employing 2,200 people (including 450 scientists), enabled it to
fulfil another ambition. Asta, which had a turnover of DM900m (Dollars
642.8m) in its financial year to September 30 1991 and raised net income by
14 per cent to DM33m, was also attracted by AWD's facilities for chemical
synthesis; the company had supplied most of the East German industry's needs
for synthesised materials.
Another important reason for the deal was access to eastern Europe. Although
the economic travails of the former Comecon area have weakened this argument
temporarily, Mr Rolf Kramer, Asta's chief executive, has no doubt of the
possibilities. 'In the medium term, there is enormous potential for
pharmaceuticals, since eastern Europe's knowhow and infrastructure is not
well developed in this field.'
He sees future opportunities for co-operation and joint ventures in Russia
and the rest of eastern Europe once the region's economies develop
sufficiently to allow them to start building up their own pharmaceutical
industries.
'State agencies will ask western exporters to come up with investments in
Russia and elsewhere and to transfer knowhow,' he says. Companies such as
Asta could supply raw materials and semi-finished products, or begin with
local packaging operations. 'Russia and other countries would save hard
currency and have employment.'
In order to keep up the previous links with the east, Asta also bought the
former East German state trading company in pharmaceuticals. Like AWD, this
had been part of the big Germed pharmaceutical concern, now dissolved.
Fortunately for AWD, and unlike many other east German operations, its
business was not dominated by eastern Europe. About a third of its sales
were made there, a proportion which is falling steadily.
None of these various arguments in favour of AWD, which has nearly 10 per
cent of the east German market, would have weighed much with Asta if the
east German business had not been in solid shape.
In contrast to much of east German industry, the pharmaceutical sector did
not collapse with the coming of the D-Mark and exposure to western cost
levels. Nor was it hit by the preference of east Germans for western goods
after reunification.
'There is a very close relationship between the east German medical
profession and local products,' Mr Kramer explains. 'Doctors are used to
these brands and have strong loyalty to them.' Even before Asta appeared,
AWD had had the funds to start modernising its facilities in the hope of
being acquired by a western company.
Asta has invested about DM100m in AWD's plant and spent a further DM100m on
repairs and maintenance. The funds came from the cash flow of AWD, whose
turnover is about DM400m a year.
It aims to continue investing at the rate of about DM50m a year. Sales
revenues are being eroded, however, by the government's requirement that
some pharmaceutical prices be cut by 25 per cent to take account of the
fragile east German economy.
This is apart from the Bonn government's efforts to save on soaring west
German health costs by making extensive savings in medical spending.
With more than 16m people in east Germany, AWD, whose specialties include
circulatory, alimentary, and analgesic drugs, expects market share to shrink
as competition hots up.
Rising wages will also eat into profits. Because wages are generally rising
faster than productivity in east Germany, Mr Kramer warns about escalating
cost levels. 'This is the most vulnerable part of the whole economic
development there,' he says.
Yet he remains confident of AWD's earning power, not least because of the
skills and attitudes of the Saxon workforce. 'Motivation is extremely high.
I'm always overwhelmed.'

FT  09 SEP 92 / International Company News: Heinz fall distorted by last

<TEXT>
HJ HEINZ, the US foods group, yesterday announced a 44 per cent drop in
first-quarter net income - due to a one-off gain last year - but reported
higher sales volume and underlying operating profits as its 1991
restructuring began producing results.
The company reported a drop in net income, which totalled Dollars 143.79m,
or 55 cents a share, in the quarter to July 29, compared with Dollars
254.43m, or 95 cents a share, in the same period of last year.
The drop was due to a one-time Dollars 221.5m pre-tax gain the company made
last year from the sale of the Hubinger Company, a corn-starch business.
The disposal was part of a 'quiet restructuring' announced by Mr Tony
O'Reilly, the group's Dublin-born chairman, which was designed to keep
profits growing strongly, in spite of a mature US market.
Other initiatives have included cost cutting, increased marketing and a
realignment of the group's fast-growing Weight Watchers diet foods business.
Heinz reported operating profits in the latest quarter of Dollars 259m,
compared with Dollars 212m a year ago when the Hubinger gain is excluded.
Analysts reckoned its earnings per share in the first quarter of last year
totalled 44 cents.
Heinz shares fell Dollars  3/8 to close at Dollars 41 1/2 .
Mr O'Reilly yesterday told the annual meeting that the earnings figures were
'on track and in line with expectations' and reiterated his forecast of last
March that earnings for this year would reach Dollars 2.60 a share compared
with Dollars 2.40 last year. He added that sales were expected to exceed
Dollars 7bn, up from Dollars 6.58bn.
Sales in the first quarter totalled Dollars 1.56bn, up Dollars 64m, or 4.3
per cent, from Dollars 1.5bn last year. The company said this was due mainly
to a 3 per cent increase in volume, with the fall in the dollar contributing
about 1 per cent.

<TEXT>
CORPORACION Banesto, the industrial holding controlled by Banesto, the big
Spanish retail bank, will make provisions against the losses by subsidiaries
for the second consecutive year.
Mr Arturo Romani, chief executive of the holding, said he expected Pta18bn
(Dollars 190m) to be put aside for 1992 write-offs and bad debts.
Last year provisions totalled Pta28.6bn.
Corporacion Banesto has been hard hit by the spiralling losses of its mining
division Asturiana de Zinc which has posted a six-month shortfall of
Pta8.5bn against losses of Pta3.2bn in the corresponding period last year.
Losses at Tudor, the holding's battery producer, rose in the first six
months of this year to Pta1.8bn against a shortfall of Pta798m in the same
period last year.
The holding's main money earners have posted lower first-half earnings.
Profits at the construction company have fallen to Pta764m from Pta1.6bn and
the steel manufacturer Acerinox earned Pta1.1bn against Pta4.1bn in the
first half of 1992.
A spokesman for Corporacion Banesto said the 1992 provisions would be
covered by the Pta35bn earned by the holding through the disposal made
midway through July of Sanson, its cement unit.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Electric, the US engineering company, is facing a third successive
year of losses at GE-Tungsram, its Hungarian lighting subsidiary.
The Hungarian government's reluctance to devalue the currency in line with
cost inflation means that GE-Tungsram is continuing to lose money in 1992,
Mr George Varga, the subsidiary's chief executive officer, said yesterday.
Recession in GE-Tungsram's main west European markets has depressed prices
for lighting products and compounded the effects of rising local costs.
Mr Varga admitted that GE-Tungsram was under pressure to make money from its
parent company and that with hindsight General Electric would probably have
invested less than the Dollars 310m it has put into Tungsram.
The earnings outlook remains gloomy in spite of a far-reaching cost-cutting
exercise which the unit announced this March. GE-Tungsram announced at the
time that it would reduce by 25 per cent employment and the investment that
it had planned for 1992 and temporarily halt some production to draw down
excess stocks.
The retrenchment came in the wake of figures showing that GE-Tungsram lost
Ft1.1bn (Dollars 13.6m) on 1991 sales of Ft26.6bn on a Hungarian accounting
basis.

<TEXT>
BSN, France's largest foods group, yesterday reported an underlying 12.9 per
cent rise in first-half profits, although earnings fell steeply in spite of
exceptional gains from last year's sale of its champagne brands.
The group published net profits of FFr1.95bn (Dollars 408m) for the first
six months of this year, up from FFr1.72bn in the same period of 1991,
excluding the profits from the champagne sale.
Including exceptional gains, BSN made a FFr3.4bn profit in the first half of
1991, on which yesterday's results showed a 43 per cent decline.
Sales rose by 14 per cent to FFr36.3bn from FFr31.9bn over the same period,
or 4.2 per cent after stripping out acquisitions and exchange rate
fluctuations.
These include the first-time contributions from Danone Espage, France Plats
Cuisine, Pycasa, a Spanish pasta and groceries producer, and W and R Jacobs,
an Irish biscuits supplier.
Operating profits rose to FFr3.76bn from FFr3.49bn. Within this, the dairy
products division was the star performer, with a rise in profits to
FFr1.28bn in the first six months of this year from FFr1.01bn in the first
half of 1991.
The mineral waters division reported a rise in operating earnings to FFr577m
from FFr457m, an 'excellent performance,' said BSN.
Operating earnings in the packaging division rose slightly to FFr436m
against FFr426m in the first half of last year, while profits on beer rose
to FFr511m from FFr425m.
Among BSN's other activities, the biscuit division saw operating earnings
fall to FFr485m from FFr536m, due to a fall in demand.
Pasta and groceries fell back to FFr511m, from FFr664m; this reflected a
drop in exceptional gains and a one-off lift to sales during the Gulf war
last year.

<TEXT>
CIMENTOS de Portugal (Cimpor), one of Portugal's largest manufacturing
companies, has won approval from the Spanish government to launch a takeover
bid for Corporacion Noroeste, the cement producer from Galicia.
The Portuguese company which holds almost 25 per cent of CN, will pay about
Pta24.3bn (Dollars 266m) on the basis of an offer of Pta37,100 per CN share
for over 654,000 shares. If successful, it will give Cimpor control of CN.
The bid is supported by a financial syndicate including Portugal's Banco de
Fomento Exterior which will provide Pta12.26bn, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya
(Pta9bn), Banco Luso-Espanhol (Pta1.75bn), and Banco de Extremadura
(Pta1.25bn).
At the end of August, Cimpor bought 24.9 per cent of CN for about Pta8bn.
The company says that it has reached agreement with shareholders controlling
25.7 per cent of CN.
Cimpor must formally announce its bid in a national Spanish newspaper, after
which it will have 30 days to complete the transaction. As part of its
takeover offer, the Portuguese company undertakes to launch within six
months a bid for Cementos Cosmos, another Spanish cement producer, in which
CN has a large stake.
Cimpor's decision to acquire manufacturing facilities outside Portugal came
as a surprise in view of its forthcoming privatisation.

BOLS, the Dutch spirits and beverages group, reported a small increase in

both turnover and operating results.
Net profit in the period rose by 3.6 per cent to Fl 55m (Dollars 34.3m) from

Fl 640.0m from Fl 659.3m, while operating profit eased by 3.8 per cent to Fl
74.3m from Fl 77.2m.
In spite of the lower operating profit, Bols turned in a rise in net profit
because of a decline in financial charges to Fl 5.4m from Fl 10.3m in the
first half of 1991.

Tight cost control and a strong performance from contract hire activities
enabled Bletchley Motor Group to raise interim profits by 49 per cent.
Mr David Dunn, chairman, said the pre-tax outcome for the six months to June
30 - up from Pounds 406,000 to Pounds 604,000 - was achieved despite
'continuing economic recession, high interest rates and intense pressure on
margins'.
Turnover amounted to Pounds 35m (Pounds 30.3m). Mr Dunn said new vehicle
sales were still 'very disappointing' but sales to the corporate sector had
improved.
The interim dividend goes up to 4.4p (4.1p), payable from earnings of 11.4p
(8.1p).

However, investment income of Pounds 237,000 (Pounds 470,000) and an
exceptional gain of Pounds 512,000 (Pounds 33,000 charge) on the sale of
Reuters' shares left the pre-tax figure at Pounds 546,000 (Pounds 636,000).

Despite an increase of 4 per cent in sales, pre-tax profits at Record
Holdings were cut by 48 per cent in the half year to June 30.
The group makes hand and bench tools, and non-portable power tools. The
competitive advantage it created by reducing prices had been largely
eliminated by weakened currencies in its principal overseas markets,
particularly North America, the Far East, Australasia and South Africa,
explained Mr Michael Mallett, chairman.
Turnover was Pounds 14m (Pounds 13.4m) and within that volume increases
included North America 24 per cent, UK exports 41 per cent, and power tools
66 per cent.
Operating profit came to Pounds 801,000 (Pounds 1.79m) and the pre-tax

First half pre-tax profit at Herring Baker Harris Group, the chartered

Margins declined from 26 per cent to 15 per cent. Mr Nick Owen, chairman,

Earnings per share were 6.24p (9.74p) and the interim dividend is held at

FT  09 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Pounds 9m losses at Estates &amp; General
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Estates &amp; General, the property group, had a poor first half. It moved into
a trading loss which was exacerbated by a significant write-down through
pulling out of a development in Norwich.
As a result it will not be paying the half yearly dividends on the two
classes of cumulative preference shares, nor on the ordinary (1.225p last
time).
The loss for the half year ended June 30 worked through at Pounds 1.96m
(profit Pounds 1.48m) and the write-off at Pounds 7.4m pushed the pre-tax
deficit to Pounds 9.36m.
Mr Peter Prowting, chairman, said the principal negative factor was the
reduced level of sales activity from investment and trading stock. The
profit on both showed a decline of Pounds 2.77m and Pounds 504,000 to Pounds
529,000 and Pounds 130,000 respectively.
Gross investment rental income rose by 3 per cent over last year.
Regarding the development of the Castle Mall Retail Centre at Norwich, Mr
Prowting said it became clear that the ongoing commitment could not be met
given the group's increasingly restricted financial position.
Accordingly, the partners will take over the interest, although the group
will still be involved as project managers.
Mr Prowting said the bankers had agreed in principle to provide continuing
support.

A proposed final dividend of 2.5p returns the total to the 4p paid in the
year to May 1990 and doubles the 2p paid last year. Earnings per share were
8.5p (3.6p).
Gearing had been reduced to 32 per cent (59 per cent) enabling net interest
costs to be cut to Pounds 481,000 (Pounds 774,000).
Mr Harry Lambert, chairman and chief executive, said that publishing margins
had improved from 7.1 per cent to 12.9 per cent helping that division almost
double profits. Printing margins were maintained although there was a 26 per
cent fall in turnover.
On the present year he said there was no sign of a return of consumer
confidence but total advertising revenue in the first quarter had stayed at
the same level as the previous year.

FT  09 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Peek falls 7% but sees improvement
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE FIRST half of 1992 Peek, the traffic and field data systems company,
reported pre-tax profits down 7 per cent. This, however, was considered a
creditable performance and the interim dividend is maintained at 1.05p.
Mr Ken Maud, chairman, said that in the second half the current order book
and the successful conclusion of anticipated new orders would result in an
improved result.
On turnover of Pounds 39.1m (Pounds 38.1m) first half profits were Pounds
2.81m (Pounds 3.02m). Earnings per share came out at 1.74p (2.01p).
During the period road traffic activities were acquired in Scandinavia and
the sale of Greenpar Connectors and Dubilier ended its connectors interests.
As a result future trading will be weighted towards the second half.
At the end of the period net cash stood at Pounds 6m.

FT  09 SEP 92 / UK Company News: MBO at Massey Ferguson offshoot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MF INDUSTRIAL, the Manchester-based construction equipment company which is
part of the Massey Ferguson Group, is to be acquired by a management buy-out
team in a Dollars 18m (Pounds 9m) deal agreed in principle yesterday.
The deal ends several months of uncertainty over the future of MF, a
producer and distributor of backhoe loaders, light industrial tractor
loaders and skid-steer loaders.
MF, which has annual sales of about Pounds 50m and 440 employees, is a
self-contained unit of Massey Ferguson, best known for its farm equipment
and itself part of Varity, the US corporation which also produces vehicle
components and diesel engines.
Varity has said it would be interested in selling non-core businesses, but
MF will retain links with its current parent after the deal is finalised.
It will continue to use the MF trademark under license, and will use axles
from Massey, diesel engines from Perkins and hydraulic cylinders from
Pacoma, all Varity units.
Mr Richard Robson, leader of the buy-out team and managing director of MF,
said that, thanks to support from Varity and Massey, MF had been able to
carry out a significant investment programme in new product development and
manufacturing modernisation.
MF is the third biggest company in the UK backhoe market, behind the
dominant JCB and JI Case, and last year exported 82 per cent of production.
Its headquarters and manufacturing plant is located at Stretford.
Equity and loan financing for the acquisition and future working capital
requirements is being arranged by Arthur Andersen Corporate Finance, and the
management team is being supported by an international equity syndicate led
by Granville Development Capital.

FT  09 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Croda advances 40% to Pounds 14.3m -
Buoyant performance from chemicals dominates results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CRODA International, the chemicals group, yesterday reported a rebound in
first-half pre-tax profits, which expanded 40 per cent, from Pounds 10.2m to
Pounds 14.3m.
Despite market conditions which Mr Michael Valentine, chairman, described as
'universally testing,' turnover in the six months to end-June increased by
5.8 per cent to Pounds 183.7m (Pounds 173.7m).
The company, which cut its 1991 dividend after profits collapsed in the face
of the recession, attributed the recovery to improving overseas sales and
'the sizeable productivity improvements made in the UK.'
Earnings per share rose to 7.2p (5.1p) from which a maintained interim
dividend of 2.75p is declared.
The results were dominated by the record performance of the chemical
companies, which produced a 35 per cent improvement in trading profits to
Pounds 15.5m (Pounds 11.5m) on a 12 per cent increase in turnover to Pounds
122.8m (Pounds 109.6m).
The larger UK divisions, General Chemicals, Colloids and Universal, which
are big exporters and beneficiaries of recent capital expenditure, together
increased sales by 21 per cent.
Coatings operations also recovered from last year's setback to achieve
trading profits of Pounds 3.3m (Pounds 2.7m) on turnover which slipped by
Pounds 1m to Pounds 42m. Productivity gains at UK Paints more than offset a
further decline in sales, but Croda's sizeable Australian industrial paint
business was unable to match last year's performance.
The cosmetics and toiletries business, which accounted for 10 per cent of
group sales, had a 'disappointing first half even allowing for the normal
seasonal weakness,' and reported a Pounds 200,000 trading loss (Pounds
200,000 profit) on turnover down from Pounds 21.1m to Pounds 18.9m.
Croda said falling demand on both sides of the Channel undermined sales and
put pressure on margins. In addition the company's French operation suffered
disruption following a fire.
COMMENT
Croda's first half profits were ahead of market expectations and underline
management's success in taking out costs. The company has invested in new UK
plant and although there were early teething problems, the sharp profit
improvement from the chemicals operations indicates these have now been
overcome. Providing the sales gains in overseas markets are maintained, full
year pre-tax profits of about Pounds 30.5m and earnings of 15.5p a share
look possible. On that basis Croda is trading on an attractive prospective
p/e of about 11.4.

FT  09 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Reduced costs help Plantsbrook jump 40%
</HEADLINE>

   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANTSBROOK Group, the UK's largest quoted funeral services company,
formerly known as PFG Hodgson Kenyon, yesterday reported a 40 per cent
increase in interim profits.
The improvement was helped by a fall in administrative costs, lower interest
charges following the March rights issue and a one-fifth rise in operating
margins to 23 per cent.
Pre-tax profits in the six months to June 30 rose from Pounds 3.51m to
Pounds 4.91m on sales 7 per cent lower at Pounds 26.2m.
Administration costs were cut by 16 per cent to Pounds 11.5m and interest
charges fell from Pounds 2.03m to Pounds 1.34m.
The interim dividend is maintained at 1p; fully diluted earnings per share
were 4.31p.
The group has now sold or closed 29 of the funeral homes bought in a burst
of acquisitions in 1990 and 1991 which boosted debt and took gearing before
the rights issue to 415 per cent.
Gearing has now been reduced to 75 per cent from 108 per cent after the
rights issue.
The group is planning to focus on funeral homes in urban conurbations, a
change from the policy that greatly expanded its network.

FT  09 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Candover increases net assets by 2.9%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANDOVER Investments, an investment trust specialising in management
buy-outs, achieved a 2.9 per cent increase in net assets over the six months
to June 30, slightly ahead of the 2.4 per cent rise in the FT-A All-Share
Index over the same period.
Mr Roger Brooke, chairman, said that in the short term he did not expect to
record increases in Candover's net assets at the levels possible in the mid
to late 1980s.
Net assets rose to Pounds 56.2m, against Pounds 54.5m at December 31 and
Pounds 52m a year earlier. Net assets per share were 251p compared with 244p
at December 31.
Problems in achieving realistic prices for new buy-outs, two large
flotations of buy-out companies and the raising of a new Pounds 37.5m fund
led to a rise in the proportion of net assets held as cash or short term
deposits to 40 per cent.
Pre-tax profits rose by 4 per cent from Pounds 2.17m to Pounds 2.26m. This
was due largely to an increase in management fees resulting from the raising
of the new fund. Earnings per share rose to 6.81p from 6.69p.
The interim dividend is raised to 3.75p (3.5p).
Despite a generally difficult climate for disposing of companies, Candover
floated both Kenwood Appliances and Anglian Group with substantial capital
gains. It also has a little less than half of the Pounds 319m fund it raised
in 1989 still available for investment.
There was little competition from trade buyers for the buy-outs backed by
Candover but it was often difficult to persuade corporate vendors that the
price being offered for their company was realistic, said Mr Stephen Curran,
chief executive.
Candover made three new investments in the six months. The largest was in
the buy-out of Gaymer Group from Allied-Lyons with an investment of Pounds
15.6m with the others being in British Technology Group and Orion Publishing
Group.

FT  09 SEP 92 / UK Company News: ASH sees US growth following Sonitrol buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUTOMATED Security (Holdings), the supplier of burglar alarms and other
security devices, has agreed to buy Sonitrol Corporation, the largest
franchiser of audio alarm verification systems in the US, for Dollars 42m
(Pounds 21.1m) cash.
Sonitrol has 170 franchises in North America and Europe covering 100,000
systems. The alarms are connected to a central station which verifies the
threat is real rather than a system failure.
ASH raised Pounds 150m in July from the sale of its European security and
specialist CCTV business to Sensormatics Electronics. This eliminated
borrowings, although the company still has Pounds 57m of convertible capital
bonds. Some of the proceeds from the disposal will be used to fund the
acquisition, although it intends to refinance the purchase into dollar
borrowings.
Mr Tom Buffett, chairman, said that about one third of revenues following
the acquisition would come from North America. However, this could rise to a
half in the next three to five years as there was more scope for growth in
the US than in the UK.
Following the acquisition, ASH will also own 22 Sonitrol franchises, with
minority holdings in a further four. The company will have first refusal if
any are sold. Mr Buffett said the company was keen to acquire more
franchises, but only where they fitted in with its existing network.

FT  09 SEP 92 / UK Company News: All-round growth as Macro 4 advances 14%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MACRO 4, the computer systems software developer, yesterday reported a 14
per cent increase in full year pre-tax profits from Pounds 7.65m to Pounds
8.75m.
Turnover grew to Pounds 19m (Pounds 18m) in the year to June 30, with the
overseas activities contributing 76 per cent.
Earnings per share rose by 15 per cent to 26.5p (23p), slightly outstripping
the profits advance because of a small reduction in the tax rate.
The proposed final dividend is increased to 12.61p, including a special 5p
payment, raising the total for the year to 17.75p (11p).
The company said the special dividend was being made 'because of the cash
generative nature of Macro 4's business and the continuing build up of cash
reserves.' However, it cautioned that it expected future dividend payments
to be in line with profits growth.
Mr Terry Kelly, chairman, said the group had 'continued to make progress
this year, against an economic background generally as difficult as the
previous year'.
He added that most of the company's important markets had experienced severe
economic downturns. However, all subsidiaries had improved both turnover and
contribution to profits.
The performance in the US was the best for several years and there were
strong performances in France, Italy and Switzerland.
The results from the agent-run territories had been disappointing generally,
said Mr Kelly, even though they had shown improvements. In Japan, a 36 per
cent increase in royalty payments reflected a successful year.

An 18 per cent reduction in turnover forced Laser-Scan Holdings into a
pre-tax deficit of Pounds 408,000 in the first half of 1992, compared with
profit of Pounds 246,000.
Mr Jim Utterson, chairman of the USM-quoted micrographic equipment company,
said the turnover fall from Pounds 4.87m to Pounds 3.99m reflected the
continuation of the adverse trading conditions of the latter half of 1991.
Losses per share were 2.5p (earnings 1.5p).
Pressure on margins had persisted with geographic systems in particular
being affected.
Also imaging systems, which depended on a small number of relatively large
orders, did not achieve the same level of shipments as last year.

FT  09 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Pounds 50m European buy for Hillsdown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HILLSDOWN HOLDINGS, the food group, is paying Fl 157m (Pounds 50m) for the
European chilled foods activities of Beledia, a private Dutch company.
Hillsdown shares rose 2p to 106p.
Mr John Jackson, deputy chairman of Hillsdown, said that the purchase
provided the ideal start for the group's aim of building a European chilled
food business.
He said that chilled foods was a fast-growing sector of the food market
throughout Europe, and that Hillsdown's UK chilled food business had been
expanding quickly.
The acquisition should at least cover its interest costs in its first year,
he added. Sales in the year to the end of September 1991 were Fl 500m for
operating profits of Fl 14m.
The acquisition is the latest in a number of deals following a Pounds 281m
rights issue a year ago. At the time Hillsdown said it wanted to make a
number of purchases in its existing product areas in its chosen regions of
the UK, continental Europe and North America.
Mr Jackson said that so far about Pounds 140m had been spent. The largest
deal before this was the Pounds 37m purchase of JP Wood, the UK poultry
company bought from Unigate. He added that there were no other sizeable
deals under discussion at present.
The businesses Hillsdown is buying include the Johma group in the
Netherlands and Belgium, Kobenhavns Salat in Denmark and Nadler in Germany.
Each have leading market positions and together they comprise the largest
chilled salad producer in Europe.
The operating margin of 2.8 per cent was low, Mr Jackson said, because the
German business was less profitable than the others. However, after six
months negotiating the deal and getting to know the business, Hillsdown
believed it could tackle trading problems.
The assets being bought have a net value of Fl 50m (Pounds 29m). Mr Jackson
said that heavy investment over recent years had given the business 'superb'
production facilities.

FT  09 SEP 92 / UK Company News: William Baird ahead 8.5% as interest
charges decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WILLIAM BAIRD, the textiles and engineering company, produced first half
profits 8.5 per cent higher at Pounds 10m, against Pounds 9.2m, as a result
of a lower interest charge following last year's rights issue.
Mr Donald Parr, chairman, warned that the economic recession was worsening
with demand continuing to fall beyond the end of the half year.
'We experienced a steady first quarter followed by a second quarter in which
demand from all our major UK markets declined. There are signs of further
deterioration during July and August,' he said.
Turnover for the six months to June 30 was slightly higher at Pounds 242.7m,
compared with Pounds 239.1m. Earnings per share came to 6p (6.4p) and the
interim dividend is maintained at 3.55p.
Sales at the Darchem engineering business were hard hit. They fell from
Pounds 50m to Pounds 47m, partly as the result of the disposal of three
small non-core businesses. Operating profit fell by Pounds 500,000 to Pounds
3.2m.
Three more unprofitable business should be sold by the end of the year, and
these and other closure costs will be indicated by a Pounds 3m exceptional
charge in the full accounts.
Textiles turnover rose from Pounds 188.9m to Pounds 195.3m but operating
profit was static at Pounds 8.8m. 'Our margins have been squeezed across the
board,' said Mr Andrew Mills-Baker, finance director. The health of second
half sales depended on the present bout of cool and wet weather continuing
The interest charge fell from Pounds 3.13m to Pounds 1.56m, partly because
the proceeds of the 1991 rights issue only cut borrowings from May of that
year.
COMMENT
Baird is taking a double hit: from a strong dollar, which cheapens textile
imports, and from the recession, which cuts capital goods sales of its
engineering division. Disposals of non-core operations from Darchem are
taking longer than expected. It is a bad time to sell businesses but delays
mean Baird will have to make further provisions - and these will be taken
above the line, in accordance with new Accounting Standards Board rules.
Thus, the company will struggle to make much more than Pounds 27m at the
pre-tax level, compared with Pounds 25.1m last year. Earnings are forecast
at about 16.5p for a prospective p/e of 12, roughly the sector average.
Longer term prospects are rosier, given the strong post-rights issue balance
sheet. An imaginative acquisition or two would bolster investor confidence.

LASMO, the independent oil company, has sold its last principal US upstream
assets as part of a programme of disposals following last year's Pounds
1.1bn takeover of Ultramar.
It is selling Ultramar Oil &amp; Gas of Houston to Cody Resources, a private

November and includes assets in Louisiana and Texas producing 3,500 barrels
of oil and 45m cu ft of gas a day.
Lasmo has also agreed to sell its share of the Bright Star gas gathering
system in Texas for Dollars 15m, and various other properties in Texas and
Louisiana are expected to bring in another Dollars 4m.
The company has now raised Dollars 1.4bn of its target of Dollars 1.8bn from
disposals for 1992 and 1993. They are designed to reduce net borrowings,
which stood at Pounds 914m in July.

ACCBANK, the Irish state-owned financial group that is being groomed for
privatisation, reported a 21 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, from
IPounds 2.9m to IPounds 3.6m (Pounds 3.42m), for the half-year to June 30.
Its loan portfolio has grown 25 per cent on a year-on-year basis to IPounds
482m, while total assets have grown 25 per cent to IPounds 741m and deposits
by 15 per cent to IPounds 535m, also on an annualised basis.
An interim dividend of 1p is declared.
Accbank was the first state bank established in Ireland after independence
in 1922, being set up to provide long-term credit to the agricultural
sector.
After heavy losses in 1987, it was reorganised and per-mitted to make loans
to the non-agricultural sector of up to 25 per cent of its loan portfolio.
This ceiling was achieved by the end of 1991, and new legislation this year
lifted all remaining lending restrictions allowing it to diversify.
The Ministry of Finance said yesterday: 'Everything is in place for a sale.
It's just a matter of finding the right buyer'.
Deregulation of the Irish financial sector has resulted in keen interest,
particularly from the non-banking Irish financial institutions, in any
banking network coming on to the market.

FT  09 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Bimec calls in company doctor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BIMEC Industries, the acquisitive engineering and waste treatment company,
has called in a company doctor to replace Mr Sam Smith as chairman and chief
executive.
The appointment of Mr Roy Barber, who has worked on the Thomas Robinson
engineering group and Astra Holdings, the munitions concern, comes less than
a month after Bimec cancelled its final dividend.
Mr Smith arrived in 1989 and Bimec's subsequent expansion sent the share
price up to a peak of 80p last October. The company said yesterday that the
skills required to build a business in an expanding economy were different
from those called for in a recession.
The dividend cancellation, which was accompanied by the news that production
had fallen by 20 per cent in the first few months of this year, surprised
the market. The shares plunged from 19 1/2 p to 6 1/4 p.
Bimec had raised pre-tax profit from Pounds 5.4m to Pounds 6m in the year to
March 31 on turnover of Pounds 103m (Pounds 74.5m).
Only four days before the bad news on the dividend, Bimec had announced the
purchase of Pearl Contracts Holdings, a building and maintenance services
concern, from Cannon Street Investments.
The consideration comprised 3.25m shares, then valued at 19 1/2 p each.
Mr Smith earned Pounds 120,000 last year and waived his right to Pounds
25,000 of his remuneration. A wire service report that his pay-off could be
about Pounds 500,000 was last night described as 'absolute rubbish' by Mr
Barber.
Mr Smith's pay-off was 'reasonable and realistic', he said.
In March net debt amounted to about Pounds 7.4m, including finance leases -
about 60 per cent of shareholders' funds. However, gearing has risen since
then and the proposed sale of the aero and industrial division had fallen
through.
After yesterday's announcement, the shares rose 1 1/2 p to 9p.

<TEXT>
HARLAND SIMON, the control systems company where share dealings were
suspended last Friday pending 'clarification' of its financial situation, is
urgently reviewing its business plan and may decide to sell core operations.
Harland is conducting the review with Hambros Bank, its financial adviser,
after Barclays, the group's main commercial banker, indicated last week that
its banking facilities were being cut by up to one third.
A source close to the company said its survival was still not guaranteed.
'But it looks a good deal more hopeful than four days ago,' he said.
Barclays said discussions were continuing.
Harland's problems began when it received the proceeds from the sale of
Vickereys, a specialist blade and equipment maker. It expected about half
the Pounds 6.9m proceeds would remain with Barclays, which extended most of
Harland's Pounds 14m overdraft, while the remainder would come back to it as
working capital.
However, Barclays appeared to be concerned by the recent collapse in
Harland's share price, as well as rumours about declining orders, and kept
all the money. Harland's overdraft was repayable upon demand. Its shares
were suspended at 20p, compared to a high for the year of 653p.
The latest review of business strategy goes further than a similar one in
February by Mr David Mahony, who returned as chairman following the
departure of Mr Roy Ashman ahead of unexpected losses.
The first review led to the sale of Vickereys and the intended disposal of
Contraves, an electronic control company bought last year.
Harland hoped these sales would leave it free to concentrate on its
remaining core businesses of controls, automation and image processing.
However, the working capital crisis has forced the company to consider
further disposals, withdrawing from some markets or other ways to scale back
operations.

FT  09 SEP 92 / UK Company News: IMI shows 9% decline as recession bites -
Shares drop 19p as margins in metals operations remain under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STOCK market yesterday cut more than 7 per cent from the value of IMI
following the announcement of a 9 per cent reduction in interim profits.
The diversified engineering group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 36.5m
in the six months to June 30, compared with Pounds 40.1m, as it continued to
wrestle with trading losses on its titanium and copper alloy tube operations
and sought rationalisation of its fluid power division.
In a generally weak market, the shares lost 19p to 228p, reversing gains in
the period shortly before the announcement, and reducing the group's market
value to Pounds 742m.
The profit outcome reflected the problems of the UK recession. Domestic
sales accounted for 50 per cent of turnover of Pounds 515m (Pounds 496m),
but the UK was the only geographical area where sales were lower than in the
1991 first half.
Trading profit held up at Pounds 40.9m (Pounds 42.6m), supported by
contributions from companies acquired in 1991.
The drinks dispense business remained strong internationally, producing a
rise in trading profits. The building products division held steady,
sustained by strong demand for copper plumbing equipment in east Germany.
However, markets for fluid power products were sluggish. The group has spent
Pounds 3m rationalising plants and reorganising a business which in recent
years has grown rapidly.
'The metals area had a very rough time,' said Mr Gary Allen, chief
executive. Titanium selling prices have been low, battering margins, IMI's
titanium operations should break-even by the end of the year, he said.
Orders have been coming in and Rolls-Royce, the aero engine manufacturer,
which is IMI's largest customer, has evidently finished its de-stocking.
Difficulties with copper alloy tube are likely to take longer to resolve.
There is a worldwide excess of capacity and Mr Allen did not expect
break-even point to be reached this year.
The group has been attacking the costs of these and other operations. Some
600 jobs were lost in the first six months of the year, half of them in the
UK, and more could be lost in the current half. There have, however, been
300 recruitments in the drink dispense sector.
Although the group noticed a pick-up in its US businesses, the relative
optimism it exhibited about prospects for the UK economy at the annual
meeting last April has evaporated and there is little hope of any recovery
this year. Although order books have not slimmed further, 'there is a sense
of disillusionment which puts a freezer on confidence,' Mr Allen said.
The interim dividend is maintained at 4.2p, covered 1.7 times by earnings
per share of 7.3p (8.1p).

FT  09 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Mowat goes into receivership as banks
refuse further funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOWAT, the USM-quoted leisure and property group, was last night placed in
receivership after a consortium of 13 banks, led by Lloyds, refused to
provide it with further funding.
The group's shares had yesterday morning been suspended at 2 1/2 p at its
own request. Touche Ross, the accountants, have been appointed receivers
with effect from this morning.
Mowat, whose activities include UK-based holiday parks and cruises on the
Norfolk Broads, said receivers were called in after the company had failed
to raise Pounds 6.5m in new working capital, as demanded by the banks.
Mr Ian Birch, regional director of Lloyds Bank Commercial Services, said
last night that problems over the group's property business and its high
level of debt had proved insurmountable. He added: 'The first priority will
be to reassure those customers who have booked and paid for holidays in
September that those holidays will be honoured. The receivers will be
urgently looking at the situation and a helpline will be set up.'
Mr Brian Dunlop, Mowat's chairman, said it had 20,000 holidays booked for
September and 43,000 for October. The company was not a member of the
Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) and the holidays were not
protected by a bond.
Mr Dunlop expressed disappointment that the banks had decided to place the
company in receivership after what he described as a successful attempt to
resolve some of its problems. He said that of Mowat's Pounds 54m of debt,
Pounds 30m was secured against property. This was owed to 10 of the banks,
which had agreed in principle to take ownership of the property concerned.
He said the remaining Pounds 24m was owed to the three remaining banks, led
by Lloyds. They had demanded that the company come up with Pounds 6.5m in
working capital, of which it had obtained Pounds 2.5m with the promise of
Pounds 1m more.
Lloyds said, however, that Mowat had not managed to obtain the level of
funding it had required.
The downturn in the UK property market led to Mowat announcing a pre-tax
loss of Pounds 1.97m for the 15 months to the end of September 1991. Its
property interests included commercial property development and
housebuilding.
Following the announcement of the loss, the company said it planned to
withdraw from property development and housebuilding and concentrate on the
holiday business.
Last July, Mowat said it was selling its Potter Heigham boatyard and more
than 200 cruisers and pleasure boats to Broads Tours, a private company, for
Pounds 1.9m cash and Pounds 2m worth of property.
The first cash instalment of Pounds 1m is due at the end of October. Mr Len
Funnell, Broads Tours' chairman, said yesterday he still expected the deal
to go ahead.

FT  09 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Medeva trebles to Pounds 14.1m and beats
expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEDEVA, the rapidly growing pharmaceuticals company, yesterday beat market
expectations with a trebling of profits and a doubling of earnings per
share.
Mr Bernard Taylor, chairman, described the first half as a 'corker' and a
sound platform from which the group could develop into a significant
international pharmaceuticals company within the decade.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 rose from Pounds 4.02m to
Pounds 14.1m on sales up 82 per cent at Pounds 57.7m as the benefits of
recent acquisitions came through. Earnings per share were 4.77p basic
(2.26p) or 4.58p fully diluted. The interim dividend is raised 50 per cent
to 0.75p.
The profits comfortably exceeded the highest market expectations but the
shares slipped 12p to 186p, following a strong recent run ahead of the
announcement.
The group also reported a sharp increase in profit margins from 38 per cent
to 58 per cent, reflecting an improvement in the product portfolio, Mr
Taylor said.
The results included another difficult period at the intensely competitive
Evans-Kerfoot unbranded generics business which incurred losses. Sales fell
28 per cent to Pounds 12m due to price decreases, product line
rationalisation and some stock shortages.
Mr Taylor said the board had resolved to return this division to
profitability in the second half. 'We must not just restrict ourselves to
shaving costs further,' he said.
The group enjoyed particularly strong growth in the US where advances at
Adams Laboratories and MD Pharmaceutical led to sales of Pounds 25.5m, an 80
per cent increase on a like-for-like basis.
Mr Taylor tried to respond to some criticism that Medeva has little more to
offer than acquisition-led growth. 'We are able to get growth from what we
buy with the result that we are not simply the sum of the parts.' he said.
COMMENT
The impressive doubling of earnings per share suggests, perhaps for the
first time, substantial short term organic growth potential from recent
acquisitions, particularly those in the US. This hint of inner strength was
essential given that sizeable paper and debt-financed acquisitions will be
much harder to make at the current share price and following recent
increases in debt. Probably Medeva should be trading at a premium to the
market, rather than roughly in line, as is implied in full year forecasts of
earnings of 11.8p from pre-tax profits of Pounds 34.5m, though not at the
kind of premiums commanded by mainstream pharmaceutical companies with
greater security and quality of earnings. But it will be difficult for
Medeva to regain the momentum it found earlier this year while riding a wave
of US infatuation with the sector. On the other hand, the bulls could soon
stir again if Medeva extricates itself gracefully from its unbranded
generics business, which would be no small feat with the intense competition
in the sector.

FT  09 SEP 92 / High-stakes power play in the homelands: Monday's massacre
in Ciskei has damaged the prospects for compromise in South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South African politicians spend a remarkable amount of time vowing not to
speak to one another, and Monday's massacre in the Ciskei black homeland has
prompted yet another round of dark threats from both sides about the future
of constitutional negotiations.
Indeed, for most of the two and a half years since Mr Nelson Mandela was
released from prison in February 1990, the official position has been that
the African National Congress (ANC) and the government are not negotiating.
Meanwhile, there has been almost continuous contact between officials from
both sides, discussing everything from political prisoners to constitutions.
But those contacts are described as talks about talks, or talks about why
there are no talks. Officially, the ANC and the government are not speaking.
That is the situation now: the ANC says it cannot talk to the 'regime'
because it holds Pretoria responsible for the Monday killings, carried out
by the security forces of Ciskei, one of the black homeland governments
which survive only through South African support. The government says it is
'reassessing' talks with the ANC because the organisation seeks to impose
its will by violence, through the kind of provocative mass action which left
23 dead in Ciskei.
There is fault to be found on both sides, and each is now busy finding it.
But independent politicians believe the real fault lies in the fact that
neither side is serious about negotiation - not serious enough to face real
political compromises over power sharing; not serious enough to agree on an
interim government which alone can restore stability; and not serious enough
to settle the future of the homelands. Put simply, neither side yet feels
enough pain to make compromises aimed at stopping it.
Monday's march in Ciskei, organised by the ANC with the aim of overthrowing
the government of military dictator Brigadier Oupa Gqozo, was meant to step
up the government's pain. ANC officials disagreed over whether such a
strategy was worth the risk, but the strategic gain for the ANC is now
obvious.
For Ciskei is rightly seen, internationally and domestically, as South
Africa's responsibility. Pretoria created the homelands, and Pretoria
sustains them with financial security and political support. With Monday's
deaths the government of Mr F W de Klerk can no longer delay dealing with
the homeland problem.
In reality, of course, the homelands are not one problem but many. For the
10 'homelands' created as segregated tribal states under apartheid each have
their own political identity and their own aspirations to power in the new
South Africa.
Transkei, the second-largest homeland with 3.5m inhabitants, has proved
fertile ground for ANC mobilisation. Its residents are Xhosas - the tribe of
Mr Mandela and other top ANC leaders - and its leader, General Bantu
Holomisa, is the staunchest ANC supporter among homeland leaders. Gen
Holomisa seems to have chosen his ally wisely, for he has escaped the ANC's
campaign against the repressive practices of homeland leaders.
Instead, the ANC has chosen to target Ciskei, the much smaller Xhosa
homeland in the eastern Cape, with a population of 800,000. Ciskei has
suffered increasing repression since Brig Gqozo took power in a March 1990
coup. Undoubtedly, the ANC has been hampered in its attempts to organise
politically in Ciskei, so it is hardly surprising that the organisation
should target Brig Gqozo for protest. But as the Johannesburg daily Business
Day pointed out yesterday: 'Gqozo's sin . . . is not that he heads an
unrepresentative homeland regime spawned by apartheid, but that he does not
agree with the ANC.'
The problem for the ANC is that the two other most powerful homeland leaders
 -Lucas Mangope of Bophuthatswana and Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi of KwaZulu
 -also disagree with the ANC. Official ANC strategy is to seek their
overthrow by force.
Neither is a negligible foe. President Mangope's government has been accused
of widespread corruption and repression against members of the ANC. But as
host to the second largest platinum mine in the world and with the strongest
economy among the homelands, any move to overthrow him would be resisted by
business and government leaders in South Africa.
The risks of taking on Chief Buthelezi are even greater. The KwaZulu
homeland which he heads is 5m strong, with the most powerful security forces
of any homeland government. Furthermore, Pretoria is counting on Chief
Buthelezi as a crucial ally in the first multi-racial elections (officials
of the ruling National party believe he could deliver 1m votes to a moderate
alliance). The government cannot afford to do without him.
So the risk is great that the ANC's plan to overthrow the governments of
Ciskei, Bophuthatswana and KwaZulu could lead to violence. ANC leaders knows
this, and are using it to pressure Pretoria for a solution which would bring
the homelands back into a multi-racial South Africa and destroy them as
ethnically-based centres of power.
The outline of such a solution was agreed four months ago at the Convention
for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa). There, the 10 homeland governments
(except Bophuthatswana, which reserved its position) agreed to separate
referenda on the issue of reincorporation into South Africa. Church leaders
spent much of yesterday trying to persuade Brig Gqozo to agree to such a
referendum for Ciskei but he later rejected their proposal. Still, Pretoria
could regain strategic ground lost to the ANC by persuading homeland leaders
to agree to such a test of popular will.
By so doing, the government would risk losing some important allies for its
planned electoral coalition of whites, coloureds, Indians and moderate
homeland blacks. But after Monday's events, Pretoria will find it
increasingly difficult to resist calls to determine the homelands' future
democratically, through referendums.
But if negotiations cannot resume without an act of statesmanship of this
sort from Mr FW de Klerk, the same demand must be made of Mr Nelson Mandela,
the ANC leader. For whatever the successes of the ANC's recent campaign of
mass action against the government, it remains very unlikely that Pretoria
can be overthrown by the ANC. The ANC can raise the temperature of
negotiations, but not to a level which would force substantial concessions
on the central issue of distributing power in the post-apartheid South
Africa.
Both men will be called upon to rise above the fray and act as statesmen
rather than political streetfighters. The risk is that if they fail to do so
soon there will be nothing of value left to inherit.

One sign that outside interest in the TUC has reached a pretty low ebb is
that staff from the European Commission didn't show up to open their
exhibition stand in Blackpool till half way through the conference.
TUC officials stress that the EC's late arrival is the result of staff
shortages and has nothing to do with EC indifference. But the Eurocrats
might have been persuaded to put in an earlier appearance if the TUC itself
had shown more interest in Brussels. After all, the CBI has had an office
there since 1971 and the TUC is only now getting round to opening its own
little room.
Tipped to head the TUC's new outpost is Belinda Pyke, now working for EC
Commissioner Bruce Millan - who will be out of work if Neil Kinnock gets his
job.

One company that's glad it doesn't have to listen to any more financial
advice from the Duchess of York's adviser John Bryan, is Oceonics.
In 1988 Bryan and his dad bought 20 per cent of Oceonics' equity, got a
couple of seats on the board, and took the North Sea firm into the German
property market. It could hardly have picked a worse time to diversify.
The Bryans quit 18 months ago and a new management team is nursing the
company back to health. Oceonics (Deutschland), whose involvement in
Frankfurt's Messeturm tower nearly busted the parent, was sold to young
Bryan for Pounds 1 and the group reckons that the ill-fated venture probably
cost it Pounds 3m.
Hardly the most reassuring record for a financial adviser.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Poor old Sir Ian MacGregor. The man who so assiduously pruned the workforces
of British Steel and British Coal has not taken kindly to being sacked for
the first time.
He's suing HunterPrint, the specialist printer that he helped to rescue in
December 1990, for at least Pounds 300,000 following his ejection from the
chair. He was on one's year notice and describes his sacking as 'gross
ingratitude'. Given that he is less than a fortnight away from his 80th
birthday and has had a heart by-pass operation, it could be argued that it's
time to hand over to a younger generation.
However, MacGregor continues to jet to and fro across the Atlantic and
business colleagues outside HunterPrint have been keen to vouch that his
faculties are in full working order. 'I am better than I have been for five
years,' Sir Ian told Observer. He stressed that ageism is illegal in the US.
MacGregor's old pals in the City are puzzled why he keeps soldiering on. One
merchant banker said that MacGregor's work ethic was a bit like the malaria
bug. It never goes away. But Nicky Wilson, boss of the Scottish NUM, was
less kind. 'It's appropriate that a person who has sacked so many miners
should now have the tables turned against him. I don't wish him luck - the
miners got nothing.'

FT  09 SEP 92 / Letter: Take a risk on sterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROWAN M L MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The UK chancellor's protestations, the Bank of England's intervention
in the market and the government's latest heavy borrowing of foreign
currency all seem unable to achieve the object of raising sterling from its
ERM limit or just above it.
Why does the chancellor not reduce the base rate by, say, 2 percentage
points? Such a dramatic move might immediately bring sterling straight down
to its ERM limit, but the government is in any case committed to defending
it at that level.
On the positive side a drop in the base rate (and it would have to be of the
order I have indicated) should revive the UK economy (it is so depressed
that the danger of inflation seems minimal); encourage the purchase by
foreigners of British equities (and thus the purchase of sterling);
generally renew confidence in the UK and its currency; reduce the cost of UK
government borrowing; and perhaps encourage the Bundesbank to consider
reducing its rates.
This may seem a risky solution, but the conventional ones do not seem to be
working.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr W PETZNY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In the debate on a broad-based examination I would like to offer a few
comments on the International Baccalaureate as compared with A-levels.
There is no doubt that the IB offers a demanding but flexible mix of
numerate, social and scientific subjects, with three subjects on a higher
level and three on a subsidiary level in addition to training in the basics
of philosophy. A very satisfactory level of Allgemeinbildung, or general
education, is achieved, allowing direct access to all university systems.
There is, however, a real objection to the IB as far as UK university
admissions are concerned: the grading levels range from 7 to 1, with 7 being
the best grade. In the UK 7 is equivalent to A, 6 to B and 5 corresponds to
a C in the A-level system. This puts IB students clearly at a disadvantage
in the admission procedure. It would be highly desirable if admission
officers took account of that.

The post-16 further education sector is totally flexible and willing to be

Is it not now time for a national forum to identify this demand with the

<BYLINE>
   From Mr PAUL R KING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, My company is one in which Warburg suddenly ceased to be a marketmaker
last week.
My immediate reaction is that this decision and other similar ones recently
taken by other marketmakers must mark the beginning of the end not only of
marketmaking in smaller companies such as our own, but also of such
listings.
It seems to me that there will be little virtue in being a listed company.
Why should we be treated like second-class citizens, relegated to The Stock
Exchange's Bulletin Board? Presumably we shall still have to comply with the
same stringent listing requirements and pay the same fees as hitherto.
It will offer little encouragement to budding entrepreneurs to come to the
market, yet the government and the stock exchange would have us believe that
small businesses are the life-blood of the nation.
In our own particular case, while the trade in our shares is not large, we
have many small local shareholders who to date have been able to deal
readily in our stock. Executors have been able to market their shares when
the need has arisen.
Members of our company's successful Save As You Earn Share Option Scheme
have had no problem in being able to deal in options when these were
granted. The ability to transact business via the Bulletin Board, where
bargains have to be matched, is bound to be much more difficult. The
attraction of holding shares in smaller companies will decline, as,
presumably, will their value.
In the corporate world it seems sadly that small is no longer beautiful.

FT  09 SEP 92 / Letter: Root of problem facing Shias in southern Iraq has
yet to be addressed, despite no-fly zone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From M F RUIZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Security Council Resolution 688, based on Chapter 7 of the United
Nations Charter, is a mandatory resolution. It 'demands that Iraq
immediately end . . . the repression of the Iraqi civilian population'. It
calls on the United Nations and member states to address humanitarian needs
and provides enforcement mechanisms for dealing with internal man-made
disasters in Iraq which threaten international peace and security.
Recently, your columns have suggested that a plausible explanation for
roaring across southern Iraq is missing. The question is not to ask why a
no-fly zone is being established at this time, but rather why the UN and the
international community are not doing more regarding the human rights
situation in Iraq.
Since last year, the UN has provided assistance in Iraq on the basis of a
memorandum of understanding (MOU). It is clear from the UN's failure to
convince Baghdad to extend the MOU that the UN cannot pursue its aims based
on such an agreement. An MOU should perhaps never have been proposed,
especially as 688 is a legal basis for the UN's humanitarian mandate in
Iraq.
It is time to enforce 688. It is a clear instruction, requesting the UN's
secretary-general to 'use all the resources at his disposal . . . to address
urgently the critical needs of the refugees and displaced Iraqi population .
. . (and) demands that Iraq co-operate with the secretary-general to these
ends'. Failure to carry out the resolution will result in further suffering.
In the absence of effective UN action, the allies have chosen not to wait.
The no-fly zone is unlikely to deter Saddam Hussein from launching a ground
offensive in southern Iraq. What will happen then? The allied aircraft are a
short-term solution. The aim is to provide comfort to besieged Shias, but
the root of the problem has yet to be addressed.

FT  09 SEP 92 / Business and the Environment: Clash of the cans - Why the
aluminium and steel industries are doing battle over the drinks market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A fierce clash of the cans is intensifying in the UK drinks market as rival
steel and aluminium manufacturers champion the respective commercial and
environmental merits of their products.
The conflict, which has simmered away for many years, has hotted up in
recent days as the tinplate industry has launched a novel push-button
'Ecotop' opening system allowing a carbonated beverage can to be
manufactured entirely from steel.
Amid much publicity, the steel industry is promising full-scale production
of a lightweight, environmentally-friendly container - known as the Ultimate
Can - by 1994. 'It is the beverage can of the future made from recyclable,
energy-efficient steel,' says British Steel Tinplate, which has spent more
than Pounds 25m developing the new packaging technology. 'This is steel
waging war against aluminium.'
Not surprising, the aluminium can industry dismisses the threat almost
disdainfully. It does so from a position of strength.
Although the cost advantages of steel have allowed it to dominate the food
can market, the aluminium industry has won an ever-increasing share of the
more technically complex beverage drinks market in recent years. This year
the Aluminium Can Recycling Association (Acra) believes it will capture 60
per cent of the market, forecasting a rise to almost 80 per cent next year
as big consumer products companies switch to their material.
'We believe that steel technology is old technology. They are a long way
behind and are now desperately trying to catch up,' says Alex Griffin,
national manager of Acra.
Part of the skirmish is being fought over the battleground of the
environment. Through marketing campaigns - which are best described as canny
 -the aluminium industry has succeeded in persuading the British public of
its own environmental virtues. With 350 recycling centres, 1,160 supermarket
can collection points and high-profile campaigns on the Blue Peter
television show, the industry has largely succeeded in assuring shoppers
that aluminium cans are 'green' by recording a recycling rate of 63 per
cent.
While such campaigns have big marketing benefits they also make sense for
purely commercial reasons. Griffin says it costs between Dollars 8m to
Dollars 10m a tonne to install and operate the plant capacity necessary to
produce aluminium cans from primary materials but only Dollars 1m a tonne to
produce them from recycled cans.
The high intrinsic value of aluminium (with factory gate prices of Pounds
700 a tonne) has pulled the metal up the collection chain - in contrast to
low-value bulk packaging materials such as paper which are more cheaply
dumped in landfills.
The recycling infrastructure is also in place with the Alcan Recycling plant
in Warrington, big enough to re-use 80 per cent of the current aluminium UK
can market. A lack of recycled materials, however, has so far meant that it
has had to import cans from the US to run the plant at full capacity - a
move which is of highly dubious environmental value.
Yet the steel industry is quietly miffed that the aluminium industry has
been able to parade its green credentials quite so effectively and is
beginning to become more assertive about its own merits.
BST argues that currently 'it takes 50 per cent less energy to make a steel
can than an aluminium one' and points to the continuing environmental
benefits of steel's development programme. It believes that next year it
will be able to reduce the weight of steel beverage cans by 20 per cent with
a further 10 per cent reduction possible by 1994. This will reduce the metal
thickness from 0.27mm to 0.22mm.
Unlike aluminium, steel cans are also easy to pull out of the waste stream
by the simple means of magnetic extraction. In some towns - such as Edmonton
and Coventry - this has led to recycling rates in excess of 80 per cent. The
national average, however, is just 10 per cent because of the low number of
local authorities that have yet invested in a Pounds 15,000 magnetic
extraction line. BST concedes the industry still has a lot to do to promote
the environmental benefits of steel. 'It is all about innovation and getting
the consumer excited,' it says.
David Knowles, director of the Can Makers trade association, says the battle
between the two metals has been particularly sharp in the UK because the can
market is comparatively big - accounting for 35 per cent of the European
total - and both products are used on a widespread scale.
'The UK has historically used both aluminium and steel which is unusual.
Other countries have been dominated by one metal or another,' he says. The
US and Italy, for example, use mainly aluminium cans; Germany and France
overwhelmingly use tinplate.
The BST 'Ecotop' system marks an interesting development because previously
the vast majority of steel beverage cans had to use ends made of aluminium,
which can be easily 'scored' to produce the ubiquitous 'stay-on' ring-pulls.
However, other companies, such as the Franco-British CMB, are experimenting
with steel ends which they believe may yield considerable cost benefits.
A previous trial of steel openings in Germany four years ago met with mixed
success, but BST claims the 'Ecotop' system - which has been jointly
developed with the Dutch Hoogovens company and the German Rasselstein group
 -is a technically better product. The top will be used on 130m cans in the
Netherlands this year and on a very small scale in the Spar grocery chain in
the UK.
Bill Stratton, marketing services controller of the Spar grocery chain, says
the company is selling 100,000 cans of own-label lemonade with the new
'ecotop'. The experiment started in March; almost all the cans are likely to
have been sold by the end of the month.
'Initially when it appeared in the stores people were saying that the can
was not complete and the ring pull must have fallen off. But it is simply a
case of educating the customer,' he says.
Ultimately, it will be the consumer who decides the fate of the beverage can
market in the UK by expressing their preferences via the buying orders of
the drinks companies. But it should be noted that some environmental groups
would rather 'educate' consumers out of using cans altogether, advocating
the use of refillable drinks containers rather than 'one-way' systems.

FT  09 SEP 92 / People: Walking innocently into Granada TV
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Charles Allen, the accountant with a management background in the catering
and leisure industries who was yesterday appointed chief executive of
Granada Television, has one essential qualification for his new job.
He has walked down Coronation Street, the set for Granada's most famous
television programme. His former job - chief executive of Granada Leisure -
included responsibility for studio tours of the set.
Allen, a 35-year-old Scotsman who has worked for GrandMet and the Compass
Vending Group, is the first to admit he has no experience of television but
will start to learn on his arrival this morning. He expects to be
challenging everything - asking what everything costs and how it's done.
'Innocence is wonderful. You are allowed to ask questions,' he says.
After talks with programme makers, Allen will be drawing up a plan for the
future of Granada Television over the next six months. 'I shall very much be
looking to see how we can take the business forward,' he says, emphasising
his skills as 'a good leader and negotiator'. He will clearly be looking to
find the most appropriate structure for the television company at a time
when all British television is going through an era of tension and change.
Allen is involved with Business in the Community and has recently worked on
a management development project chaired by the Prince of Wales. He replaces
Andrew Quinn who is leaving Granada to become the first chief executive of
the ITV Association. Quinn in turn replaced David Plowright who was forced
to resign at the beginning of this year.

Douglas O'Brien was yesterday named the new president and chief executive of
Bank of Ireland First Holdings Inc (BOIFH), the loss-making New Hampshire
subsidiary of the Bank of Ireland. He replaces Bill Marshall who announced
his retirement two months ago, after two years in the job.
O'Brien, 53, leaves a senior post at National Westminster's US subsidiary,
National Westminster Bancorp, where, as senior executive vice president, he
held responsibility for its Dollars 23bn US retail banking operations.
Bank of Ireland has lost some Dollars 260m in the US since it took over
First New Hampshire bank in 1988. It is currently integrating two other
banks - Amoskeag and Bank-East - into the BOIFH holding company, which is
being supervised by a senior Bank of Ireland executive Des O'Reilly. In its
half-year results BOIFH reported that it 'is still on schedule to achieve
fully its target cost savings of Dollars 40m by October 1992'.

English China Clays' chief executive Andrew Teare celebrated his 50th
birthday yesterday by adding another heavyweight name to his board of
directors.
Sir Christopher Harding, the 52-year-old chairman of BET, is the third
non-executive director to join the English China Clays boardroom in the past
four months and his arrival completes the recent strengthening of the ECC
board, says Teare.
Sir Christopher, a long-time director of Hanson who recently stepped down as
chairman of British Nuclear Fuels, joins Rank Organisation managing
director, Michael Gifford, and ICI executive director, Rob Margetts, on the
board.
Teare, who has recently been appointed a non-executive of the Prudential
Corporation, says that his company has used a variety of processes to find
its new non-executive directors.
It was looking for non-execs who were active in their own companies and came
from similar sized but complementary businesses. In the case of Harding, it
is understood that ECC went through an intermediary.
Teare's aim is to have executive and non-executive directors in roughly
equal balance on his board. Each director has been appointed for a
three-year term with the option of a second term.
'Cadbury would be proud of us,' says Teare, referring to Sir Adrian
Cadbury's recent report on corporate governance.

For a relatively young financial institution, the 18-month-old European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development continues to have an above average
turnover of staff in its public relations department. James Rosenstein, 46,
is the latest to head for the exit. He is leaving his job as the EBRD's
chief press and public affairs officer to become director of communications
for the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, which represents 14
manufacturers.
When Barbara Ann Clay, formerly public affairs director at the US Treasury,
took on the role of the EBRD's chief spokesperson earlier this year, she was
the fourth person to handle the EBRD's relations with the outside world.

FT  09 SEP 92 / Business and the Environment: Pollution plays back seat
driver
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Motorists who imagine that their cars protect them against traffic pollution
are deluding themselves, according to research published today.
Pollution levels inside cars can be up to 18 times higher than those in the
air outside, says Earth Resources Research, a London-based environmental
consultancy in a report commissioned by Greenpeace.
Drivers can be exposed to even higher levels of toxic pollutants -
hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide - than cyclists and
pedestrians. And they suffer whether the windows are open or closed.
The research is based on studies in Britain, Europe and the US which
measured pollution inside and outside cars. Levels inside were were two to
18 times higher for benzene (a carcinogenic hydrocarbon), two to 14 times
higher for CO and 1.3 to 2.5 times higher for NO. They consistently exceed
safety limits recommended by the EC and World Health Organisation.
Exposure to benzene and CO is highest on urban roads and in slow-moving
traffic. Conditions are worst in older cars with faulty exhaust systems. CO
in the blood impairs the delivery of oxygen to the body and is dangerous for
pregnant women and people with heart disease.
In contrast, NO levels inside cars reach a peak during high-speed motorway
driving, Earth Resources Research found. NO can damage the lungs and
increase susceptibility to respiratory infection and asthma attacks.
'Interestingly, in most studies the level of ventilation did not
significantly alter interior concentrations, although conditions tended to
be worse with the heater on and somewhat better with air conditioning in
use,' the report says.
Recent data from the US, where most vehicles have catalytic converters, show
in-car pollution levels similar to those in Europe, the report says,
'suggesting catalysts alone are not sufficient to solve the problem'.

FT  09 SEP 92 / Business and the Environment: New York outpaces its
recycling effort
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the old days, commuters into New York City would arrive at Grand Central
station, leave the remains of their morning paper on the train and throw
their empty styrofoam coffee cup into the nearest waste bin, all without a
second thought.
These days, environmentally sensitive travellers can toss their rubbish into
recycling containers and head off to work with a clear ecological
conscience. It's part of an expansion of New York's recycling crusade, which
has placed 42 recycling receptacles on the city's streets and stations.
'We're trying to incorporate recycling into every aspect of New Yorkers'
lives,' said Marcia Bystryn, assistant commissioner for waste prevention in
the city. She is also organising pilot programmes for recycling everything
from tele-phone books and textiles to batteries.
New York already runs America's largest recycling scheme, processing close
to 1,200 tonnes of waste materials each day. Despite its good intentions,
however, the expansion of New York's recycling programme comes at an awkward
time for the industry.
Recycling companies say they are having a hard time unloading the materials
they already have. Piles of recycled glass, paper and plastics have been
accumulating, as a glut in the market continues to make the products
unsaleable.
Recycling groups say they are being hit from all sides. A surge in the
popularity of recycling schemes around the country and the rest of the world
has caused an excess supply of materials, while the recession has curbed
demand.
At the same time, commodity prices are extremely soft. With fresh aluminium,
tin, paper and other products available at bargain-basement prices, dealers
complain, no one wants to buy recycled goods.
'A tonne of newspapers will sell for Dollars 5 at best after processing,'
said Phillip Barretti, head of Nekboh Recycling in Brooklyn. 'Obviously
that's selling at a huge loss.'
The dealers make ends meet through payments from the city government, which
reasons that it is cheaper to pay the recycling plants than to pay a company
to haul away the rubbish.
Some products are harder to unload than others. Plastics are a problem,
because there are many different kinds and they don't always mix together.
'On the plastic side, we're making heavy losses,' said George Wolfson, head
of marketing for REI Distributors, which has a contract with the city to
take in a certain amount of materials.
Glass can also be a problem, especially if it is broken, crushed or green.
'The vendors can't really make any money from green glass,' admitted
Bystryn. 'The problem is that the US consumes a lot of green glass in the
form of products like imported beers but we don't actually produce much
that's bottled in green glass.'
Dealers also complain that the public has not been educated to be careful
enough in their recycling selection. 'I get in a load of bottles full of
things I can't use, like mayonnaise jars,' said Tom Bolton, general manager
of Omni Recycling in New York. 'Besides that, we have a big problem with
contamination, because people don't clean out the bottles very well.'
Even so, people in the industry are convinced that the market will improve.
The city government has launched a new campaign to educate New Yorkers about
the importance of cleanliness in products destined for recycling.
Bystryn is also counting on the size of the New York programme to pull the
city through the rough times. 'Because we can guarantee large supplies, the
dealers will come to us,' she explained. 'We're lucky, because we're having
an easier time than most.'

FT  09 SEP 92 / Wimpey warns on homes market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECESSION in the construction industry could continue for another two
years and would leave very few survivors unless the government took steps to
help the industry, the chairman of Britain's second largest housebuilder
warned yesterday.
Sir Clifford Chetwood, chairman of Wimpey, was commenting after the company
announced a Pounds 7.2m first-half loss and reduced its interim dividend by
half.
He said the recession in housebuilding had run for three years and could
stretch for a further two.
'If we face a five-year recession with no assistance by government, there
will be very few construction firms left,' Sir Clifford said.
He appealed to the government to introduce measures to stimulate the housing
market which, he said, would encourage greater confidence in the economy as
a whole.
'Every day that their house is seen as a wasting, dwindling asset - a false,
unwise investment - the longer we put off a return to consumer confidence,'
Sir Clifford said.
'This does not just affect the housing industry. it hits motor cars, white
goods, furniture, manufacturing right across the board.
'People will not spend when their safety-net, when the money that is
invested in their property, has been seen to vanish from under them and
threatens to diminish even further.'
Sir Clifford, a former president of the Building Employers Confederation,
criticised government economic policies which concentrated solely on
defeating inflation. He said: 'The defeat of inflation is a laudable goal,
but on its own will do nothing to rekindle confidence among those whose nest
egg has disappeared and who will have to spend the rest of their lives
paying off the liability which their investment has become.'
He continued: 'There can be schemes devised which are neither short-term nor
impulsive. It should not be beyond our wit as a nation to identify them and
implement them to help the country as a whole in the most effective way at
our disposal - by getting the housing market back to steady growth.'
He said he did not want to say what measures he would like the government to
introduce to assist home buyers. Previously he has advocated removal of
stamp duty from house purchase and increased mortgage tax relief.

FT  09 SEP 92 / Red-blooded leaders change battle cry to 'Pensions':
Behind-the-scenes manoeuvrings by the big unions in the wake of the Maxwell
affair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO RED-BLOODED union leaders the issue of pensions has been best left to the
backroom boffins at HQ - worthy, but hardly the stuff of which stirring
speeches are made.
The scandal over the Maxwell pension funds has changed all that,
highlighting the potential threat to employees and pensioners from lack of
controls on the operation of occupational pension funds. The pensions
ombudsman recently expressed his frustration about the narrow limits of his
watchdog role and said he had been overwhelmed by the volume of complaints.
The union movement, marginalised for so long, clearly has a legitimate
interest as the only national grouping to represent those employees and
pensioners.
Mr Bryn Davies, actuary with Union Pension Services, says: 'The debate at
last year's TUC didn't excite a lot of interest. But this year everyone I
talk to in unions sees pensions as perhaps the key issue for unions in the
1990s.'
The debates scheduled today at the TUC conference will conclude by restating
the movement's wish for a number of legal reforms. But for all this, it is
not the TUC itself which will make the running on the issue. Pensions do not
even figure on the list of six areas identified by the TUC earlier this year
as priorities for action.
An unofficial grouping of the larger unions, initiated by the GMB general
union and including the TGWU general union and the MSF general technical
union, has been meeting for some weeks behind the scenes to discuss pensions
strategy.
This could be seen as further evidence of the increasing irrelevance of the
TUC - if pensions are one of the most important issues for unions in the
1990s, it is significant that the leaders of the big unions feel happiest
getting on with the job on their own.
The group's target is the independent commission, under Professor Roy Goode,
set up by the government to review the framework of pension legislation over
the next year. The group hopes to raise the profile of unions in the pension
debate and put forward a number of well-constructed submissions to the
commission.
A TUC fringe meeting today will launch a 'charter for pension-fund
democracy' and a special conference on the issue is likely to follow at the
end of the year.
The campaign will focus on representation on boards of trustees. From
arguing that there should be an equal division of power between employees
and companies, unions have moved to demanding that employees should have
majority representation. The argument is that pensions are pay, so fund
members should have the right to control fund assets.
The charter will also demand the legal separation of company and
pension-fund activities and assets, the right for pensioners to be
represented on trustee boards, the right to full and up-to-date information
for scheme members, paid time off for employee representatives to receive
training and carry out their duties, and trustee powers to appoint outside
advisers.
Apparent contradictions in unions' arguments over control and use of
surpluses remain unresolved. Employers say that if they bear the risk of
having to top up funds to pay benefits, they should control those schemes
and benefit from pensions holidays when times are good.
Employers say unions want to have their cake and eat it - that they are
asking for both democratic control and financial guarantees. Mr Davies says
existing guarantees are, in law, virtually worthless. 'Employers rarely have
an inescapable commitment to pay the expected benefits, come what may,' he
says.
The next stage of the debate within unions on pensions may need to move to a
more sophisticated level with the offer - currently impossible for some
unionists even to contemplate - of a trade-off between some of that phantom
security and increased democracy.

FT  09 SEP 92 / Security training call for Tube
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON Underground staff should be trained at inspecting suspect packages to
curb the number of delays caused by false alarms, according to a report
published yesterday.
The study suggests that passengers should be made more aware of the need to
keep belongings with them.
The report was commissioned after an incident in Bethnal Green, east London,
18 months ago in which six Central Line Underground trains were stuck in
tunnels when two suspect briefcases were discovered.
It was five hours before all 6,000 passengers were evacuated.
That incident came at a time of soaring security alerts on London
Underground and British Rail. Between 1990 and last year anonymous calls
rose from 446 to 1,683, suspect packages from 270 to 1,961 and devices found
from five to eight.
Mr Brian Appleton, the report's author, paints a generally favourable
picture of the work being done by British Rail, British Transport Police and
London Underground to reduce the disruption caused by security alerts.
He rejects suggestions that the balance of risk involved in bomb threats
should be recognised by continuing to run train services in the face of the
threats.
The report says that the degree of risk can shift wildly from month to month
depending on the political environment.
The report suggests that the risk to Underground passengers from fires has
shrunk to the point where London Underground and the London Fire Brigade
should be working to reduce the disruption caused by their reaction to fire
reports.

test case High Court ruling on North Tyneside council's enhanced severance
scheme.
The Audit Commission confirmed yesterday that Mr Tony Childs, its solicitor,
was preparing guidance to be sent to all district auditors within the next
month, to enable them to decide whether any enhanced payments made by
councils exceed their statutory powers.
The commission said that since last October's ruling councils had 'fought
quite shy' of offering enhanced redundancy terms. Now that the judgment had
been upheld after subsequent legal challenge from North Tyneside, the
commission was to issue advice on this complex area.
'It will set out under which circumstances auditors may advise that local
authorities should seek repayment,' he said. Payments made since October
1991 would be studied.

MORE than two thirds of workers believe their employers do not provide them
with sufficient training, a poll conducted by NOP for the TUC shows.
Almost seven out of 10 workers, of both sexes and all ages and classes,
would like more training, the poll of nearly 1,000 people found. More than
80 per cent of people believe trade unions should bargain for better trade
unions.

FT  09 SEP 92 / Gyngell urges more cuts at BBC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BBC should make even deeper cuts in staffing and move to multi-skilling,
Mr Bruce Gyngell, chairman of TV-am, said last night, Raymond Snoddy writes.
In a speech to the Royal Television Society he said the BBC should survive
and be properly funded by a licence fee. But it did not need 24,000 people
to sustain its vision.
He said Mr John Birt, the director-general designate, appeared to have said
big cuts could be on the way.
Mr Gyngell added: 'But I was amazed to hear Sir Michael Checkland (the
current director-general) say the other day that all 14 studios owned by the
BBC would be an integral and vital part of the of the BBC's future.'
He said: 'Multi-skilling, combined with the proper use of studios is the
future. Only in this way will the cost of productions be brought down to
fully competitive levels, so that the BBC can continue to make the quality
and range of programmes it does now.'
Mr Gyngell warned the BBC against moving away from truly popular
programming. Audiences would shrink and the licence fee would become more
difficult to defend.
The only way ITV would become fully competitive would be when the English
ITV companies merged into four groupings covering the north, the Midlands,
the south and London.

FT  09 SEP 92 / EETPU rebuked over agreements: Controversy over electricians
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GAVIN LAIRD, general secretary of the AEEU craft union, publicly rebuked
the EETPU electrical wing of his organisation as efforts intensified to
ensure the return of the electricians to the TUC.
Mr Laird told the TUC annual conference that he would do everything he could
to help the Ucatt construction union in its 'rightful complaints' about the
construction industry.
He was speaking after Mr George Brumwell, Ucatt's general secretary, told
delegates that the EETPU had struck a single-union deal with an employer at
a site where his union was already recognised.
Delegates are tomorrow likely to debate terms governing talks on the
possible re-affiliation of the EETPU to the TUC. It was expelled in 1988 for
failing to implement TUC disputes rulings. Talks on its re-affiliation
follow its merger with the AEU engineers.
Mr Laird's comments came as the TUC re-affirmed concern about single-union
agreements which are made before the workforce has been recruited or
consulted. The AEU and EETPU have been the most successful unions at winning
such agreements.
Mr Jack Carr, assistant general-secretary of the MSF general union,
proposing the resolution, deplored 'beauty contests' in which unions
competed against each other for deals by 'bidding down' the rights of
workers.

FT  09 SEP 92 / Pressure on Labour over Maastricht: Calls for devaluation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR policy on Europe came under double pressure yesterday when several
union leaders at the TUC congress in Blackpool called for devaluation of the
pound and Mr Bryan Gould, shadow heritage secretary, described the
Maastricht treaty as 'not the right blueprint for Europe'.
The call for devaluation was led by Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB
general union, one of the largest Labour-affiliated unions. He said: 'The
pound is over-valued. An early realignment is essential if we are to live
without further agony in the ERM.'
Mr Edmonds, who was supported by several other large unions including the
general union TGWU, the public service union Nalgo and white collar union
MSF, added: 'Most people in industry know that the pound is over-valued.
Realignment is now inevitable.'
He said he believed that Britain should remain in the European exchange rate
mechanism. Earlier yesterday he strongly endorsed the TUC's support for the
Maastricht treaty without a referendum, a position backed by a large
majority of congress delegates.
But Mr Edmonds argued that high interest rates were strangling the economy.
'The best way to deal with the problem is through a revaluation of the
D-Mark but both the French and British governments are against that,' he
said.
The union call for devaluation will ensure a rough ride on the issue for the
Labour leadership at the party conference in three weeks. Labour has been
reluctant to call for any tampering with the pound's position in the
European exchange rate mechanism.
Mr John Smith, Labour leader, in Blackpool for dinner with the TUC general
council last night, said he was 'not in favour of a devaluation of sterling
because that would not assist in reducing interest rates'. But he added that
the EC 'should not rule out a revaluation of the D-Mark'.
Disarray over Europe on the Labour front bench intensified with Mr Gould's
call to use the failure of the Maastricht agreement to set out a new agenda
for Europe.
Mr Gould said: 'Britain should now take the lead in acknowledging that the
Maastricht treaty is deeply flawed and has failed as a consequence to secure
the endorsement of the people of Europe. This is as much an opportunity as a
problem.'
While the Labour leadership says the party will not decide what line to take
until the bill to ratify Maastricht returns to the House of Commons, Mr
Gould's remarks strike a very different tone from the conditional support
for the treaty expressed by Mr Smith and Mr John Cunningham, shadow foreign
secretary.
Mr Gould, who challenged Mr Smith for the Labour leadership in the summer,
launched a particular attack on the European exchange rate mechanism.
He said: 'A European economy wrecked by recession simply cannot afford to
hand economic policy over to unelected bankers who will enforce treaty
provisions requiring massive cuts in pubic spending and giving an overriding
priority to price stability at the expense of jobs and living standards.'
In Blackpool yesterday Mr Smith indicated that he did not propose to
discipline Mr Gould for his statement. 'I think he was speculating, as I
think we are all entitled to do, on the effect of the Danish negative
response to their referendum,' he said.

FT  09 SEP 92 / Dumping of arms at sea comes under fire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MINISTRY of Defence has not notified international regulators that it
has dumped bombs, shells and hand grenades at a site in the Atlantic, it
emerged yesterday, prompting allegations that the government was in breach
of international conventions.
The disclosure comes as concern is growing about the environmental costs of
decommissioning military equipment as defence forces are reduced.
The London Dumping Convention, to which the UK is a signatory, allows
military dumping under 'sovereign immunity' clauses. But Greenpeace, the
environmental group, said in a report yesterday that the MoD had an
obligation to notify the LDC's secretariat of military dumping.
Mr Chris Smith, Labour's environment spokesman, said yesterday the
government had 'a clear duty of information'.
The amount of ammunition dumped at the Atlantic site, 400 miles west of
Land's End, will be 8,405 tonnes this year. It was 1,093 tonnes last year.
From the end of this year, when the Oslo Convention on sea dumping comes
into force, the MOD will bury old ammunition in pits.

FT  09 SEP 92 / Cut in N-power levy ruled out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has ruled out any immediate reduction in the nuclear levy on
the electricity industry, in spite of pressure from the electricity
regulator.
The Department of Trade and Industry, which is now responsible for energy
policy, is not even planning to suggest a reduction to the Treasury.
It sees little prospect of a cut in the levy because the public spending
round is proving so tough.
The levy was imposed to subsidise the higher costs of nuclear electricity
after the privatisation of the non-nuclear generators in 1990.
Any fall in the levy would mean that the financial support it provides for
Nuclear Electric, the state-owned company which owns and operates the 12
nuclear power stations in England and Wales, would have to come from the
public sector borrowing requirement.
This year the levy will amount to Pounds 1.2bn - equivalent to 11 per cent
on the electricity bills of every household and company in England and
Wales. It is supposed to shrink by stages to Pounds 800m in 1997. This year
it was responsible for turning Nuclear Electric's Pounds 783m loss into a
Pounds 482m profit.
The company's ability to achieve a profit, albeit with the help of the levy,
has reinforced the argument of critics who argue that what is effectively a
tax on electricity should be reduced.
The opponents of the levy are mainly industrialists, headed by large
companies such as Imperial Chemical Industries. They have been joined by
National Power and PowerGen, the two privately owned electricity generators,
and by Professor Stephen Littlechild, the director-general of the Office of
Electricity Regulation.
Ministers argue, however, that a straight withdrawal of the levy as Nuclear
Electric becomes profitable provides little incentive to the manage ment to
make the improvements they are confident of attaining under Mr Bob Hawley,
the company's new chief executive.
Nuclear Electric says that even when it becomes profitable it will still
need the support of the levy to make provision for the reactors it inherited
when it was formed in 1990.
A small proportion of the levy also subsidises renewable forms of energy,
such as projects using wind and tides, which ministers are conscious are
already facing difficulties because the levy must end in 1998.

FT  09 SEP 92 / Nordic Markets In Turmoil: EMS tensions take toll of Nordic
markets - Sara Webb explains the factors behind yesterday's financial drama
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORDIC bankers used to joke that when Finland sneezed, Sweden caught a cold
 -and vice versa. The joke is beginning to grow stale. Over the last year,
whenever there has been a crisis of confidence in Finnish economic policy,
Sweden has suffered a knock-on effect and the Riksbank, Sweden's central
bank, has been forced to push up domestic interest rates to protect the
krona.
Late on Monday night, Mrs Sirkka Hamalainen, the governor of the Bank of
Finland, informed her Nordic counterparts that Finland was considering
scrapping the link between the Finnish markka and the Ecu, preparing them
for the official announcement made early yesterday.
The Finnish markka fell in the foreign exchange markets yesterday morning
with the Ecu appreciating by 15-16 per cent against the markka. Finnish
government bond yields were at first forced up in hectic trading, although
yields ended lower on the day.
In Sweden, the Riksbank increased its marginal rate (the key lending rate to
the banking system) by 8 percentage points, from 16 per cent to 24 per cent
to prevent a dramatic outflow of currency.
Q. Why has Finland decided to abandon linking the Finnish markka to the Ecu
when it only recently introduced the peg?
Finland decided to apply for EC membership earlier this year and the link of
its currency to the Ecu in June 1991 was intended to signal its desire for a
closer monetary relationship.
However, the recent tension within the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the
European Monetary System has taken its toll on the Nordic markets. Many
international investors are worried about the possibility of a realignment
in the ERM and the impact this would have on the Nordic markets, and as a
result, capital has flooded out of the region.
Over the last week, the Bank of Finland has taken several steps to defend
the markka. It has been forced to intervene to defend the markka every day
and in increasing measures. It has operated in the forward market - and will
therefore have to meet these commitments soon, and it has drawn on swap
agreements with other European central banks.
There were rumours in the financial markets that the Bank of Finland's
reserves had been almost depleted by these measures. Mr Jorn Donner, a Bank
of Finland parliamentary supervisor, said yesterday that the bank's reserves
yesterday 'were probably eaten up'. The central bank itself denied this and
said it still had 'substantial reserves'. However, in the end, it decided
that these measures were not enough to prop up the currency and decided to
let the markka float.
The decision frees the central bank from supporting the markka with high
interest rates at a time when the Finnish economy is in recession.
The Bank of Finland has stressed that this is not a formal devaluation -
however, the effect of allowing the markka to float is tantamount to
allowing a depreciation of the currency. Once the currency has stabilised,
it is likely the Bank of Finland will link it to the Ecu again.
Q. Why has Sweden been forced to raise interest rates on such a dramatic
scale?
Nervousness about the state of the Swedish economy and tensions within the
ERM sparked a sharp outflow of capital from Sweden last month, forcing the
Riksbank to raise its marginal rate on two occasions.
Yesterday's large rise in the marginal rate - from 16 per cent to 24 per
cent - was intended to give the financial markets a clear signal that Sweden
wants to defend the krona.
Mr Claes Norgren, deputy governor of the Riksbank, said: 'After Finland's
decision to float, we needed to be on the early track to prevent a currency
outflow.' He added that the measure was intended 'to demonstrate the
firmness of monetary policy'. He denied that there were any plans to float
the krona.
Q. Who is responsible for withdrawing capital from Finland and Sweden?
The Bank of Finland claims that the Finnish corporate sector in general is
moving currency out of the country with foreign investors playing an almost
insignificant role in the capital flows. Many foreign investors pulled out
of Finland last year after the devaluation.
However, in Sweden, the Riksbank said that both domestic and foreign
investors were responsible for the capital movements.

FT  09 SEP 92 / Nordic Markets in Turmoil: Sweden's limping economy takes a
fresh body-blow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, European Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT 8pm on Monday Mr Carl Bildt, the Swedish prime minister, leaned back in
his armchair at a London hotel and declared confidently that Sweden's
interest rates were 'going to come down'.
Roughly 12 hours later, the world knew differently. Mr Bildt flew back to
Stockholm with his own political future looking even more complicated than
when he left.
The Bank of Sweden's drastic increase to defend the krona adds up to a
further depressant on the Swedish economy. 'We had been thinking that, if we
were lucky, we might get zero growth next year,' Mr Bjorn Jonsson, chief of
economic analysis at Skandinaviska Enkilda Banken in Stockholm said
yesterday. 'Now, it could be a minus.'
The further dose of economic gloom comes as Sweden is endures its worst
recession since the 1920s. This will increase pressure on Mr Bildt's
minority conservative administration when it tries to push through
parliament fresh cuts in spending to restrain the sharply rising budget
deficit.
Mr Bildt on Monday promised no let-up in Sweden's tough economic policy,
which has brought inflation - at 2.2 per cent - to below the German level.
He promised to cut social security further and to maintain the krona's link
to the Ecu. 'The markets must be persuaded that we are going to stay on
course ..This is not a recipe for being popular.'
The firm line was repeated yesterday in Stockholm by Mrs Anne Wibble, the
Swedish finance minister.
Money market rates - to which much of Swedish corporate and personal loans
are linked - yesterday showed a much smaller rise of up to 3 per cent.
Swedish economists believe that, provided yesterday's action triggers the
return of large flows of speculative capital, the Riksbank will be able to
bring down interest rates again before long.
If that does not happen, the pressures to lower the level of the krona will
grow. This might take place as part of a general realignment of currencies
within the European Monetary System, of which Sweden is not a member.
According to Mr Ola Virin, chief economist at the Swedish Industry
Federation, the main negative effect on business is the uncertainty caused
by the two separate rounds of interest rate tightening. In view of
competition between forest industries in Sweden and Finland, the markka
devaluation could bring considerable problems for Swedish producers, he
warned.
Mr Nils Lundgrun, chief economist at Nordbanken in Stockholm, said the chief
worries for business will arrive if the interest rate squeeze continues for
more than about three weeks. A combination of a low dollar rate, a slow
recovery in the US and Europe, and continued nervousness on the foreign
exchanges could add up to a 'disastrous' outcome.
WHAT THE INTEREST RATE RISE MEANS FOR SWEDEN
Companies:
Big companies can still borrow at prime lending rate (15.5 percent
prior to yesterday's action).  Medium-and small-sized companies face
greater uncertainty over funding.  All companies lose competitiveness
against Finland.
Individuals:
Mortgage rate prior to rise 14 percent.  25 percent of mortgage
loans linked to 3-month money market rate (+3 percent yesterday)
75 percent of mortgages linked to long-term capital market rate.
Owner occupation rate above 40 percent.
Economy:
Economic contraction likely to continue into 1993.  Doubling of
budget deficit to Skr 140m almost certain this fiscall year.  Government
reaffirms policy of seeking more spending cuts.

<TEXT>
THE financial crisis in Finland puts its fragile centre-right coalition
government at risk.
Mr Esko Aho, Finland's prime minister, said there was no question of anybody
resigning over the central bank's decision to float the markka. But his
cabinet faces painful decisions on how to cut government spending further to
convince sceptical international money markets that it can control the
budget deficit, which may reach FM160bn (Pounds 21bn) in this fiscal year.
Yesterday ministers were saying that Finland needed a wage freeze, tax
increases on export industries to finance aid to the ailing banking sector
and cuts in social benefits. Last week's budget proposals for 1993 called
for a 10 per cent cut in some social benefits but this was not enough to
satisfy the markets.
The problem is whether voters will go along with further erosion of living
standards. A poor showing by Mr Aho's Centre party and its Conservative
allies in next month's local elections could lead to a new coalition,
possibly including the social democrats.

<TEXT>
THE gloom enveloping Scandinavia's battered insurance sector deepened
yesterday when the share prices of Swedish insurers fell sharply amid fears
of heavy credit insurance losses.
Shares in Sweden's two biggest companies, Trygg Hansa and Skandia, plunged
following reports that the credit insurer, Svenska Kredit could face losses
of SKr5bn (Pounds 500m) to Skr10bn (Pounds 1bn). Skandia and Trygg each own
47 per cent stakes in Svenska.
Insurance shares were also hit by interest rate worries following the
Swedish government's decision to raise marginal lending rates by 8 points.
Trygg fell by 5 krona to close at SKr27, while Skandia fell SKr7 1/2 to
close at Kr55.
Yesterday's falls follow a steady erosion this year in share prices of the
region's insurers, which have been damaged by property and investment
losses.
'Investors have been badly burned. They are not interested in Scandinavian
financials at any price,' says Mr Jonathan Walker, analyst with Baring
Securities.

FT  09 SEP 92 / Fisons warns that recovery will be slow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FISONS, the pharmaceuticals, scientific instruments and horticultural
products company, will not return for years to the near 25 per cent growth
it enjoyed in the 1980s, Mr Cedric Scroggs, the new chief executive, warned
yesterday. The statement accompanied the company's first-half figures which
showed a 58 per cent fall in profits to Pounds 40.4m.
Fisons shares dropped 24p to 150p, as analysts cut their profits forecasts
for the full year by about Pounds 20m to around Pounds 100m.
Mr Scroggs hoped to announce over the next few months the disposals of the
horticulture and consumer health divisions and CP Pharmaceuticals, which
makes generic (unbranded) drugs. The sales, starting with CP possibly next
month, should eliminate the company's Pounds 239m borrowings.
He said the company was 'in advanced discussions' with other drugmakers over
joint development, manufacture and marketing of new and existing products.
Talks were being held with US and European companies.
The profits decline was partly the result of a 13 per cent fall in drug
sales to Pounds 206m which cut almost Pounds 16m from profits. 'The sales
decline is unusual and unpalatable,' said Mr Scroggs, adding that the first
two months of the second half showed an improvement on 1991.
At the operating level, profits from the pharmaceuticals division fell to
Pounds 23.1m from Pounds 68.1m in the first half of 1991. Profits were again
damaged by the absence from the US market of the eye treatment Opticrom
which was withdrawn two years ago after the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA), the US drug licensing body, criticised production methods.
Mr Scroggs acknowledged that the company had a difficult relationship with
the FDA. He visited the head of the FDA earlier this year as part of moves
to 'rebuild confidence' in the company. The costs associated with improving
production standards to meet FDA rules, and lower profit margins, cost
Pounds 18.5m in lost profits.
Turnover from its biggest selling drug, the asthma treatment Intal, fell 10
per cent to Pounds 72m. In spring 1992, the company had supply problems with
Intal as a result of more stringent quality control measures introduced to
meet FDA requirements, but these have now been overcome.
Sales of the newer asthma treatment, Tilade, rose 9 per cent to Pounds 12m.
The company is still waiting for FDA approval for Tilade.

FT  09 SEP 92 / Wimpey halves interim dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WIMPEY, Britain's second largest housebuilder, yesterday announced a Pounds
7.2m first-half pre-tax loss and halved its interim dividend to 2p.
The company also proposed to halve its final dividend to 3.25p but did not
rule out a deeper cut if trading conditions deteriorated further. The share
price, which fell a fifth the previous week, fell another 6p yesterday to
71p compared with a peak of 188p four months ago.
It was Wimpey's first dividend cut since it went public. The first-half loss
compared with a Pounds 200,000 pre-tax profit a year ago. Turnover fell from
Pounds 887m to Pounds 731m.
Mr Roger Wood, finance director, said every division apart from commercial
property had made lower profits.
In particular, he blamed further weakness in the UK and North American
housing markets. UK house sales, which began the year well but fell after
the general election, fell from 3,131 to 2,803. US sales fell from 673 to
540.
Margins remained under pressure with house prices continuing to fall and the
group was still working through land bought expensively in the late 1980s.
The average price of a UK home had fallen from Pounds 65,000 to Pounds
60,000 since the first half of last year, said Mr Dwyer.
The value of the group's construction order book fell from Pounds 800m to
Pounds 600m during the 12 months on the decline in residential and
commercial property markets and a fall-off in work on the Channel tunnel.
Property profits were helped by the sale for Pounds 45m in February of St
Alphage house, a London office block, one of a string of disposals made by
the company to reduce borrowings. Interest paid fell from Pounds 15.4m to
Pounds 12.2m.
Net debt of Pounds 232m, representing gearing of 43 per cent, would be
reduced further in the second half following the receipt of Pounds 110m for
the company's 50 per cent stake in the Little Britain office development in
London.
Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive, declined to comment on the financial crisis
at Eurotunnel caused by claims for extra payments of more than Pounds 1bn by
Channel tunnel contractors. He said negotiations with Eurotunnel were at a
delicate stage.

FT  09 SEP 92 / Accountant to be chief executive of Granada TV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRANADA, the television and leisure group, yesterday alarmed some of its
programme makers by appointing Mr Charles Allen, an accountant with no
background in television, as chief executive of Granada Television.
Mr Allen, 35, has worked at British Steel and GrandMet before becoming group
managing director of the Compass Vending Group.
He said yesterday he was on his way to Granada Television to listen and
learn and work out over the next six months the best way to take the
business forward. He added he was committed to the ITV company remaining a
leading producer rather than a commissioner of programmes.
Earlier this year, Mr Gerry Robinson, chief executive of Granada Group,
forced the resignation of Mr David Plowright, chairman of Granada Television
and one of the most respected figures in ITV. He was replaced by Mr Andrew
Quinn, who had the title of chief executive and who recently resigned to
become chief executive of ITV.
Mr Allen has worked closely with Mr Robinson since 1983 and in 1991 was
appointed chief executive of Granada Leisure, which groups motorway
services, hotels, night clubs and theme parks.
'This is the inevitable consequences of not standing up and being counted
when David Plowright was forced to resign,' a Granada programme maker said
yesterday.

FT  09 SEP 92 / GPA to ask shareholders to support Dollars 300m share issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GPA Group, the world's largest aircraft leasing group, will today ask some
of its biggest shareholders to support a new issue of shares aimed at
raising about Dollars 300m (Pounds 150m).
For the first time since the group's international flotation was pulled in
June, GPA has asked its big shareholders to its headquarters in Shannon, the
Irish Republic, for a two-day meeting.
GPA will tell shareholders that an injection of fresh equity is part of a
recovery programme which includes two more asset-backed securitised issues
and the renegotiation of its aircraft acquisition programme.
The group has placed Dollars 12bn of aircraft orders for the rest of the
decade.
Institutional shareholders said they may be willing to participate in a new
issue of shares providing the price was right and all of GPA's shareholders
took part.
In contrast to its earlier attempt to raise finance, which was preceded by a
disagreement between GPA and its advisers over the pricing of new shares,
the group yesterday said it had an open mind about the pricing of new
shares.
One institutional shareholder said: 'GPA appears to have learnt some lessons
from the aborted flotation. Whereas in the past GPA fixed the price on a
take-it-or-leave-it basis, it is now asking us at what price the new shares
should be offered.'
Since GPA's aborted flotation, when it tried to raise Dollars 800m by
offering shares at a price of Dollars 20, most of its shareholders believe
the value of their shares have fallen by at least Dollars 5 to Dollars 15.
The shares are also being quoted on the Dublin grey market at between
Dollars 6 to Dollars 8, although no transactions have taken place.
Shareholders will also be given an update on the recent management changes.
These resulted in Mr Maurice Foley being replaced as chief executive by Mr
Tony Ryan, who founded the company 17 years ago, as executive chairman and
chief executive.
Some shareholders have expressed concern about the move. Mr Foley, who was
well regarded by many institutional investors, was responsible for the
day-to-day running of the group.
GPA said Mr Ryan had taken charge because of his expertise in leasing and
selling aircraft and in dealing with aircraft makers.

FT  09 SEP 92 / Scramble for a licence to print money: Demand for banknotes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, BETHAN HUTTON and CHRISTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KIEV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The cluster of international companies supplying banknotes, paper and
printing technology to central banks and governments faces one of the
biggest upheavals since the birth of the paper currency business 250 years
ago.
In spite of falling inflation, central banks in the big industrialised
countries are issuing many more banknotes, as they seek cleaner, better
designed and higher-security notes for cash dispensers and other automatic
banking operations.
Heavy demand for 'parallel' currencies in politically and economically
distressed countries is also increasing demand for the dollar and the
D-Mark. The US Bureau of Engraving, which handles dollar printing, expanded
banknote output by 25 per cent last year to 8.5bn notes, and is due to raise
production to 18.2bn by the year 2000.
Outside the industrialised west, a sizeable group of new customers - freshly
independent republics of the former Soviet Union and former members of the
communist bloc previously bound to the rouble zone - has entered the
banknote market.
Mr Philip Conway, managing director of the paper-making subsidiary of
Portals, the world's largest supplier of banknote paper, says former eastern
bloc countries 'have recognised that their currencies were old-fashioned and
insecure against counterfeiting. To have within one or two years around 20
new countries (as potential customers) is something rare in our business.'
Mr Tilmann Otto, managing director in charge of marketing at Giesecke &amp;
Devrient, the big German banknote printer which supplies half the roughly
2bn D-Mark banknotes in circulation, sums up the new aggressiveness in the
industry: 'We don't simply want to defend our market share, but also to
maintain growth. Everywhere there is a chance for orders, we are present.'
The company recently won an order to produce banknotes for Latvia. It has
also printed new zloty notes to distribute when Poland's long-awaited
currency reform takes effect.
In another sign of scrambling for eastern contracts, Canadian Bank Note
Company (CBNC), the Ottawa-based group which prints half of Canada's
banknotes, last month agreed to produce new currency for the former Soviet
republic of Tajikistan in central Asia. It has also clinched the largest
eastern deal so far, a CDollars 36m (Pounds 15m) order to print the new
Ukranian currency, the hryvnia, to be issued next year. De La Rue, the
UK-based company which is the world's biggest security printer, will share
the printing to increase stability of supply. 'Many former Soviet republics
outside Russia are considering using their own currencies,' says Mr Jeremy
Marshall, De La Rue's managing director. 'We are closely in contact with all
the countries interested in doing this.'
Uzbekistan, in central Asia, also appears to be pondering a break from the
rouble. According to industry reports, Harrison and Sons, the High
Wycombe-based security-printing company owned by the Lonrho trading group,
is negotiating a joint security and currency printing venture with
Uzbekistan.
Another company which has been turning its attentions to the former
communist lands is US Banknote, the biggest US security printer. Mr Stanley
Kreitman, president, says: 'Banknotes normally wear out in 18 months, so you
are always soliciting new business.'
The main problem in wooing new eastern customers is arranging the financing.
'It is a huge potential market, but the only problem is that they have no
money,' says Mr Peter Caithness, a market consultant for BA Banknote.
The top corporate names pursuing such orders are nearly all old-established
companies from Europe and North America with far-flung international
activities.
Many banknote makers have been pushed towards exports by the dominant
position of state-owned banknote printing companies in their home
territories. Of the top seven industrialised countries, only two - Germany
and Canada - use private sector companies for large amounts of banknote
printing. Of world banknote production of roughly 100bn notes a year, only
around 10 per cent is supplied by commercial, as opposed to state-owned,
printing works.
With estimated annual production of around 5.5bn banknotes, De La Rue
outstrips its competitors by a large margin. 'It is a world power, a war
machine,' sighs Mr Michel Aime, managing director of the Paris-headquartered
Francois-Charles Oberthur group, a fast-growing security printing company
which produces 1bn banknotes a year.
Oberthur relies for its staple customer base on about 13 or 14 Francophone
African countries, whose banknote orders are channelled through the Banque
de France.
But Oberthur has also been active in picking up business elsewhere, aided by
manufacturing in its French plants, which also make stamps, lottery tickets
and identity documents.
But De La Rue has set a tough pace. It has shifted production to low-cost
plants in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malta and Sri Lanka. It is also building a
Pounds 10m currency printing plant in Nairobi.
Through its subsidiary De La Rue Giori, which accounts for an estimated 95
per cent of annual sales of banknote machinery, De La Rue is also a dominant
force in printing presses. It supplies competitors such as G &amp; D and central
banks with their own printing works. De La Rue Giori machines are being used
to re-equip the Bank of England plant, which has produced its own notes
since 1791.
By contrast, when West Germany restarted its own banknote production after
the Second World War, the Bundesbank allotted a 50 per cent share in
banknote manufacturing to G &amp; D. The other half is taken by the
Bundesdruckerei, the state printing works.
The international jostling to sell paper money looks certain to increase.
Harrison's Mr Stuart says competition is now coming increasingly from state
banknote printers, under pressure from central banks to subsidise their own
production with export orders.
'The thing that concerns us most is those subsidised, large printing works
trying to get in on what was a market for privately owned companies. There
are quite a number of them doing it,' he says.
The bigger commercial banknote printers hope eventually to turn the tables.
The Bank of England, for example, is taking seriously a behind-the-scenes
campaign by De La Rue to try to win political approval for privatising
Britain's banknote manufacturing.
De La Rue claims that it could do the Bank of England's work more cheaply
and with no loss of security. No one imagines De La Rue will have an easy
job in breaking through the Bank's portals. Compared with the task of
clinching a deal for English pounds, winning banknote orders from Ukraine
and Uzbekistan may turn out to be child's play.

FT  09 SEP 92 / Lamont fends off criticism with strong rejection of
devaluation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN LAMONT has moved to pre-empt a row over the economy at next
month's Conservative party conference with a robust defence of his refusal
to devalue the pound.
The chancellor reassured Tory activists that the economy would emerge from
recession during 'the course of this year'.
His comments, in the latest issue of the party newspaper, will be followed
tomorrow by a renewed attempt from Mr John Major to reassure industrialists
and to steady the nerves of government supporters over economic prospects.
The prime minister, who earlier this week sought to quell the revolt within
his party over the Maastricht treaty, plans to restate his conviction that
the pain of recession will bring the reward of a sustained upturn.
Conservative MPs returning from their summer break have reported growing
unrest in constituency associations over the length and depth of the
recession. Ministers are adding their voice to predictions that criticism of
Mr Lamont's strategy may sour planned conference celebrations of April's
election victory.
A number of constituencies - whose associations tend to be dominated by
small business owners and the self-employed - have tabled critical motions.
Most call for early interest rate reductions, with some making a link with
the need to devalue or withdraw sterling from the European exchange rate
mechanism.
In the long and strongly worded article published in Conservative Newsline,
Mr Lamont rejected suggestions that a lower pound would speed economic
upturn. He insisted: 'Devaluation would not help recovery. It would lead to
a collapse in market confidence and a damaging rise in interest rates.' He
added that withdrawal from the ERM would be a bigger mistake. 'We would see
a huge fall in the pound and an explosion in inflation.'
Anticipating what is expected to be a central theme of Mr Major's speech in
Edinburgh, Mr Lamont promised that the current strategy would bring an end
to 'stop-go' economics.
The sharp and continuing fall in Britain's inflation rate had been
overlooked. 'Yet those figures tell us more about the future of the British
economy and our long-term prospects than any other bit of economic news.'
But those who argued for what would be a 'quite disastrous' decision by the
government to ease up in the battle against inflation had to recognise that
prices were rising faster in the UK than in France or Germany.
He pointed to a range of economic indicators to dismiss predictions that the
recession might be prolonged indefinitely. Manufacturing output had risen
for two successive quarters, exports and retail sales had increased in the
second quarter and the growth of unemployment had slowed.
The chancellor added: 'I expect growth to resume in the course of this
year.' The recovery would be slow at first but the 'critical point' was that
'the only way to secure a long-lasting recovery is to put in place a stable
medium-term framework which will deliver low inflation'.

FT  09 SEP 92 / School standards plan attracts over 4,000 would-be
inspectors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 4,000 people have applied to become school inspectors under the
government's new scheme for monitoring standards in England's schools.
Launching the Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted) yesterday,
Professor Stewart Sutherland, chief inspector of schools, said the selection
of the first 210 inspectors would start next week, with teams ready to start
work in September 1993.
From next year, all schools in England will be subject to inspection at
least once every four years by a team appointed by Ofsted, the successor to
Her Majesty's Inspectorate, under the direction of the chief inspector.
Inspection teams, which must include at least one lay member without direct
teaching experience, will be licensed by Ofsted. Licensed teams will bid for
inspections, most likely school-by-school, with Ofsted awarding inspections
on the basis of price and quality. Of the 4,000 applicants, 1,500 are from
individuals applying to be inspection team leaders, the majority wishing to
inspect secondary schools.
In line with government hopes, lay inspector posts are proving attractive to
individuals from private sector backgrounds. Of 100 applications processed,
24 are from present or past consultants, 21 from managers, six from company
directors and six from 'professionals'.
Prof Sutherland said: 'My office is now heavily engaged in the assessment of
this avalanche of applications. Nearly 1,000 have already passed the first
scrutiny and will be invited to take a place on the Ofsted training scheme.'
Schools thought to be 'at risk' of failing to offer a satisfactory education
will be given priority for inspection by Ofsted. Where a school is found to
be 'at risk', its governors will be expected to take urgent action to
improve standards.
Mr John Patten, education secretary, intends to take powers to send in a
national taskforce to run schools which fail to improve themselves after
being designated 'at risk'.
Ms Ann Taylor, Labour's education spokesman, said the new system was 'a
recipe for uneven and sub-standard inspection', adding: 'Inspectors will be
sent to schools with little training.'

FT  09 SEP 92 / Opinion poll group makes switch to secret balloting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LEADING opinion poll organisation is to change its survey methods
radically, following the disastrous performance of pollsters at the general
election in April. Other polling organisations may follow.
ICM, one of the big five pollsters, said yesterday it would abandon oral
questioning of electors on voting intentions in favour of a system of
confidential ballot papers.
Extensive research since the election has persuaded ICM that this would
produce more accurate results as it is more likely to disclose true voting
intentions than a face-to-face interview.
The final polls before the April 9 election recorded, on average, a Labour
lead of 1.3 per cent and varied between a 0.5 per cent and a 3 per cent
swing to Labour. In the event, the Tories won by a margin of 7.6 per cent,
gaining 42.8 per cent of the vote compared with Labour's 35.2 per cent.
It was described by one leading pollster as 'the worst result for the
opinion polls since they were invented', and the inquest has been going on
ever since.
Mr Brian Gosschalk, director of Mori, is still looking at polling
methodology, but said: 'We are considering introducing a secret ballot.' Mr
Bob Wybrow, director of Gallup, said the idea of a secret ballot was being
studied. ICM's research involved reinterviewing those who took part in its
final pre-election survey.
This confirmed a high degree of reluctance among Conservative supporters to
say how they would vote. When the election polls were adjusted in the light
of the new information, and the confidential ballot paper substituted, the
outcome was very close to the actual election result.
Only 1 per cent of the people in the tests refused to take part in the
secret ballot compared with 7 per cent when using conventional polling
methods, and the results were found to be much more accurate.
Under the new method, anyone who declines to take part in the secret ballot
will be asked to say which party has the best policies on the economy. This
answer will then be used to determine how they would probably vote.
Mr Nick Sparrow, managing director of ICM, said yesterday: 'This change in
technique has the effect of increasing the Tory vote in line with what
actually happened in the election. It must therefore be a big step forward,
and other polling organisations will have to take note of it.'
There are already signs that this is happening. Mr Nick Moon, director of
NOP, said the research was encouraging. 'We are reaching no decision yet,
but it could be a sensible thing to do.'

FT  09 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: IMI
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IMI might feel a touch piqued about yesterday's 8 per cent fall in its share
price. After all, it managed to contain the drop in first half profits to 9
per cent. Capital spending is up 16 per cent to Pounds 24m and, despite a
further Pounds 14m in acquisitions, gearing is still only 31 per cent. The
share performance, however, has to be taken in the context of a steep run-up
over the past month. Assuming full year earnings little changed on last
year's 15p, IMI is still trading on a prospective multiple slightly above
the market average. The question is whether it boasts sufficient growth
prospects to justify such a rating.
Parts of its business are highly geared to recovery. But IMI's strength
through the recession has been the breadth of its diversification both
geographically and in terms of product. That could work against it in a
recovery. The company expects to eradicate titanium losses by the end of the
year, but revival hopes there must be limited by the weak dollar, the
parlous state of the civil aircraft market and falling defence orders.
The only real fizz is to be found in drinks dispensers, which is hardly
enough to sustain the whole group. Yet, if it persists in rating IMI so
highly, the market may be pointing towards a different sort of growth
opportunity. IMI could use its own paper to mount a sizeable acquisition -
providing a sufficiently attractive target can be found to tempt its
innately cautious management.

FT  09 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Wimpey
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It speaks volumes for the bleak outlook in the building sectors that even
after halving its interim dividend yesterday Wimpey shares were trading on a
10 per cent yield. Investors are not sure whether the lower level of payout
can be sustained, and who can argue with them? Tarmac, for one, must be all
too painfully aware that a single cut in the current recession may not be
enough.
To some extent Wimpey has only itself to blame for the market's
disenchantment. The company was not alone in raising expectations earlier
this year, but a less than informative presentation at the half way stage is
hardly calculated to placate shareholders who have lost 50 per cent of their
investment in the last six months. Nor does it do to over-sell the strategy.
Wimpey has rightly been given credit for pursuing a survival plan without
recourse to a rights issue. But interim gearing - 23 per cent post the
Pounds 110m Little Britain property proceeds - will be nearer 30 per cent by
the year end. It will almost certainly continue to rise in 1993 even if the
company completes its Pounds 100m disposal programme and achieves its target
of being cash neutral.
The bigger worry, though, is where the earnings impetus will come from.
Wimpey is surely right to dispose of the sort of low yielding assets which
were so fashionable in the 1980s, but its remaining businesses will continue
to feel the chill for some time. Further provisions look inevitable in
housing, contracting margins will be wafer thin however choosy the company
be-comes, and pricing pressure in minerals can only intensify. Wimpey will
be a survivor, but hardly an exciting one.

FT  09 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Currencies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One must either gape in admiration or in horror at the behaviour of the
Swedish central bank. To raise its overnight emergency lending rate by 8
percentage points to 24 per cent when inflation is only 2 per cent and the
economy is in deep recession takes, to say the least, determination. But it
is also a vivid illustration of the price that peripheral countries in
Europe are paying to align themselves with a fixed-rate currency system
centring around the D-Mark. Weaker countries already inside the system must
be wondering whether they will eventually be called on to pay a similar
price.
There is some consolation in the thought that the Nordic currencies are a
special case. All are outside the formal system and defended by central
banks with limited reserves. Sweden's rate rise was prompted by Finland's
decision to float the markka - and Finland's troubles are compounded by its
heavy dependence on forest products priced in dollars.
The implications for struggling ERM members like the UK are disturbing
nonetheless. Sweden's action is a rude reminder that a small rate increase
will be insufficient if it does become necessary to use the interest weapon
to defend the pound. Then again, such a drastic move seems so perverse as to
make the whole effort at European currency stability look absurd. Investors
could be forgiven for doubting whether European politicians will have the
stamina to stay the course.

FT  09 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Fisons' doubtful cure
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After yesterday's interim results, the market lost all patience with Fisons.
The proximate cause of the 14 per cent share price fall was a further
reduction in analysts' estimates of full year profits, but behind that are
worries that the new team also suffers from a habit of producing nasty
surprises. Historically, shocks have centred on the pharmaceuticals division
and its spat with the US Food and Drug Administration. Now it transpires
that the scientific instruments business has been badly hit by recession and
the company has not hedged for 1993 against the effects of a weaker dollar.
Although some of this can be put down to bad luck, such developments will
hardly help management shed its reputation for treading on banana skins.
Fisons has some good products and there is a market for them. The balance
sheet will be further strengthened this year by disposals which should
eliminate net borrowings. But credibility is the key to the company's
revival. To prosper as a small player in pharmaceuticals, and to find favour
in the City, the company must be seen to have mastered its difficulties -
most notably the production problems which have slowed sales and soured
relations with the US authorities.
Of course there are props for the share price. The dividend looks secure,
and the yield of 1.5 times the market average is more commonly found among
recovery stocks than drug companies. The businesses have real value - broken
up the company is worth more than its present Pounds 1bn market
capitalisation. But with no bidder in sight, investors must decide when or
whether that value will be realised by the current management. The judgment
is still finely balanced.

FT  09 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Killings at Bisho
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SLOWLY BUT surely the prospect of a stable, democratic South Africa is
moving out of reach. The circumstances of the June massacre in Boipatong and
Monday's slaughter in Bisho differ widely, but are the symptoms of the same
malaise - politically motivated violence. The latest tragedy underlines the
need for a speedy implementation of the Security Council's plan for a UN
observer team intended to help avert such tragedies and revive the stalled
peace process.
No party emerges from the Bisho killings with clean hands. The overwhelming
burden of blame clearly rests on Brigadier Oupa Gqozo, leader of the
nominally independent homeland of Ciskei. Yet Brig Gqozo is also a creature
of apartheid, and Pretoria remains the puppet master. President FW de
Klerk's denial of responsibility on the grounds that the massacre did not
take place on South African soil, and that it was Ciskei soldiers who were
in charge, is disingenuous. A similar march in July nearly ended in
bloodshed; intervention by South African security forces might have
prevented Monday's massacre.
But it is the tactics of the ANC that deserve to come under the most
critical scrutiny. What was its objective in marching on Bisho? If it was to
parade the party banner in an important constituency, where Brig Gqozo's
regime has tried to suppress opposition, it was a legitimate albeit risky
exercise.
There seems little doubt, however, that for some demonstrators, notably
senior members of the South African Communist party, it was an intoxicating
opportunity to storm the barricades, at the risk of deaths, to give impetus
to the mass action campaign that fizzled out after its launch last month.
The rhetoric of these radicals obscures reality. Mr de Klerk is too weak to
govern effectively; but he remains too strong to be overthrown - or allow
the ANC to overthrow homeland leaders.
Corrupt and authoritarian as most of the homeland 'governments' are, they
are a fact of life, notwithstanding the political fantasy of their claims to
independence. They perform practical administrative roles, responsible for
education, health, housing and other services. A post-apartheid government
must live with - and work through - the administrative structures now in
place.
But unless the ANC is prepared to countenance bloodshed on a scale far
exceeding the massacre in Bisho, the future of the homelands must be
determined at the negotiating table. The appropriate formula has in fact
already been accepted at the Convention for a Democratic South Africa, the
multi-party negotiating forum which reached deadlock last May. Nearly all
homeland leaders agreed in principle to referenda which would offer the
choice of independence or re-incorporation into South Africa.
But the homelands are secondary to the fundamental issue: how to relaunch
negotiations on reconciling majority rule and minority rights. And here the
outlook was not without hope before the latest tragedy. Although piecemeal
and tardy, the government's response to the ANC's terms for the resumption
of talks, broken off after the Boipatong killing, had appeared to open the
way for renewed negotiations. The Bisho massacre makes the need for such
talks even more pressing.
