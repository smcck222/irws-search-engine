FT  02 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow holds its ground as
currency declines

Wall Street
US STOCK markets held their ground yesterday in the wake of a declining
dollar and some mostly negative economic reports, writes Patrick Harverson
in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 8.91 up at 3,266.26, having spent
the day near to Monday's close. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 2.04 at
416.07, while the Nasdaq composite added 2.49 at 565.61.
Turnover on the New York SE was fairly light at 174m shares, and rises
outpaced declines by 945 to 738.
Although the stock markets have been hostage to the dollar's fortunes in
recent weeks, yesterday's drop in the US currency's value to an all-time low
against the D-Mark had little effect on equities.
Attention was otherwise focused on economic news. A 0.1 per cent rise in
July leading indicators, a 0.6 per cent decline in construction spending in
the same month, and the slight fall in the National Association of
Purchasing Management's August index confirmed that economic activity
remained extremely sluggish in spite of the lowest domestic interest rates
in 30 years.
Lennar lost Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 28 1/4 on news that some Florida
homeowners, whose Lennar-built houses were destroyed by Hurricane Andrew,
plan to file a suit against the company. The decline may also have been a
natural correction to recent gains in Lennar stock, prompted by expectations
that the company would benefit from the demand for new homes in south
Florida.
Another stock affected by the hurricane was American Reliance, which dropped
Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 17 5/8 on the American Stock Exchange on the
expectation that the company will incur substantial direct losses from
property damage in Florida.
Airline shares were in demand as investors anticipated an improvement in
carriers' business now that the summer fare war is over. UAL advanced
Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 107 1/2 , Delta rose Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 52
1/2 , USAir put on Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 13 1/2 and AMR, parent of
American Airlines, gained Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 57 3/8 .
Oil issues, which have posted strong gains in recent months after a long
period in the doldrums, were mostly lower after broking house Wertheim
Schroder cut its ratings on six big oil companies, arguing that they had
reached, or were near, their target prices. Royal Dutch shed Dollars  3/8 to
Dollars 90 3/4 , Texaco Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 65 3/8 , Atlantic Richfield
Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 114 3/8 and Amoco Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 51 1/4 .
Canada
TORONTO share prices closed steady for the second consecutive day. The TSE
300 index gained 4.7 at 3,407.6 and advancing issues led declines by 294 to
218 after a fair volume of 30.2m shares.
MDC 'A' rose 7 cents to 55 cents and topped the actives list on volume of
5.3m shares after heavy block trading.
PWA said it has begun legal action to have Gemini Group Automated
Distribution Systems declared insolvent. Gemini termed the action without
merit, said it has a strong financial position and that PWA had boycotted
meetings of the Gemini board. PWA, up 43 cents on Monday, lost 15 cents to
CDollars 3.15. Air Canada, which is a partner with Gemini, gained 10 cents
at CDollars 4.50.

FT  02 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets: Timely leaks lift Tokyo off the bottom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week demonstrated the Japanese market's ability to anticipate events;
and, linked with this, it showed that the prospect of determined and broadly
based government action can do more for equities than a period of masterly
inactivity.
Japan's Y10,700bn (Dollars 87bn) economic stimulus package was not detailed
until after the Tokyo equity market closed last Friday, but there was a
succession of helpful leaks, mainly on Thursday and Friday, which left the
FT-Actuaries Japan index up 9.9 per cent last week after a rise of 11.8 per
cent over the previous five trading days.
In two weeks, Tokyo has recovered from a fall of 33.7 per cent this year to
one of 18.5 per cent, and from a position of the worst performer in the
World Index series to fourth from bottom, after Finland, Denmark and Italy.
Europe's decline continued with a fall of 2 per cent on the week, and a
neutral performance in the US left the World Index 1.9 per cent higher on
balance. The time is ripe, it seems, for the analysts, investment
strategists and asset allocation specialists to guide their clients.
On Japan, Mr Shigeki Sakaki says in an economic commentary for Nomura
International that the government package includes public loans which may
crowd out private loans and, therefore, not increase demand for goods and
services. Thus, he says, the package's true effect on the economy may be
Y4,000bn to Y5,000bn, or about 1 per cent of GNP.
Mr Sushil Wadhwani, the Goldman Sachs strategist, says the move is evidence
of a change in the attitude of the authorities to the market - 'equivalent,
so to speak, to drawing a line in the sand' - but that while a bottom in the
market may have been found, that equities are now well up with events and
there is scope for short-term disappointment.
On Europe, Mr Wadhwani is more sanguine. European equities, he notes, have
fallen by more than 15 per cent since the Danish referendum three months
ago, on European monetary union uncertainty and downgrades of economic
forecasts partly precipitated by pessimism about German interest rates.
He adds, however, that using a quantitative framework, neither the rise in
bond yields nor the actual downgrading of earnings growth stemming from
these uncertainties can explain more than a small proportion of the actual
decline in share prices.
There are other opinions, notably from Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, which says
the sharp and painful corrections necessary to adjust the markets'
'notoriously optimistic' profit and interest rate expectations to reality
still have some way to go.
Mr Wadhwani thinks European equities are a 'good medium-term buying
opportunity'. There is short-term risk in the French referendum, but a 'Yes'
vote would prompt a general rise, while there would be little risk to
German, Dutch or Swiss equities if the voters were to say 'No'.

FT  02 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei drops back below
18,000 on profit-taking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   TOKYO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE shares ran into profit-taking after the Nikkei average's
1,680-point surge over the previous four sessions, agencies report from
Tokyo.
The Nikkei closed 321.06, or 1.8 per cent, down at 17,740.06, after a day's
low of 17,699.72 and high of 18,059.21. Declines outnumbered advances by 751
to 285, while 82 issues were unchanged.
Volume was estimated at 550m shares, down from 564.5m registered on Monday.
The Topix index of all first sec-tion stocks slipped 15.24 to 1,370.27,
while in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index lost 6.11 to 1,086.07.
Traders said the Nikkei's downside was probably limited to 17,500 as
sentiment remained buoyant in the wake of the government's fiscal stimulus
package. However, they added that selling pressure remained heavy above
18,000.
Mr Hiroyuki Maki, a trader with County NatWest Securities, said that with
the Nikkei at 18,000, and price/earnings ratios above 45, 'the market does
not look cheap'. With companies cutting their earnings forecasts for the
current fiscal year, the ratios could soon exceed 50, he added.
Individuals and dealers dominated trading, with Aids-related shares
attracting the most interest. Meiji Milk accounted for roughly 9 per cent of
the day's turnover as it advanced Y50 to Y1,110. Mochida Pharmaceutical
climbed Y160 to Y3,690.
Other sectors which had risen sharply over the previous two weeks fell on
profit-taking. Mitsubishi Estate dropped Y53 to Y957 and Mitsui Real Estate
Y40 to Y1,040.
Blue chip electricals were mostly softer, although the latest downward
earnings revisions did not have a big effect. Hitachi dipped Y11 to Y786 and
Toshiba shed Y18 to Y620.
Takashimaya weakened Y40 to Y1,000 after a newspaper reported that the
company will suffer a 48 per cent drop in pre-tax profits in the current
fiscal year.
Carmakers lost ground following the domestic car sales data for August that
showed a 16.3 per cent fall from a year ago, the sharpest decline since
November 1980. Toyota Motor receded Y30 to Y1,420 and Mazda Y15 to Y450.
Roundup
TOKYO'S retreat prompted profit-taking in the Pacific Basin region.
TAIWAN finished slightly higher as investors became cautious after the
recent rises. The weighted index put on 14.10 at 3,960.45 as turnover
decreased to TDollars 25.56bn from Monday's TDollars 29.5bn.
Slight profit-taking was seen but major players and institutions traded
actively, encouraging small investors. China Steel, strong in the past two
days, relinquished 30 cents to TDollars 17.50 on profit-taking.
HONG KONG closed firmer after an early decline, selling orders having dried
up by mid-morning. The Hang Seng index gained a net 82.97 at 5,711.97 in
turnover of HKDollars 2.7bn. The market was closed on Monday.
HSBC Holdings led the actives list, rising HKDollars 2 to HKDollars 56.50 on
the back of last week's results.
MANILA fell further in listless trading as PLDT and Philippine National Bank
continued to soften in reaction to the steady rise of the peso against the
dollar. The composite index shed 9.75 to 1,366.91 in combined turnover of
163.36m pesos, after Monday's 144m.
AUSTRALIA eased in quiet trading dominated by selling of industrial stocks.
The All Ordinaries index finished 4.7 off at 1,542.5 in turnover of ADollars
168.2m.
Lend Lease tumbled 30 cents to ADollars 14.00, extending its fall since its
disappointing results last week to ADollars 1.90, while Brambles slid 56
cents to ADollars 14.98, a loss of ADollars 1.12 so far this week ahead of
its financial results, due tomorrow.
NEW ZEALAND rose slightly in light trading on the first day of spring, the
NZSE-40 capital index firming 1.96 to 1,483.88 in turnover of around
NZDollars 14.4m. Fletcher Challenge moved forward 4 cents to NZDollars 2.40
following late interest from Australian institutions.
Fishing concern Sanford advanced 15 cents to NZDollars 5.10 on expectations
that Sealord, Carter Holt's fishing company, will not now be floated.
SINGAPORE closed easier on thin selling, the Straits Times Industrial index
losing 3.08 to 1,375.46 in volume of 28.11m shares, up from 26.38m.
KUALA LUMPUR retreated in the afternoon on profit-taking. The composite
index ended 1.23 down at 573.50 after reaching an early high of 579.21.
Volume fell to 31.4m shares from Friday's 51.1m. The market was shut on
Monday. Tenaga Nasional was active as 1.5m shares changed hands. It closed
steady at MDollars 9.65.
SEOUL consolidated after a two-day rise. The composite index retreated 4.20
to 558.60 in turnover of Won639.6bn, up from Monday's Won428.2bn.

FT  02 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Renewed dollar weakness hurts
bourses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE renewed tumble in the dollar hit currency-sensitive bourses yesterday,
writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT fell on the dollar, and on a warning from the outgoing president
of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), Mr Heinrich Weiss, that Germany
was heading for long-term recession and a sharp rise in unemployment if wage
and budget policies are not changed.
The DAX index lost 22.55, or 1.3 per cent to 1,518.70 as the dollar
registered its lowest ever Frankfurt fixing, dropping to DM1.3977 from
DM1.4097.
Turnover fell again, from DM4.2bn to DM3.8bn. Dollar stocks, particularly
the carmakers, led the declines with Daimler DM10.30 lower at DM617.70, BMW
down DM10 to DM499 and Volkswagen off DM9.60 at DM317.50.
Lufthansa rose against the trend, adding another DM3.80 for a two day gain
of DM11.80, or 12.6 per cent at DM105.80. Unions at the loss-ridden air
carrier agreed to a one-year wage freeze on Monday.
PARIS recovered from the day's lows but the mood remained cautious. The
CAC-40 ended 10.65 down at 1,674.23, after 1,662.47, in thin turnover of
FFr1.15bn.
Building stocks remained weak following last week's poor housing figures.
Lafarge dropped FFr7.20 to FFr264 while Saint-Gobain, also depressed by the
impact of the weak dollar on its US earnings, fell FFr10.80 to FFr489.20.
News that Baltica, Denmark's biggest insurer, made a loss of DKr991m in the
first six months took Suez down by FFr4.10 to FFr224.40. Suez has an
indirect stake in Baltica via Victoire.
Total closed FFr1.50 lower at FFr207.30 just before first-half results
featured a net profit of FFr1.91bn, down 47 per cent. This fell short of
market expectations of FFr2.2bn-FFr2.4bn and dealers expected the shares to
open lower today.
Among smaller stocks, Seb fell another FFr14.10 or 3.7 per cent to FFr370 as
the market responded badly for the second day to its disappointing interim
results.
MILAN hit another low for the year as uncertainty about the French
Maastricht referendum Maastricht kept investors on the sidelines. The Comit
index fell 5.94 or 1.5 per cent to 384.99 in turnover estimated at around
L50bn on the return of London traders, up from Monday's meagre L35.7bn.
Montedison, whose chairman Mr Giuseppe Garofano was due to be questioned by
a magistrate later in the day over an alleged payment to a political party,
lost L20 to L1,101.
Fiat lost L77 to L3,942 and Mediobanca by L300 to L10,100.
ZURICH eased, the SMI index closing 4.3 lower at 1,747.3, but company news
took some shares higher: Alusuisse rose SFr2 to SFr404 as the diversified
metals company forecast a 20 to 40 per cent rise in group net profits this
year; Oerlikon added SFr3 to SFr449 on a turnround into profit, and Swissair
put on SFr10 to SFr560 as it said that income had outpaced costs in July.
STOCKHOLM fell across the board in thin trading as high domestic interest
rates and a poor performance in major markets abroad dragged prices down.
The Affarsvarlden General index fell 21.1 or 2.7 per cent to 751.6 in
turnover of SKr342m after SKr260m.
Volvo B shares fell SKr11 to SKr257 on news of a SKr2bn cost-cutting
programme for its truck division, which was interpreted negatively by the
market.
COPENHAGEN fell 2.4 per cent, the KFX index shedding 1.88 to a new low of
74.88 as Baltica fell DKr20 to DKr360.
Mr Michael Douglas of Bikuben said that the index was pushed down an hour
before noon, ahead of the expiry of futures contracts; it stabilised
thereafter, but weakened again in the last half-hour of the day.
OSLO continued its recent plunge as the deepening crisis in Norway's
financial sector dampened investor interest. The all-share index was down
9.77 or 3.1 per cent to 309.12 in thin turnover of NKr156.6m.
HELSINKI, a byword for losses this year, managed to fall on profit-taking,
the fall of 11.0, or 1.9 per cent to 561.9 wiping nearly all the Hex index
had recovered over the previous three days.
MADRID closed modestly higher on a batch of steady, or better first half
earnings results, Telefonica, and Dragados among them. The general index
closed 1.40 higher at 206.37.
AMSTERDAM's CBS Tendency index fell 0.8 to 109.1, weighed down by the weak
dollar and firm domestic interest rates.
ISTANBUL was volatile on reports, later denied, that the yield on nine-month
treasury bills would fall by six percentage points. The index rose to a high
of 4,234.46 but later fell on profit-taking to end 20.8 up at 4,168.72.
TEL AVIV's blue chip index gained 1.77, or 1.1 per cent to 158.12 in
response to positive half-year corporate reports.

Strong &amp; Fisher, the sheep skin processor and leather clothing manufacturer
70.3 per cent owned by Hillsdown Holdings, yesterday reported a 60 per cent
fall in interim profits, from Pounds 5.23m to Pounds 2.17m.
Although turnover for the six months to end-June was static at Pounds 44.4m,
operating profits declined from Pounds 4.3m to Pounds 675,000.
The pre-tax figure was struck after a Pounds 535,000 profit arising from the
disposal of surplus land and buildings and interest receivable of Pounds
960,000 (Pounds 918,000).
Mr Michel Buswell, chairman, said the balance sheet remained strong, with
healthy cash resources.
The leather division was still profitable, he added, although the second
half would be adversely affected by the weakness of the dollar.
Earnings per share came out at 0.9p (2.7p) basic, or 0.8p (2p) fully
diluted.

FT  02 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Flogas rises to IPounds 7.16m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits of Flogas, a distributor of liquefied petroleum gas,
amounted to IPounds 7.16m (Pounds 6.8m) for the 13 months to June 30.
That compared with IPounds 6.74m for the 12 months to end-May 1991. The
inclusion of the extra month had no impact as a break-even result was
achieved for the month - in common with previous years.
Sales of the Irish Republic-based group declined to IPounds 48.1m (IPounds
50.5m), principally due to lower selling prices.
Net borrowings were reduced by IPounds 1.22m to IPounds 4.03m, some 12 per
cent of shareholders' funds.
Earnings were static at 23.92p (23.78p) but a final dividend of 4.98p makes
a 7.92p (7.41p) total.

STRICT control over costs helped Macfarlane Group (Clansman) lift profits 13

Earnings per share rose to 6.06p (5.33p) and the interim dividend is
increased from 1.75p to 1.88p.
Lord Macfarlane, chairman of the Glasgow-based packaging company, said that
strict cost controls would ensure the improvements would continue despite
'the recession lasting longer than the economists, and others who should
have known better, predicted.'
At the end of the period the company had no borrowings and cash in hand of
Pounds 6m.

FT  02 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Unigate disposes of US cheese operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIGATE, the food and transport group, is continuing the restructuring of
its portfolio of activities with the sale of its US cheese operations for
about Dollars 75m (Pounds 37m).
The disposal will give Unigate a profit over the book value of Dollars 57m
and represents an exit multiple of 16 times last year's profits.
Unigate's shares rose 4p to 231p.
The buyer is Stella, a larger US cheese business ultimately owned by Artal
of Belgium. The consideration will be met in cash and could be adjusted to
reflect working capital at the time. The sale is subject to approval by US
competition authorities.
Unigate's US cheese operations consist of two businesses, Frigo and
Gardenia, which make Italian-style cheeses. In the year to end-March the two
made an operating profit of Pounds 4.5m, a recovery from Pounds 400,000
previously.
Mr Ross Buckland, chief executive of Unigate since October 1990, said the
business had been subject to volatile milk prices and despite action taken
to improve profitability Unigate was still not satisfied with the return it
was making. Profits were expected to fall again in the current year.
In February this year Unigate sold JP Wood, its loss-making chicken
operation, and last month sold part of its Giltspur International exhibition
business. Its Wincanton car contract hire operation is being run down, and
Unigate is discussing the sale of its vehicle rental activities. Last year
Unigate set up a Pounds 76m provision to cover losses on businesses sold or
closed.
The cash from the sale of the US cheese business will go to reduce
borrowings which were a net Pounds 47.7m in the March 31 balance sheet.

FT  02 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Persimmon falls 42% to Pounds 7.25m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE PRICES of UK housebuilders were sent tumbling again yesterday after
Persimmon, regarded as one of the best companies in the sector, announced a
42 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30.
More than Pounds 23m was knocked off Persimmon's stock market value as the
share price fell 25p to 148p.
Mr Duncan Davidson, chairman, described the UK housing market as the worst
in his 30 years in the business. Interim profits fell from Pounds 12.5m to
Pounds 7.25m despite increased sales of Pounds 71.5m (Pounds 68.5m).
Mr Davidson said that lower house prices, increased selling costs and the
high price paid for land at the end of the 1980s had pushed net margins down
from 18.2 per cent to 10.1 per cent.
Part-exchange deals and special offers, such as free carpets and white
goods, cost the group Pounds 3,500 for each home sold. This was equivalent
to a 5 per cent reduction in profit margins on an average priced home of
Pounds 63,000. If discounts were included, the figure would have been even
higher.
'In other words sales incentives could reduce pre-tax profits by about
Pounds 8m this year on sales of about 2,400 homes, slightly more than the
2,300 sold last year,' said Mr Davidson.
The group sold 1,128 homes in the first half compared with 1,100 last time.
Average selling prices, after taking account of discounts, were 8 per cent
lower.
The slight increase in sales meant that Persimmon was increasing its share
of a reduced market for new house sales, making it the seventh largest
housebuilder in the country. Last year it was the eighth largest.
Earnings per share fell to 5.2p (10.1p). The interim dividend is maintained
at 2.8p and a same-again final of 5.8p is forecast, 'unless market
conditions deteriorate further.'
Mr Davidson warned that less resilient builders were expected to cut or omit
dividends when they announce interim results during the next few weeks. 'Our
results, given the state of the market, were not too bad,' he said.
The balance sheet remained strong with net debt of Pounds 32m, equivalent to
24 per cent of shareholders funds of Pounds 132m. This excluded Pounds 11m
of off-balance sheet finance reflecting Persimmon's share of housing joint
ventures.
See Lex
Prices for housing land have fallen sharply and in some cases were between a
quarter and third of their peak in the late 1980s, Mr Duncan Davidson, said
yesterday. Prices in parts of the Midlands had fallen from between Pounds
600,000 and Pounds 700,000 an acre to just Pounds 200,000.  Owners which had
been holding land in the hope that house prices would rise were beginning to
sell sites at more realistic values, he said.  Persimmon had increased its
land bank to 13,300 plots with planning permission, representing about 5
years' supply at current selling rates. The group said that bank was higher
priced land bought in the late 1980s.

<TEXT>
FOREIGN &amp; Colonial is expected to manage the rump of Drayton Consolidated,
the investment trust which is currently planning a restructuring.
Under plans already announced, the bulk of the trust's assets will be sold
but the remainder will be placed in a 'realisation vehicle' which will
consist of the unquoted securities and the less liquid quoted shares. It is
this vehicle which Foreign &amp; Colonial is expected to manage.
Details of the restructuring are not expected to be announced for some
weeks.
Drayton wrote off more than half the value of its unlisted assets in March.
Investors have seen a sharp fall in the share price from 587p at its 1989
peak to 164p at yesterday's close.

FT  02 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Increases in core businesses limit ADT's
fall to 13%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADT, the Bermuda-based electronic security and vehicle auctions company,
yesterday reported a 13 per cent decline in pre-tax profits from Dollars
80.1m to Dollars 69.7m (Pounds 35m) for the first half of 1992.
The result, struck on sales 10 per cent ahead at Dollars 677.3m, was largely
in line with analysts expectations. The shares rose 11p to 400p.
Mr Michael Ashcroft, chairman, said the core businesses had retained their
'recession resistant qualities'. Operating profits of the security and
auctions businesses had improved to Dollars 53.1m in the second quarter,
compared with Dollars 50.6m in the first.
During the six months security services increased operating profits from
Dollars 61.7m to Dollars 64.2m.
The auctions business reported operating profits 12 per cent down at Dollars
39.5m. The company also signalled changes in the US market, which could mean
fewer products for auction. For example, car rental agencies were holding on
to vehicles longer than anticipated.
Six month profits were depressed by a sharp rise in 'other expenses less
income' from non-core activities, from Dollars 4m to Dollars 16.2m. These
included losses from a travel business and lawn care operation, which Mr
Ashcroft said were highly-seasonal.
Interest charges fell by Dollars 5.9m to Dollars 23.6m.
The dividend is withheld. Earnings per share for the first half fell by 7
cents to 52 cents.
COMMENT
These figures lend credence to Mr Ashcroft's view of ADT as a 'recession
resistant' business. But the longer the recession lasts, the harder it may
be to live up to the claim - as other companies are finding. The figures
also go some way to polishing up ADT's image. Remaining doubts centre on
such questions as whether capitalisation of some costs unfairly flatters the
security profits. The biggest reservation is the onerous Dollars 1.2bn debt,
including some Dollars 500m of convertible preference shares which fall due
in 1994. Until investors are given some sign of how this preference share
problem will be resolved, the shares are unlikely to attract confident
followers. Full-year forecasts are for between Dollars 130m and Dollars
140m. The prospective p/e of about 9 is not as cheap as it looks.

FT  02 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Haynes Publishing shows sharp advance to
Pounds 2.37m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HAYNES PUBLISHING Group, the Somerset-based printer of workshop manuals,
staged a sharp recovery over the 12 months to May 31.
Profits before tax amounted to Pounds 2.37m, against just Pounds 26,000 in
the previous year, on turnover ahead at Pounds 21.2m (Pounds 19.2m).
Mr John Haynes, chairman, said a 'solid' performance in North America had
supported the group during the restructuring of its UK operation.
Exceptional charges of Pounds 928,000 (Pounds 957,000) reflected the
cost-cutting programme in the UK which saw the volume of titles fall by 45
per cent and 25 per cent of the workforce made redundant.
The charge also included costs of writing off unearned royalty balances and
production costs.
Mr Haynes said the elimination of non-recurring costs helped the US
businesses record a 58 per cent profits improvement in dollar terms. The US
side ended the year in a cash positive position, he added.
Overall borrowings were cut from Pounds 4m to Pounds 1.3m over the year,
with gearing falling from 47 per cent to 14 per cent. Interest charges
amounted to Pounds 396,000 (Pounds 566,000).
Reflecting the recovery, earnings per share emerged at 14.5p(0.1p); a
proposed final dividend of 3.5p brings the total for the year to 6p (2.5p).

<TEXT>
SHARES IN Eurocopy yesterday fell 7p to 32p following a warning from the
photocopier distribution company that second half profits would show only a
minor improvement over the Pounds 720,000 achieved in the first six months.
House broker Panmure Gordon cut forecasts for the year to September 30 from
Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 1.5m on the news. Last year, Eurocopy reported pre-tax
profits of Pounds 7m.
Mr Michael Armitage, finance director, said signs of business confidence
detected immediately after the general election had since disappeared.
'After taking into account cost savings of some Pounds 200,000,' Eurocopy
would show only a modest improvement in the second half, he said.
Earlier this summer the company had blamed the effects of a government
inquiry into the selling practices of some of its subsidiaries for the 80
per cent decline in interim profits. Mr Armitage said at the time that
competition had exploited doubts sparked by the inquiry.
Eurocopy's troubles began when it purchased a Scottish photocopier company
in 1989. Complaints about misleading selling practices at the subsidiary
sparked an inquiry by the Office of Fair Trading.

<TEXT>
The management of Burns-Anderson Independent Network, a 75.1 per cent owned
subsidiary of Burns-Anderson Group, the recruitment and financial services
operation that went into administration receivership two weeks ago, is
staging a buy-out.
Agreement in principle has been reached with Touche Ross, the
administrators.
Burns-Anderson Independent Network, the third largest network of financial
advisers in the country, is financially ring-fenced from its parent. It owns
24.9 per cent of the capital and is putting together a deal to buy out the
rest. Mr Alan Taylor, managing director of the network, which has 375
individually registered members with Fimbra, the self-regulatory
organisation, said he was hopeful the price would be satisfactory to all
parties. The network made pre-tax profits of Pounds 15,000 to Pounds 20,000
in 1991 on turnover of Pounds 13m to Pounds 14m.
Investors Planning Associates, another company in the Burns-Anderson stable,
said it, too, was putting together a management buy-out. 'We're fed up with
people owning us who did nothing for us,' the company said. IPA, which has
57 Fimbra-registered individuals, said pre-tax profits amounted to less than
Pounds 100,000 in 1991 on turnover of Pounds 2.4m.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (32): So many willing hands - Luisetta
Mudie views Asia's rising stars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUISETTA MUDIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST June, US aircraft manufacturer McDonnell Douglas signed a contract with
a Chinese corporation to co-produce 40 commercial jetliners for use by
Chinese airlines. This was the largest co-production contract ever signed
between China and a US company, and the agreement provides for up to 130
additional jets to be supplied at a future date.
The deal is indicative of a wider trend, which has seen leading aerospace
companies flocking east to manufacture parts and assemble aircraft, lured by
cheaper labour and the promise of soaring demand for passenger aircraft in
the region into the next century.
Analysts say that deals such as the McDonnell Douglas/CATIC link-up will
become more and more commonplace, as fledgling Asian aerospace industries
demand the transfer of technology and management know-how in return for
low-cost manufacturing and access to an increasingly young and educated
workforce.
McDonnell Douglas is no stranger to China. Since 1985 the same Chinese
company, China National Aero-Technology Import and Export Corporation
(CATIC), has delivered 28 MD-80 147-seater passenger jets to Chinese
airlines from its plants in Shanghai. China has also landed Dollars 125m
worth of business making parts for Boeing 757 and 737 jets.
Competition among aerospace giants for joint venture contracts with would-be
Asian aircraft manufacturers is stiff, and negotiations are often hampered
by such thorny issues as technology transfer and threats to job security
back at home. Offset programmes, whereby an agreed amount of offset 'credit'
accompanies an order for aircraft, entitle the buyer to supply the agreed
value in parts to the aircraft company, and are a common form of agreement.
Taiwan has only recently begun to take full advantage of the benefits of
offset. Although economically in better shape, it is several years behind
most of its neighbours when it comes to attracting lucrative aerospace
business. To date there is only a handful of companies currently engaged in
production of parts for aircraft. Its home grown fighter plane, the IDF, was
largely concocted out of US-modified fighter parts.
By contrast, South Korea has aggressively promoted its aerospace industry
for more than 15 years, spearheaded by the country's flag-carrier airline,
Korean Air. The airline set up its aerospace division in 1976, concentrating
at first on manufacture and assembly of aircraft, notably the McDonnell
Douglas 500D helicopter for domestic and overseas markets.
Daewoo and Samsung have complemented Korean Air's contracts, with the former
producing wing and fuselage parts for a range of Boeing jets and the latter
engine components for the US's F-16 fighter jet. This last is part of an
offset agreement linked to last year's purchase by the South Korean
government of Dollars 5bn of F-16s from the US.
Taiwan has the technological capability to supply aircraft manufacturers
with a range of parts, but a lack of co-ordination among the island's myriad
small specialist companies has limited the progress of the aerospace
industry. A lack of sophistication in handling aerospace deals has,
according to Taiwan Aerospace president Mr Denny Ko, also been a handicap in
negotiating a proposal to acquire a Dollars 2bn stake in the commercial
aircraft business of McDonnell Douglas.
Both the government and the private sector in Taiwan were put off by the
ill-health of the Douglas Aircraft commercial sector finances. Taiwan
Aerospace's proposal to postpone a direct equity investment and link loans
to orders for the MD-12 has left the two sides facing each other over a
stalemate.
However, 'there are plenty more fish in the sea,' says Mr Ko. Since the deal
appeared to founder, both Boeing and British Aerospace have visited Taiwan,
both to discuss offset programmes. Boeing recently awarded its first
contract to a Taiwan supplier, and is to set up a quality training and
testing laboratory on the island, in conjunction with the Taiwan government.
Boeing forecasts that China alone will need Dollars 25bn to Dollars 35bn of
new jetliners between now and the year 2010. The expanding Asian market will
inevitably attract increasing attention globally as the region continues to
experience economic growth. The aerospace industry will form a significant
part of that growth.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (31): Japan and US widen their lead -
Lord Tombs, of Rolls-Royce, talks to David Fishlock on the race for new
materials
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID FISHLOCK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WARNING that British industry is failing to heed overseas competition in
an area that underpins much of manufacturing industry comes from one of its
leading technologists.
Lord Tombs of Brailes, the outgoing chairman of Rolls-Royce and a Fellow of
the Royal Academy of Engineering, believes Japan and the US are pulling
ahead with the next generation of engineering materials. These are the
materials from which engines and high-duty machinery of every kind will be
made in the 21st century.
They will supplant the steels on which engineers have relied for 200 years
because of such advantages as temperature and corrosion resistance, low
weight and eventually lower cost, Lord Tombs says.
Collectively, they are often known as engineering ceramics. They bear scant
relationship, however, to the brittle substances with which the potter
works. But like clay they come from some of the most abundant elements on
earth, and so are intrinsically very cheap. As with the potter's art, their
intrinsic value depends on the skill invested in shaping and forming the
engineering ceramics.
The Japanese, for example, have a project to build an entire diesel engine
from ceramics, says Lord Tombs. Rolls-Royce is already testing ceramic
aero-engine parts made in Japan for possible use in its jet engines. Lord
Tombs believes that there is a fundamental difference between the
engineering ceramics and today's high-duty engineering materials that could
make it very difficult for British companies to retrieve the situation once
they have begun to rely on overseas suppliers.
With today's materials, it doesn't much matter where the engineer buys his
bars or sheets of steel. He adds the value in his design office and with his
machine tools.
With ceramics the situation is quite different. So intimately are
formulation, design and manufacture interwoven, the material supplier will
provide finished and certified parts. And initially they will be those parts
most crucial to enhancing the performance of engines, by allowing them to
run hundreds of degrees hotter.
As Lord Tombs tells it, an eminent British civil engineer first drew his
attention to the similarity between the kind of ceramics aero-engine
designers covet for such parts as turbine blades, and reinforced concrete.
Strands of steel firmly embedded in the cement enormously strengthen what
otherwise would be a very inadequate material. Skilfully reinforced, it is
perfectly possible to use concrete to construct a pressure vessel or a ship.
Like reinforced concrete, an engineering ceramic is a composite material.
Very strong fibres, whiskers or fabrics of one substance are firmly embedded
in another, to impart the metal-like properties such as tensile strength
that ceramics normally lack. Performance will depend crucially on the
integrity of that bonding and how the bond survives when the going gets hot.
Will one substance start to dissolve in the other? Or attack and corrode it?
Three decades of trying to harness these infuriating materials have
convinced Rolls-Royce engineers that success can lie only in an integrated
approach to development, design and manufacture of a particular part. The
material stockist will have no role in marketing engineering ceramics.
A team of leading UK industrialists with special interests in new
engineering materials found recently that Japan already enjoys a lead in the
development of ceramic components. 'If you want to buy ceramics today, Japan
is the place to go,' says Lord Tombs. But the US also has a huge national
effort co-ordinated by the Pentagon, he says.
By comparison, Britain's effort is miniscule, led, he believes, by
Rolls-Royce 'still feeling our way along the ceramic route'. For the past
three years the company has supported a special programme at Warwick
University, conducted by its Advanced Ceramic Centre. Here a
multi-disciplinary team of a dozen specialists in materials, design and
manufacture have been learning the art and science of making aero-engine
parts of ceramic.
About a score of other universities, notably Swansea and Birmingham, are
involved. 'We are probably spending more than anyone else in Britain,' says
Lord Tombs - around Pounds 10m a year, he estimates. Lord Tombs believes the
novelty of the technology and the strategic importance to British industry
warrants an urgent national effort on engineering ceramics. He wants DTI to
back an 'enabling club' of major potential users, such as Rolls-Royce,
British Aerospace, GEC and other engine makers, 'to get people thinking
about advanced materials'.
What is lacking, he says, is any general awareness of how easily British
industry could lose out to overseas rivals. What is needed, he says, is 'a
central push'.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (29): Consolidation is the key to
economy and progress - The rising costs of developing business jets are
forcing manufacturers to pool their resources
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BOGGIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COSTS ENTAILED in developing a new generation of business jets are reaching
the point at which some manufacturers are unable to fund such a project from
their own budgets.
Consolidation among manufacturers is the way ahead, many in the industry
agree, as companies pool resources in the interests of economy and progress.
In 1990, Bombardier, the Canadian transport conglomerate, acquired Learjet
in the US, adding that company's portfolio of smaller, shorter-range
business jets to Bombardier's Canadair Challenger, a larger model with
intercontinental range and a full-size cabin.
In March this year General Dynamics, the second-largest US defence
contractor, sold its Cessna civil aircraft division to Textron, the
aerospace and financial services conglomerate. Cessna, formerly best known
for its range of single-piston engine trainers and tourers, has in recent
years concentrated on turboprop and jet aircraft and has over the past
couple of decades developed its Citation range of business jets into a
best-selling series of models.
Now British Aerospace is offering much of its Corporate Jets division for
sale rather than find from its own pocket the finance needed to develop and
build its NBJ - New Business Jet - project, intended as a follow-on to its
BAe 125 range of executive aircraft, which has been a steady money-spinner
for 30 years.
Mr Ian Woodward, acting director of public affairs for BAe, points to the
125 models' 'excellent reputation in the market', but notes: 'We are looking
at what is needed in the future.'
New projects demand new cash. 'If we find a joint venture partner, it would
be to raise funds.  .. The size of the partnership has yet to be
determined.'
Mr Alan Piper, public relations manager at Corporate Jets, elaborates: 'We
need investment running up to Dollars 1bn to develop a new aircraft.'
At present, BAe's 125 production plant at Chester is producing two models:
the 125-800, which has transatlantic range, and the 1000, built to cross the
US from coast to coast. The original 125 was designed around a cabin with
enough headroom for passengers to move about, but on the 1000 the cabin is
extended, making more room for seating.
All told, BAe has sold 820 125s of all models, of which, recently, 802 had
been delivered. Explaining Bombardier's purchase of Learjet, Mr Bryan Moss,
president of the Challenger division of Canadair, says: 'Canadair with the
Challenger had only one production option - although it was a successful
programme. We wanted to be able to offer a family of products.'
The smaller Learjets make an elegant fit with the larger Challenger.
Bombardier salesmen make the point that for the roughly Dollars 27m cost of
a Gulfstream IV - the business jet market leader, offering the greatest size
and range so far - a company can buy a Challenger and a Lear.
The Challenger remains a highly successful product, with deliveries of the
latest model, the 601-3A, from the Montreal plant running at roughly two a
month, a rate consistent with that achieved over the past couple of years.
Canadair's present development effort is going into the Global Express,
designed as a business jet capable of flying eight passengers and a
four-person crew distances of up to 5,650 nautical miles - true
trans-Pacific range, enough to fly from Los Angeles to Tokyo or from Tokyo
to London. The 48 ft cabin will be the same length as that on Canadair's
Regional Jet airliner, also in development. The company expects the Global
Express to make its first flight in 1996.
Learjet, which in the first quarter of this year sold nine of the smaller
model 31A and two 35As, together worth Dollars 48.9m, is test-flying its
model 60, a step towards bridging the size and range gap between the 35A and
the Challenger. Although slightly smaller, the Lear 60 represents direct
competition for the BAe 1000.
Learjet disclaims any interest in buying into BAe. It comments, though: 'The
cost of developing (a new business jet) runs into millions of dollars. You
are going to see consolidation in the future because of the high cost of new
development.'
Cessna's switch of ownership from General Dynamics to Textron is explained
by the company more as a matter of tidying up. Cessna describes itself as 'a
much more commercially oriented company' than GD, which 'is going into
military and aerospace manufacturing'. Textron, in contrast, has decided 'to
intensify its commercial business'.
Textron owns the Lycoming aero-engine business, which powers several Cessna
models, and Bell, the helicopter manufacturer. Cessna also foresees further
consolidation in the business jet building industry.
Its own marketing and development effort centres on the five models in the
Citation portfolio, the smallest the CitationJet - which will be available
from December this year - to the larger and higher-performing model VII.
Company philosophy is 'to cover every market niche, so that we can start (a
customer) at the bottom end of the market and increase in size as their
needs grow'.
With its Citation X, Cessna is moving into the topmost levels of height,
speed and range performance for this size of jet.
In France, Dassault Aviation also disclaims any interest in buying into BAe.
Dassault, like BAe, has a long history of building military as well as
business jets. Its large tri-jet Falcon 900B is at the top end of the
market, competing against the Challenger and the Gulfstream IV, and the
Falcon 2000, due to fly next spring, is essentially a shorter, twin-engine
variant of the 900B and will provide competition for the BAe 1000.
BAe shrugs off Dassault's disparagement of its models. It is talking to
several prospective partners, more than one a non-British concern, and
remains confident. 'You have only got to look at the (125's) track record,'
Mr Woodward says. 'It is second to none.'

FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (26): Four-nation headache - Europe's
fighter is stalled by loss of German support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Fighter Aircraft was to have been the centrepiece of this
year's Farnborough show, with a flying display. The aircraft will still be a
central talking point, although not in the way that was intended.
If development plans had kept to schedule, the first EFA prototype would
have made its maiden flight in Germany about six months ago. But the fighter
was not destined to become airborne with its original
Anglo-German-Italian-Spanish partnership arrangements still intact.
The German government's decision not to proceed in the programme to build
the aircraft in its current form beyond the development phase was long
anticipated. Less expected was its proposal, sprung on the other partners
late in the day, to replace the project with a new, more modest aircraft
with French participation.
Bonn's opt-out, based on grounds of cost and changed military requirements,
was largely a political calculation - a sacrifice to the new mood of united
Germany, reflecting the negative image the project has suffered in that
country and the lack of sufficient parliamentary support for it outside
Bavaria, the region most industrially involved in the programme.
German industry, with a prime role in the aircraft's fly-by-wire system and
responsible for its centre fuselage and fin and rudder assemblies, was as
committed as Britain's to the project, with jobs no less at stake. However,
German failure to secure leadership of major EFA contracts such as the radar
and electronic warfare systems led to its being viewed as a 'British'
aircraft.
It was inevitable that Germany's decision should raise questions in the UK
about the wisdom of the whole project. The UK Ministry of Defence, which had
to face a grilling by Mrs Margaret Thatcher on the justifications for EFA
back in 1988 when full-scale development was begun, has insisted that there
is no alternative - no available aircraft that could provide comparable
performance without, at this stage, costing more.
This view has received backing from all three main political parties and the
House of Commons defence committee, which came to the conclusion that the
project could survive the loss of one or even two partners.
However, German withdrawal creates a quandary for the UK. The amount written
into budget plans for acquiring the originally planned 250 aircraft for the
RAF and providing spares and support for the first two years of service is
around Pounds 11.5bn at 1991 prices. Savings can be made in a more
narrowly-based project by simplifying manufacturing arrangements, but these
are unlikely to compensate fully for the extra share the remaining
participants have to take in the cost of setting up production.
Keeping within the budget therefore requires buying fewer aircraft; Italy
and Spain, like Germany, had already cut their numbers and the British
figure was under review. However, the fewer aircraft produced under the
programme, the less cost-effective they become. UK officials have estimated
that below a combined level of about 350-400 aircraft, EFA would lose its
competitive advantage over its rivals.
The UK, in contrast to Germany, is looking to a global role for the aircraft
beyond the requirements of national air defence and is optimistic about
export prospects.
Although they are rivals in the export market, the French have an interest
in seeing the EFA programme kept alive in order to sustain future European
prospects in the combat aircraft sector.
However, the more ambitious proponents of an integrated European industry in
competition with US manufacturers have received a major setback with the
split in the EFA project. Ideas formulated at Deutsche Aerospace (DASA), the
Daimler-Benz subsidiary which includes the airframe company MBB, involved a
joint European military aircraft company based around the merged Tornado and
EFA management companies.
BAe was already somewhat cool to this corporate approach. After successful
collaboration with the US on developments of the Harrier and Hawk, it wanted
to keep its US options open as well. It is now all the more likely to be
confirmed in that philosophy.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (28): A proud name changes hands - Dutch
to give up Fokker control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOKKER, the aircraft builder that has put the Netherlands on the world
aerospace map, is to be transferred into German hands by the end of 1992,
triggering a shakeup of Europe's regional aviation market and substantially
redrawing the ownership of the Dutch aerospace industry.
Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) is expected to acquire 51 per cent of the Dutch
company on or around October 1. Majority control will be achieved by buying
out part of the Dutch government's 32 per cent stake and subscribing to a Fl
500m issue of new Fokker shares. Final details of the detail, including the
price the Dutch state will receive for its Fokker shares, are still being
worked out. Dutch unions and parliament must also approve.
Eventually, Dasa will sell a portion of its shares in Fokker to its
'Euroliner' consortium partners, Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy,
creating a four-way tie-up in the regional segment of Europe's aerospace
industry.
The Fokker-Dasa transaction was given the final go-ahead by the Dutch
government's decision in late July to sell part of its shareholding to Dasa
this year, with the rest to follow in three years.
The sale is a logical consequence of the conditions set in 1987, when the
Dutch government bailed out Fokker after it ran into difficulties launching
its new Fokker 50 and Fokker 100 aircraft, leaving the state with a 32 per
cent shareholding in the company in the process. At the time, the government
said that Fokker should seek a strong, international partner to help fund
any future generations of aircraft.
Fokker has now found one in Dasa, part of Germany's Daimler industry group
and itself the product of a series of mergers and takeovers among Germany's
aerospace companies. Nevertheless, the Dutch government initially baulked at
the prospect of Dasa's takeover of Fokker, fearing that high-technology jobs
and skills would eventually be transferred to Germany.
In his direct negotiations with the chairmen of Fokker and Dasa, the Dutch
economic affairs minister, Mr Koos Andriessen, won some guarantees on future
employment and production at Fokker's plants in the Netherlands. But the
Dutch government, for its part, was required to pledge to give up its
remaining Fokker shares at the end of three years.
With the main outlines of the Fokker takeover now agreed, the biggest
remaining uncertainty is the future of the Fokker 50, the company's
50-seater turbo prop.
The agreement with the Germans virtually ensures that Fokker will be able to
develop its new Fokker 70, based on the existing Fokker 100. And it
indicates that the Fokker aircraft will also form the nucleus of a
130-seater machine which will probably be built together with Aerospatiale
and Alenia. But the agreement does not cover the Fokker 50, which has been
less successful than the 100-seat Fokker 100.
The future of the Fokker 50 is particularly doubtful because Aerospatiale
and Alenia have a competing aircraft, the ATR-42, which has managed to crack
the North American market, an region where the Dutch machine has yet to
achieve a breakthrough. In the past, Fokker has complained that the
Franco-Italian jet enjoyed an unfair advantage because of subsidies and
grants which Aerospatiale and Alenia receive from the French and German
governments. Both companies are now poised to play an influential role in
Fokker's future.

flexes its muscles

<TEXT>
IN A CORNER of a cavernous assembly shed on the banks of the river Elbe,
just downstream from Hamburg, the first prototype of a new Airbus aircraft
is being painstakingly rivetted together.
For the 90,000-odd workers in Germany's aerospace industry, the final
assembly of the A321 narrow-body Airbus is more than just the production of
another aircraft. It is the first large passenger airliner to be produced in
Germany - albeit from sections made in France, Britain and Spain as well -
since before the Second World War.
'I am very proud that we got the final assembly,' says Mr Johannes Muller,
Airbus programme director at Deutsche Airbus, 37.9 per cent partner in the
four-nation Airbus Industrie consortium. 'It has an historic importance for
us.'
Deutsche Airbus is the most visible sign of the German aerospace industry's
emergence as a new force in Europe, alongside the longer-established French
and British industries. By the end of September, it will be 100 per cent
owned by Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), the umbrella group brought together by
Mr Edzard Reuter of Daimler Benz to co-ordinate and consolidate the
industry.
Dasa is an extraordinarily ambitious effort to combine all the big players
in the German industry under one roof: Mr Reuter has brought together MBB
(Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm) and Dornier, the two principal aircraft
manufacturers, with MTU (Motoren und Turbinen Union), the aircraft engine
manufacturer, and TST (Telefunken Systemtechnik), in space and
communications technology. Welding them into a co-ordinated unit is proving
a real challenge , even for Daimler Benz, Germany's
The new group employs 56,500 people out of the 90,000-odd in the industry,
and accounts for more than DM12bn sales out of an industry total of DM24bn.
Last year it made a profit of just DM50m, thanks to Deutsche Airbus moving
into the black.
Nevertheless, Dasa has been flexing its muscles on the international stage
in recent months: as the successful purchaser of a majority stake in Fokker,
the Dutch regional aircraft manufacturer, and as a potential buyer of
British Aerospace's own space division.
Yet the German aerospace industry finds itself caught in a contradictory
situation: on the one hand aggressively looking to establish itself as an
equal to other international players; and on the other, desperately
defending itself against the potential loss of its two most lucrative
state-financed contracts, the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA), and the
Hermes space shuttle.
If Germany does pull out of those two European collaboration projects,
because of the budget cuts ordered in Bonn to pay for the costs of German
unification, it will deal a grievous blow both to the standing of the
national industry, and to Mr Reuter's whole concept of Dasa as a key new
profit centre for Daimler Benz. Yet the prospect is real, and it makes
leaders of the industry apoplectic.
'We cannot preach pro-Europeanism, and then pull out of a European project
from sheer national egoism,' says Mr Karl Dersch, a Dasa director and
current president of the BDLI, the German aerospace industry federation,
about the decision of the ruling German coalition not to go ahead with EFA
production. 'It is simply crazy. An ad hoc decision like this will strangle
the industry.'
He says it is not the big companies, such as Dasa, which would suffer as
much as the small: about 110 of the 120 companies in the BDLI are in the
small to medium-sized sector. 'The cancellation of the EFA could mean
bankruptcy for one third of the companies in the industry.'
The EFA project is a joint programme with British Aerospace, Italy's Alenia
and Spain's Casa. The Hermes space shuttle, in which France is the leading
partner and Italy another minority shareholder, is also in doubt because of
the budget squeeze in Bonn.
Dasa has produced its proposals for the space programme which still require
an extra DM200m to DM300m from Bonn. 'Making false economies in the European
long-term programme to achieve short-term budgetary relief means throwing
away the technological future of Europe in space, and the future of its top
engineers on earth,' Mr Dersch says.
Having said which, he insists that the German industry is now far less
reliant on the public purse than 20 years ago.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (15): Much ado about deregulation -
Americans grin as carriers groan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS summer, millions of US holidaymakers have clambered aboard their
holiday flights. Most have several hundred extra dollars in their pockets,
thanks to a ferocious price war which halved domestic fares in the
late-spring.
The nation's airlines, by contrast, will be totting up the damage. Most have
already posted losses for the second quarter of 1992, and the current three
months seems unlikely to yield much recovery. Traffic volumes are guaranteed
to be heavy this summer, but the fare war meant that many tickets were sold
at uneconomic levels. The sudden surge in traffic, meanwhile, is inflating
costs.
This is the sharp end of deregulation. Come November, it will be 14 years
since the US Congress decided that any US airline should be allowed to fly
any domestic route, and charge whatever it wished. Since then, travellers
have become accustomed to 'cheap' fares - including time-limited promotional
campaigns, such as the latest May/June offer - while US carriers have been
forced to pay acute attention to their costs.
But the deregulated climate has also led to dozens of airline
consolidations, with carriers either merging or going out of business
altogether. And even the survivors, bowed by an aggregate Dollars 6bn loss
during the last couple of years, are cutting back on capital spending for
the future.
Now the worry is that deregulation will generate an oligopoly, with the
three mega-carriers - American, United, and Delta - inflating prices once
their competitors have disappeared. Carriers deny this scenario strongly and
it is probably simplistic, at the very least. Nevertheless, given the bloody
battlefield which constitutes the US airline industry, it is little wonder
that Europe is setting off down the 'deregulation' road with a certain
wariness.
For the average air traveller, deregulation has been a mixed blessing. Fares
are almost certainly cheaper as a result. The US Air Transport Association,
for example, notes that since 1978, domestic air fares have risen by 53.4
per cent, while the consumer price index has increased by 108.9 per cent.
But in order to provide services at these prices levels, airlines shied away
from traditional point-to-point services, and implemented 'hub and spoke'
systems instead. This means that a passenger who wants to go from New York
to Little Rock, say, will find that he has to waste time flying into
Nashville or Memphis. Once he has touched down at the hub city, he will
probably have to change planes as well.
Clearly, the hub system offers carriers an enormous advantage - permitting
them to feed numerous flights in and out of the hub at the same time, so
that the aircraft landing in Little Rock carries visitors who began their
journeys in totally different cities. But from a passenger's standpoint,
'hubbing' means extra travel time and, arguably, greater risk of delays,
lost luggage, and so on.
For the airline industry, too, deregulation has been a mixture of pros and
cons. The initial impact was much as expected: a wave of new entrants, most
of which hoped to capitalise on lower cost structures. Names like Peoples
Express, New York Air and Capitol suddenly landed on the nation's tarmacs.
Yet in less than a decade and a half, virtually all of these companies have
been eliminated. Peoples Express became part of the Continental Airlines
group; Republic merged with Northwest; Midway eventually folded; and so on.
America West is one of the few 'new airlines' which is hanging on grimly,
under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.
More recently, the consolidation trend has been exacerbated by the sheer
level of losses which the industry has been enduring - some inflicted by
external events, like the Gulf War - and by the added burden of some onerous
debt levels taken on during the 1980s. Three 'national' carriers are in
bankruptcy: Eastern, Pan Am, Midway and Braniff have all stopped operating
in the last two years, and only the three mega-carriers and a couple of
smaller 'niche' airlines seem sure to survive.
Already, the prospect of an industry dominated by three big players has
prompted calls for 're-regulation', has contributed to an ongoing Justice
Department investigation into allegations of price-fixing in the industry,
and has yielded a class action suit against all national carriers on similar
grounds. The last - which could have gone to an unpredictable jury trial
with trebled damages because of its anti-trust nature - was settled by the
main carriers without admission of guilt this year.
At face value, when bargain fares are so readily available and the industry
is losing money hand-over-fist, price-fixing charges would seem difficult to
sustain. But as the number of carriers continues to shrink, the allegations
seems unlikely to abate.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (14): Softly, softly on EC fares -
Europe shrinks from open skies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DONNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European air transport industry faces the era of the Single European
Market from next January 1 with doubts as to whether it will produce early
and substantial reductions in fares.
The EC Transport Ministers' complex agreement last June on the third phase
of deregulation measures effectively covered three major aspects of air
transport operations.
On airline licensing, it was agreed that subject to meeting the necessary
technical and financial standards, airline operating licences would be
granted on the basis of Community criteria, rather than individual national
rules as hitherto, making it possible for citizens (or airlines) of one
Community country to establish airlines in other Community countries.
On fares and rates, the agreement gave complete pricing freedom to
intra-Community cargo and charter air services. For scheduled international
passenger services, pricing freedom was approved, subject to governments
having the power to disallow any fares regarded as either too high, or too
consistently low as to be unfairly 'predatory'. In the case of disputes, the
Commission itself would have an arbitration role.
Probably the most far-reaching aspect of the package, however, was the
introduction from next year of 'consecutive cabotage', effectively meaning
that any Community airline serving a foreign destination will have the right
to pick up traffic there and carry it on to a second destination in that
country - for example, British Airways flying from London to Frankfurt will
be able to pick up traffic in Frankfurt and carry it on to Berlin, and
vice-versa.
But the agreement fell short of what many protagonists of total 'open skies'
had sought. The 'consecutive cabotage' was restricted, with traffic picked
up at foreign points being limited to only 50 per cent of the overall
seasonal capacity on that sector, until April 1, 1997. Full cabotage, or the
right of any airline to fly freely inside another EC country, was also
delayed until April 1, 1997.
Other restrictions include a ban on foreign carriers flying certain 'public
service routes' in another country, for example to and from islands.
More controversial is the rule that member-states, under Commission control,
may limit foreign-carrier access to their domestic routes for serious
congestion or environmental reasons, particularly where other forms of
transport, such as high-speed trains, are already deemed to provide
satisfactory levels of service.
The overall response to the agreement from the airlines was lukewarm. Some
did not like it at all, preferring to maintain the principle of total
national sovereignty over their airspace. Others, more eager to see 'open
skies' , felt that while it was a step in the right direction, it did not go
far enough. Interpreting the safeguards - for example, determining whether
trains provide enough service between two points to justify denying foreign
airlines rights to fly the same sector - could lead to some difficult
situations.
Moreover, since most of the big Community airlines, such as Air France,
Alitalia, British Airways, Iberia, KLM and Lufthansa, already effectively
serve most major cities within the Community with direct flights, the
'consecutive cabotage' rights now permitted do not seem likely to result in
a significant immediate spread of additional services, and thus more
competition, on Community air routes, although that may come eventually.
Even unfettered cabotage - the right of a Community airline to fly without
restriction between two domestic points in any other EC country  - when it
does come in 1997 seems more likely to be covered by smaller regional
airlines, rather than the bigger flag carriers (although the latter may seek
to buy existing, or establish new, regional operators).
In what is already a densely-served European air transport arena, faced with
the threat of worsening congestion because of air traffic control and ground
infrastructure limitations, the scope for an increase in the number of air
services is much smaller than many outside the industry may believe
possible.
Furthermore, in the light of the airlines' current financial situation -
collectively they lost some Dollars 6.7bn on scheduled international
operations world-wide over the past two years as a result of the traffic
collapse caused by the Gulf War and the recession - they will find it
difficult to finance a large number of new routes in the immediate future.
Setting up new routes can be expensive - in terms of personnel, aircraft
procurement and marketing costs - a factor that more than one European
airline has discovered in recent years resulting in bankruptcy through
over-commitment.
The 24-member Association of European Airlines has already expressed its
distaste for use of the word 'deregulation', regarding it as 'wholly
inappropriate to describe the stream of packages, plans and proposals on air
transport topics emerging from the European Commission' - a number of which
it believes have negative implications for the airlines' overall cost
structure and traffic base.
The AEA has warned about what it believes could be 'over competition', with
163 scheduled airlines and some 65 specialist charter operators already in
Europe - more than in the US - and it has pointed out that even on scheduled
services many passengers already benefit from discounted fares.
It estimates that some 77 per cent of all international passengers in Europe
already benefit from low fares, so that the scope for further cuts is
limited.
Moreover, the AEA stresses that while its members are not afraid of
competition, in that they already compete across the whole spectrum of their
businesses as well as with a dense surface transport system of roads and
railways, the European airline industry could well be weakened 'by
politically sponsored duplication of effort based on the arbitrary
assumption that three airlines on a route compete, while two conspire'.
But the AEA's real fear is that the European Commission is trying - probably
without really realising it - to generate competition with one hand, whilst
throttling the airlines' financial ability to compete with the other.
It points out that the Commission is planning to introduce Value Added Tax
on intra-Community airline tickets, probably at around 9 or 10 per cent,
which could add Dollars 1bn to their costs over a full year.
Mr Giovanni Bisignani, chairman of the AEA and managing director of
Alitalia, says that would raise air fares considerably, whilst adding an
expensive heavy administrative burden on the airlines.
The proposed abolition of intra-EC duty-free concessions for airlines and
airports, now delayed until 1996, is also likely directly to reduce the
airlines' own income, whilst adding to their costs if airports pass their
own losses of duty-free income on to the airlines.
There are other European airline concerns. It is felt that not enough is
really being done to solve the problems of congestion on the ground and in
the air.
The airlines are also worried about the Commission's plans for a Dollars 3 a
barrel carbon tax, which, especially if it rises as planned to Dollars 10 a
barrel by the year 2000, will add further heavy costs to already battered
airline balance sheets.
The airlines recognise that the Community is changing the entire scope and
structure of intra-European air transport.
They are not afraid of the new era of increased competition, but they feel
that instead of approaching it with euphoric notions of much cheaper fares,
the European Commission as the policy maker, and the politicians and the
public at large, must recognise that the scope for such cuts is limited, and
that they will come only slowly, as the airlines themselves recover from the
ravages of the recess ion and digest the full long-term implications of
so-called 'open skies'.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (6): New targets for rocket makers - US
hit by missiles shakeup
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER A false start in Europe, the shake-out in the missile business has
begun in earnest in the US.
The sale of General Dynamics' guided weapons business to Hughes Aircraft,
the General Motors subsidiary, creates a missile company of roughly equal
dimensions to the one British Aerospace and Thomson-CSF of France tried
unsuccessfully to set up by merging their operations.
The move, announced in May, is expected approximately to double Hughes'
turnover in missiles to Dollars 2.7bn. But it does not afford Hughes the
same domination of the US industry that the planned BAe-Thomson venture
would have enjoyed in Europe. Hughes, with wide-ranging interests in defence
electronics, followed the announcement with plans to shed 9,000 jobs over
the next 18 months, about 15 per cent of its workforce.
General Dynamics, perhaps the most broadly-based of all US defence
manufacturers with products ranging from combat jets to tanks and
submarines, decided to ditch its missile activities as part of a plan to
reduce itself in size in response to the downturn in defence spending,
rather than try to diversify into new civilian activities.
Missiles made up about 16 per cent of General Dynamics' Dollars 8.75bn sales
last year. This included production of the Tomahawk cruise missiles that
were launched from US warships in the Gulf war, and Stinger shoulder-fired
weapons. The company had considered including missiles as one of its future
'core activities'. But Mr William Anders, its chairman, said it 'could not
achieve sufficient market position to be the leader in a field which
includes nearly a dozen firms in the US alone.'
That statement summarises the challenge facing the missile sector. It will
remain a central part of the defence business, a large and diverse sector
with a wide range of products, subject to constant technological advances.
But the industry is over-populated and the number of projects is getting
smaller.
The confidence of US manufacturers in the products they have developed has
meanwhile been undermined by the policy of 'second-sourcing' production of
weapons such as the Stinger or the Standard naval air defence missile.
Further concentration in the industry - which includes Boeing, Hughes,
Lockheed, Loral, Northrop, Martin Marietta, McDonnell Douglas, Raytheon,
Rockwell and Texas Instruments - can now be expected.
In Europe, the Eurodynamics venture confidently planned by BAe and Thomson
was abandoned early last year after failure to agree on the value of the two
companies' respective businesses - the French company having been boosted in
the interim by a fresh air-defence order from Saudi Arabia. Thomson, which
saw BAe's weapon production complementing its own expertise in guidance
systems, sought a similar match in the US with the planned takeover of the
missile business of LTV, whose activities include the international Multiple
Launch Rocket System.
However, Thomson's plan, part of a Dollars 450m deal for LTV accepted by a
New York bankruptcy judge, came up against the barrier of US security
concerns.
Seeking to consolidate its position in air-defence systems, Thomson reached
agreement last year with Short Brothers of the UK on joint development of a
new generation of weapons, succeeding the Shorts' latest Starstreak system.
GEC-Marconi, the traditional supplier of guidance for BAe weapons, has
meanwhile set out to challenge BAe's position as the automatic UK choice as
prime contractor for missiles. With BAe in the throes of rationalising its
Dynamics division - currently being reduced to 5,300 employees, less than a
third of the level of four years ago - it recently completed the takeover of
Ferranti International's missile operations. The acquisition provides
GEC-Marconi, which has also established links with Matra and Dassault
Electronique of France, with a capability for producing complete weapon
systems.
However, the company had a bitter disappointment when it failed in its bid
with Matra to supplant BAe's long-troubled Advanced Short-Range Air-to-Air
Missile project (Asraam). BAe, collaborating with Hughes, won the Pounds
570m contract for development and initial production for the RAF in March,
just before the general election.
BAe and GEC-Marconi are also on different sides in a contest to supply a
medium-range surface-to-air missile, replacing the already retired
Bloodhound. BAe has entered a joint bid with Raytheon of the US, proposing
an updated version of the Patriot missile which gained fame in the Gulf
against Iraqi Scuds, together with an additional purchase of BAe's latest
Rapier 2000 low-level air-defence system. GEC-Marconi has meanwhile joined
with the French-Italian Eurosam consortium to offer the SAMP-T, part of a
new family of missiles. Hughes is also competing, alongside NFT of Norway,
with a ground-launched version of its Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air
Missile (Amraam).
Another Pounds 500m-plus battle is shaping up between potential British,
French, US, Swedish and Italian contenders for a conventionally-armed
stand-off missile for the RAF, expected to be decided late next year or in
early 1994.
The UK also still has plans for a nuclear-armed stand-off missile. However,
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the UK defence secretary, said recently that this was
'certainly not something I am expecting to arrive on my desk in the next few
weeks'.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (5): Complex but real - David White on
the consequences of the peace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PEACE dividend, that overworked cliche, has somehow lost its optimistic
connotations.
The expression first gained currency in the US at the close of the Vietnam
war, when hopes were raised that money previously poured into the conflict
could be redirected into new social programmes.
In the aftermath of the Cold War, it has come to be usedironically by the
sectors that have suffered the negative effects of defence cutbacks. Nobody
seems conscious of having received a peace dividend. But it is certainly
being paid. General John Galvin, the recently-retired supreme Nato commander
in Europe, reckons it will add up to more than Dollars 500bn by 1997 - the
value of what the 16 Nato allies will have refrained from buying or saved on
their military forces.
Worldwide, defence expenditure fell last year for the third year running,
according to estimates by the Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute (SIPRI). Some industrialists, including Mr John Weston, chairman
of British Aersopace's defence division, foresee an end to the decline in
the mid-1990s, and an increase after that.
But even if the outlook for arms manufacturers is not totally gloomy, things
are likely to get worse before they get better. Defence spending is like an
ocean liner when it come to slowing it down.
Sharp revisions of government spending plans have become the norm throughout
the industrialised world, including countries such as France which have been
relatively conservative about their defence outlays.
In the US, the Dollars 281bn requested by the Pentagon for the fiscal year
beginning in October would be a 4.5 per cent drop in real terms.
Plans up to 1997 have been revised downwards by Dollars 50bn. This has
involved halting 10 major equipment programmes including the B-2 stealth
bomber, of which only 20 are now due to be built, the Seawolf
nuclear-powered submarine, which is being stopped at one boat instead of the
original plan for 36, and the Comanche scout helicopter, which is to remain
at the prototype stage.
US spending plans, which still provide for a slight annual increase in
current dollars from the 1994 fiscal year onwards, will continue to come
under heavy pressure.
The UK has so far managed its Options for Change review without major
cancellations but faces a continuing squeeze on defence resources. After a
10 per cent decline in real-terms spending in the second half of the 1980s,
current plans are for a further gradual drop over the next three years.
A report published just before the April general election by the
London-based Centre for Defence Studies estimated that real defence
expenditure, on current trends, would be 20 per cent lower by the year 2000
than it was in 1990 - a level of about Pounds 17bn a year at today's prices.
Even with the modest reductions envisaged, the future of some ongoing
programmes might have to be reviewed, it said. Any deeper cuts in the budget
'could demand a major reappraisal of equipment needs'.
Increasingly dependent on exports to offset reductions in their home
markets, US and European manufacturers find themselves in head-on collision
in the growth markets of the Middle East and Asia. In antithesis to the
industrialised west, the Asia-Pacific region has become the prime area of
growth in arms expenditure, but suppliers face increasing competition from
Asian countries themselves, including South Korea and Japan.
Elsewhere in the developing world, export prospects are overshadowed by
financial problems, limited requirements for high-technology equipment,
inroads by suppliers such as China and Brazil, and the large amount of
second-hand Russian and other weapons on offer. Figures from SIPRI show a 25
per cent drop last year in the global value of trade in major conventional
weapons, to Dollars 22bn. Significantly, US exporters took 51 per cent of
the total. Four years previously the US share had been 30 per cent.
The competition for developing-world markets appears unlikely to be greatly
affected by the initiatives undertaken in the wake of last year's Gulf
conflict to discuss restraints on arms sales, particularly to the Middle
East. The US, Russia, Britain, France and China, the five permanent members
of the UN Security Council, which have held a series of talks on possible
curbs, are also the countries which control four-fifths of the market. A
global UN register of transactions, initially proposed by Britain, is due to
start next year, but there is little sign of willingness among any of the
main exporting nations to forego sales vital for sustaining their defence
industries.
Within Europe, the market in the larger countries remains largely divided
along national lines, with the consequences of wide-scale duplication and
inefficiency. Progress towards opening up trade in arms in line with other
industries has been slow.
The Independent European Programme Group (IEPG), made up of European Nato
allies, has succeeded in increasing the opportunities for companies to bid
for contracts in other European countries. Further moves will have to await
the outcome of the ratification process of the Maastricht treaty, which
places Community defence responsibilities in the hands of the Western
European Union. Problems then needing to be resolved include the status of
Turkey and Norway, which are in the IEPG but not the EC or WEU. Proposals
such as a joint European procurement agency, favoured by Germany and
Holland, still appear remote.
Takeovers have increased the concentration of Europe's arms industry, which
is in the throes of drastic workforce reductions. But despite much talk
about the potential for multinational industrial groupings in Europe, the
only truly cross-border ventures to have got off the ground are Matra
Marconi Space, which has brought together the bulk of the space activities
of France's Matra and the British GEC group, and Eurocopter, the helicopter
company formed by Aerospatiale of France and MBB of Germany. In the
cost-cutting climate, multilateral collaboration on specific projects has
come under strain - the European Fighter Aircraft being only one, albeit
spectacular, example.
A series of tentative links has been made between European companies,
however, for new-generation equipment ranging from vehicles to air combat
radars.
The sharp change in defence structures and priorities - the thinning-out of
forces in continental Europe, the new emphasis on mobility and flexibility,
the needs of peacekeeping missions and arms control enforcement -
undoubtedly creates new equipment requirements which will go some way
towards compensating for the business defence contractors have lost. But
governments are in no hurry.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (1): Fasten your safety belts -
Aerospace faces its worst cyclical down-turn since World War Two. As the
industry prepares to go on show at Farnborough, parts of its military and
commercial sectors are bracing themselves for some radical reshaping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS

<TEXT>
TO MAKE a small fortune you should start with a big one, saysMr Jean
Pierson, the chairman of the European Airbus consortium.
This old adage from the farming industry is becoming increasingly apposite
for aerospace which during the past two years has faced the worst cyclical
downturn in its post war history.
As the industry prepares to gather in force for its regular Farnborough
showcase next week, it is facing a series of severe problems both in the
military and commercial sectors which are likely to lead to a radical
reshaping of some significant parts of the business.
This process has already begun. The last few months have seen Deutsche
Aerospace negotiate a partnership with Fokker of the Netherlands which is
expected to lead to a broad restructuring of the European regional aircraft
industry. McDonnell Douglas of the US has been striving to forge an alliance
with aerospace manufacturers in the Far East to form a new international
commercial airliner partnership. In the UK, British Aerospace is in the
throes of a sweeping restructuring aimed at refocusing the company around
its core military aircraft and large civil airliner activities in the
European Airbus partnership.
Mergers, partnerships and consolidation have also accelerated in the airline
business still struggling to recover from the air travel slump caused by the
combined effects of the Gulf crisis and the recession in many western
economies. The most spectacular recent deal involved the proposal by British
Airways to buy this summer a stake in USAir, the sixth largest US carrier,
in an effort to form a global airline. Other carriers have also been
scrambling to negotiate partnerships. Air France acquired this year stakes
in Sabena of Belgium and CSA, the Czechoslovak national airline.
The military side of aerospace has also been forced to scale back its
operations to adapt to the reductions in government spending in the new post
Cold War defence climate. This has led to large scale job cuts and attempts
by manufacturers to diversify increasingly in commercial activities to
offset the loss of defence business.
Even though the civil market remains soft, the contraction in the defence
industry is expected to continue spawning new ventures in commercial
aerospace. In turn, this is bound to put even greater pressure on the excess
capacity already evident in the commercial sector.
'It seems clear to me that the growing problem of excess capacity, and
defence conversion, will have a huge impact on our industry over the next
five to ten years,' says Mr Larry Clarkson, a vice president of Boeing, the
world's biggest manufacturer of commercial aircraft.
Boeing has been cutting back production as have Airbus and McDonnell
Douglas. But even with 55 per cent of the world commercial airliner market
and an order backlog worth Dollars 97bn, Boeing has also been forced to
change the way it does business. The Seattle-based company is adopting a
much more open stance towards the outside world and is actively encouraging
airlines, suppliers and subcontractors to participate in the design of its
latest airliner, the 777 widebody twin engine jet.
It is also openly talking for the first time of forging close ties,
including equity partnerships, with other companies. It has been forced to
do so by the huge investments required to launch new programmes in a market
where the risks have kept steadily rising. 'I don't know where our next
partners will come from but I am not ruling out partnerships with any other
company in the world,' Mr Frank Shrontz, Boeing's chairman, said at the
company's annual meeting this year.
Airbus, which has now become Boeing's principal competitor building up a 26
per cent share of the world market during the last 20 years, is also anxious
to expand international collaboration as a response to the increasing
challenges and complexities in designing, funding and developing new
aircraft. 'At the same time as alliances are developing between American and
Asian interests, Airbus is exploring, sounding out, talking with new
potential partners wherever they may be, and why not the US,' Mr Pierson
said in New York this summer.
The problem for the industry is that there is a fundamental difference
between the current downturn and previous cycles, which have tended to occur
at regular 10-year intervals. For the first time, the prolonged recession in
civil aviation has coincided with deep cutbacks in defence.
In the past, the industry was able to rely on its military activities to
tide it through a cyclical recession in the commercial sector. This has not
been the case during the last two years. Instead, the industry has had to
restructure simultaneously both sides of its business.
The end of the Cold War has not only shrunk the defence market but has also
changed the emphasis on the types and scale of military projects either
already in progress or envisaged. In the past, the industry's activities
were dominated by projects designed to address a potential conflict between
super-power blocks.
But the political upheavals of the past two years, with the collapse of the
Berlin Wall and the disintegration of the former Soviet Union, have altered
that philosophy. The emphasis has now turned more in favour of lighter,
cheaper and more tactical weapon systems rather than the former dominance of
long range strategic military aircraft or missiles.
However, the disappearance of the risk of a super-power confrontation has
now highlighted the fact that in many other regions of the world there is
still the possibility of local conflagrations requiring weapons more suited
to that threat. To respond to such threats, many Air Forces are increasingly
looking for lighter and more operationally flexible systems.
The UK has argued vigorously that this situation also applies to the Pounds
20bn European Fighter Aircraft (EFA), which is fighting a political battle
for survival.
The EFA issue is bound to be one of the dominating themes at next week's
Farnborough air show. The UK is expected to use the occasion to lobby hard
Germany, Spain and Italy to continue participating in the production phase
of the controversial programme.
Germany provoked the EFA crisis when it announced this summer it did not
intend go ahead with production of the new fighter, although it would
continue to participate in the project's development. Both Spain and Italy
have also expressed concerns about EFA's costs and are still, at this stage,
by no means committed to production.
The collapse of the EFA programme would be a huge blow for the European
aerospace industry. It would have repercussions on jobs and the future
aerospace technological capabilities of the four EFA countries, and could
also have implications for France which is developing its own advanced
combat aircraft, the Rafale. A decision to scrap EFA could lead to a
reappraisal of the Rafale by the French administration in Paris, some French
aerospace officials fear.
The industry is worried that the possibility of EFA and other military
programmes being dropped or downgraded could have a long term effect on
commercial aerospace activities, which are still regarded as having good
long term growth prospects. These concerns largely stem from the fact that
advanced technology in new materials and production techniques developed for
military programmes find their way in many cases into commercial programmes.
These techniques are likely to become all the more important in the future
as the industry starts to turn its attention to the next generation of
supersonic airliners and the development of 600-800 seater super jumbos.
Demand for super jumbos and a second generation Concorde is expected to
emerge around the turn of the century.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Money Markets: Cautious trade
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADE IN the sterling cash and futures markets was calmer yesterday as the
pound held above its floor against the D-Mark in the European exchange rate
mechanism without the need for Bank of England intervention.
However, the dollar's fall to an historic low against the D-Mark in late
European trading kindled fears that sterling may weaken in the next few days
and trigger a rise in UK interest rates to support the currency. 'Quite
apart from the worries about the French referendum, the one thing that would
frighten the moneymarkets would be a big fall in the dollar,' said a trader
at one discount house.
Most period rates in the cash market ended the day unchanged. Once again,
the Bank of England was seen to be very helpful in its operations, dealing
in all four bands and the repurchase agreement (repo) at the established
rates. That policy continued to keep the overnight rate below 10 per cent,
in spite of the firming of rates further out over the last week. It also led
to a softening of the one-month rate by  1/16 percentage point to 10 1/16
per cent at the close.
Three-month money, an important indicator of where the market thinks rates
are moving, again ended at 10 5/8 per cent on the offered side. Both the
six-month and one-year rates again finished at 10 7/8 per cent offered.
In the morning the Bank forecast a shortage of Pounds 900m which, in the
view of one trader, was the bulk of the shortage for the week. In early
operations the Bank purchased Pounds 250m of Band 1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per
cent, Pounds 87m of Band 3 bank bills at 9 3/4 per cent, Pounds 5m of Band 4
Local Authority bills and Pounds 167m of Band 4 bank bills at 9 per cent,
and Pounds 382m in the repo at 9 15/16 per cent. The Bank did not operate in
the afternoon.
Trade in sterling futures was quieter than last week, with volume down to
around 20,000 lots in the September and December contracts combined. But in
the afternoon, sterling's fall forced the December contract down to its
opening level.
The September contract rose to a high of 89.28 in the morning, and closed at
that level, up 8 basis points from its opening. The December contract
started at 89.15, peaked at 89.22 at around lunchtime, but ended at 89.17.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar at new historic low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR slipped to eclipse a recent historic low against the D-Mark in
late European trading yesterday, worsening tensions in the European exchange
rate mechanism, writes James Blitz.
After closing at DM1.4028 in New York on Monday night, the US currency
gradually declined in European trading to test the record low of DM1.3940
set last Tuesday. In the European afternoon, the currency bottomed out at
DM1.3895 and closed in London at DM1.3935, nearly a pfennig down on the day.
In New York the dollar fell further to finish at DM1.3900.
Again, the pressure on the dollar had little to do with speculation by
interbank traders. It was the result of steady selling in a thinly traded
market by institutional investors, who are concerned by the big difference
between German and US interest rates.
The US Federal Reserve and European central banks were either unable or
unwilling to stem the tide. As the dollar tested the old low, there were
rumours in the Frankfurt market of Fed intervention, which temporarily
pushed the dollar up by nearly 1 1/2 pfennigs. But dealers said the market
was still not short of dollars and that if intervention had been considered
it would have been unlikely to work.
Yesterday's August index from the US National Association of Purchasing
Managers was slightly softer than expected at 53.7 per cent, compared to
54.2 per cent in July, and also triggered some selling of the dollar.
According to Mr Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at Bank of America
in London, yesterday's report damped hopes of a good figure in this Friday's
non-farm payroll report for August, which influences the market more than
most other US indicators. 'The implications are that, at best, we will still
see an underlying increase in unemployment this Friday,' he said.
The dollar could well test new lows this week. Mr Hawkins said that if it
opens below DM1.40 in London today, it will be on a downward path to DM1.35.
A technical analyst at Deutsche Bank was looking for the dollar to reach a
target of DM1.35 based on technical analysis. 'If we break DM1.3460, it
could go as low as DM1.29,' he added.
The dollar's weakness kept sterling close to its ERM floor against the
D-Mark as investors exchanged dollars for the German currency. At one stage,
the pound was seen to be trading at DM2.7830, its lowest since Britain
joined the ERM in October 1990. Further pressure on sterling came at the
official close of ERM trading at 4pm in London and the Bank of England was
under no formal obligation to intervene to support the currency. The pound
closed nearly  1/2 pfennig down at DM2.7825.

FT  02 SEP 92 / International Company News: Investors welcome changes at SBC
 -Ian Rodger looks at events on the inside of an outsider from Basle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWISS BANK Corporation officials said yesterday that the top level executive
changes planned for next spring were merely 'normal'. However, investors
felt this was an understatement and drove the shares higher.
This was against the trend that prevailed for other leading banks and helped
recover some of the ground that SBC's shares have lost this year.
In Swiss bank management practice, the chairman of the executive board has
overall executive responsibility, so the appointment of Mr Georges Blum, a
tough commercial banker, to this post is the most important of the changes.
But some analysts suspect that the thoughtful Mr Walter Frehner, who moves
up to become chairman of the supervisory board, will be more active than Mr
Franz Galliker has been.
'I think they are trying to impose stricter quality control over lending,'
says Mr Hans Kaufmann, banking analyst at Bank Julius Baer in Zurich. Mr
Beat Philipp, banking analyst at Bank Vontobel in Zurich, foresees a renewed
concentration of power at the centre.
Historically, SBC is the most international of the Swiss banks, but it has
had more than its share of problems overseas in the past few years. Apart
from large problem loans in the US and UK, its acquisition of the second
division brokerage Savory Milln in London in 1986 turned out to be an
expensive failure. The same could be said for its lunge into the French
market with its purchase of control of Banque Stern in 1987.
On the other hand, the association SBC formed with the Chicago derivatives
house, O'Connor Partners, last year has so far been a resounding success,
and the bank has put a high priority on developing its international swaps
and options business.
Then there is image. Among the three big Swiss banks, SBC has always seemed
the hardest for analysts to understand. Union Bank of Switzerland is the
predictable but steady giant with an aura of military might. Credit Suisse
is the bank of the Zurich establishment which has transformed since the
early 1970s into a shrewd global investment bank. But SBC, the outsider from
Basle, has, say analysts, no clear image or personality and seems to change
strategy with disquieting frequency.
These weaknesses appear to be reflected in SBC's share prices. At
yesterday's SFr243 close, the bearer shares were only about 6.5 times
estimated 1993 earnings and yielded more than 6 per cent. 'Everyone is too
negative on this bank,' said Mr Kaufman, pointing out that it has made very
good profits in the past two years in spite of having to make large loan
loss provisions.
That is probably the message that SBC executives, who meet financial
analysts in London today, will try to put across.

restructures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DAI-ICHI KANGYO Bank, Japan's largest commercial bank, yesterday began a
restructuring intended to show that the banking industry is worthy of the
public support on offer from the Japanese government.
The bank will cut directors' salaries by 5 per cent, reduce entertainment
expenses by 20 per cent over the next year, and send a 66-point cost-saving
checklist to each of its 400 domestic branches and 69 overseas offices.
DKB insisted that the restructuring be viewed as 'positive' and not as a
sign that the bank is in financial difficulty. The action is likely to be
followed by other banks, whose troubles with non-performing property loans
had undermined confidence in the financial system.
But DKB's cuts do not go deep and may not increase community approval for
plans announced by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, to provide public
funds to liquidate banks' non-performing loans. The proposal has been
condemned by Japanese newspaper commentators and some opposition
politicians, who argue that the banks should trade their way out of trouble.
Japanese banks' problems stem from the turmoil in financial and property
markets, and from their own rapid expansion of branches and loans during the
late 1980s. At DKB, for example, there were 26 business divisions a decade
ago, compared with 46 divisions now.
However, the bank will not lay off staff, although it plans to reduce the
annual intake from 500 to 400 students next April. It will 'review' the
performance of its branches, while not necessarily closing the unprofitable.
DKB's reluctance to sack reflects both the Japanese custom of lifetime
employment and the enduring belief that institutions will weather these
difficult times without having to take dramatic action.

FT  02 SEP 92 / International Company News: First-half reverse for
Wallenberg company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTOR, the Swedish investment company controlled by the Wallenberg
family, reports a SKr2.08bn (Dollars 404.7m) first-half profit (after
financial items), which compares with SKr2.64bn for the same period of 1991.
The company's share portfolio was valued at SKr22.1bn, of which SKr6.82bn
derived from its stake in Astra, Sweden's pharmaceuticals conglomerate and
SKr3.65bn from Stora, the largest forestry group in Europe.
Investor also announced that Saab-Scania, the Swedish vehicle and aerospace
group which it owns outright, achieved an increase in its first-half profits
(after financial items) to SKr1.26bn from SKr564m. Net sales fell by 8 per
cent over the same period to SKr13.29bn from SKr14.52bn.
There was a substantial improvement in the group's order book to SKr22.9bn
from SKr12.9bn, mainly due to the orders received for the JAS 39 Gripen
fighter aircraft. The return on capital employed rose to 12.1 per cent from
9.4 per cent.
Saab-Scania expects second-half results to be lower than for the first half
and overall profits for 1992 to be at the same level as last year when the
group made SKr1.71bn. The group's prediction is more pessimistic than the
one it made in the spring.
The group suffered a 25 per cent drop in aircraft sales to SKr1.77bn from
SKr2.37bn. The order book increased to SKr22.4bn from SKr11.7bn, of which
SKr6.6bn was for civilian aircraft and SKr15.8bn for its military aircraft.
Its combitech division experienced a slight decline in orders to SKr1.07bn
from SKr1.18bn.
Incentive, the Wallenberg dominated engineering based industrial company
announced a slight drop in its first-half profits (after financial items and
including its associated companies) to SKr654m from SKr671m.

FT  02 SEP 92 / International Company News: Lufthansa confirms jobs and
cost-cuts programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LUFTHANSA, the loss-making German national airline, hopes to improve its
results by DM700m (Dollars 500m) a year from 1993 through improved marketing
and more flexible pricing, as well as making big savings through the job and
operational cuts agreed this week.
Its supervisory board approved the employment and cost-cutting programme put
forward by Mr Jurgen Weber, chief executive, to haul the airline out of the
red. Lufthansa made a pre-tax loss of DM542m in the first six months of this
year, 66 per cent higher than in the same period of 1991.
The airline confirmed its plan to shed 6,000 people over the next two years
after 1,800 in 1992. This will be a cut of 15 per cent on the 50,000 at the
airline, although the whole group has a labour force of some 60,000. Cuts in
management would be especially deep. The total impact of its measures could
be up to DM3bn a year from 1995.
Lufthansa officials said concessions by the unions, including a one-year pay
freeze and more flexible pay structures and working conditions, represented
a marked change from the high wage demands made throughout industry earlier
this year.
The airline reached agreement with its two main unions, the DAG white collar
union and the oTV public sector union, on Monday night.
It said the favourable pay terms meant its new Lufthansa Express domestic
operation would be a division of Lufthansa and not a separate company with
lower pay levels than the rest of the airline. It threatened to take the
latter move if unions did not go along with Lufthansa's requests for wage
savings.
Lufthansa's financial situation is more acute than at most big German
companies. It must now retrench in line with the tougher economic and
airline environment. Mr Weber said operating losses this year would be
around DM1.2bn.

TWO LEADING European insurance companies are to scale down parts of their
international insurance and reinsurance business.
Internationale Nederlanden, the Netherlands' biggest insurer, is to stop
writing new business at its Folkestone, UK-based Orion subsidiary, which
specialised in aviation and marine insurance in the London market.
Skandia, Sweden's largest insurer, announced it is seeking to sell its US
and European reinsurance businesses.
ING and Skandia are concentrating on the development of less volatile
personal lines (home and motor) and life insurance.
The ING subsidiary, Orion, has been badly hit by intense rate competition
and heavy losses in the London marine and aviation market.
Orion, acquired by its Dutch parent in 1976, had been a market leader in
aviation business.
London market operations are being closed although some of the group's 70
staff will be retained to handle claims on business already written.
ING said it is negotiating with a potential buyer the sale of Orion's
personal lines and health insurance business.
After investment income losses amounted to Pounds 48.8m (Dollars 97m) in
1990 (against a premium income of Pounds 97m) and to Pounds 26.3m in 1991
(against a premium income of Pounds 108m). In 1990 claims on marine business
exceeded premiums by over 100 per cent.
ING said the company was too small in relation to the size of the UK market.
Skandia, which has been hard hit by losses in its investments in real
estate, said it is 'exploring possibilities to sell its New York-based
reinsurance operation through an initial public offering'.

FT  02 SEP 92 / International Company News: Boeing to open itself to wider
global collaboration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS AEROSPACE CORRESPONDENT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOEING, the world's largest manufacturer of commercial jets, is set to open
itself up to greater collaboration with other international aerospace
companies, Mr Philip Condit, the US company's new president, said yesterday.
Although Boeing has traditionally been a 'go-it-alone' company, Mr Condit
said in an interview yesterday that increased international collaboration
would become an important thrust of company strategy.
Mr Condit, aged 51, was elected Boeing president on Monday and is widely
tipped to become chairman after Mr Frank Shrontz, the current chairman,
retires in four years.
Mr Condit would not elaborate on what kind of increased international
collaboration Boeing was seeking but confirmed that 'we will see more
collaboration with lots of people in the international field'.
Boeing is already collaborating more closely with the three Japanese
aerospace companies (Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Fuji Heavy Industries, and
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries) on its new 777 twin engine wide-body airliner
programme managed up to now by Mr Condit.
The new president also said Boeing had entered into closer collaboration in
military programmes including the new US Advanced Tactical Fighter F-22 with
Lockheed and General Dynamics and the Comanche helicopter with Sikorsky.
Mr Condit is taking over as president at a difficult time for Boeing and the
aerospace industry. The military business is under pressure from government
defence cuts while Boeing is facing challenges on the commercial front
including the launch of its new 777 airliner in a depressed market,
increasingly aggressive competition from the European Airbus consortium, as
well as the need to revamp its 737 narrow-body jet family and to press
forward with studies to develop a new super jumbo large capacity airliner.
But Mr Condit said the 777 programme was 'in good shape'.
He also welcomed the recent US compromise with the European Commission on
Airbus subsidies as 'an important step' in the dispute over commercial
aircraft trade. But he added that Boeing wanted to see the European Airbus
consortium operate 'on a completely privatised basis'.

<TEXT>
MONDADORI, the Italian publishing group controlled by Mr Silvio Berlusconi's
Fininvest concern, confirmed its continuing recovery by raising parent
company profits before tax and extraordinary items to L22bn (Dollars 20.4m)
in the first half of this year, against a loss of L13.7bn in the same period
last year, writes Haig Simonian.
Results at subsidiary companies, which had lost L9.2bn in the first half of
1991, also improved sharply, with pre-tax earnings rising to L19bn in the
first six months of this year.
Consolidated sales for the group, which was subject to a battle for control
between Mr Berlusconi and Mr Carlo De Benedetti, rose by 16.9 per cent to
L837bn.
Net debt at Mondadori fell to L59.8bn from L96.6bn. Fininvest controls
almost 90 per cent of the group.

FT  02 SEP 92 / SBC chief named in top-level changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWISS Bank Corporation, Switzerland's second largest bank, said Mr Georges
Blum, head of its commercial banking division, would become chief executive
next spring. The move is apparently an attempt to tighten management
controls and improve the bank's image.
Mr Franz Galliker, supervisory board chairman since 1984, will retire and Mr
Walter Frehner, current chief executive, will become chairman.
SBC said the new appointment was a 'normal change' and did not reflect
operational problems. However, in the past few years, the bank has been
caught with large loans to companies that have collapsed, including Macy's,
the US department store chain, Maxwell companies and Olympia &amp; York in the
UK and the Omni conglomerate in Switzerland.
Earlier this year Moody's, the US credit rating agency, downgraded its
rating of SBC bonds from triple A to double A-1.
While the two other big Swiss banks, Union Bank of Switzerland and Credit
Suisse, reported profit gains in the first half, SBC's pre-tax profits fell
7.7 per cent to SFr1.24bn (Pounds 500m) and it warned that provisions for
bad loans this year would be larger than it had originally thought.
Mr Blum, who as the bank's chief credit officer has had to extricate the
bank from some of these difficulties, has a reputation as a tough commercial
banker.
An SBC spokesman said it was always clear that the next chief executive
would be selected from within the executive board and Mr Blum had very broad
experience and was 'in the best position'.
He said Mr Blum had handled the bank's difficult involvement with the 1988
liquidity crisis in the Co-op retail group in Germany.
Mr Blum joined the legal office of SBC in Lausanne in 1961. In 1978, he was
sent to the general management in Basle but returned to Lausanne as senior
vice-president in 1980. Since 1984, he has been a member of the bank's
executive board and headed its commercial group.
SBC said that Mr Galliker would remain on the board at least until 1994 when
his current term expires.
'Decisions regarding the redistribution of responsibilities within the
executive board as a result of these changes will be made at a later date,'
it added.

FT  02 SEP 92 / SmithKline plans R&amp;D shake-up: Group to cut jobs, invest in
new facilities and end research into gastro-intestinal drugs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMITHKLINE Beecham, the Anglo-US pharmaceutical group, is to to make
far-reaching changes in research and development. They involve 150
redundancies among UK research staff, a Pounds 200m investment in new R&amp;D
facilities and, most surprisingly, withdrawal from long-term research in
gastro-intestinal drugs - the field that provided its best-selling product,
the ulcer medicine Tagamet.
The 'strategic realignment' of R&amp;D is the final phase of cost cutting and
rationalisation that followed the merger between Beecham of the UK and
SmithKline Beckman of the US in 1989. Savings in manufacturing, marketing
and administration have already cut the group's workforce by about 2,000 and
helped raise pre-tax profits 18 per cent a year.
'Resources must be focused on drug discovery with the highest potential for
return,' said Dr George Poste, R&amp;D chairman. 'As a result SB has decided to
discontinue several research programmes.'
The most striking casualty is gastro-intestinal drug discovery, which led to
Tagamet, with sales exceeding Dollars 1bn (Pounds 500m) in each of the past
six years, and more recently to Kytril, the anti-nausea drug launched last
year as a competitor to Glaxo's Zofran.
'We feel that basic research in this area has proceeded more slowly than in
others and it's more difficult to identify rational candidates for drug
discovery,' said Dr Poste. But he emphasised that development work on SB's
existing gastro-intestinal compounds would continue.
The realignment will leave SB with drug discovery programmes in five areas:
central nervous system; heart and lungs; anti-infectives; inflammation and
tissue repair; and vaccines.
UK R&amp;D sites will be cut from eight to six. SB will close its medical
offices in Reigate, Surrey, and the small research facility at its
antibiotics factory in Worthing, Sussex. The 150 redundancies - including
scientists, technicians and office staff - will be spread across the eight
sites.
The Pounds 200m investment in new buildings and equipment over the next four
years will concentrate on Brockham Park and Great Burgh in Surrey and
Mundells in Hertfordshire. SB will continue to divide its R&amp;D effort equally
between the UK and US.
Dr Poste said SB planned to devote about 15 per cent of pharmaceutical sales
to R&amp;D. This year's R&amp;D budget is about Pounds 410m. Its A shares closed 13p
down yesterday at 443p.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Henlys fights off Cowie's Pounds 32m bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HENLYS, the motor trader and bus and coach builder, yesterday succeeded in
fighting off a Pounds 32m hostile takeover bid from rival T Cowie. By the
close of the bid at 1pm yesterday Cowie had acceptances from or owned shares
totalling 42.6 per cent of Henlys' share capital.
Henlys' shares fell 5p to 62p and Cowie's rose 5p to 126p after the outcome
was announced.
The failure of the bid was put down partly to Henlys' spirited defence, and
also the fall in the stock market since the bid was launched at the end of
June. The all-paper bid had a partial cash alternative which would have
given Henlys shareholders 20p in cash per share.
After this and the lapsing of Kalon's bid for Manders, the paint group,
there is a feeling that paper bids cannot succeed in current stock market
conditions.
Mr Robert Wood, chief executive of Henlys, said he was delighted with the
outcome. He was aware that Henlys' shareholders would now expect him to
improve the performance of the company, which lost Pounds 6.8m pre-tax in
1991 and is forecast to make a small loss in the current year after
exceptional costs.
Mr Gordon Hodgson, chief executive of Cowie, said he was disappointed not to
have won. However, he said: 'Henlys' management has made claims about future
performance and as a major shareholder in Henlys, Cowie will watch with
interest to see if these claims are fulfilled.'
During the bid Henlys announced orders for its loss-making bus and coach
building plant in Scarborough, north Yorkshire, and forecast a 70 per cent
operating profit improvement for its motor division in 1992.
Cowie has a 9.9 per cent stake in Henlys, bought last week at 73p a share.
Mr Wood said he would treat Cowie like any other large shareholder. Mr
Hodgson said that although the income it would receive from the Henlys stake
was less than it could get on cash, Cowie planned to keep the stake.
Henlys' defence costs are likely to be around Pounds 850,000 to Pounds
900,000 while Cowie's are expected to be in the Pounds 600,000 to Pounds
650,000 range. If successful, Cowie would have had to pay success fees,
taking its costs to Pounds 941,000.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Looking for smaller worlds to conquer: Michiyo Nakamoto on
why Europe's chipmakers are changing course
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's semiconductor manufacturers are abandoning their long-held
ambitions of competing with the industry's leaders to concentrate on more
specialised areas, which they believe offer a better chance for success.
Faced with rising investment costs and increasing competition in their home
market by foreign groups setting up bases within the EC, the big three
Europeans, Philips, SGS-Thomson and Siemens, have been reassessing their
strategies for the 1990s.
They are focusing their portfolios on specific products in which they have
recognised strengths, rather than trying to tackle the high-volume standard
product areas which are the battlegrounds of the leading US and Japanese
manufacturers.
'There was a time when semiconductor companies tried to do almost
everything,' says Mr Heinz Hagmeister, chief executive officer of Philips's
semiconductor division. 'But that time is gone.' From now on, even the
largest semiconductor companies will have to be more selective.
That belief has led Philips to leave the highly competitive market for
standard products such as memory chips and focus its energies on more
specialised items for the consumer, telecommunications, industrial controls
and automotive industries.
Siemens, which earlier this year decided to reduce involvement in memory
chips production, also says it is no longer necessary to be a large
participant in the market for standard products such as memories. 'Standard
products are led by major players. To compete against them is a silly idea,'
says Mr Klaus Knapp, a senior director at Siemens.
Siemens will use the technology gained from its involvement in memory chip
development to manufacture application specific integrated circuits (ASICs)
and logic chips, which offer more stable revenue and better margins.
SGS-Thomson has also been concentrating on systems and application-specific
products for the consumer, telecommunications and automotive industries.
Until last summer Europe's semiconductor manufacturers had been talking
about forming a 'European champion' to compete with the large US and
Japanese groups in an industry expected to be worth as much as Dollars 200bn
(Pounds 100bn) by the end of the decade.
The idea of merging the operations of Europe's large semiconductor
manufacturers was 'a dream of consultants', Mr Hagmeister says. The
companies would have to deal with their own problems before there could be
any serious co-operation.
The driving force behind this change has been the need to generate profits.
Europe's semiconductor manufacturers can no longer afford to be in markets
where they are clearly behind their US and Japanese competitors.
Siemens, for one, has suffered big losses from its involvement in D-Rams.
'For every D-Ram we sell we are making a loss,' the group says. Its
semiconductor division lost DM500m (Pounds 180m) on sales of DM2bn in its
last financial year.
The conventional wisdom that a company had to be in all the main product
areas to attain a leadership role is being challenged by the examples of
successful companies which have risen to prominence on the strength of one
or two leading products. Intel of the US, which has carved a dominant and
lucrative position in the microprocessor market, is a key example.
European companies are medium-sized operations in an industry increasingly
polarised between the large, broadly based companies and the smaller,
specialised niche players.
Therefore, by focusing on applications-oriented products the Europeans have
probably increased their survival chances.
Concentrating on core businesses eliminates the enormous risks they would
have faced in huge growth markets such as memory chips. Because of the huge
investments needed and the characteristic boom-to-bust swings, 'trying to
compete in these markets may kill your company', says Mr Mike Glennon at
Dataquest, the technology consultancy.
At the same time, because these products depend on close collaboration
between supplier and user, the Europeans believe they are better placed than
their foreign competitors in supplying them to leading European companies in
the consumer electronics, telecommunications and automotive industries.
Meanwhile, the areas where the Europeans are developing expertise could
become more relevant in future as technology drivers, says Mr Matthew
Whitcombe of the Computing and Electronics Group at Coopers &amp; Lybrand
Deloitte, the management consultants.
Consumer electronics itself is not expected to expand its share of about 21
per cent of the entire semiconductor market, which Dataquest forecasts will
go to Dollars 88bn by 1995. However, Philips has been working on
applications for multimedia, the convergence of consumer electronics and
computers, which is expected to be a big growth area within consumer
electronics. In the long term multimedia applications are also expected to
be the driver for electronic data processing as well. Meanwhile, Siemens has
expertise in automotive applications, the fastest growing market sector last
year.
SGS-Thomson has strengths in communications which Dataquest forecasts will
grow from 13.9 per cent to 15.1 per cent of the market in 1995.
In spite of these promising signs, unless European semiconductor
manufacturers look outside of Europe to the larger markets of the US and
Japan, the crucial step beyond survival towards growth may still elude them.

FT  02 SEP 92 / New UK share indices to join existing benchmarks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS for new UK stock market indices have been prepared by a working party
including representatives of the FT, the London Stock Exchange, the
actuarial profession and market participants.
The new indices would complement the FT-SE 100 index and the FT-Actuaries
All-Share index, which are expected to remain the UK market's principal
real-time index and the main end-of-day performance benchmark, respectively.
The new indices would cast more light on the performance of the market,
particularly of second-rank UK companies.
They would also allow investors to monitor the performance of individual
industry sectors minute-by-minute during the day.
A broad measure of agreement on the plans has been reached, but some details
remain to be settled. A formal announcement of the plans is expected in the
autumn. Among the proposed new indices are:
The FT-SE Mid 250, covering the 250 companies that rank below the FT-SE 100
in size. This would be a real-time index that would contain companies with
market capitalisations of roughly Pounds 150m to Pounds 1bn.
These are typically substantial national companies, rather than the UK-based
international companies that make up most of the FT-SE 100.
FT-SE Actuaries 350 Industry Baskets, based on the top 350 UK shares (the
FT-SE 100 plus the FT-SE Mid 250). Industry classifications would be based
on the system used in the FT-Actuaries All-Share index. The industry baskets
would be calculated in real time.
The indices have been planned in part to allow for the creation of
derivative instruments, such as futures and options. In practice, these are
likely to be based on the FT-SE Mid 250 and the more important industry
baskets.
Mr Richard Lambert, editor of the FT, said yesterday: 'The new indices will
be part of a coherent family jointly sponsored by the FT, the London Stock
Exchange, and the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.
'We have co-operated closely in the past, and are pleased that we will
shortly be in a position to strengthen and extend the index coverage of the
UK market.
'These arrangements will also enhance the role of the All-Share index, the
principal benchmark of UK portfolio performance.'

FT  02 SEP 92 / Letter: Effect of house price changes must be reconsidered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRIAN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Edward Balls' summary of interest rates and inflation since 1925
(August 20) clearly shows the high real interest rates that have prevailed
in the UK economy over the past decade.
Nevertheless, for most of the 1980s, for many people, and for a significant
segment of the UK economy, the interest differential that mattered was the
difference between base rate and the annual change in house prices.
On this measure, interest rates throughout much of the 1980s were negative.
The change came at the end of that decade, as falls in house prices and
increases in base rate led to an exceptional rise in 'real' interest rates
according to this measure - possibly the highest 'real' interest rates in
history.
Such considerations were largely irrelevant before the 1980s because
consumer credit was not freely available against the security of houses and
property or otherwise. However, should we not now find a way of allowing for
the effect of house price changes if we are to arrive at a realistic picture
of what is going on?

FT  02 SEP 92 / Foreign Affairs: A chance to vent spleen - French voters may
vote 'No' on referendum day, but the morning after would be bleak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Dix ans, ca suffit. Onze ans, c'est trop.' (Ten years is quite enough.
Eleven is too much.)
That was what the students chanted in Paris, in April 1969. They had failed
to get rid of President Charles de Gaulle the previous year, on the 10th
anniversary of his return to power. But in 1969 he foolishly held a
referendum on a proposed reform (regionalisation) which did not seem to most
people a burning necessity. That gave a wonderful opportunity for everyone
who was fed up with him to vote against, without having to agree that they
were for anybody or anything in particular.
Three years later his successor, Georges Pompidou, held another referendum,
on the enlargement of the European Community to admit Britain, Ireland and
Denmark. This move achieved its objective of causing a split in the
opposition between the pro-European Socialists, already led by Francois
Mitterrand, and the anti-European Communists, already led by Georges
Marchais.
When Mr Mitterrand decided to hold a referendum on the Maastricht treaty on
September 20, he clearly had the Pompidou precedent in mind rather than the
de Gaulle one. Mitterrand too has succeeded in embarrassing and dividing an
opposition which contains both fervent Europeans and fervent nationalists,
with some of its leaders balanced between the two. He perhaps forgot that
he, like de Gaulle in 1969 - and indeed like Mrs Margaret Thatcher in 1990 -
has been in power for 11 years.
At least, unlike President de Gaulle, Mitterrand has not presented the issue
as a personal vote of confidence in himself, or threatened to resign if it
goes against him. He knows well that this would be seen by many as a reason
to vote against it. 'Our only hope of getting it through is for him to warn
that in the event of a 'No' vote he will stay,' a senior civil servant said,
half jokingly, in June. But it now looks as though that may not be good
enough.
Last week I heard a French banker, a keen supporter of the president, wonder
aloud whether Mitterrand might not yet save the situation by announcing,
just before the poll, that he would resign in the event of a 'Yes' vote, his
mission of securing Europe's future and France's place in it being at last
accomplished.
That was at the annual Aspen Institute seminar on 'the US and the world
economy', which this year was held in France. The European participants  -
drawn mainly from the banking and business elite but including senior
politicians from France and Italy - were unanimous in hoping that Maastricht
would go through, and by and large convinced their American interlocutors
that they should hope that too. Parallels were drawn between European and
North American integration even though (as one American speaker pointed
out), the proposed North American Free Trade Association is a very different
animal from the EC, Maastricht or no Maastricht.
Speakers from both sides of the Atlantic reassured each other, and sought to
reassure Japanese and other parties present, that no 'fortress Europe' or
'fortress America' was in prospect, and that regional arrangements, if
properly managed, were a step towards the global liberalisation of markets.
Perhaps the most telling argument in favour of Maastricht, at least at the
Aspen seminar, was that a French 'No' vote would make an early breakthrough
in the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations much less likely.
One influential Japanese speaker did observe dryly that both the EC (by
excluding agriculture from its 'Europe agreements' with Czechoslovakia,
Hungary and Poland) and Nafta (by raising the local content requirement for
imported cars and abolishing the 'maquiladora' free trade zone) appeared to
be violating the Gatt rules. But even he went on to argue that the future
lay in a worldwide 'federation' of regional groups, though he was unclear
about the nature of the group to which Japan itself would belong.
At the same time, the European speakers were acutely aware of speaking for
an elite which, irrespective of party labels, had largely forfeited the
confidence of the man and woman in the street. The French were in a mood, as
one of them remarked, to say not so much 'Non' as 'merde' to the entire
political class.
The precise reasons for this mood are hard for the British observer to
grasp. One is inevitably struck by the prosperous and well-organised
appearance of France as compared with Britain. But obviously high
unemployment in France has a lot to do with it, especially now that the
static condition of the economy offers little hope of early improvement.
The danger of a referendum is that it enables all those who dislike a
particular government, or a particular proposal, to gang together and defeat
it without having to agree on an alternative. Some of the French politicians
campaigning for a 'No' vote - notably Mr Marchais and Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen,
the National Front leader - are no more likeable than the establishment
leaders calling for a 'Yes'; But that does not seem to matter in a
referendum, where victory would not automatically give them power.
Equally, there is much to dislike about the treaty itself. In June, I too
gave way to an impulse of Schadenfreude and expressed the hope that Ireland
would vote down Maastricht, suggesting that this would clear the decks for a
better-designed European union.
Happily the Irish ignored that advice. Events since have confirmed their
wisdom. Turmoil in the currency markets has shown how difficult it is for
Europe to maintain a fixed exchange rate regime with separate currencies and
divergent fiscal policies. Worsening carnage in Bosnia-Hercegovina and the
continued isolation of Macedonia have shown how ineffective is European
foreign policy so long as every detail of it has to be negotiated between 12
national governments on the basis of unanimity.
Damage limitation exercises after the Danish 'No' vote have distracted the
EC from the more serious agenda: the Uruguay Round, the accession of
European Free Trade Association members, aid to eastern Europe, and the
follow-up to the Rio Earth Summit.
Maastricht will not rectify these deficiencies overnight. The convergence
necessary for monetary union will take until the end of the decade to
achieve. The foreign policy machinery defined in the treaty will be only a
slight improvement on the present one, and will in any case need to be
recast in 1996 in the light of enlarged EC membership.
But a 'No' vote from France, the country that has been in the vanguard from
the very beginnings of European construction, would be a body blow to the
entire enterprise. Nationalist demons would be unleashed throughout Europe,
and much that has already been achieved would begin to unravel. In a world
of nation-states, we might all be forced to choose between accepting German
hegemony and forming an anti-German coalition: a choice which, for 40 years,
French leaders have striven skilfully to avoid.

The fallout from the break-up of Yugoslavia is having some strange effects
in distant parts of the world. The Australian Soccer Federation, eager to
stamp out occasional outbreaks of thuggery among spectators, has ordered
clubs to drop their ethnic names, ignoring impassioned pleas for a reprieve.
The league says the ruling has provoked 'a lot of emotion' among the clubs,
many of which rely on support from specific ethnic minorities to pay the
bills. The affected clubs include Sydney and Melbourne Croatia, South
Melbourne Hellas, and Preston Makedonia.
The league has yet to decide whether Parramatta Melita Eagles derived its
name from the Maltese community which provides its main support. However,
Sydney Marconi will be allowed to keep its name, in spite of its Italian
overtones. The league says the club was named after the inventor.

Brazil's diplomats are facing increasing difficulty matching their
beleaguered President Fernando Collor's appetite for foreign travel - 18
foreign trips in 2 1/2 years - with countries still keen to receive him.
However, Observer hears that Collor is insisting on putting in an appearance
at the UN general assembly in three weeks time. By tradition Brazil provides
the first speaker in the general debate and while Collor could have sent his
foreign minister, his absence from the international stage would not have
looked good back home.
In the event the UN's diplomatic gossips cannot help noting that the first
speech at the general assembly will be given by a president facing
impeachment, while the second speech will be given by a US president facing
defeat.

Meanwhile, another casualty of current market conditions has been a new
issue for Sleepy Kids, the USM-listed animation company. Having bought the
film and merchandising rights to the Duchess of York's 'Budgie The Little
Helicopter' books, Sleepy Kids has had a spot of bother refinancing itself.
It has only raised half what it hoped for through a share placing and its
shares have gone to a discount. In spite of the adverse publicity
surrounding the Duchess of York, Sleepy Kids is adamant that its
disappointing performance has nothing to do with Her Royal Highness' recent
troubles. It blames the perilous state of the markets.
However, John Bryan, the Duchess' financial adviser on the deal, must feel
proud that this time he seems to be earning his keep.

Sir Tom Cowie's failure to win control of rival motor dealer Henlys in a
hard fought Pounds 32m bid could be put down to the fall in the stock market
or sympathy for the under-dog on the part of Henlys' shareholders. But
perhaps his choice of advisers played a part.
Sunderland-based Cowie employed Noble Grossart, the Edinburgh merchant bank,
and Dickinson Dees, a Newcastle-based lawyer. It brought in an external PR
firm halfway through the campaign. It estimates its costs at around Pounds
600,000 to Pounds 650,000 - 'we drive a hard bargain' boasts Gordon Hodgson,
Cowie's chief executive.
Henlys fees, by contrast, are in the Pounds 850,000 to Pounds 900,000
region. But then that may not be such a high price to pay if it helps secure
the firm's continued independence.

Delegates to the Non-Aligned Movement conference have been making their

unnoticed in an unmarked white airplane, while the Sultan of Brunei, the
world's richest person, jetted in on his own jumbo.
While most heads of state are staying in the Jakarta Hilton, the Sultan has
opted for the Grand Hyatt, where he is understood to have rented a mere four
floors. However, The Hilton will be missing another well-known guest.
Libya's Colonel Gadaffi has decided to stay at home. This will be good news
for tennis players since it will free up court Number four which had been
reserved for his tent.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Observer: All change at Heineken
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It's changing of the guard time at Europe's big brewers. Guinness's Sir
Anthony Tennant steps down at the end of the year and now Holland's Freddy
Heineken is reshuffling the pack at his family-controlled brewery.
But while the transition at Guinness is proceeding smoothly, Heineken,
Europe's largest brewing group, is being more adventurous. It has appointed
Karel Vuursteen, 51, a former chief executive of Philips' US lighting
operation. He takes over the chairmanship of Heineken's executive board next
April.
Last year Heineken hired an ex-Volvo man, Leendert Schouten, to run its
finance side, and Vuursteen's promotion is an even clearer sign that
Heineken is intent on shaking off its image as a cosy family-run company.
Although the jazz-playing billionaire chairman retains considerable
influence, outsiders believe that Vuursteen's appointment bears the hallmark
of Gerard van Schaik, who took over from Freddy Heineken in 1989.
'In spite of van Schaik's gentle and informal manner, he is the one making
the decisions', says one long time Heineken watcher. Under his short
stewardship, Heineken has made more money even though it has sold less beer.
However, van Schaik is a Heineken veteran, whereas Vuursteen has only been
there just over a year.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Letter: 'Visionary' approach to defusing the sterling crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DUNCAN HEENAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The current sterling crisis once again points up the blindness of the
City and the government to the 'real economy'. The long-term value of a
currency is determined by the relative supply and demand for it, arising
from the flow of trade. The 'hot money' of capital flows and arbitrage
reflects only the short-term exploitation of differences and bears little
relation to the underlying strength of the economy in the longer term. To
try to counteract long-term trends with short-term weapons is merely to
store up bigger problems for the future.
A more visionary approach than fiddling with interest rates or criticising
the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) would be to take the ERM quickly forward
to the stage of a common European currency. Exchange rates within Europe
would then cease to be a factor in economic management, and interest rates
would be influenced by an institution with a proven record of nurturing the
'real economy' - that is, the Bundesbank.
I fear that this view will be shared by few in the City, however, as too
many of their livelihoods depend on the retention of these cumbersome
national differences in a world which has outgrown them.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Letter: Promotion of science beyond the media circus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof PETER DAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader writer ('How to advance British science', August 28) is
right to diagnose the task of expounding the scientific view of our world as
too important and pervasive to encapsulate in one week's media circus each
year, of the kind that traditionally accompanies the meeting of the British
Association. The need to explain the world we inhabit is great, and our
efforts to do so are continuous, but I am sorry that you succumb to the view
that what is not universally visible in the media does not take place.
In particular, your leader writer's remarks do less than justice to an
extensive and successful programme of lectures, master classes and teachers'
workshops that fill our historic Lecture Theatre nearly every weekday
throughout the school year. Since last autumn some 20,000 young people have
had the chance to watch experiments and hear accounts of subjects as diverse
as electric sparks and the movements in the earth's crust.
As to co-operation between the Royal Institution and the British
Association, you need look no further than the contribution that we have
traditionally made to the BA meeting itself in the form of a repeat
performance of one of our celebrated discourses; this year the show put on
by Michael and Wendy Gluyas on sound and music was a highlight of the week
in Southampton, with 100 or so people being turned away from the door.
The RI and the BA co-operate closely, both in organising their own
activities and in contributing, with the Royal Society, to the work of the
Committee on Public Understanding of Science (COPUS).
What we do is in many respects complementary. Whether the over-riding cause
that we both serve - of bringing the public to awareness of the power and
limits of science as a way of making sense of our world - is best served in
unity or diversity, is something we will both continue to keep in review.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Letter: A proven model for schools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From D V BENNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with interest your editorial on education ('Exam results',
August 20) and was curious as to why you choose the International
Baccalaureate as a proven model.
May I suggest that you obtain some information concerning the European
Schools in Europe and their already accepted and well-known European
Baccalaureate.
Between 60 and 70 per cent of the students in these schools are children of
those working in European or other international organisations in Europe.
The remainder have parents who are not connected with the
European/international civil service.
The first European School was started in Luxembourg in the 1950s. Today,
their stringent examination requirements are appreciated by many
nationalities throughout Europe. This system has the strong support of
parents and students, unusual these days.

<TEXT>
Sir, At the Republican national convention, Mrs Marilyn Quayle stated that
though a career was a real option, 'most of us love being mothers or wives,
which gives our lives a richness that few men or women get from their
professional accomplishments alone'. ('Discordant tones over family values',
August 21).
Has it occurred to Mrs Quayle that many women with, dare I say careers, lest
I be labelled a feminist, do not have a choice as to whether or not they
work? For some women it is an actual financial need.
Where is it written that being a mother, a wife and a professional are
mutually exclusive?
Please do not speak for all of us, Mrs Quayle. You may represent a majority
of the women on Walton's mountain, but I hardly think you represent all
American women in 1992.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Personal View: Blind faith in R&amp;D
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID SAWERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has become part of the conventional wisdom that the level of industrial
spending on research and development (R&amp;D) helps to explain international
differences in industrial performance, and that one reason for the
disappointing performance of British industry is that it spends less than
its competitors on R&amp;D.
But these beliefs are not supported by the evidence. The most appropriate
measure of industrial effort devoted to R&amp;D is industrially financed R&amp;D as
a percentage of industrial production. As the table shows, Germany and Japan
are the only large industrial countries in which industry devotes a
significantly higher proportion of its income to R&amp;D than British industry.
French and Italian industry have performed well while devoting less to R&amp;D
than does British industry. At the level of the nation, there is clearly no
simple correlation between industrial expenditure on R&amp;D and growth.
It is naive to imagine that national growth can be closely correlated with
research expenditure. Growth depends more on increasing the efficiency with
which resources are used than it does on increasing the input of such
resources, including R&amp;D. Research activity is only one way in which
industry can improve its efficiency; and it is the results of this activity,
not the level of expenditure on it that determines its contribution to the
growth of industrial efficiency.
One explanation of the pattern of British industry's expenditure on R&amp;D over
the years could be that the results of its high expenditure in the 1960s
proved commercially disappointing, and that the UK increased its expenditure
in the 1980s when competition intensified.
Economists are tempted to use any available figures when comparing the
economic performance of nations, even if the figures are not truly relevant.
R&amp;D statistics are among the less relevant figures. The most interesting
questions are why companies and industries differ in the success with which
they introduce new products and processes to increase sales and reduce
costs, and whether changes to the hardware or to the organisation of
marketing and production do more to improve efficiency.
Expenditure on one means of improving the hardware is not a very useful
figure in this context. It is all the less useful because decisions
concerning which efforts to improve hardware should be called R&amp;D are
partially subjective, so that international differences in R&amp;D expenditure
may well reflect differences in the interpretation of what it comprises.
Studies of the reasons for international differences in industrial
performance therefore need to be analytical and qualitative rather than
quantitative. Statistics can only provide a starting point for analysis, not
the answers themselves.
It is depressing, given the limited significance of R&amp;D expenditure, that
the Democratic party of the US - along with the Labour party of the UK -
places so much emphasis on tax incentives to encourage more spending on R&amp;D.
A company's expenditure on innovative activity, including R&amp;D, is largely
determined by the technical opportunities for such activity in its industry
and by the intensity of the competition it faces. Tax reliefs will reduce
the cost of R&amp;D, but this reduction is unlikely to increase significantly
the expected return.
The British government is trying to encourage firms to spend more on R&amp;D by
promoting the publication of research expenditure by individual companies.
But the government's efforts to make companies more conscious of their R&amp;D
expenditure are likely to cause companies to place more of their activities
in this category, which is what the US tax credit appears to have done. This
government intervention may therefore make everyone happy without changing
anything but the work of the accountants.
If any government wants to improve the performance of its national
industries, it should recognise that improvement will depend on getting more
output from the available inputs, not on increasing the quantity of the
inputs, whether R&amp;D, investment or employment.
Performance is a matter of how firms are managed, which governments cannot
directly influence. The most relevant role for government is to improve the
quality of the labour input through its influence on the educational system,
and to maintain a stable macro-economic climate. Attempts to increase the
quantity of R&amp;D demonstrate politicians' failure to analyse the problem and
their desire to be seen to be doing something.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Leading Article: A PR coup for the banks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH clearing banks' talent for public relations is almost as
impressive as their genius for losing money. To have conveyed the impression
that they want to introduce charges on current accounts in the depths of a
particularly severe recession invites no more flattering verdict. Yet,
ironically, the clearing banks have a reasonable case for phasing out free
banking. On past form they will probably fail to make it persuasively,
before exploiting the notorious inertia of the majority of bank customers by
slapping on the charges regardless.
For years the big four clearing banks complained that they did not earn
enough from current accounts to defray the heavy costs of money
transmission. Then Midland Bank ensured that transparency in bank charges
would be deferred sine die when it introduced 'free-if-in-credit' banking in
the mid-1980s. This entrenched a system of cross subsidisation. Lloyds Bank
stirred the pot further when it started to offer interest on current
accounts in 1988.
Since then retail bank profits, while still handsome enough to absorb the
consequences of the banks' folly in corporate lending, have been under
growing pressure. As for the customers, those who have managed to stay out
of overdraft have enjoyed an inexpensive service, subsidised by a minority
that includes people paying usurious interest rates of up to nearly 40 per
cent on unauthorised dips into the red.
Part of the rationale for offering such a competitive current account
service was to lock customers into a long-term relationship, thereby opening
the way for the banks to sell them more lucrative savings products such as
life assurance and pensions. Such a strategy, which involved turning a core
banking product into a loss leader, looked risky in the 1980s. It looks more
risky in the present decade when endowment policy bonuses are being cut and
growing disillusionment is felt by consumers over the products and quality
of service peddled by life assurance salesmen.
The problem that the big four clearing banks face in seeking to address the
declining profitability of retail banking is that their history and size
continue to give rise to the suspicion that they are part of an oligopoly,
even if many areas in which they operate are highly competitive. The merest
hint of collusion would give the Office of Fair Trading justifiable cause to
sit up and take note.
Yet in practice the big four clearing banks are no more likely to move as
one on current account charges than they did on the introduction of plastic
card charges. Their more normal game is follow-my-leader, after sizing up
the market's response to innovation.
The Midland's move to free banking in 1985 was in part a response to the
free banking service provided by smaller competitors such as the
Co-operative Bank and the Royal Bank of Scotland. Now that the pendulum
looks set to swing the other way, it would not be surprising if the big
banks once again restricted free banking to those who maintain a high
minimum credit balance in their account, while smaller competitors, whose
ranks now include a more versatile group of building societies, offer a
completely free current account alternative.
Such competition probably offers a more effective remedy than anything the
OFT can do. And in the long run, greater transparency in charges will be
healthy for both the banks and their customers.

FT  02 SEP 92 / A summer storm that is set to last: US airlines face a long
and difficult journey to recovery

April may be the cruellest month but, for US airlines, August was a close
contender. At the height of the summer travel season, when the industry
traditionally lines its coffers, it was instead plagued by fare cuts,
tumbling share prices and warnings of poor financial performance for the
rest of the year.
In one week alone, Northwest slashed fares by up to 47 per cent on Pacific
routes. American Airlines, one of the nation's leading carriers, scuppered a
proposal by Delta, the third largest carrier, for a proposed 5 per cent rise
in domestic fares. And bankrupt Trans World Airlines stepped up the dogfight
over Atlantic fares by offering Dollars 398 (Pounds 201) return tickets from
New York, Washington and Boston to various European cities.
On top of this, the finance director at American Airlines - a bellwether for
the industry - told analysts that the company would post a heavy
third-quarter loss. On Wall Street, airline shares are trading close to
their 52-week lows.
The events of this summer, which come against a background of losses, have
exacerbated a crisis in the industry and are forcing a rethink in strategy,
even among the largest and strongest carriers. Delta has announced
'down-sizing' moves, including the loss of about 4,000 jobs - about 5 per
cent of its employees - greater use of contract services and more 'seasonal'
scheduling of flights.
Mr Stephen Wolf, chairman of United, the largest US airline, has also hinted
that unspecified 'alternative actions' by the Chicago-based carrier might be
necessary to reduce expenses, should the industry's economics fail to
improve.
Already, capital expenditure plans, which traditionally consume about 15 per
cent of a carrier's revenues, have been cut. 'Neither we, nor other
airlines, can continue spending capital unless we can earn a profit on our
investments,' says Mr Bob Crandall, head of American Airlines. 'Without
profits, the airplanes and facilities that our customers - and the country -
want us to provide simply won't be there.'
Such dire warnings are a long way from the goals of industry deregulation, a
policy launched in 1978 when Congress decided that airlines should be able
to fly freely within the US, charging whatever they liked. The objective was
low-cost air travel and an industry driven to efficiency by competition.
Today, air travel is cheap and carriers are certainly cost-conscious. The US
Air Transport Association, for example, estimates that air fares have risen
53.4 per cent since deregulation, while consumer prices have gained 108.9
per cent - meaning that air fares have fallen in real terms. This summer's
particularly savage fare war took domestic prices back to 1983 levels.
Service quality also appears to have improved - at least according to
official statistics. Figures compiled by the US Department of Transportation
show travellers' complaints on a declining trend since the late 1980s. The
number of on-time flight arrivals, for example, stood at 82.5 per cent last
year, compared with 78.7 per cent in 1988.
But all this has been achieved at the expense of profits. Since the start of
the 1990s aggregate losses have totalled Dollars 7bn (see graph) and there
is little sign of a return to profitability in the immediate future. In only
one of the past 10 years has the industry's annual after-tax profit margin
topped 3 per cent. For the period as a whole, the average after-tax profit
margin has actually been negative.
The reasons behind the crisis now facing US airlines are complex. Much blame
has been put on the Gulf war and the US recession by both the airlines
themselves and by industry observers. The Middle East crisis led to sharply
higher fuel prices in the second half of 1990; the stagnant domestic economy
resulted in a 2.2 per cent fall in domestic traffic last year, the first
downturn for 10 years.
But the problems run deeper. Ever since deregulation, which introduced
dozens of low-cost competitors, the industry has been in turmoil. In
addition to the greater number of competitors, upheaval was created by the
development of national 'hub' networks, a strategy adopted by the big
airlines to combat the new entrants and which led to a process of
acquisition and consolidation.
Under the hub system, an airline arranges for flights from different cities
to fly into a central 'hub' airport at roughly the same time. Passengers
then join connecting outward flights. This is plainly efficient; there would
be limited demand for a direct service between, say, Detroit and Little
Rock. But by funnelling passengers who start from a large number of cities
through Memphis, for example, there is a good chance of filling the aircraft
from Memphis to Little Rock.
To maximise the benefits of this system, carriers sought to expand their
domestic coverage - and mergers were a quick method. Sometimes these were
relatively painless, as in the 1987 merger between Delta and Western. But,
more often, the combining carriers encountered severe problems of
integration. Northwest Airlines' takeover of Republic in 1986, for example,
was dogged by labour difficulties, operational disruptions and consumer
disenchantment.
While this consolidation trend was underway, deregulation and the ready
availability of acquisition capital lured a number of financial operators
into the industry. These include Mr Carl Icahn at TWA and Mr Al Checchi at
Northwest Airlines. As a result, several carriers came under the control of
people whose management skills in a difficult industry were untested. At the
same time, acquisitions brought billions of dollars of debt to the airlines'
balance sheets, a burden which carriers such as TWA, Continental and
Northwest are still carrying.
Given these airlines pressing need for cash flow in a market dogged by
overcapacity, the outbreak of fare wars was only to be expected. And that is
precisely what has happened. This summer, for example, half-price travel was
available on most domestic routes. No sooner had these fares been withdrawn
from the market, than 30 per cent was lopped off advance autumn fares.
So how and when will it all end? In theory, corporate Darwinism should take
over; airline failures should reduce the overcapacity in the industry. So
far, the 1990s have seen the demise of Pan Am, Eastern, Midway and the
reincarnated Braniff. The futures of some larger, and similarly distressed
carriers - including Continental, Northwest and TWA - are still unresolved.
But in practice the US bankruptcy system provides an obstacle to the
process. A company that obtains bankruptcy court protection from its
creditors - which Continental, TWA and America West have done - gets relief
from most debt payments while it tries to restructure. Since a 'dead'
airline is worth relatively little (there is a surplus of equipment and
aircraft, so only international routes and landing slots tend to attract
buyers), creditors have every reason to encourage a reorganisation plan.
But the carrier still needs to earn enough cash to pay its operating bills,
often resorting to either asset sales and/or ticket promotions. This has
been the catalyst for many of the fare wars, with stronger carriers obliged
to match aggressive fare-cutting by their bankrupt rivals.
The current crisis has prompted growing demands for reform by the solvent
airlines. 'Congress should change the nation's bankruptcy laws, which have
worked badly in every industry,' says Mr Crandall of American. Unfortunately
for Mr Crandall and his counterparts, however, there is little prospect of
any overhaul of the system.
As in other troubled industries, foreign investment is an alternative
solution. The Dollars 750m that British Airways proposes to invest in USAir,
for example, is a significant contribution, given the US carrier's Dollars
2bn debts and Dollars 760m of losses in the past two years.
But relief from this source may also be limited. US rules restrict
foreigners to 49 per cent of a domestic airline's equity, and 25 per cent of
the voting rights. Moreover, globalisation of the airline industry is a
two-edged sword.
In contrast with the US domestic market, international travel is still
growing, and the stronger US airlines also want to continue their own push
into international markets. Many have historically had little exposure
overseas. International revenues accounted for a third of the total at
United in 1991, and only about 21 per cent at American.
Accordingly, the larger US carriers would like their government to use
approval for deals, like the BA-USAir transaction, as a bargaining counter
to win concessions abroad for US carriers.
An alternative approach to the industry's problems is presented by Southwest
Airlines, the only sizeable carrier to remain consistently profitable in
recent years. Based in Dallas, Southwest has specialised in flying direct
city-to-city services on popular commuter journeys, rather than funnelling
flights through a hub and attempting to provide national coverage.
It uses one type of aircraft, the Boeing 737; keeps its costs and fares to a
minimum; and regularly attracts the fewest consumer complaints of any
leading carrier. Its performance has attracted interest from larger rivals.
American, for example, recently said that it might either have to bow out of
certain markets where Southwest competes, or attempt to rival its low-cost
operating structure.
For most of the industry, however, the immediate prospect is for more of the
same. The fare cuts offered this summer and autumn have probably doomed
carriers to sizeable losses in the third quarter of 1992, and the final
three months of the year traditionally lose money.
A further round of consolidation is also widely-expected. The continuing
losses and dwindling cash at TWA is pressuring Mr Icahn, the carrier's
owner, its creditors and its unions to negotiate a reorganisation plan under
which the creditors and unions would become the leading shareholders. But
with some of its international assets already sold, and BA-USAir a potential
buyer of others, it seems likely that any 'restructured' TWA would be a
smaller operation.
BA is clearly a possible saviour for USAir, and there are still suggestions
that Northwest and Continental will eventually combine. Over the summer,
however, Continental has received formal investment proposals from two
separate Texas-based investors, and from the loss-making Air Canada.
Only when this final shakeout is complete, the economy recovers and domestic
traffic improves, may the fare wars abate and some semblance of
profitability return. The travelling public will probably bemoan the day,
but for the US carriers it cannot come a moment too soon.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN EXPECTATIONS of rapid progress are raised in Middle East peace
negotiations, bitter disappointment can not be far behind. So it has proved
in the last 10 days, as Israelis and Palestinians have moved towards a
thoroughly predictable impasse in their Washington talks on arrangements for
Palestinian self-government in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip. The latest round started with what seemed to be a fair wind,
generated in large part by the election of a more conciliatory Israeli
government under Mr Yitzhak Rabin. But the relatively calm and businesslike
atmosphere of the bilateral negotiations has served merely to highlight vast
differences on matters of substance. Further concessions from both sides
will be necessary to avoid a breakdown.
At issue is the body which Israelis and Palestinians agree should be set up
to administer the territories during a five-year transitional period. The
Palestinians want a fully-fledged authority with legislative powers and
control over land; the Israelis have proposed a much more limited
arrangement with domestic administrative powers but no say in security,
foreign affairs or the running of Jewish settlements.
This is no semantic dispute. It goes to the heart of the aspirations and
fears on both sides. The Israelis say that by demanding a legislative
authority, the Palestinians are seeking to pre-empt future negotiations on
the final status of the territories and set up the nucleus of an independent
state. The Palestinians reply that by circumscribing their self-rule so
narrowly and reserving the right to continue building settlements,
appropriating land and extracting water in the West Bank and Gaza, the
Israelis are allowing themselves the scope to consolidate their hold over
the territories in perpetuity.
Both sides are missing the immediate point. What they are discussing is a
transitional arrangement to enable Israelis and Palestinians to show they
can live together free of violence, intimidation and interference. The
Israelis need to be assured that a self-governing authority can not
constitute a threat to them. Equally, if the word autonomy is to have any
meaning, the Palestinians can not be asked simply to administer existing
Israeli occupation laws; they have to be given the ability to initiate, or
amend, legislation in their own right.
Above all, though, Israelis and Palestinians will have to recognise the need
to avoid being completely dogmatic about the ultimate outcome. If they try
to predetermine the outcome of final-status negotiations that will only
start in three years at the earliest, they will get nowhere.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS WELL known that broadcasters spend an above average portion of their
time honing their skills in malicious gossip. Once a year, they do this in
public at the Edinburgh Television Festival, which has just ended.
The prime time slot in this year's event was occupied by Mr Michael Grade,
chief executive of Channel 4, who attacked the BBC for its 'political
appeasement' of the government in pursuit of a new charter based upon
continued funding by the television licence fee. He went on to brand the
management style of the corporation as 'pseudo-Leninist'.
It was probably this remark which inspired Mr Marmaduke Hussey, chairman of
the BBC board of governors, to dismiss Mr Grade as a 'Bourbon in red
braces'. It was left to one of Mr Hussey's fellow governors to acknowledge
that much is wrong with the BBC, not least its system of governance, where
there is a serious confusion between regulatory and management functions.
This is an inauspicious beginning to the BBC charter debate, which is to be
officially inaugurated shortly by a government green paper. Lenin versus
King Louis is hardly a billing for the turn of the 20th century.
The weakness of Mr Grade's position is that he denies the need for change in
an era of multi-channel television. Logically, he must be even more
committed than current BBC management to the licence fee and hence to the
corporation's longstanding supplicant relationship with government.
It it not possible to identify with similar clarity the weakness of Mr
Hussey's position, since in six years of office, he has failed to enunciate
one. The BBC, after a laborious exercise in self-examination, has declined
to set out an official view about its own future before the green paper.
This may be in some circumstances be judged tactically shrewd, but its prime
cause is the fact that the BBC has for the past 15 months had a cautious
director-general, Sir Michael Checkland, and a director-general designate,
Mr John Birt, who thinks the BBC should be moving upmarket and who takes a
more robustly interventionist view about the role of senior management. The
predictable result has been confusion.
Since the choice of director-general is easily the most important direct
task of the governors, it may well be asked in the light of this botched
indecision what this oddest of public sector boards is capable of doing
well.
It all underscores the case for moving towards a single regulatory body for
British broadcasting, taking in ITV, the BBC and the largely unregulated
satellite broadcasters too. That at least was a point well made in
Edinburgh.

FT  02 SEP 92 / People: Fox to advise ECGD
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Robin Fox, vice chairman of Kleinwort Benson, has succeeded Sir Peter Leslie
as chairman of the Export Guarantees Advisory Council.
Since a change in legislation last year, the Council advises the Export
Credits Guarantee Department on all its activities - whereas previously it
was formally consulted only in cases where 'national interest'
considerations applied.
Fox, 55, who was brought up in the same Cornish village as trade minister
Richard Needham , has been at Kleinworts since 1961, and has in the past
been heavily involved with the bank's project work.
While Kleinworts is a big arranger and provider of ECGD-backed finance, the
Council has traditionally picked a clearing banker - such as Sir Peter, a
career Barclays man before he became Midland's deputy chairman last year -
for the post. But Fox is a well connected City figure, and, as a member of
the Overseas Project Board advising the Department of Trade and Industry,
also a familiar face at the DTI.
Appointed as chairman designate 12 months ago, he was given a three-year
term instead of the standard five because the agency was then in a state of
flux, according to ECGD. Since, the division offering short-term cover has
been sold to the Dutch insurer NCM.
Now ECGD, which insures against export risk 'is doing well' says Fox. 'We
hope we have entered a new era - though we have a big hangover (of bad
debts) from the past'. Last month, it resumed cover for some exports to
Russia.

LEP GROUP, the troubled freight forwarding and security company, has
appointed Wynne Denman and Brian Smith to the board, following indications
last month from chairman David James that he wanted to strengthen his team
with more 'experienced' non-executive directors.
Denman is currently a director of Sterling Industries, Amber Industrial
Holdings, North Sea Assets and FLS Aerospace. As well as joining the board,
Denman will be closely involved in the management affairs of the Freight
Forwarding division, the company said yesterday.
Smith is on the board of Eagle Trust, Manganese Bronze Holdings and Gerald
Gobert Holdings. He was previously group managing director of The Rank
Organisation. He will also be joining the Board of Lep's principal USA
subsidiary, The National Guardian Corporation.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Business and the Environment: Giving CFCs the cold shoulder
 -Peter Knight asks why domestic refrigerators are still not free of
dangerous chlorofluorocarbons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER KNIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If it is possible to make a CFC-free domestic refrigerator, why don't we
find them in the shops? 'Technically, there is no reason why a CFC-free
refrigerator cannot be produced now. The reason why there is none on the
market has something to do with the cost and perhaps the manufacturers' view
of the market,' says Jane Gartshore of the UK-based consultants Cool
Concerns.
While most industries that use CFCs have reduced their dependence on the
ozone-depleting chemicals, the EC's refrigeration sector has increased their
use by 4 per cent during 1986-91, according to CEFIC, the European chemical
makers association.
The slow progress of domestic refrigerator makers towards eliminating their
dependence on CFCs is a case of commercial hedging in the face of, some say,
minor technical difficulties and major economic uncertainties.
EC countries have agreed to cease CFC production by 1997, three years before
the date stipulated by the Montreal Protocol, an international agreement
reached originally in 1987. The protocol is about to be re-negotiated and
the phase-out date in the US and EC is likely to be brought forward to the
end of 1995.
'But those dates are a long way away for people caught in a recession,' says
Mike Harris of ICI, which supplies CFCs and some alternatives (see box,
right).
Domestic refrigerators use CFCs both as a coolant and to make the foam
insulation. (The foam, which is made by blowing CFCs into polyurethane, also
helps to support the refrigerator's structure.)
Refrigerator makers wanted a 'drop-in' chemical replacement that they could
use without incurring heavy retooling costs. This proved impossible. CFC
makers quickly produced replacement refrigerants, notably HCF-134a, but the
chemicals could not be used until changes were made to compressors and a new
lubricant found.
The technical problems associated with 134a have now been overcome but only
one domestic product in the UK, a Danish-made chest freezer sold by Iceland,
uses 134a.
Refrigerator makers have rejected other coolants - such as propane and
ammonia - on health and safety grounds. Ammonia is toxic and propane is
highly flammable (it is used as bottled gas). Manufacturers are worried
about the risks of using these alternatives in the factory, and they are
concerned that there will be consumer resistance to their use in domestic
refrigerators.
There are, though, technical difficulties in producing an insulation foam
which is as efficient as that made with CFCs. Yet refrigerator makers have
some 25 potential solutions to insulating their products. These can be
divided roughly into three groups of options.
First, a reduction in CFCs. Manufacturers can use a blowing agent that is
far less harmful to the ozone layer (made with a small amount of a chemical
from the CFC family, R22). Bosch produces three free-standing refrigerators
with such foam, although the appliances still use CFC as the coolant.
Environmentalists reject this foam technology and point to the second
option, CFC-free alternatives. Pentane has been promoted in Germany by
chemical maker Bayer, but manufacturers have rejected it because of
flammability problems.
Manufacturers do not think the CO technology is good enough to use on big
production lines. Furthermore, they say they cannot afford to add extra
insulation because they have to make fitted refrigerators to standard
kitchen design sizes, or risk losing custom to those that do.
For the same reason they do not want to reduce the capacity of the
refrigerator by encroaching on its inner dimensions. But just how much extra
foam is needed is in dispute. John Missenden, of the Institute of
Environmental Engineering at London's South Bank University, says it is 'a
matter of millimetres'.
Missenden's department produced a propane-driven refrigerator with CO-blown
foam insulation, commissioned by Greenpeace. The prototypes worked well, but
no manufacturers have shown an interest in using the technology. 'There's
been polite applause but no manufacturers take it seriously because they
don't take technology seriously,' says Missenden.
The third possible foam alternative is being developed by ICI, the leading
European producer of CFC substitutes. It is trying to use 134a to blow
polyurethane and a product is promised in a few years.
There are other forms of insulation. These include fibre wool, expanded
polystyrene and vacuum panels. The wool and polystyrene are generally
rejected for being too bulky and the panels are not yet commercially
available. If these alternatives were to be used, the refrigerator design
would have to be changed and might need strengthening with other materials.
While a CFC-free refrigerator could be made today, manufacturers feel that
the technology would only be an interim solution. Such a refrigerator will
also be more expensive to make (134a is five times as costly as CFC) because
of the cost of development and retooling.
Dorothy Mackenzie, of the consultancy Dragon International, says the
environmental performance comes low in the ranking of consumer decisions
when buying white goods. This provides insufficient stimulus for
manufacturers to risk the cost of launching a new, and probably more
expensive, product.
'Manufacturers were once sold the idea that people would pay a premium for
green goods. They are now waking up to the fact that these premiums won't be
paid,' says Mackenzie. And CFC suppliers are caught in a difficult
commercial position. They do not want to transfer pressure from the
environmental lobby on to their customers, because that could ruin business
relationships. But they need to sell more of their alternatives to recoup
the enormous development costs.
'There is a general disappointment that the market has not developed as we
would have liked. But the best thing for us is to do everything in our power
to ease the change-over for our customers,' says Harris. 'But the carrot is
not there and neither is the stick. There's not much more ICI or other
suppliers can do at the moment.'

FT  02 SEP 92 / Business and the Environment: Derelict land grows on trees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY DE BOERR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sapling number 26, on a windy Welsh hillside, looks deceptively like any
other young alder. With a spindly trunk and only a few leaves it struggles
to survive. Yet it is part of a project which challenges conventional
thinking on land reclamation.
The project, in the heavily-mined Blaenavon area in south Wales, is
experimenting with an ecological approach to reclaiming derelict land -
rather than the traditional approach of employing machinery and civil
engineers. If successful, it could prove applicable not only to Wales, but
around the world.
The idea is to use trees to generate self-sustaining soil in what is now
mostly impermeable clay. The engineering approach currently adopted involves
reshaping land with bulldozers. Channels and drains are created to control
running waters and a thin carpet of soil is added, seeded and fertilised.
The process produces green fields but time shows that such reclaimed land
eventually deteriorates, requiring re-reclaiming at great expense.
The Blaenavon project is the brainchild of Martin Haigh, lecturer at Oxford
Polytechnic and vice-president for the World Association of Soil and Water
Conservation. He has been monitoring the reclaimed mining and industrial
land in Wales for the past 21 years, examining soil erosion, soil evolution
and hydrology. His work has shown that the soil in former mining areas is
dying; shales brought up to the surface by mining break down into clays
which clog up the imported topsoil with water and prevent plant growth.
Green fields of grass become water-logged and replaced by moss and algae,
unsuitable even for grazing. Some mined land in Wales has been devoid of
vegetation for more than 40 years.
Haigh's search for a solution has resulted in a surprising form of east-west
technology transfer - from the environmentally-ravaged eastern bloc to
Britain.
Bulgaria has been experimenting with ecological land reclamation for the
past 50 years to tackle its problems. Research has shown that planting
alders and other trees helps rejuvenate the soil; the tree roots bring in
micro-organisms which create organic material, and that helps build up an
active soil ecosystem which is self-sustaining.
Bulgaria has been forced to adopt such an approach because the country's
best energy reserves lie under prime agricultural land, hundreds of acres of
which are dug up every year. Reclaiming such land is a national priority,
receiving the attention of Bulgaria's best scientists and research
institutes.
In Wales, the long-term future of reclaimed land is a taboo issue for land
reclamation agencies, says Haigh. He has had little encouragement from such
established groups. 'This project is at the forefront of a change in
philosophy in soil reclamation,' he says. Bulgarian experiments found that
ecological reclamation costs one-tenth that of the UK approach because
topsoil is so expensive to buy and transport. But the new method takes 10
times as long because the trees do the work naturally in their own time.
'Cost is important but it's not the whole question, sustainability is,' says
Haigh.
Haigh expects still to be working on his project in another 21 years - his
saplings will take at least 10 years to mature to the point where he can
begin monitoring the soil underneath for changes.
Meanwhile, he relies on funding from a number of organisations. The BOC
Foundation - a company set up by the UK industrial gases group to initiate
and fund research into pollution - has committed Pounds 40,000 over two
years. Earthwatch, the environmental charity, has also committed resources
and manpower. Its 'volunteers', who pay to spend their holidays helping out
on conservation projects, have been working with Haigh, monitoring soil and
sapling growth.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Thames Water, the biggest of the privatised water companies, has promoted
John Sexton, formerly head of research and laboratories, to the position of
director of environment and science.
The move comes at a time when Thames, with the rest of its sector, faces
increasingly heavy capital spending requirements to bring drinking and waste
water up to national and European Community environmental standards.
Sexton, 43, a statistician by training, has been involved with water since
leaving university in 1969. He joined Thames in 1976, initially to work on
the water resources side. Following spells in water quality and
environmental management, he had latterly masterminded the establishment of
Thames' two new labs (replacing 25 smaller and out-dated facilities), which
will each handle a million and a half analyses a year.
He joins the board of Thames Water Utilities, the principal operating
company.
Sexton's predecessor, Peter McIntosh, who, for personal reasons, has taken
early retirement at the age of 58, did not have the additional science
responsibilities.
Thames has recently been drawn into a number of environmental controversies,
notably the debate about the River Darent in Kent that had been suffering
from drought, and, allegedly, over-abstraction. 'The Darent is flowing very
nicely, and indeed there have been a number of floods ' says Sexton, who
vigorously defends the company's environmental record.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (20): Evolution favours mammoths of the
air - Towards the 800-seat airliner / Michael Donne, on this page, weighs
prospects for stretched variants of Concorde and the Jumbo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
WITH passenger volumes slowly recovering, airlines are wondering how to cope
with a doubling of present traffic levels by early in the next century.
The most obvious answer is to use bigger aircraft. Already, a new generation
of medium-to-long range jet airliners seating upwards of about 350
passengers a time is on the way.
But even as they plan to bring these new large aircraft into their fleets
around the mid-1990s, the airlines' thoughts are leaping further ahead to
the concept of 600-plus seaters for service by the end of this decade.
While initially these notions are focused on long-range aircraft,
particularly for trans-Pacific and trans-Atlantic operations, there are many
in the airline industry who believe that short-to-medium haul versions,
capable of coping with large passenger loads on routes of even a few hundred
miles, may well become necessary to ease the congestion problems in US,
Western European and Japanese air-space.
As a result, much discussion and analysis is in progress between the
airlines and the three major manufacturers, Airbus, Boeing and McDonnell
Douglas, on what is being called the Ultra-High Capacity Aircraft, or UHCA.
The manufacturers want to know just what the airlines are looking for in
terms of range and payload capabilities, while the airlines want to know
whether the manufacturers can provide what they want at economic cost in a
realistic time-scale - such as around the turn of the century.
Nothing has been settled. The airlines' requirements vary between 500 and
800 seats, with some of the most ambitious ideas stemming from airlines in
the US and especially the Far East and South-east Asia, where traffic growth
has remained strong even during the recession.
The manufacturers in turn have two main options. They can either develop
such monster aircraft by enlarging their existing latest models, such as the
Airbus A-330/A-340 and Boeing 747-400 and 777, or they can develop entirely
new aircraft.
The economics of both options are finely tuned. Theoretically, derivative
models would be cheaper to develop. It would be possible to lengthen the
fuselages of the existing large A-330/A-340 and 777 aircraft types, for
example, or in the case of the 747-400 extend the existing upper deck all
the way to the tail, so as to increase the payload.
But that might not necessarily be the best solution, since entirely new
aircraft would be able to take more advantage of the steady improvements in
technology, for example in new composite materials and in power-plant
technology, which would not only make them environmentally more acceptable
at airports, but also perhaps reduce their operating costs.
Every airline has different ideas as to what it wants. The manufacturers'
problem is matching these to produce compromise designs that can generate
sufficient orders to be successful. This is vital, for the development costs
involved in such monster aircraft will amount to several billion dollars for
each manufacturer - one estimate has suggested that if all three major
airframe builders produced designs, total airframe development costs alone
could reach as much as Dollars 20bn.
The basic engines for such large aircraft already exist or are under
development. Some time ago, the big three engine builders foresaw the need
for bigger aircraft, and launched a new generation of very-high thrust
engines, starting at around 65,000 lbs thrust and capable of expansion
through derivatives to as much as 100,000 lbs thrust or more - the
Rolls-Royce Trent, the General Electric (US) GE-90 and the Pratt &amp; Whitney
(United Technologies) PW-4000. Even so, further developments of these will
still need cash, perhaps another Dollars 5bn or so might, depending upon the
thrust-ratings required.
Such sums mean that no single airframe or engine manufacturer could
undertake such a venture alone. Each will have to seek risk-sharing
partnerships from other manufacturers throughout the world. This is not new
 -many current commercial airliner projects involve extensive international
sub-contracting and risk-sharing partnerships, but because of the great size
and cost of any UHCA, the global involvement would have to be much greater.
It seems likely, therefore, that virtually every aerospace manufacturer in
the world, even some of the smallest, would have some share in the
production, if not in the development, of the various UHCAs that may emerge.
The sums involved also indicate that the total purchase price of, say, a
600-seater to an airline will probably amount to somewhere around Dollars
200m against today's flyaway cost of a new, complete Boeing 747-400 of
around Dollars 140m.
At such prices, airlines will want to get the maximum utilisation from such
aircraft, which presupposes that they will be used most widely on routes
with heavy traffic densities, such as trans-Pacific, trans-Atlantic and on
long-haul routes between Western Europe and South-East Asia, the Far East
and Australasia. The airlines showing most interest so far - including
All-Nippon, American, British Airways, Air France, Japan Air Lines,
Lufthansa, Qantas, Singapore Airlines and United - all have such
long-distance routes in various parts of the world.
But specially designed short-haul variants could be developed for some of
shortest but busiest air routes - London to Paris and other near-Continental
cities, Rio de Janeiro-Sao Paulo in South America, and Tokyo-Osaka in Japan,
for example. Already in Japan, extensive use is made of a short-haul version
of the Boeing 747 that can carry more than 500 passengers. Such variants
might need larger, heavy-duty undercarriages because of their more frequent
take-offs and landings, and probably more doors for faster loading and
unloading so as to reduce turn-round times at airports and enable an
increase in flight frequencies every day.
This in turn means that much attention must be paid to airport
compatibility. Any new breed of 600-plus seaters will have to fit existing
gates and apron stand areas, although waiting areas for passengers within
terminals will have to be larger. But as traffic volumes recover from the
recession anyway they will create problems for airport operators, especially
through the need to improve passenger flow-rates through terminal buildings.
What can the passengers expect from these leviathans of the air? Forget
notions of in-flight gymnasia, super-comfort smoking-rooms and creches for
children.
There will be more doors, lavatories and galleys, of course, but the
emphasis will be on more seats. It is impossible to say precisely when such
giant aircraft will come into service. Most airlines and the manufacturers
believe it will be around the year 2000, after allowing for a four-year
production period in turn following some two years or so of detailed
development. This means that designs will need to be settled and projects
formally launched by around 1994, even though by then the airlines will
barely be out of their recession and probably not even back into profit.
The next two years, therefore, will be critical in this situation. As Mr.
John B. Hayhurst, Boeing's vice-president in charge of Future Large Airplane
development, has said: 'Anything is possible. It all depends on what the
market demands. Our key challenge up front is to identify precisely what is
needed. There is a big market out there, and we want to have the right
solution.'

FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (19): Barriers to a high speed
breakthrough - Michael Donne, on this page, weighs prospects for stretched
variants of Concorde and the Jumbo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH there is much interest in the world airline industry in the
development of a second-generation supersonic airliner to replace the
Concorde, it is unlikely that any such aircraft will emerge before the year
2005, if then.
The reasons - environmental, technological and financial - are the 'three
keys to success' in the aerospace industry.
They are closely related, and without all being fully addressed, no second
generation supersonic airliner - called the High-Speed Commercial Transport
or HSCT - will ever materialise.
Many long-haul airlines believe that an HSCT will be desirable into the next
century - although not necessarily essential - if only because, as a result
of traffic growth, there will be many more people flying long distances,
especially over the oceans, who will want to reach their destinations
quickly.
This will be particularly true for trans-Pacific flights, which already take
many hours in even the fastest subsonic jets, such as the Boeing 747-400. It
is believed that with an HSCT cruising at a speed of about Mach 2.4 (or
about 1,500 mph, faster than Concorde's Mach 2 or about 1,200 mph), with a
range of about 5,000 miles, it would be possible to fly between Los Angeles
and Tokyo non-stop in about 4.3 hours, instead of today's subsonic 10.3
hours, or between Los Angeles and Sydney in about 7.3 hours, with one stop
in Honolulu for refuelling, instead of today's one-stop subsonic journey
time of 15.8 hours or 14 hours non-stop. Such an aircraft would carry up to
300 passengers, instead of Concorde's 100, at fare levels broadly comparable
to today's subsonic rates.
If such an aircraft could be built at an economic cost the market would
probably run to several hundred aircraft.
While small in comparison with many subsonic types of jet airliner built
over the past 40 years or so, that would still make it exceptionally
successful compared with the total of 16 Concordes that entered service with
British Airways and Air France (subsequently reduced as some aircraft have
been taken out of service for use as 'spares pools').
But to achieve that will take considerable time, money and technological
expertise, going far beyond the research effort put into the Concorde.
The environmental problems, severe enough for the Concorde, will be far more
difficult to overcome with an HSCT, in view of the significant growth of
world-wide environmental concerns in recent years.
Noise will be especially critical. The aircraft's engines will need to be
much quieter than those of Concorde, because although much of the HSCT's
flying will be done at very high altitudes and supersonic speeds over the
world's great oceans, especially the Pacific, it will still need to land and
take-off at existing airports, some far inland, requiring extensive subsonic
flight (to avoid the disturbance of sonic boom) until the oceans are
reached. Moreover, in recent years, international aircraft noise regulations
have been progressively toughened, and it is unlikely that any relaxation
will be made for any new HSCT.
The engines will also have to be much more efficient, so as to save fuel and
keep direct operating costs down, while also reducing if not eliminating
pollutant emissions, especially nitrous oxides in the upper atmosphere.
This will call for new forms of engine, with improved combustion processes.
Much research is already being undertaken in these areas, but so far without
a suitable production engine emerging.
The aircraft will also need to make considerable use of high-temperature
resistant materials, such as ceramics, especially in the form of new
composites, capable of coping with the extremely high temperatures that will
be generated both inside the engines and on the skin of the aircraft for the
longer periods of sustained and faster supersonic cruise than Concorde is
called upon to perform.
Although several companies have produced individual design studies - notably
Aerospatiale of France, Boeing of the US and British Aerospace - seen as
models on elaborate display stands at international air shows  - these are
little more than the reflections of designers' dreams and do not mean that
an acceptable design is just round the corner.
The major airframe companies in the US (Boeing and McDonnell Douglas),
Western Europe (Aerospatiale, British Aerospace and Deutsche Aerospace) and
in Japan, and now also Russia in the CIS, have been working on the many
aspects of the HSCT for some time, pooling knowledge where they can, in an
effort to reach some kind of consensus on precisely what kind of aircraft
the market wants, when it is likely to want it and how big that market is
likely to be.
The American industry, backed by the long-running and extensive HSCT
research programme master-minded by the Government's National Aeronautics
and Space Administration, and supported by the vast technological knowledge
emanating from its missile and manned space programme, is the most advanced
in HSCT studies and is certainly the most confident, the overall attitude
being that the basic question is not whether an HSCT will ever emerge, but
when.
Concorde entered service in 1976, but because its annual utilisation rate is
low compared with subsonic jets (about 1,000 hours a year per aircraft
compared with about 5,000 for a Boeing 747-400), and because of its careful
maintenance, it will probably be able to continue in service until the early
years of the next century.
Many HSCT supporters therefore target the year 2005 as a suitable in-service
date for the second-generation aircraft.
They believe that technologically that is an achievable target, given the
pace at which aerospace technology has been and is likely to continue
accelerating.
But others believe that if a later date, say 2010, is targeted, there is
more time for further research, thereby improving the design and enhancing
the ultimate environmental, technological and economic acceptability of the
aircraft.
The last aspect of that argument is the most important.
Finding the answer to the timing of any HSCT is made more difficult because
it will depend not so much on technological progress or environmental
acceptability, as on finance.
That, in turn, is where the project ceases to be an industrial matter, and
becomes political.
There are several possibilities. If the US aerospace industry can convince
its government that an HSCT is worth developing, either as a purely
commercial venture or one with both commercial and military uses, it is
possible that the US Government may at some time consider subscribing part
of the money, with the US industry itself subscribing the rest.
Some other governments might be happy to see that situation emerge, given
the high cost of developing such an aircraft.
No one really knows yet what the cost is likely to be, but estimates have
put it at upwards of Dollars 15bn for the entirely new airframe and engines
that will be needed.
No single company, even in the US, can afford that sort of money -
especially with other large subsonic aircraft commitments under way, such as
the current studies for a subsonic Ultra-High Capacity Aircraft (UHCA).
The high potential cost would also make it difficult for the aerospace
industries of Western Europe and Japan to get their own governments to think
in terms of investing in a competitive collaborative HSCT of their own - a
kind of 'Supersonic Airbus Consortium'.
Moreover, a competitive European, or Euro-Japanese, venture would be an
expensive option, with no guarantee of success.
For while it would provide the alternative project the airlines would
welcome, it would be disastrous financially if the anticipated market proved
too small to sustain two ventures.
A more sensible scenario would be for all the other governments to persuade
the US to embark upon a single collaborative project on a global basis, with
everyone subscribing some part of the cash, picking up some part of the
development and production, and getting some part of the market in return.
Experience of getting big international collaborative aerospace ventures off
the ground indicates that launching an HSCT in such a way would be tough,
involving long and complex negotiations.
But it would not be impossible, and at least a start has been made in the
existing internationally collaborative preliminary research programmes and
market studies that have been under way at company level for some time.
Given the right kind of encouraging noises from the rest of the world's
aerospace industries and their respective governments, the US government
itself might be willing to consider such a possibility. Economic facts would
appear to indicate that only in that way will any HSCT stand any chance of
success.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (17): Heathrow showdown looms -
Resistance mounts to bigger airports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DONNE

AIRPORT planners throughout the world face mounting difficulties in finding
space, and then winning approval, for new airport facilities.
As a result, new airports and associated facilities are taking longer to
develop.
For despite the sharp downturn in traffic over the past two years caused by
the economic recession and the Gulf War, the resumption of air traffic
growth, albeit slow, is bringing a resurgence of congestion on the ground
and in the air.
The Association of European Airlines, representing 24 of the major airlines
in Western Europe, has pointed out to the European Commission and
Governments that 'air transport can only contribute effectively to European
integration and adequately satisfy user requirements if Community policies
ensure that the airline industry can conduct its business in a sound
economic environment.' This means devoting much more attention and money to
the development of a sound and adequate infrastructure in the air through
air traffic control and air navigation facilities, and on the ground with
adequate terminals and runways .
The International Air Transport Association (IATA) two years ago pointed out
that before the mid-1990s, 22 out of 46 existing international airports in
Europe would run out of runway capacity, while another 11 airports would
face similar problems between 1996 and the year 2000 if no corrective
measures were taken.
IATA, which represents more than 200 airlines, pointed out that congestion
was already causing losses of some Dollars 5bn a year to the air transport
and related industries and national economies in Western Europe, a figure
that would rise to Dollars 10bn a year by the year 2000 if nothing were
done.
The real difficulty, however, is that while many European Governments
recognise the problem, they lack the cash (and in some cases the courage) to
take the necessary steps to deal with it in the face of environmental
opposition. Expanding existing facilities can and will help, but such
measures often take much time to put in place, and they are frequently only
temporary solutions before even they are overtaken by the inexorable growth
in demand for air travel.
The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), estimates that between
Dollars 250bn and Dollars 350bn will be needed between now and the year 2010
to provide the necessary airport infrastructure to cope with anticipated
traffic growth, either through expansion of existing facilities or the
development of new airport sites.
The ICA0 identifies 35 new airports, including Bangkok, Berlin, Chicago,
Hong Kong, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Macau, Osaka and Sydney, with 48 new
runways planned and almost 150 runway improvements planned or underway,
apart from new terminals.
But the airlines argue that even this is not likely to be enough -
especially, for example, when set against the Dollars 857bn expected to be
spent on close to 11,500 new transport aircraft of all kinds by the early
years of the next century.
The airlines believe that Governments should be urged to spend more, and to
speed the pace of implementation of existing and proposed development plans.
This task of persuasion takes much of the time of the ATAG's officers who
travel ceaselessly world-wide.
In the UK, the problem of siting new airport developments is likely to come
to a head again with plans by the BAA (the airports authority) for a major
new terminal at Heathrow, T-5.
The proposal, expected to be submitted in a planning application later this
year, is aimed at building on the site of the Perry Oaks sludge works at the
Western end of the airport a terminal capable of handling eventually 30m
passengers a year, raising Heathrow's capacity to 80m passengers.
The cost will be between Pounds 800m and Pounds 900m at today's prices, and
the terminal will be built in phases, with the first phase opening in 2002
to handle up to 10m passengers a year, with further phases thereafter until
phase five is opened in 2016, bringing the terminal to its full 30m
passengers a year.
The application is certain to result in a major public inquiry starting some
time in 1994. BAA believes the inquiry will conclude in 1995, and that
allowing for political delays a Government decision on T-5, which BAA hopes
will be in its favour, will be taken in 1997 enabling construction to start.
But many others, both in the air transport industry and outside, remain
dubious, arguing that such a time-scale may be extended because of the
severity of environmental objections.
It is also argued that the bitter fight for the new Pounds 400m terminal
complex at Stansted, opened early last year, was almost won by the
environmental lobbies.
The battle lines for T-5 are thus now being drawn up. BAA is extensively
publicising its plans to local residents and others, stressing that it will
require neither another runway at Heathrow nor an increase in night flights,
and that the local environmental impact will be minimal.
The local residents are not convinced. They point to the likely impact upon
the surrounding urban areas of busier roads, especially an enlarged M-25
motorway, and, more significantly, call for the adoIntermediate string
overflow ption of radical new concepts, such as offshore airports on
reclaimed land, instead of adding more terminals to existing airports.
The anti-T-5 lobbies point to the approach employed elsewhere - in Japan at
Osaka Bay, in Hong Kong with Chek Lap Kok and Portuguese Macau in China -
with offshore airports planned well away from built-up areas.
They believe there is a good site in the Thames Estuary (well away from the
original Maplin offshore site which was abandoned in the early 1970s). They
argue that, if phase one of the new T-5 is not likely to start operating
until 2002, there is still time enough to consider such an offshore site and
build it, also in phases, to give the 30m passengers a year that T-5 will
eventually handle by 2016.
The cost might well be more than the Pounds 800m-Pounds 900m estimated for
T-5, but immense savings could be achieved far into the next century by
having a major airport close to London.
They argue that had Maplin not been cancelled, it would have been in service
by 1980, at a cost of about Pounds 750m and would have been capable of
regular expansion to cope with subsequent traffic growth at costs far lower
than the Pounds 1bn-plus total already spent on additional terminals at
Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, even before taking account of the proposed
T-5's near-Pounds 1bn projected cost.
The environmental lobbies also reject the argument that the new facilities
must be at Heathrow so that travellers can benefit from the inter-change
traffic that Heathrow already generates.
The UK environmentalists are not alone, for there are many in the world air
transport industry who believe that while mainland airports will still have
to be built or enlarged, an increasing use of offshore airports offers a
solution to the problems of disturbance and increasing pressures on scarce
land resources.
The future of T-5 is thus still wide open, but this confrontation between
airport and environmentalists is set to become the fiercest yet seen in the
UK.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (18): A money spinner for the
intermediaries - Leasing of aircraft is again becoming a convenient form of
finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIRCRAFT LEASING is not what it used to be. A combination of falling
interest rates, troubled banks and the recession has prompted airlines in
the past year to reconsider their enthusiasm for leasing. But now the tide
may be turning again in favour of leasing as financiers step up their
efforts to secure new business from airlines and investors.
During the late 1980s some of the world's most successful financial
organisations were aircraft leasers. At the top of the tree were, and are,
Guinness Peat Aviation (GPA), of Shannon, Ireland, and Los Angeles-based
International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC), owned since 1990 by the
American insurer AIG.
The business is hugely profitable for these intermediaries: over the past
five years, GPA achieved an average profit margin of 15.6 per cent on the
aircraft it bought in bulk from manufacturers and sold to investors.
Their airline clients liked leasing because it freed capital for other
purposes. By last year, one third of British Airways' entire fleet was owned
by investors and run by the airline on operating leases.
The investors, for their part, were able to divert taxable profits into
aircraft - mobile and sought after assets - and received an income stream
derived from the regular lease payments made by airlines.
This cosy arrangement began to go wrong two years ago. Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait frightened passengers away from international air travel and the
recession slowed their return to the skies. Airlines struggled, often in
vain, to make profits.
Furthermore, one technique used by airlines to cuts costs has been to defer
orders, which did little to support the view that aircraft values would be
supported by continuously rising demand.
The recession was accompanied by a worldwide fall in asset prices,
especially property and shares. This meant that banks' investment portfolios
became more skewed away from shares and property and more dependent on other
investments such as aircraft. To rebalance their portfolios, investment
managers, especially in Japan, staunched the flow of funds into aircraft.
The recession also slowed inflation, which upset the calculations involved
in leasing aircraft. The depreciation profile of aircraft in the 1980s
suggested a negligible fall in the nominal value of an aircraft over the
first five years of its life.
According to Avmark, an aviation consultancy, a 1985 Boeing 737-300 would
have cost Dollars 22m new and would have been worth the same in 1990. This
reduced the risk attached to investing in aircraft and so cut the cost of
lease payments. However, the same type delivered new in 1987 is now worth
only about Dollars 18.5m. Such declines have hit narrow bodied jets such as
the Airbus A320 and the Boeing 757 harder than the more popular new
wide-bodied aircraft such as the Boeing 747 and McDonnell-Douglas MD-11.
Finally, as world economies slid towards recession, most governments tried
to cut interest rates. In the US, the biggest single market for aircraft,
interest rates are at their lowest level for almost 30 years. This has
pulled airline executives towards simple bank borrowing rather than leases.
'The pendulum has swung away from leasing,' says Mr Dan Garton,
vice-president of financial planning and analysis at American Airlines. 'The
alternative of borrowing money on the market through bonds looks more
economical. Interest rates have fallen faster than lease rates, especially
in the US.'
This attitude was dramatically revealed in the failure of GPA's aborted
Dollars 1bn share sales in June. US investors in particular were unconvinced
of the security of airlines' profits and thus their ability to pay lease
rates.
Financiers have since put on a brave face on the future of leasing. Citicorp
Investment Bank in London raised Dollars 522m at about the time of the
failed GPA share sale. It used an innovative aircraft securitisation
technique to repackage old leases for new investors.
The bank is optimistic that such deals can be repeated. It points to
historic growth in airline traffic being double economic growth and growth
in aircraft sales should be even faster than that because 30 per cent of new
aircraft are to replace old ones, it says.
The bank estimates the total value of aircraft to be sold in the 1990s at
Dollars 45-50bn, three times the level during the 1980s. It believes that
the demand for leasing will continue to come from smaller airlines where the
off-balance sheet nature of leasing is particularly attractive.
Some airlines agree there is room for the opportunistic banks now: 'Over the
next few months, leasing will get easier because both demand has fallen as
well as supply,' says Garton. Financiers might take heart at this analysis.
But there is another airline view that they may also have heard often in
recent months. Says Mr Tony Galbraith, the treasurer of British Airways:
'leasing is just another way of borrowing. The decision to lease is entirely
a matter of cost.'

FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (16): Loads of time and money - David
Fishlock on the huge efforts needed to create better engines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID FISHLOCK

<TEXT>
'WE only deal with two things really - materials and air,' said Phil
Ruffles, Rolls-Royce's director of engineering, in an interview earlier this
year. But the cost of research and development to get those two things right
for a new aero-engine can be, typically, Pounds 500m spread over a decade or
more from design concept to full certification.
Up to six years is spent preparing the ground for engine development by the
acquisition of the technology - new materials and manufacturing technology -
needed to demonstrate the design performance. Engine development takes five
years, with the heaviest costs falling in years two to four. Once the
go-ahead is given for engine development, the risk must be low. It can be
devastatingly costly for the engine-maker if his engine should start to fail
in unexpected ways - say, a new material begins to break up.
But by getting his material and air-flow perfectly balanced a designer can
achieve minor miracles. For example, he can run a superalloy turbine blade
at a temperature 300 degrees C above its melting point for thousands of
hours - provided he keeps a film of air flowing across its surface.
Ceramics offer the opportunity to leap hundreds of degrees higher still in
temperature. But ceramics differ fundamentally from metals - for example, in
the ways they fail. New ways must be learned both to compensate for their
weaknesses in tensile strength and to manufacture parts without compromising
their good properties, including high specific strength and stiffness. The
inducements for the designer include a lighter engine and lower running
costs.
The engineer sees two broad ways of harnessing the advantages of ceramics:
as monolithics, from which, say, a new turbine blade might be shaped; and as
composites, in which the ceramic is buried in an energy-absorbing matrix of
polymer or metal.
Composites using polymer matrices are already widely employed by designers
of both engines and airframes. No engine designer has yet introduced either
monolithics or composites in rotating parts. Rolls-Royce is experimenting
with small, uncooled turbine blades of ceramic for helicopter engines.
Looking ahead, this company forecasts that by the year 2010 ceramics will
account for 20-30 per cent of engine weight. If ceramics could be applied to
the Trent engine for a 300-seat, 4,700 nautical mile range airliner, to push
up engine temperature by 500 degC, the life cycle saving to the airline
could be Pounds 3.5m per engine, says James Angus, Rolls-Royce's manager of
design systems and technology.
The airframe designer is also deeply concerned with the interplay between
materials and air. Some aircraft designers contend that the last big
challenge for aero dynamics, at least in subsonic flight, is better control
of the turbulence generated within two or three millimetres of the skin, and
a big reduction in drag.
Where turbine blade designers have been blowing air through fine orifices to
insulate metal from combustion gases, airframe designers have experimented
with sucking the turbulent air through the skin, through fine holes. The
first suction system for a big aircraft was demonstrated by Boeing in 1990,
as part of a laminar flow research programme funded by NASA and the US Air
Force.
Holes only 0.002 inch in diameter were drilled by laser in a titanium panel
built into the upper left wing surface of a Boeing 757. The laminar flow
created by sucking air in through these holes extended across two-thirds of
the wing. But NASA estimates that another five years of R&amp;D may be needed
before such a system can be sold.
In the mid-1980s when the Ministry of Defence's chief scientific adviser was
asked where Britain stood in developing 'stealth' materials and techniques
to make equipment invisible to enemy sensors, he replied sardonically that
the defence chiefs were busy filing the corners from their ships. Smart
materials - materials which respond or adapt to their environment the way,
say, a chameleon can camouflage itself - are a major R&amp;D target today.
For example, pieso-electric materials embedded in airframes or flight
control surfaces could be another way of reducing drag. One idea is to fit
the fins of a guided missile with pieso-electric elements which can be made
to twist by applying a voltage. A computer might then continuously control
their shape in flight. Alternatively, control could be exercised through
varying pressures on pieso electric surfaces, fed back as a changing voltage
to the flight control computer.
Likewise, to make an aircraft or missile invisible to enemy sensors, there
are possibilities emerging for active surface coatings that respond to
radiation falling upon them, so as to persuade, say, the radar that it is
not there.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (12): In the throes of transformation -
UK aerospace has lost a quarter of its jobs in three years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

WITH AN annual turnover of Pounds 12.5bn and exports of more than Pounds
8bn, the UK aerospace industry is Europe's largest and second only to the
US.
But it is now facing a series of pressures that are already beginning to
alter its fundamental shape and nature, and are likely to have significant
long-term repercussions for British manufacturing as a whole.
The industry is in the throes of profound restructuring, to adapt to falling
defence expenditure and the recession in civil aviation.
The Society of British Aerospace Companies (SBAC), the industry's trade
association, is estimating a 25 per cent fall in employment in the UK
aerospace industry between 1989 and the end of this year, because of cuts in
defence procurement and the slump in the commercial side of the business.
Total employment is expected to fall from 194,000 in 1989 to around 150,000
by the end of this year.
Another 40,000 UK aerospace industry jobs could be directly at risk if (as
discussed on page 12 of this survey) the European Fighter Aircraft programme
collapses. Even though Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Malcolm
Rifkind, the defence secretary, have continued to support strongly the
Pounds 20bn EFA project, the decision of Germany to withdraw from the
production phase of the new combat aircraft has made the future of the
programme extremely uncertain.
All the main UK aerospace companies have been forced to cut jobs and
restructure their operations. British Aerospace, Europe's largest aerospace
company, has undergone an extended period of top management turmoil, and is
now refocusing its activities on its core aerospace and defence businesses.
It has been forced to make extensive job reductions, announced that it is
looking for a buyer to acquire a majority of its corporate jet business, and
is scrambling to resolve the problems of its loss-making regional aircraft
operations.
It has also made clear that the company in future would no longer develop
any new commercial aircraft on its own, and that it would rely increasingly
on its 20 per cent involvement in the European Airbus programme for which it
provides all the wings.
Rolls-Royce, ranked as Europe's third largest aerospace company, has also
been restructuring heavily, closing and rationalising plants and shedding
7,000 jobs over the past two years, in an effort to improve productivity to
compete against its two larger US rivals, General Electric and Pratt &amp;
Whitney, and to adapt to a shrinking defence market.
Unlike previous downturns, the SBAC is worried by the current shake-out in
the industry, because some UK aerospace companies have reported that over 30
per cent of job losses were among engineering and technical staff. 'In
short, companies are cutting long-term capability,' the SBAC said, in a
recent briefing paper.
Apart from the loss of manpower, the downturn in both the civil and military
sectors is also threatening the long-term health of the UK aerospace
industry in other ways, according to the SBAC.
The technology base is shrinking, with cuts taking place without benefit of
any national assessment of the core technologies required to ensure that the
UK's industry maintains a competitive edge.
Falling sales are limiting the industry's ability to invest in product
development. International competition is becoming fiercer, and competitor
countries are becoming increasingly aggressive in their international
marketing efforts and providing additional support for their indigenous
industries.
In the face of a shrinking defence market, aerospace companies have
increasingly turned to civil activities, which are expected to show stronger
longer-term growth once the airline industry recovers. Aircraft
manufacturers are continuing to forecast demand for up to 8,000 new
airliners during the next 15 years.
But the SBAC emphasises that aerospace companies will need to invest heavily
in new technologies at a time when the costs of product development are
growing by between 5 and 10 per cent a year above inflation. 'Investment can
only come from the return on sales, which, during the current recession, are
being squeezed,' it adds.
At the same time, there is a close link between the civil and military sides
of the UK aerospace business. Reductions in defence activities (a fall of
between 10 and 15 per cent in Ministry of Defence equipment expenditure is
expected over the next few years, coupled with similar falls in Europe and
the US) are bound to have a negative impact on commercial aerospace
operations.
'The forecast reductions in overall defence expenditure will affect
competitiveness throughout the aerospace industry, because reduced business
levels drive up production costs and essential overheads, such as the
maintenance of major research and test facilities,' warns the SBAC. To adapt
to the new circumstances in the defence market and the commercial aerospace
slump, the industry is adopting a series of options, including
consolidation, greater collaboration, globalisation, or acquisition as has
been the case this year with the TI Group's hostile bid for Dowty, the
aerospace components maker.
But the industry is also calling for the government to show more robust
support by encouraging expansion of the civil aerospace sector and by
increasing investment in new space and other civil projects. Additionally,
the industry would like to see government launch funds for civil aerospace
projects, expanded to include equipment and avionics, as well as backing for
large aerospace companies considering investment in fields outside their
traditional activities.
The industry also argues that a government policy is needed on defence
diversification, to study possible conversions from defence to civil
activities. Above all, the UK industry believes a dialogue between companies
and the government has become vital, to ensure that the country maintains
the optimum defence industrial base and leading-edge technological
competence in spite of the current wave of restructuring.

Airforce suppliers are in a murderous mood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

WITH DOUBTS hanging over almost all new combat jet projects, military
aircraft manufacturers are fighting bitter and sometimes dirty battles to
secure export orders for their current-generation aircraft.
Since the Gulf war, most of the trophies have gone to the US, at the expense
of the European industry. McDonnell Douglas's recent deal with Finland for
64 F/A-18 fighters, valued at between Dollars 2bn and Dollars 3bn and
matched by industrial offsets for the full value of the sale, was a
politically significant breakthrough in a neutral country.
The aircraft to be replaced were Russian MiG-21s and Swedish Drakens. The
Swedes had high hopes for their new JAS 39 Gripen, the French equally so for
Dassault Aviation's upgraded export jet, the Mirage 2000-5. Dassault
described the decision as 'surprising'.
The deal followed the confirmation last year of a Swiss decision in favour
of the F/A-18 - although that deal, worth some Dollars 2.4bn including
spares, is now due to go to a referendum. The Swiss authorities originally
opted for the F/A-18 in 1988 over the Mirage 2000 and General Dynamics'
F-16, but then ordered a re-evaluation, with the Russian MiG-29 and Su-27
also joining in the contest.
McDonnell Douglas has been through similar re-appraisals over the F/A-18
before - winning in Spain in 1983 and losing last year in South Korea to the
F-16, a 120-aircraft deal worth more than Dollars 5bn. Although the F/A-18
is still some way from rivalling the success of the F-16 in Europe, the
Middle East and Asia, McDonnell Douglas hopes to export between 270 and 470
more over the next five years.
The Swiss and Finnish decisions were a big setback for Dassault, which was
looking to these countries to bring a revival in its export business,
flagging since the mid-1980s. After the failure of the Mirage 4000, a
twin-jet aircraft developed with its own money, it has yet to find a
customer for the 2000-5 version of the Mirage, which it has equipped with a
new look-down radar to take on US competition in world markets. The company
has not clinched an export deal for combat aircraft since 1988, and that
deal - with Jordan - has since been suspended.
Dassault has now set its sights on more controversial targets - Taiwan,
where the US has for the past decade been unwilling to sell advanced
fighters, and Pakistan, where an argument over nuclear weapons development
stands in the way of more deliveries of US F-16s.
Disappointments are not confined to the French. Hopes for the
Anglo-German-Italian Tornado - except for the Saudi deal under way since
1986 - have been unfulfilled. Provisional deals with Jordan, Oman and
Malaysia all fell through, although in the latter two cases they were
substituted by sales of British Aerospace Hawk fighter/trainers. A new
contest is now under way in Malaysia, with a proposal for leasing Tornados
through the RAF put forward in a competition against the F/A-18, F-16,
Mirage 2000 and MiG-29.
BAe has been kept waiting anxiously for confirmation of a further sale of 48
Tornados to the Saudis agreed in principle four years ago, while McDonnell
Douglas has been waiting for US administration approval to sell the Saudis
72 more F-15 fighters - both deals vital to the respective manufacturers'
production plans. Budgetary pressures in Saudi Arabia following the Gulf war
have added to the tension over new contracts. A further deal in prospect
involves the replacements for more than 100 ageing Saudi F-5 fighters, with
the F/A-18 and F-16 both likely contenders.
Overall sales of front-line combat jets can be expected to decline as the
F-15/F-16 generation comes to an end, giving way to a sparser generation of
more expensive aircraft. However, the market for light fighters such as the
Hawk and the Italian-Brazilian AMX is expected to increase.
Possibly never have so many questions been raised about military aircraft
programmes as now, in the light of changing defence policies and tough
spending constraints. The questions involve numbers, specifications, timing
and in some instances the overall viability of projects already well under
way.
A sobering blow was struck early last year with the US decision to cancel
the A-12 naval attack aircraft being developed jointly by McDonnell Douglas
and General Dynamics, a Dollars 52bn project. This has been followed by a
reduction in the programme for Northrop's extraordinary B-2 stealth bomber
to 20 aircraft, compared with an original plan for 132. The bombers will now
work out at some Dollars 2.2bn apiece.
The F-22 being developed by Lockheed, Boeing and General Dynamics, chosen
last year to succeed the F-15 as the top-of-the-range US Air Force fighter,
has been protected in US budget plans, as has the McDonnell Douglas C-17
heavy transport aircraft. But other plans are subject to a battle over
priorities. They include the navy's AX requirement (in lieu of the cancelled
A-12) and the USAF's need for a new or upgraded multi-role fighter to
succeed the current F-16.
France's Rafale, being developed at Dassault both for navy and air force
use, has suffered a revision since the French experience with single-seat
Jaguar ground-attack fighters in the Gulf conflict. The French air force has
switched its emphasis to two-seat versions and has put back delivery plans.
The first air force Rafale squadrons are not now due to be formed until the
early 2000s.
After taking separate paths in the mid-1980s, when the French broke away
from the European Fighter Aircraft project, BAe and Dassault have agreed to
undertake joint research on the following generation of aircraft, planned
for around the year 2020. BAe has also agreed with its Harrier partner
McDonnell Douglas to undertake feasibility studies on a supersonic jump jet.
In the world market, US and European manufacturers will have to look to new
rivals in the next century.
A recent UK Ministry of Defence assessment foresaw that indigenous combat
aircraft production capabilities would to be limited to five Asian countries
up to 2005 - China, India, Japan, Taiwan and Israel, all dependent on
technical and/or financial assistance. After that date they could be joined
by Indonesia, Pakistan, Singapore and Iran - and Japan would by then be
fully self-sufficient.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (13): The great trek begins - Reforms
ease air links with South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

WHEN Richard Branson, owner of Virgin Airlines, visited South Africa last
March, he was effusively welcomed as the man who was going to liberate the
South African traveller from high airline prices.
Things haven't quite turned out that way, with Virgin still struggling to
get the arrival slots at Heathrow necessary to operate a service to South
Africa. These difficulties aside, the fanfare which accompanied Branson's
visit was instructive, testifying to a public hitherto starved of discount
air-fares.
Ironically, though it was Virgin which created most hype about the prospect
of cut-price rates, it has been the existing carriers who have started to
deliver the goods. Nothing symbolised this more clearly than the recent
announcement by British Airways that it was introducing a return
Johannesburg-London fare of R1,992, a price which South African Airways
(SAA) soon matched. A year ago bottom of the range prices for the same route
were about R3,200. Lufthansa and KLM have also been offering heavily
discounted fares to Europe.
These developments are all a function of the liberalisation of South
Africa's international aviation policy, announced in April by Dr Piet
Welgemoed, Minister of Transport. The main features of the policy,
concerning scheduled services, are the deregulation of tariff control,
allowing multiple designation of carriers on specific routes, allowing
flexibility of provision by designated carriers to match demand and
promoting Cape Town and Durban as alternative gateways to the country from
Johannesburg. Charter flights will also be encouraged far more than in the
past.
The new policy has economic and political roots and reflects developments in
the domestic and international aviation markets. The economic impetus arose
from the shift in government policy, evident for the past few years, to
encourage greater competition in the economy through deregulation and to
place the economy on a more market-oriented footing.
This thinking had already been reflected in the deregulation of the domestic
aviation industry which took effect in July 1991. This allows for any
airline that has suitable aircraft, and is able to maintain and operate them
safely, to be allowed to compete with SAA. Also, with SAA now part of a
company (Transnet) operating on commercial lines, a clearer distinction was
required between the national interest and SAA's interests.
The government has also been persuaded that a liberalisation of
international aviation policies will stimulate tourism and trade, and hence
economic growth, job creation and the earning of foreign exchange.
The main catalyst for change, however, was politics. So long as South Africa
remained the political polecat of the world, with many markets closed to it,
the government was obviously going to maintain a highly regulated policy
environment which protected SAA's financial viability. All of this changed,
however, with the start of political reforms in February 1990 and South
Africa's subsequent return to respectability.
A glance at the apron of Jan Smuts airport in Johannesburg confirms this
changed status. Since mid-1991, 10 new airlines have started flying to South
Africa - new entrants include Cathay Pacific, Singapore Airlines, Qantas and
China Airlines - bringing the total to more than 30 with a further 25
applications pending. This represents considerable competition for a fairly
small market - less than 1 per cent of the world total - in less than
perfect health. The total number of passengers flown by SAA in fiscal 1992
declined to 4.93m from 5.05m the previous year driving SAA into a loss
position for the year. The exact figures are not disclosed. SAA made an
estimated R60m loss in 1991 after profits of R133m in 1989 and R63m in 1990.
The new entrants into the market have been mirrored by the increased
destinations to which SAA is now flying. The most significant developments
here have been SAA again getting permission to overfly Africa to Europe, a
right withdrawn in 1963; the resumption of flights to New York, banned in
1986; and the reintroduction of flights to Australia, where landing rights
were withdrawn in 1987. Other new destinations include Luanda, Cairo, Milan,
Singapore and Bangkok.
These developments place SAA in the fairly unusual position, in the
international context, of needing to expand its fleet. It has taken delivery
of two of the four Boeing 747 400s on order and four of the seven Airbus
A320s.
While passengers enjoy the fruits of deregulation in the form of lower
airfares, they will soon have to get used to higher airport charges as the
country's nine airports and air traffic and navigation services are
commercialised into two separate state-owned companies. These services
currently cost the state about R200m per year and income does not cover
costs.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (9): Gulf war set a new pattern -
Helicopters' military potential is widening
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HELICOPTERS are not only versatile but also surprisingly robust machines -
and that is their curse as well as their blessing.
When civil operators or defence ministries want to trim non-essential
spending, replacement purchases of helicopters can nearly always be put off.
Take the Wessex, a British version of the Sikorsky S-58, dating from the
early 1960s and used by the RAF for transport and search and rescue. It is
20 years since it merited an entry in Jane's All the World's Aircraft, but
the Wessex is still in service and could well be 35 years old before it is
retired.
Delays in new orders, particularly from the military, are the constant
frustration of US and European helicopter manufacturers. In the longer term,
prospects for military helicopters would appear to be bright, at least in
comparison with most other defence equipment sectors. Helicopters proved
their worth on the modern battlefield during the land campaign to recover
Kuwait in early 1991 - and as happened when they were used by US forces in
Vietnam, revealed new potentialities. The US AH-64 Apache found another role
when it rounded up Iraqi prisoners.
In future, the helicopter's usefulness should increase with the remodelling
and reduction of forces, particularly in order to move troops rapidly.
In the short term, however, industry analysts expect a fall in deliveries of
military helicopters, which have been running at a rate of about 500-600 a
year excluding the former communist countries. This is despite signs of
demand from some developing countries.
The civil market, where total sales run at about 1,000 a year including
about 400 very light helicopters, is expected to show some increase. In the
small helicopter sector, there is a move towards twin-engined rather than
single-engined models, and in the offshore industry the trend is towards
larger helicopters. However, growth is not expected to be spectacular.
Military orders will continue to provide the industry's backbone on both
sides of the Atlantic. Despite the lessons from the Gulf conflict, both the
US and the leading European nations are taking their time to decide on their
future helicopter needs following the collapse of the Soviet military bloc.
The new RAH-66 Comanche armed scout helicopter, a programme which Boeing and
Sikorsky won only last year in a competition against the other two US
manufacturers, McDonnell Douglas and Bell Helicopter Textron, has been put
on the shelf. Development of prototypes is continuing, but the Pentagon has
put off production to an unspecified date, leaving the US Army to make do
with an ungraded fleet of Apache and OH-58 Kiowa aircraft, the latter
originally developed in the 1960s.
Another major US project, the tilt-rotor V-22 Osprey, a hybrid between a
helicopter and a fixed-wing aeroplane being developed by Bell and Boeing,
was 'killed' and then - in a way that only ever seems to happen in the US -
brought back to life. In the face of a strong congressional lobby, the
Pentagon agreed in July to allocate Dollars 1.5bn towards the cost of an
initial six production versions. But there is no commitment to follow this
up with purchases for the US Marines.
Elsewhere, projects have been put back. The NH-90 military utility and naval
helicopter, involving France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, has been
leading a precarious existence, with the French government balking at
development costs. Following an agreement in May to award a Dollars 1.7bn
development contract, France has postponed planned deliveries of the army
version by two years to the beginning of the next century, in the meantime
extending the life of current Puma models.
The Franco-German Tiger, an anti-tank and support helicopter, has suffered a
similar fate, with both partners delaying initial deliveries by two years.
The UK, whose joint project to build a light attack helicopter with Italy,
Spain and the Netherlands predictably collapsed in 1990, is due to invite
tenders this October for an anti-tank helicopter. That, too, might be
delayed.
The Ministry of Defence is insisting on holding a competition despite
pressure within the army to opt for an immediate purchase of McDonnell
Douglas's Apache. Rivals to the latest Apache model, which would be
assembled by Westland in the UK, are the Eurocopter Tiger and a version of
Bell's AH-IW Supercobra, known as the Cobra Venom. British Aerospace
announced in February a preliminary agreement to study collaboration on the
Tiger for the British army, and GEC Avionics is heading the Cobra Venom bid
with Bell.
The MoD aims to sign a contract in mid-1994. Eventually it is expected to
buy about 125 of the anti-tank helicopters, for a value expected to be more
than Pounds 2bn. Current plans are that the army should start operating the
helicopters in 1997, but the ministry has told manufacturers this target
'may not be compatible with the most cost-effective solution'. A later date
might increase the Tiger's chances.
Doubts about the future of the Anglo-Italian EH101, a three-engined
helicopter designed for naval, utility and civilian uses, were lifted a year
ago when the UK government placed a Pounds 1.5bn contract with IBM of the US
to manage the supply of 44 EH101 Merlins for the Royal Navy. IBM had bid for
the contract in collaboration with Westland, which has been developing the
EH101 airframe with Agusta of Italy.
The decision to appoint a prime contractor reflected concerns about the
timing and cost of the programme. The helicopter has been under development
since 1984. In 1985 it was expected to be in service in 1990, although the
House of Commons defence committee ventured to suggest even then that this
might be 'slightly delayed'. The EH101 is now due to be operating in the
second half of the decade. Westland foresees a potential world market for
between 550 and 750 units. But anticipated Canadian orders and further UK
purchases for troop transport have both been under question.
Problems for western European and US helicopter companies are now
accentuated by potential rivalry from the two ex-Soviet producers, Mil and
Kazov, possibly with western partners.
The number of competing producers has been reduced through the formal
setting up of Eurocopter in January, bringing together the helicopter
operations of France's Aerospatiale and Germany's MBB. The new company can
lay claim to being the world's largest manufacturer of civil helicopters,
but is still heavily dependent on the NH90 and Tiger military programmes.
Closer links between Westland and Agusta could form a second European
manufacturing 'pole'. The US continues with four manufacturers (excluding
the very light sector), but this may not last.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (10): Many are destined to disappear -
Components Suppliers - Paul Betts reports that the thousands of component
manufacturers are the main casualties of the recession and defence cuts.
Boeing, the world's biggest builder of commercial jets, finds dual sourcing
is becoming too costly and is therefore reducing the number of its suppliers
</HEADLINE>

THE AEROSPACE industry is structured like a pyramid, Mr Larry Clarkson,
Boeing's vice-president of planning and international development, recently
noted.
At the top are the large aircraft manufacturers - Boeing, Airbus, McDonnell
Douglas, British Aerospace, Fokker and the Russians. Below them are more
than 200 major aerospace structure and assembly suppliers. And at the lower
end of the pyramid are many thousands of companies responsible for building
smaller but critical parts for aircraft.
These many aerospace components manufacturers have found life even more
difficult than the prime manufacturers in the current down cycle. The
profound changes caused by the structural decline in defence activities and
the financial slump in commercial aviation is likely to lead to significant
changes in the relationship between prime contractors and their suppliers.
Boeing, the world's largest manufacturer of commercial jets, says it is
already reducing its suppliers. 'Until recently, in many cases we had two or
more suppliers providing the same component.
The fact is dual sourcing is very expensive and we have had to find ways to
be more and more competitive,' Mr Clarkson explained.
The changing relationship with the prime contractors coupled with the
uncertainty of the market is now speeding up the trend towards greater
consolidation in the aerospace components sector as well as prompting most
companies to increase their presence in the commercial side of the business
to offset the decline in defence activities.
The successful takeover this year of Dowty, the UK aerospace components and
information technology company, by TI Group, the British specialist
engineering concern, is an example of this trend. One of the attractions of
Dowty for TI was the possibility of integrating and merging the two
companies' aerospace activities to create a business with annual sales of
Pounds 400m and a more competitive critical mass.
Smiths Industries, another leading UK aerospace components supplier, has
been in talks with the Collins Avionics division of Rockwell International
of the US to create an important avionics partnership.
The idea is to create a third force in the commercial avionics sector to
compete against Honeywell, the US company which is the current market leader
in this sector, and against the French Sextant avionics group.
The move would rationalise the commercial aircraft avionics business along
the same lines as the other main sectors of the commercial aerospace
industry dominated by three airframe manufacturers (Boeing, Airbus and
McDonnell Douglas) and three engine makers (General Electric, Pratt &amp;
Whitney and Rolls-Royce).
The industry argues that there is only room in this market for three groups
to provide the avionic systems for the flight decks of commercial airliners.
Honeywell already controls about 35 per cent of the world market and is
dominant on McDonnell Douglas aircraft. In France, Aerospatiale has merged
its avionics activities with those of Thomson CSF to form the Sextant group
which is the dominant supplier of European Airbus airliners. The partnership
between Smiths and Collins is expected to concentrate on winning business
from Boeing which makes up about 55 per cent of the world airliner market.
All the leading aerospace equipment suppliers have been forced to develop a
global presence to survive in the business. All the large UK companies in
this sector, including the General Electric Company (GEC), Smiths, Dowty and
Lucas Aerospace, have become global players producing equipment not only for
the UK aerospace industry but for aircraft and engine manufacturers
throughout Europe and the US.
Mr Antony Edwards, managing director of Lucas and last year's president of
the Society of British Aerospace Companies (SBAC), explained that Lucas saw
in the early 1980s that the company was much too dependent on two major
customers: Rolls-Royce and the UK Government.
He said that while nurturing these important customers, the company set
about broadening its customer portfolio, concentrating on the US, which
accounts for about 70 per cent of the western world aerospace market.
'But to succeed in the US, particularly in the military market, it was
necessary to have manufacturing facilities on shore.
After a planned acquisition programme, 40 per cent of our sales now
originate from our own US operations,' he said in a recent speech. He added
a similar process was undertaken in Europe through acquisitions and joint
ventures to give Lucas substantial manufacturing operations in France,
Germany and Spain as well as in the UK and the US.
Lucas is just one example. GEC, Dowty and and Smiths have all taken the same
route and own a wide range of companies in the US.
The French Thomson CSF group has been equally active in attempting to build
up its presence in the US market through acquisitions and partnerships. This
trend is now likely to accelerate in combination with greater transnational
concentration in the industry as prime contractors and other aerospace
components customers continue to reduce the number of their suppliers.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (8): Sales remain grounded - Aero engine
makers are in a grim mood, Paul Betts finds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVEN by its own cut-throat standards, the aero-engine industry has been
going through a particularly rough patch during the last year.
The decline of military sales in the post Cold War defence market and the
lingering recession in the civil side of the business have taken their toll
on all the leading aero-engine manufacturers.
Profits have slumped, restructuring has intensified in a drive to cut costs
and increase competitiveness, while research and development spending on
future engines has remained high.
To win new engine orders in the current depressed market, the big three
aero-engine makers (General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney in the US and
Rolls-Royce in the UK) have been forced to make hefty concessions and offer
enlightened terms to attract customers.
'We must stop killing ourselves with our crazy pricing structure,' remarked
Mr Brian Rowe, the head of GE's aero-engine operations during a visit to the
big US company's plant in Cincinnati. 'We are not only having to give away
new engines but we are now having to make deals with airlines on spare
parts. That's how tough it is,' he added.
Sales of spare parts have traditionally been a large source of profit for
engine manufacturers. But the slump in air travel caused by the Gulf crisis
last year and the subsequent recession in many western markets has had an
inevitable impact on the spares business.
There are now signs that air traffic is recovering, but airlines are still
financially squeezed and a significant pick-up in the aircraft and engine
ordering cycle is not expected by the industry until later next year or
perhaps not before 1994.
During the past 12 months even small orders have provoked big battles. Some
have ended in court. When Malev, the Hungarian airline, cancelled a Pratt &amp;
Whitney engine order for GE engines to power two Boeing aircraft, Pratt took
legal action. An even bigger row erupted when British Airways decided to buy
GE rather than Rolls-Royce engines to power its new fleet of Boeing 777
widebody jets.
The combined pressures of the market and the frustration of the European
Airbus consortium over its repeated failure to win an order from BA prompted
Mr Jean Pierson, the Airbus chairman, to attack the BA deal with Boeing and
GE. Airbus asked the European Commission to investigate the deal but
ultimately decided not to file a formal complaint. BA, Boeing and GE all
rejected allegations of foul play.
The BA deal eloquently reflected the current battle in the aero-engine
market focused on the new large commercial engines being developed by all
three manufacturers in partnerships with other second tier engine makers.
These partnerships are designed to help reduce the financial risks of
developing these new engines.
GE is spending about Dollars 1.5bn to develop its new GE90 heavy thrust
engine which was chosen by BA for its Boeing 777 fleet. Rolls-Royce is
investing around Pounds 400m to develop a large thrust version of its RB211
engine family called the Trent. And Pratt &amp; Whitney is also investing
heavily in the development of the PW4000.
Widebody aircraft are forecast to absorb an increasingly large share of the
commercial jet market during the next 20 years. Airbus expects the average
aircraft size to grow from around 174 seats today to 241 seats by 2012.
The battle for this important new market has so far been even. Pratt took an
early lead by winning the first big Boeing 777 engine orders from United
Airlines and All Nippon Airways. GE struck back by winning the BA order and
Rolls-Royce subsequently retaliated by clinching Boeing 777 orders from
Emirates, the Dubai-based airline, and Cathay Pacific, the Hong-Kong
carrier.
The problem for engine manufacturers is that the development costs of new
commercial engine programmes take much longer to recoup than those of an
airframe. In the case of an airframe, payback can come in around seven
years; for an engine, the figure is between 10 to 15 years.
For this reason, the industry believes that the leading engine manufacturers
will be forced into forging even broader collaborations than their existing
risk-sharing partnerships on specific engine programmes.
GE has already established a long and fruitful alliance with Snecma, the
French state-controlled aero-engine group. Pratt, more recently, has linked
up with Motoren-und-Turbinen Union (MTU), the aero-engine arm of Deutsche
Aerospace. Rolls-Royce has also formed a joint engine venture with BMW of
Germany.
However, some industry experts believe it will be eventually necessary for
the big three engine makers to consider some form of wide-ranging alliance
because they argue that three large manufacturers are too many for the
market to sustain.
Rolls-Royce, which broke off a partnership with GEin 1986, disagrees and has
made it clear it is not seeking strategic alliances with either GE or Pratt,
its two principal and larger US competitors.
Instead, the UK group appears determined to 'go it alone' and to continue to
broaden its market base to secure a 30 per cent share of the commercial jet
engine market by the middle of the decade. To this end, the UK company has
shown an interest in possibly investing in a large minority stake in the US
Allison engine company. This would resurrect Rolls-Royce's presence in the
large turboprop, small and medium turboshaft and small jet sectors in which
the UK company was once active.
But if Rolls-Royce is ruling out any wide-ranging association with one of
its main US competitors in the aero-engine business, it has decided to forge
a 15-year partnership in the industrial power generation sector with
Westinghouse of the US. The agreement reached with Westinghouse in June is
consistent with the UK company's efforts to broaden its overall industrial
base to compete more strongly with its two rival US aero-engine
manufacturers, both of which are part of much larger diversified industrial
groups.
The first important move by Rolls-Royce to increase its power generation
activities was the acquisition three years ago of Northern Engineering
Industries (NEI), the UK power equipment supplier. This diversification
strategy helped Rolls-Royce, far more dependent on aero-engines than GE or
Pratt, to ride through the current cyclical slump in the commercial
aero-engine market and the decline in military aero-engine activity.
Industrial power accounted for 42 per cent of the UK company's Pounds 3.5bn
sales last year and made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 73m compared with a
Pounds 6m loss by the aerospace division. But to make headway in the world
market and increase the share of its industrial power operations to 50 per
cent of group turnover, Rolls-Royce decided it needed to negotiate a
partnership with Westinghouse, the traditional rival of GE in the industrial
power generation business.
The decline in the military aerospace business has now put additional
pressure on aero-engine manufacturers to concentrate increasingly on
commercial jet engine and industrial power operations. Although the civil
market is still struggling because of the recession and the financial
problems of airlines, the industry remains confident it will recover.
It also expects new markets to emerge including the vast potential of the
Commonwealth of Independent States, the former Soviet Union anxious to
develop strong ties with western aerospace partners, and the replacement of
older aircraft with new more environmentally friendly jets. The challenge
for aero-engine manufacturers is to pull through the current recession to
cash in eventually on a commercial jet engine market with sales forecast to
total about Dollars 200bn over the next 20 years.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (7): The Russians are coming -
Commercial rivalry is flowering in space
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALMOST HIDDEN in the long list of space collaborations agreed in June by
Presidents Bush and Yeltsin at their Washington summit was one that could
have more economic impact than the rest put together: Russia can now bid for
contracts to launch US-built telecommunications satellites.
At a stroke, Russia could become the most powerful recent entrant into an
industry that has attracted the interest of many countries. Its impact will
be all the greater because many in the list of hopefuls, such as Japan and
Brazil, have encountered technical and budgetary problems or trade barriers
that have slowed their progress towards commercial sale of launches.
Russia is in a good position to compete with established launch
organisations. It has six different rocket launchers on offer.
The biggest, the Proton, can lift large satellites into geostationary
orbits, which is usually necessary for telecommunications and satellite
broadcasting.
Russia could make its presence felt quickly, driven by a need for hard
currency and the immediate availability of its technology.
It has already this year offered Proton to Inmarsat, the international
consortium which operates satellites for mobile communications.
However, obstacles still remain in the path of the Russian Space Agency.
Apart from the economic instability, the main rocket launch site is in
another country, Kazakhstan, which has set up its own space agency. Progress
has been made in recent weeks. In June, the two apparently came to an
agreement over the joint use of Baikonur.
If Russia is on the point of joining an elite group of nations which can
offer commercial launches, it will soon find itself competing with some
well-entrenched opposition.
Ariane is the world's most successful commercial satellite launcher.
Operated by the French-led Arianespace consortium, it claims to have
launched more than three quarters of the world's commercial satellites.
The company last year had sales of FFr5.87bn, is profitable and is designing
the next generation of launch vehicle, the Ariane V. The first launch is
expected in 1995 with commercial operations set to start a year later.
Arianespace's biggest rivals are in the fragmented US market. Seven years
ago there were only two serious contenders in the space launch business: the
US Space Shuttle, built by Nasa, and Ariane.
Then came the Challenger disaster in 1986 and the announcement by Nasa that
the Space Shuttle not be used for commercial space launches.
A flood of launch orders for the private sector followed. Ariane was the
main beneficiary, but three US defence companies also picked up business:
Martin Marietta, McDonnell-Douglas and General Dynamics. Partly as a result
of their late entry into the business, however, the US companies lag far
behind Ariane in the value of commercial orders they are winning today.
They have also been cushioned from the need to rely on commercial orders by
defence contracts.
McDonnell-Douglas, for example, is still launching satellites for the US
military's Global Positioning System, a network of satellites that allowed
allied forces to navigate across the featureless desert in the Gulf war.
Of the company's 11 launches this year, only three are commercial. 'Could we
afford to stand on our own without the military? I don't think so,' says one
senior executive at McDonnell-Douglas.
The three US companies might find it hard to reduce their dependence on the
military, where they are protected from foreign competition, by plunging
further into the civil sector.
Prices there threaten to reach new lows as the likes of China and Russia
enter the fray. Typical of the fall in launch costs brought by more
competition is the Chinese Long March III rocket. This month it is scheduled
to take into orbit an Australian communications satellite at a cost of about
Dollars 30m, compared with more than Dollars 50m for a US or Ariane launch.
China is not the only country attracted by the possibility of chunky dollar
earnings from space. Governments also like the idea because they believe it
will help in developing missiles.
Rocket technology is basically simple - to create a controlled explosion at
one end of a metal tube - and available in theory without recourse to the
latest in western high technology.
So there are many countries at various stages in the race to build
launchers.
India launched a satellite in May shortly after Washington imposed limited
sanctions against the Russian and Indian space organisations. The US
objected to Russia's proposed sale of rocket technology which India says is
for its space programme but the US thinks could be used for ballistic
missiles.
Japan has intended to test launch its H-2 rocket in February next year. But
Japan has chosen an unusually advanced design and has had persistent
difficulties in test firings. Israel whose Jericho 2 military missile has
been converted for space use as the Shavit and has successfully launched
small test satellites.
Brazil, which has its Veiculo Lancador de Satellites (VLS) booster, based on
the Sonda 4 rocket. Its development has been stifled by technical and
budgetary problems and Western technology-transfer controls.
Other countries reported to have space programmes include Iraq, North Korea
and Argentina.
That such programmes will find commercial customers is unquestioned. The
satellite services market is an immature industry that is growing quickly
despite the worldwide economic slowdown.
Telecommunications is still by far the largest area of application for civil
satellites. New customers include third world countries eager to leapfrog
the technology of copper cabling. Satellite telecommunications appeals to
physically large countries, perhaps with many islands or difficult terrain,
where cabling would be expensive.
In June, a McDonnell-Douglas rocket launched Indonesia's fourth
telecommunications satellite in its second launch programme. The third
launch programme is already scheduled for the mid-1990s.
Satellite broadcasting is a much smaller business, but growing quickly
thanks partly to European deregulation.
Observation satellites are among the industry's favourites for sharp growth
through the 1990s. They are used to forecast weather, keep track of changing
surface temperature and other environmental applications.
Importantly, earth observation from space is seen by the military as a
better value for money than thinly spread ground personnel.
More emphasis is being placed on earth observation in the post-Cold War
world where the US, UK and France increasingly see their roles as global.
The UK defence White Paper in July made explicit the UK's interest in
widening its defence activities to more than just Europe and the North
Atlantic.
For that reason, in the US satellites are taking an increasing proportion of
defence spending. 'The space budget is holding steady while other budgets
are falling', says the US Air Force space procurement division in Los
Angeles.
And military cash means that the US launcher manufacturers can afford to
invest in new fuels, re-usable launchers and air-launched rockets. With
these developments they may be able to cut costs low enough eventually to
compete with the likes of Russia while maintaining the reliability of US and
Ariane launches.
This perhaps helps explain why the US launch industry is sanguine about the
threat of the Russian and Chinese launch industries: it can continue to rely
on defence contracts while developing the technology that will allow it one
day to compete for civil contracts on its own terms.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (2): Hopeful signs on the radar screen -
Commercial jet makers see a recovery after the turmoil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE world's commercial aircraft industry is confronted with a dichotomy: in
the short term it continues to face considerable turmoil but in the longer
term it remains optimistic that demand for airliners will recover and growth
will be strong.
Historically, the industry has always been highly cyclical. But the latest
down cycle has been particularly fierce and caused by a unique set of
circumstances.
It was preceded by a record breaking binge of new aircraft orders by
airlines in 1987, 1988 and 1989. A total of Dollars 90bn worth of new jet
orders were booked by western manufacturers in 1989 alone. Even after a drop
in the number of bookings last year, the total industry backlog of orders at
the end of 1991 amounted to Dollars 191bn and 3,158 aircraft. Such a trend
was clearly unsustainable.
It was followed by economic recession in North America and several parts of
Europe which had an inevitable impact on airline profits and new aircraft
orders. The situation was exacerbated by the Gulf crisis last year and its
profound impact on air travel. In the middle of all this, the end of the
Cold War provoked a decline in the defence aerospace market forcing
companies to rely increasingly on the commercial side of the business.
All this has created huge uncertainty in the jetliner market. Financially
pressed airlines have deferred orders and significantly cut capital
spending. Some 725 aircraft are lying idle in the Arizona desert. Aircraft
manufacturers have been forced to adapt to this new market situation by
reducing production of some of their jet programmes and cutting jobs. Even
on the most optimistic assumptions of longer term growth, manufacturers now
have more than sufficient capacity to meet future demand, says Mr Larry
Clarkson, vice president of planning and international development at
Boeing, the world's biggest manufacturer of commercial jets.
'Air travel may experience much stronger growth than we now project, but our
best guess today is that there is no foreseeable shortfall to 2010 in the
world's ability to manufacture commercial aircraft,' he noted recently. 'The
problem of excess capacity is even more troubling when you consider what's
happening on the military side of aerospace ..sophisticated industries are
in place and millions of jobs are at stake,' he added.
The contraction in the defence industry is expected to spawn new ventures in
commercial aerospace even though the market remains soft. 'It seems clear
that the growing problem of excess capacity and defence conversion will have
a huge impact on our industry over the next five to ten years,' Mr Clarkson
said. 'Within the next decade, we will probably see a change in both the
composition of the airframe manufacturers and the types of relationships
they have with suppliers,' he forecast.
One of the biggest problems facing the industry is the financing of new
aircraft orders. In its latest review of the world airline market, Boeing
says that airlines will have to turn increasingly to international capital
markets to finance future aircraft purchases.
More innovative financing will be required to fund future airline jet
requirements, especially since Japan, a significant source of aircraft
financing, has become reluctant to continue investing heavily in aircraft.
Indeed, the contribution of Japanese banks, trading companies and equity
investors in aircraft leases is expected to drop from between 55-65 per cent
of total commercial aircraft financing to barely 8-12 per cent over the next
few years, according to Boeing.
Despite all these difficulties, all three leading commercial aircraft
manufacturers - Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and the European Airbus consortium
 -remain confident of the longer term outlook for the industry with a
recovery of world air travel requiring some Dollars 850bn worth of new
aircraft between now and 2010.
'We estimate that to meet the demand for air travel some 12,000 new
airplanes will have to be delivered between now and 2010, at an average rate
of 500-600 aircraft per year,' says Mr Jean Pierson, the Airbus chairman.
But this market will be strongly dependent on airlines being willing to
replace part of their existing fleets. Mr Pierson expects that of the 12,000
new aircraft deliveries between now and 2010, about 7,000 will involve
replacement of old aircraft.
After world air travel declined last year for the first time in the history
of the jet aircraft, the manufacturers are now expecting it to grow by
between 4-5.5 per cent a year to the turn of the century. This growth
coupled with congestion problems on the ground at airports and in the air
because of inadequate air traffic control systems is expected to boost
demand especially for larger widebody aircraft.
Boeing is already well into the development of its new widebody twin engine
airliner, the 777, while the new Airbus A340 four engine long range aircraft
is due to enter service next year. While orders for smaller narrowbody
aircraft have fallen sharply during the last year, demand has been more
sustained for larger aircraft.
All three leading manufacturers are also studying plans to develop
ultra-large aircraft capable of transporting 600 to 800 passengers to enter
into airline service early in the next century. Up to now, the jumbo market
has been dominated by Boeing with the 747 series of airliners. But both
Airbus and McDonnell Douglas are planning to challenge Boeing in this niche
with new jumbos.
'I believe the design and development of these giant aircraft represents the
next great challenge for commercial aviation,' Mr Adam Brown, the planning
director of Airbus, told a aviation conference earlier this year.
Boeing is studing the possibility of stretching its 747 or building an
entirely new extra large aircraft. McDonnell Douglas has already announced
its intention to develop a double-decker four engine jumbo, the MD-12, if it
can find partners to invest in the project and sufficient airline launch
customers. Airbus has also been talking to airlines, especially in the
Asia-Pacific region, about a super jumbo.
All three manufacturers agree that the costs of developing a new generation
of large aircraft are so high that it is bound to involve widespread
international cooperation. All three have been seeking to interest Asian
aerospace companies to participate in the eventual development of ultra
large airliner programmes because the biggest market for such aircraft is
expected to be in the Asia-Pacific region, where air traffic is forecast to
continue showing above average growth.
McDonnell Douglas has been striving to negotiate an equity investment
agreement with Taiwan Aerospace, while Boeing and Airbus have been
discussing cooperation with the three Japanese manufacturers: Kawasaki Heavy
Industries, Fuji Heavy Industries and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.
The manufacturers, however, are also looking at the smaller end of the
airliner market. Boeing is expected to start later this year consulting
airlines on a new design of its 737 twin engine narrowbody jets which is
expected to involve a new wing and new engines. Airbus is studing the
possibility of launching a smaller 125-seat version of its A320 narrowbody
aircraft called the A319. McDonnell Douglas also has plans to develop a new
medium sized airliner to expand its family of commercial airliners.
But their long term expectations remain firmly fixed on the large airliner
market. All three are predicting that the average size of jets operated by
big international airlines will rise from around 174 seats to 241 seats over
the next 20 years. In the Asia-Pacific region, this is likely to be even
higher, to around 334 seats. In turn, this is expected to require the
delivery of substantial numbers of aircraft very much larger than anything
flying today.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (4): Price-cutting war becomes fiercer -
Airlines head for third year of losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AIRLINE industry is still suffering from the extended hangover of the
general economic recession and the air travel slump caused by the Gulf
conflict last year.
Although traffic showed signs of recovery during the first half of this
year, capacity is still outstripping passenger demand; and airlines are
engaged in a fierce fares discounting war, to maintain market share in
anticipation of an eventual rebound in business.
The International Air Transport Association (IATA) - the industry's trade
organisation, grouping more than 200 international airlines - has warned
that, for the third consecutive year, airlines are likely to report a big
loss on international scheduled services in 1992.
The latest estimates put the 1992 loss at around Dollars 2bn. This is not as
high as the record Dollars 4bn loss reported by the industry in 1991, the
worst year in the history of aviation, which followed a loss of Dollars
2.7bn in 1990; but it is still a disappointing and worrying performance.
'The financial recovery will be crucial to the ability of the airlines to
offer better services, more tailored to consumer needs,' warns Mr Gunter
Eser, IATA's outgoing director general. 'It is not a case of going from
famine to feast. It would be good to see the airlines achieving merely the
sort of return on their money invested that anybody could get by putting it
in the post office,' he adds.
After falling by 3 per cent last year - the first decline in air traffic
since the introduction of the jet aircraft - passenger traffic has increased
so far this year by 8 per cent and cargo by 4 per cent, compared with 1990,
the year before the slump provoked by the Gulf conflict. But this traffic
growth has not matched the rise in overall capacity, which is 12 per cent
higher than in 1990.
In a nutshell, the fundamental problem of the industry is that too many
aircraft are flying with empty seats. The response of most airlines to the
slow recovery in traffic has been to cut costs in an effort to improve
productivity. Nearly 50,000 jobs were lost in the industry in 1991 as a
result of restructuring. But these moves have not been sufficient to offset
the pressures of overcapacity in the market.
The financial problems of airlines, especially of the weaker carriers,
coupled with increasing liberalisation and deregulation in the industry, are
now expected to accelerate the general trend towards greater concentration
in the industry, as well as the possibility of more airline bankruptcies.
The last 18 months have seen a number of airlines disappear, including
famous names like Pan Am and Eastern, and younger ones like Air Europe.
Several US airlines are struggling under the protection of the US bankruptcy
laws. Others are scrambling to forge partnership and strategic alliances
with other airlines, to build up their critical mass and compete in an
increasingly global airline market.
Even a profitable airline such as British Airways has been anxious to
negotiate international partnerships to strengthen its overall competitive
position. BA , which has been actively looking for allies in Europe, the US
and the Asia Pacific region, successfully forged this summer a transatlantic
alliance with USAir, the sixth largest US carrier. BA will be investing
Dollars 750m in USAir to buy a 21 per cent voting stake as well as an equity
stake of up to 44 per cent in the American carrier. BA had earlier
unsuccessfully attempted to negotiate a merger with KLM Royal Dutch
Airlines. It has also indicated it was interested in taking a stake in
Qantas Airways, the Australian carrier.
After more than 10 years of deregulation in the US, the American industry is
already heavily concentrated around a handful of giant carriers, including,
among the three largest, American Airlines, Delta and United Airlines. These
carriers have now set their eyes firmly on expansion into the European
market, which will be opened up to much greater competition next year
following the recent approval of the European Commission's third package of
air transport liberalisation measures.
To respond to the challenge of giant US carriers - as well as large airlines
from the Asia Pacific region, which has continued to enjoy above average
traffic growth - the big European carriers believe it will be necessary for
them to grow even bigger.
'At present, there are at least 60 airlines in Europe that matter: that's 40
too many,' says Mr Bernard Attali, the chairman of the Air France group,
which in terms of annual turnover is Europe's biggest carrier.
But consolidation is increasingly worrying European air transport
regulators, who fear that this risks undermining the competition they are
seeking to encourage through liberalisation. But liberalisation in Europe
faces other obstacles. The two biggest are congestion in the skies, because
of inadequate air traffic control systems; and crowded airports. Both
threaten to squeeze out new entrants into the newly liberalised European air
transport market.
European governments are addressing the problem of air traffic control by
seeking to harmonise and modernise the different systems. But the process is
likely to take several years. In the meantime, air traffic control in Europe
remains extremely fragile. 'The situation is critical for our industry,'
says Mr Attali. 'You can't expect competition to work as long as there is
congestion,' he adds.
Crowded airports are another significant problem. The EC is attempting to
draw up regulations to ensure that new entrants can secure take-off and
landing slots at congested European airports like London Heathrow or
Frankfurt. But most EC member states are objecting to such a system, which
would include a proposal to confiscate slots from established carriers to
hand them over to new entrants.
The difficult financial situation of airlines and traffic growth
artificially constrained by insufficient or badly used infrastructure could
deprive the consumer of the benefits of liberalisation in Europe, the
industry warns.
'We are heading for a formidable battle,' Mr Attali says. 'Deregulation in
the EC will give consumers a good short-term deal with lower fares, but in
the longer term it could have perverse effects, as it has had in the US.'
Already the gap between low discounted fares and business or normal fares
has widened. Businessmen are becoming increasingly frustrated by the high
fares they pay to subsidise the discount business.
'Fed up with living in crowded skies and airports, the business traveller
will one day say enough is enough, and will try to cut back on air travel,'
says one international airline executive.
A decline in business travel would have severe implications for the
industry. Although businessmen account for only 20 per cent of all air
travel, they provide between 50-60 per cent of all airline revenues,
according to IATA estimates.
After three terrible years, the industry is clearly hoping that there will
eventually be a sharp recovery in traffic, as has been the case after
previous down cycles. But it can no longer rely on recovery alone to resolve
all its difficulties.
'If airlines want to survive in the longer term, they must behave like
entrepreneurs and like any other industry, and adapt capacity to match
demand,' argues Mr Eser.
As businesses, the airlines can no longer continue defying all the laws of
gravity.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (3): Too many choices - Short-haul jets
are worst hit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REGIONAL and commuter aircraft industry is undergoing a significant
shake-up. Of all commercial aircraft markets, it has been one of the worst
hit by the recession, the slowdown in air travel, and the financial troubles
of smaller airlines - the principal customers for regional jets and
turbopropeller commuter aircraft.
The slump has highlighted the fundamental structural problem of the
industry. Simply put, it is suffering from over-capacity with too many
manufacturers offering too many competing products.
For smaller regional jet-makers, the problem has been exacerbated by the
presence of the three large commercial aircraft manufacturers at the upper
end of the market.
Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, of the US, offer 100-seat versions of their
twin-engine narrow-body aircraft, the 737 and the MD80/90. The European
Airbus consortium is now studying the possibility of entering the 120-seater
jet market for the first time, by launching a new smaller derivative of its
A320 twinjet called the A319.
All this has led to an acceleration in efforts to rationalise the regional
airliner industry, especially in Europe. Some consolidation has already
begun. Bombardier of Canada absorbed Short Brothers of Northern Ireland and,
more recently, de Havilland of Canada, after a joint bid for the Canadian
group by Aerospatiale, the French aerospace company, and Alenia of Italy,
had been blocked by the European Commission. Aerospatiale and Alenia have
also pooled their resources to form the ATR regional turbopropeller aircraft
consortium.
But the current focus is on Fokker, the Dutch aircraft manufacturer, which
finally agreed this summer to a merger with Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), the
aerospace arm of Germany's Daimler-Benz group.
Dasa will acquire control of Fokker through a 51 per cent stake in a joint
holding company to form the basis of a new partnership in the regional
airliner sector. Fokker is expected to provide its marketing expertise, and
Dasa the necessary financial backing to support future regional airliner
programmes. Fokker has been working on plans to develop a smaller 70-seat
version of its Fokker 100 jet and eventually a larger 120- to 130-seat
derivative.
The agreement between Dasa and Fokker is also expected to set the stage for
a broad realignment of the European regional aircraft industry. Dasa has had
its eyes set on the regional jet business for the past two years, as part of
its long-term strategy to re-establish the German aerospace industry in a
leading position in commercial aircraft.
To this end, it formed last year a partnership with Aerospatiale and Alenia
to develop a new family of regional jets as well as to co-ordinate the three
companies' products and marketing networks in the commuter and regional
aircraft sector. The deal with Fokker, however, has clearly placed a large
question mark on the future of the earlier partnership agreed between Dasa,
Aerospatiale and Alenia.
But the Fokker transaction could ultimately lead to Aerospatiale and Alenia
joining the new German-Dutch partnership to form a broader European regional
aircraft consortium creating a similar sort of European consortium for
regional aircraft as the European Airbus large airliner manufacturing
consortium. This is bound to put additional pressure on other manufacturers,
especially British Aerospace (BAe), to speed up the search for partners or
perhaps consider joining forces with the proposed new European regional
aircraft consortium.
Tackling the problems of its loss-making regional aircraft activities has
become one of the top priorities of BAe's restructuring strategy. The UK
group has been attempting to negotiate a partnership with Japanese aerospace
companies in its regional aircraft business, and has also been talking to
Taiwan Aerospace and other manufacturers. The industry believes BAe could
ultimately withdraw from this business.
But while the industry is scrambling to restructure itself, it remains
confident of the longer-term growth prospects of the commuter and regional
jet market. Apart from the sustained requirement for smaller jets and
turbopropeller aircraft from developing countries, especially in the
Asia-Pacific region, demand is expected to increase in industrialised
countries as the airline industry continues to develop hub and spoke route
networks.
Airlines will thus require small regional and feeder aircraft operating at
high frequency to feed passengers to the major domestic and international
routes at their hub airports. Since deregulation 12 years ago, this has been
the case in the US, where a few strong carriers now dominate the market,
operating dense nationwide networks with frequent services using smaller
jets and commuter aircraft.
With the European Commission's third stage of airline liberalisation
starting next year, large European carriers are expected to intensify
efforts to open new hubs in other EC member states. This is likely to
provide a strong stimulus for the commuter and regional aircraft market.

FT  02 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Acquisition helps Dewhirst rise to Pounds
2.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEWHIRST, the clothing group, reported pre-tax profits near-trebled for the
half year to July 17 on the back of its acquisition of Slimma, which
supplies women's wear to Marks and Spencer.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 851,000 to Pounds 2.4m on increased sales
of Pounds 81.3m (Pounds 54.8m).
Mr Tim Dewhirst, chief executive, said: 'The six months' contribution from
Slimma was a substantial part of the improvement in sales and profits. Marks
and Spencer now accounts for more than 80 per cent of our sales.'
The company has terminated its contract with a Serbian company to make
clothes for Marks and Spencer from raw materials supplied by Dewhirst.
When imports from Serbia were prohibited under UN Resolution 757, the
Department of Trade and Industry granted Dewhirst an import licence to get
its materials back from Serbia.
Dewhirst had paid more than Pounds 750,000 to Genex, the Serbia-controlled
trade company, to set up the deal with the Serbian manufacturer.
However, Mr Dewhirst said the sum had been paid into a London account, which
was now frozen. 'As far as I am concerned the case is closed,' he said.
Since acquiring Slimma for Pounds 14.1m last year borrowings rose to about
Pounds 6m. That is expected to be wiped out by cash generation by the end of
the year. Interest payable rose to Pounds 365,000 (Pounds 306,000).
Earnings per share increased to 1.25p (0.59p) while the interim dividend is
raised to 0.32p (0.29p).

FT  02 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Catching the bus to engineer a rare market
event - Paul Cheeseright considers the sale of shares in Trinity Holdings
where banks have a large equity stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SINKING stock market evidently holds no terror for Trinity Holdings, the
specialist vehicle manufacturer. After a week in which the FT-SE 100 Index
declined more than 50 points, it announced its intention to apply for a
listing later this month.
With the market casting a jaundiced eye over even traditionally defensive
stocks, like breweries and food manufacturers, any listing would have looked
a bold move. The fact that it is for an engineering company makes the timing
look odder still.
The arrival on the market of engineering companies is in any case a rare
event. The last was Prospect Industries in May 1991. The sector, highly
exposed to the recession, has found little favour as investors have watched
another bout of painful restructuring and shrinking profits.
Made confident by its own expansion, Trinity is hoping to place shares worth
about Pounds 25m. The placing is arranged by Baring Brothers and brokered by
Albert E Sharp. The management expects to retain majority control of a
company with a likely capitalisation of about Pounds 80m.
Under the Dennis brand name, Trinity makes refuse collection vehicles and
chassis for fire engines, buses and coaches. Its Duple Metsec subsidiary
makes complete bus kits, sold in developing countries. Reliance Mercury
specialises in dock-handling and airport towing vehicles, while Carmichael
manufactures airport crash tenders.
For the Warwick-based group, with plants in Guildford, Halifax, Tipton and
Worcester, the simple fact of placing the shares may be more important than
immediate market performance.
The reason lies in its structure. The company was a subsidiary of Hestair
until 1989 when Hestair decided to concentrate on management services and
shed its engineering arm. That resulted in a Pounds 27.3m management buy-out
led by Mr Geoff Hollyhead, chairman and chief executive.
The new company began with three levels of debt - senior, mezzanine and
preference shares - totalling Pounds 23.8m. But what made the buy-out
idiosyncratic was that the bank consortium involved, headed by Citicorp
Investment and Bankers Trust, took 49 per cent of the equity, leaving the
management and employees with 51 per cent.
There is no suggestion that relations between the Trinity management and the
banks have ever been less than amiable and mutually supportive. And Trinity
has repaid Pounds 12m of its Pounds 16m senior debt, so that its total debt
burden, apart from overdrafts, stands now at Pounds 11.8m. This is made up
of the balance of the senior debt, Pounds 4m of mezzanine finance and Pounds
3.8m of preference shares.
Mr Hollyhead said the bank consortium was prepared to extend its loans
beyond the existing five year term, but the heavy equity holding of the
consortium and its consequent involvement in management decisions has left
Trinity slower on its feet than it might otherwise have been.
It is not yet clear exactly how much money Trinity will seek to raise, or on
what terms, but, provided the placing is a success, the overall effect will
be not only to widen its equity but also to wipe out its indebtedness.
The main elements of recent growth have been the acquisition of Reliance
Mercury and Carmichael, the activities of which, combined with those of
Duple Metsec, account for 27 per cent of Trinity's steadily increasing
turnover. At the same time new products have been introduced, notably a new
refuse collection vehicle and a new chassis for a medium-sized bus, the
Dart, now the best selling bus on the UK market.
Unit production at Trinity has been rising steadily since 1989 along with
turnover, which, in the year to January 1993, should top Pounds 100m, nearly
doubling that of the year to January 1990.
Profits before tax and interest payments to the bank consortium should this
year reach about Pounds 8m, against Pounds 5.4m in the January 1992 year and
Pounds 4m in the January 1990 year.
Since the buy-out, conditions in the refuse collection vehicle and bus and
coach markets have been discouraging. This has had less to do with recession
than the fall-out from government policies.
Abolition of grants to bus buyers, the privatisation of National Bus and the
deregulation of the bus industry have all contributed to a 50 per cent cut
in what Trinity estimates to be the normal level of bus and coach purchases.
The purchase of refuse collection vehicles has been 40 per cent down
nationally on normal buying patterns, largely because of the turmoil created
by pushing local authority services out to tender and the reluctance, under
those circumstances, to invest in replacement vehicles.
Believing that these two sectors will settle down after the organisational
changes, Trinity expects to increase production and, if it can hold its
market share, increase profits.

FT  02 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Astec (BSR) returns to the black with
Pounds 2.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASTEC (BSR), the Hong Kong-based and London-listed electronics company which
is 48.9 per cent owned by Emerson of the US, moved back into profit in the
first half of 1992 after cutting costs and trimming losses in its electronic
components division.
However, Mr George Tamke, chief executive, said yesterday that the company
plans to close its cellular telephone and telecommunications components
manufacturing business following a sharp decline in sales.
Pre-tax profits in the six months to June 28 totalled Pounds 2.2m or 0.6p
per share compared with losses of Pounds 2.7m or 0.93p per share.
Turnover declined just over 7 per cent, from Pounds 134.2m to Pounds 124.4m.
Despite the improvement, the interim dividend is again omitted.
The last pay-out was a 0.7p interim in 1990.
After excluding figures for a printed circuit board business and a small
Hong Kong-based travel business which have been sold, first half turnover
decreased by Pounds 9m to Pounds 117.1m.
Mr Tamke said the return to profitability reflected the company's strategy
of focusing more closely on its core power conversion business.
The electronics components division sustained a reduced operating loss of
Pounds 354,000 (Pounds 1.2m) on sales of Pounds 41.3m (Pounds 51.9m).
The company said the drop was almost entirely accounted for by a reduction
in the sales of transportable telephones and telecommunications components.
After considering alternatives for the troubled mobile phone business Mr
Tamke said that the company had recently decided to 'shut it down.'

FT  02 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Torday &amp; Carlisle loses Pounds 0.35m and
omits pay-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORDAY &amp; CARLISLE, the Newcastle-based engineer, yesterday passed its
interim dividend for the first time in almost a decade as it announced a
deficit of Pounds 353,000 pre-tax for the six months to June 30.
Turnover fell 10 per cent to Pounds 20.1m, and losses per share were reduced
from 6.3p to 3.1p.
The outcome compared with last time's losses of Pounds 90,000 before
exceptional restructuring charges of Pounds 544,000. Then, an interim
dividend of 1.5p was paid.
Mr Paul Torday, chief executive, hinted that payment of the full-year
dividend could depend on the sale of Oldham, the loss-making sign
subsidiary. 'If Oldham is not there, the remaining two businesses are . . .
cash generative and gearing will have come down. That is a completely
different scenario.'
Oldham, which maintains the neon signs in London's Piccadilly Circus, was
purchased just four years ago for Pounds 9m. In the period, the business
incurred losses of Pounds 972,000 (Pounds 869,000).
A main plank of Torday's successful defence last year against the hostile
Pounds 18.8m bid from rival engineer Dowding &amp; Mills had been its defence of
Oldham Signs.
However, the 'gentle economic recovery' expected for 1992 had not
materialised, Mr Torday said. Therefore the company, under the relatively
new chairmanship of Mr Peter Ryan, former deputy chairman of Davies &amp;
Newman, had decided to sell Oldham.
Diesel Marine International, the engine repair business, suffered a 30 per
cent drop in operating profits to Pounds 902,000. Mr Torday said the
shipping industry had been severely depressed in the first half, with
freight rates down by some 30 per cent in January.
However, the division has expanded into the automotive market. Mr Torday
said he expected this to be an increasingly important business.
Elfab-Hughes - which makes pressure relief and safety equipment - improved
operating profits by 24 per cent to Pounds 380,000 on steady sales.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Protests grow as big four review bankcharges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSUMERS' organisations and opposition politicians yesterday expressed
alarm at the possible introduction of new current account charges by the
high street banks. They warned that the banks would face serious
consequences if they acted together to make customers pay more.
None of the high street clearers would admit to having plans to end free
banking (if the customer remains in credit) in the near future, but all of
the big four high street banks said they were reviewing the situation.
Smaller banks indicated that they were less likely to introduce new current
account fees than the larger clearers. Royal Bank of Scotland, the fifth
largest UK bank, said it would not be ending free-if-in-credit banking for
its customers in the foreseeable future.
'Frankly we are amazed. The banks ought to be trying to get their costs down
by reducing their bad debts rather than by charging customers more,' an RBS
spokesman said.
At Westminster the Labour party yesterday stepped up the political pressure
on the banks not to raise charges in concert - and on the government to
intervene if they tried to do so - with a letter to Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, calling for an in-depth inquiry into banks' costs, charges and
services.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, argued there is a strong case for a
statutory code of practice instead of reliance on self-regulation.
He said: 'Customers - already facing rising charges in the last year - can
ill afford to pay more, especially when many charges are deducted without
prior billing and often the increased charges are not properly explained.'
The Office of Fair Trading, which last year accused high street banks of
being high handed and insensitive, said it would be watching carefully to
see whether the banks act in unison when introducing charges.
If new current account charges are introduced, the OFT would expect the
banks to provide their customers with full notification of the changes at an
early date. However, the move would not necessarily mean an automatic
investigation leading to referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Ms Jean Eaglesham of the Consumers Association, which also expressed fears
that the banks may jointly introduce charges, said: 'Whichever bank moves
first must expect to lose a vast number of its customers so our message to
the public is that if your bank brings in charges, then switch to another
one.'
Mr John Wriglesworth of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, a leading building society
specialist, said he believed building societies would benefit if banks
introduced new charges. He said: 'The high street banks are simply trying to
make the consumer pay for the money they lent to Robert Maxwell and their
other bad debts.'

FT  02 SEP 92 / 'Germany bond' plan to boost federal budget: Bonn seeks ways
to pay for costs of unification
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW financial instrument, the 'Germany bond', to help Bonn plug gaps
punched in the federal budget by the costs of unification, was suggested
yesterday by Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister.
The issue would offer interest earnings below market rates, but holders'
income would not be taxable, he said.
He also proposed that workers taking time off for sickness should work
overtime without pay to compensate. The money thus saved would go instead
towards care for the elderly.
The government, which has repeatedly promised that there will be no further
tax increases, is now searching desperately to find ways of raising revenues
through indirect methods.
The initial task is to fund the DM150bn (Pounds 53.7bn) pumped by Bonn each
year into the east of the country. But Bonn is also under pressure from the
Bundesbank, the central bank, to rein in public spending and reduce national
debt at a time when the economy is under strain because of recession abroad
and stagnation at home.
Germany's total public sector debt - DM1,170bn, or 41.7 per cent of gross
national product at the end of last year - is on target to hit 50 per cent
of GNP at the end of 1995, or DM2,000bn.
As Mr Waigel said yesterday at a meeting of the federal association of
taxpayers, some DM350bn of the total accounted for debts run up by the
former east German government and the Treuhand privatisation agency.
Accumulated debts of the railway system are also heading towards DM400bn.
Meanwhile, the state-subsidised health service will report a DM10bn deficit
this year alone.
Other revenue-raising ideas which have emerged in recent weeks include
motorway tolls or increased oil duties - hence more expensive petrol -
ostensibly to cover the cost of subsidising the railways. Health service
patients are also being asked to pay an extra DM3bn in charges to ease the
welfare system's deficits.
Mr Waigel's latest suggestions followed a much-derided idea from other
coalition politicians that high earners should be forced to buy non-interest
bearing bonds if they did not invest in east Germany.
While the minister said the idea was worth considering, he appeared
concerned about the effects of such a novel instrument on capital markets,
interest rates and on the standing of Germany in the markets.
But it should be examined, he told a meeting of the federal taxpayers'
association, together with other 'unconventional' measures - such as his own
version, the Germany bond.
The minister said such a low-interest offering, which would not be liable
for the 25 per cent withholding tax on investment income which takes effect
next January, could attract back to the 'homeland' some of the capital which
had been 'parked' outside Germany in recent months.
The government, forced to tax investment income by a constitutional court
ruling, introduced the new levy despite fears of capital fleeing into
Luxembourg and other relative tax-havens as the year's end approaches.
Mr Waigel said money raised by such an issue could be used to pay off
eastern Germany's old debts. His reference to the 'homeland' suggests an
appeal for a patriotic response from investors and taxpayers.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Hurricane insurers expect record claims
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US INSURERS expect to pay out an estimated Dollars 7.3bn (Pounds 3.7bn) in
Florida as a result of Hurricane Andrew - by far the costliest disaster the
industry has ever faced.
The figure is the first official tally of the damage resulting from the
hurricane, which ripped through southern Florida last week. In the battered
region it is estimated that 275,000 people still have no electricity and at
least 150,000 are either homeless or are living amid ruins.
President George Bush yesterday made his second visit to the region since
the hurricane hit. He pledged the government would see through the clean-up
'until the job is done'.
Although there had already been some preliminary guesses at the level of
insurance claims, yesterday's figure comes from the Property Claims Services
division of the American Insurance Services Group, the property-casualty
insurers' trade association. It follows an extensive survey of the area by
the big insurance companies.
Mr Gary Kerney, director of catastrophe services at the PCS, said the
industry was expecting about 685,000 claims in Florida alone. It is reckoned
the bulk of the damage - over Dollars 6bn in insured claims - is in Dade
County, a rural region to the south of Miami.
However, the final cost of Hurricane Andrew will be higher still.
Yesterday's estimate does not include any projection for claims in
Louisiana, which was also affected by the storm, although less severely than
Florida. An estimate of the insured losses in this second state will be
released later this week.
But on the Florida losses alone, Hurricane Andrew becomes the most costly
insured catastrophe in the US. Hurricane Hugo, which hit the east coast in
September 1989, cost the insurance industry about Dollars 4.2bn. The Oakland
fire disaster, in California last year, cost Dollars 1.2bn.
By contrast, insurance claims resulting from the Los Angeles riots earlier
this year - the most expensive civil disturbance in the US - totalled just
Dollars 775m.
Hurricane Andrew leaves the US property-casualty insurers facing their
worst-ever year for catastrophe losses. The LA riots and a series of
tornadoes, wind and hailstorms in states such as Kansas, Oklahoma and Iowa
had already produced insured losses of Dollars 3.9bn. With Florida's
Hurricane Andrew losses added in, the total rises to Dollars 11.2bn.
This easily exceeds the record Dollars 7.6bn of catastrophe losses seen in
1989, when the industry paid out on both Hurricane Hugo and the Loma Prieta
earthquake in California.
Wall Street, however, has reacted calmly to the record losses expected, and
insurers' shares - although lower initially - have been firming recently.
The property-casualty industry is thought to have adequate reserves to cover
the disaster.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
National Power and PowerGen have an enlightened self-interest in focusing
attention on the nuclear levy and its impact on industry's electricity
bills. Their regulator is again asking questions about pool prices, although
he found no evidence of price fixing last year. The generators are also
locked in sensitive talks with British Coal over long-term coal supply
contracts. A worthy argument about who bears the cost of nuclear power
provides a welcome diversion.
Industry, though, is certainly right to worry about energy costs. Subsidies
in the form of cheap coal - and the low rate of return demanded of some
regional electricity boards - have been lost since privatisation. In a
business like chemicals the cost of power is a key component in
competitiveness since many other input prices are fixed on world markets. It
is difficult to prove UK manufacturers are operating at a disadvantage, but
the nuclear levy is is the one component of power pricing equation still in
the gift of government and an obvious target for lobbying.
But the attention of the market, and of big electricity consumers, is
unlikely to be switched for long from the issues of competition and coal.
Energy users yesterday welcomed PowerGen's proposals on the levy, but would
no doubt also applaud a full enquiry into pool prices. Industry will also be
suspicious of paying any form of hidden subsidy to British Coal through
higher electricity prices.
Both issues have to be resolved if the generators are to continue to justify
a lower yield than other privatised utilities.

FT  02 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Dollar
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sterling, the franc and the lira may all be under pressure, but it is the
dollar which is suffering most against the D-Mark. In deciding whether the
current difficulty is one of dollar weakness or D-Mark strength, the
Americans can with some justice point the finger at the Germans, not least
because the dollar's recent fall against a basket of currencies has been
modest. Those who enjoy historical irony might see present circumstances as
a German reprise of Reaganomics; a large economy has high government
spending but its independent central bank follows a tight monetary policy.
The result is upward pressure on interest rates everywhere.
Thus conventional wisdom has the gap between US and German rates as a
primary cause of the weak dollar. To the extent that this is true, it is
difficult to see what the Americans can do about it. Raising interest rates
by 1 per cent would probably kill the stunted US recovery, but it would do
little to narrow the interest differential with Germany and intervention is
at best a tactical tool. At any rate, the interest gap is largely priced
into the market.
What may be more important for the foreign exchanges at the moment are
renewed worries about the health of some American banks given sluggish
economic growth, and the age-old rationalisation of political uncertainty as
a bearish force.
Of course, as some economists never tire of saying, the dollar is cheap when
purchasing powers are compared. Unfortunately, that situation can persist
for a very long time. A market perception that the momentum of interest
rates had altered might do the trick, but it is a little too early for that.
Though it is unlikely, the Federal Reserve might even cut rates if recovery
falters further. By contrast, the threat of higher German rates still
exists. Eventually, it may be the resolution of the electoral struggle which
gives speculators an excuse to take the dollar higher.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Contested bids such as Redland/Steetley and TI/Dowty mostly squeaked through
in the first half of 1992. But with yesterday's victory by Henlys in the
battle of the motor traders - following hot on the heels of Manders'
successful defence against fellow paint maker Kalon - the predators' lot is
not proving an easy one. Obviously it is rash to make judgements on the
basis of just two tiddlers, and there are particular difficulties in making
unwanted bids for smaller companies. The explanation, though, may go beyond
relative management merits or even the lack in both recent cases of a full
cash alternative.
The way in which the falling stock market has tended to erode bid premiums
has certainly been one factor in the failures. Another may be the
increasingly uncertain outlook for earnings, and therefore the difficulties
for institutions of assessing the fairness of offers.

FT  02 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Housing subsidence
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One might have thought that the market would be impervious to shocks from
the housebuilders by now. But yesterday's 42 per cent fall in interim
profits from Persimmon clearly caught investors on the hop. The company's
own shares dived 25p to 148p on the news, while Barratt Developments (down
16 per cent to 41p) and Wimpey (down 11 per cent to 85p) were the biggest
casualties elsewhere.
Six months ago it would have been unthinkable for a quality regional player
like Persimmon to insert a health warning about the final dividend. While
there seems no need to contemplate a cut at this stage, the statement
underlines the uncertainties which the housing market faces for the rest of
the year.
The real message contained in yesterday's numbers is the risk of chasing
volume in current market conditions; Persimmon clearly geared up for a
buoyant first quarter which never happened, and has only managed to sell
fractionally more houses than in the first half of 1991 at the expense of
higher overheads. Stocks and work in progress are up almost a fifth,
reflecting a 32 per cent increase in the number of development sites.
Persimmon, however, has a relatively cheap land bank and comfortable balance
sheet, and managed to maintain its average selling price in the period: one
can only speculate on the plight of competitors dashing for cash to keep the
bankers happy, rather than growing volume as a stated objective of medium
term strategy.
Persimmon will hardly lose its premium rating as a result of yesterday's
disappointment; the question, once again, is whether the whole sector is
correctly priced.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Arts: BBC haunted by the Thatcherite dream - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF debate about the future of the BBC is to remain at the level of 'Yah boo,
you're a pseudo-Leninist' and 'Gerroff, you Bourbon in red braces', we may
as well give up hope of maintaining the level of excellence hitherto
achieved in radio and television in Britain and hand the whole shebang over
to the satellite people.
The 'Leninist' thrust was one of several delivered by Michael Grade, one
time BBC television supremo but these days chief executive of Channel 4, and
the 'Bourbon' riposte came from Duke Hussey, chairman of the BBC governors.
For those of us concerned with programmes rather than personalities, it is
agony to know that, lying beyond this squabble, there is an important debate
which never seems to come out into the open.
To be fair, Grade has made the first real effort. Delivering the keynote
speech at the Edinburgh Television Festival, he accused the BBC governors of
political appeasement, and BBC top brass of abandoning their heritage by
axing resources, creating a culture of secrecy through editorial
dictatorship, and of stifling talent.
He also laid into John Birt, director-general in waiting, whom he described
as 'a trappist monk, unable to speak publicly', and lambasted Birt's scheme
for 'producer choice' which is supposed to introduce market forces into the
heart of the corporation.
Down on the BBC gundecks, Grade's swipes were greeted with rapture by a
staff which, even by its own high standards of moodiness and paranoia, has
been especially depressed - almost despairing - recently. The feeling among
the troops is that they have carried on a BBC tradition of excellence in
programme-making, often for rewards well below those in the private sector,
but that the organisation is now being changed, lock, stock and barrel, and
its ethos cast carelessly - even unknowingly - aside in a series of moves
which might be described by a soccer commentator as 'getting your
retaliation in first'.
Their own management, it seems, is busy transforming the BBC into a
Thatcherite dream - despite the fact that Thatcher herself has been deposed,
Britain's administration has moved on and become less hostile towards the
corporation, and the Government's own discussion paper on the future of the
BBC is not due until this autumn.
Many of the powder monkeys fear that, long before they or the listeners and
viewers have had any chance to put an oar in (despite the recent array of
internal consultative committees), the BBC will have been changed into an
organisation marooned on the 'high ground' of broadcasting, and
concentrating - at the expense of its traditional strengths in popular
entertainment - on a style of serious journalism much favoured by the
serious John Birt and his proteges from London Weekend Television's current
affairs department, who now fill so many key posts in the BBC.
In the ranks, it is seen as the puritanical Cromwell and his New Model Army
driving out the cavaliers. The puritan style, known as 'Birtism' and often
characterised as 'Stalinist' because of its centralised editorial structure,
serves as a symbol for all the changes being introduced, including 'producer
choice'.
The managers see this as a way of devolving true choice to individual
producers, allowing them to use, say, the cameraman they want rather than
the one nominated from the roster; the intention is to put pressure on
overheads. Yet in the ranks, the very phrase 'producer choice' is widely
seen as an example of Orwellian Newspeak, a way of putting the full burden
of costing on to individual producers who will in future be charged for
everything from make-up to ballpoint pens. . . everything, that is, except
the cost of carrying what they see as the notorious BBC bureaucracy with its
chauffeur-driven limousines and country house hotel weekends: the very
things, say those on the lower decks, on which producers would most readily
choose to economise, and the very thing for which independent
programme-makers - against whom BBC producers are now to be measured - do
not have to pay.
Furthermore, though BBC producers are to be allowed to go outside the
organisation to find cheaper editing suites or scanner vans, the BBC's
editing suites and scanner vans will not be allowed to compete for outside
custom. Opponents maintain that this will destroy the BBC's talent base in
the craft industries, which has done so much to make the corporation into a
(many would say the) world leader in programme making.
However, having raised our eyes from the Grade-Hussey bout to look at the
background problems, it is necessary to step back again and take an even
longer view of the underlying principles. On the whole, politicians are
suspicious of broadcasters and broadcasting. It strikes them as a business
with nearly as much power as their own - more, it seems sometimes - and even
less responsibility or answerability.
Conservative politicians are particularly opposed to broadcasting being run
by uppity intellectuals. If we must have this modern fourth estate, they
would rather it was run by businessmen with the sole purpose of making a
profit; there are few profits in investigative journalism or arrogant Death
On The Rock-style exposes.
Businessmen can be relied upon to concentrate on game shows, soap operas,
and tabloid journalism of the human interest variety, not a lot of
embarrassing stuff about security scandals and police corruption. Even
though ITV was largely run by businessmen it was, for historical and social
reasons, deeply impregnated with BBC values. So the Thatcherites introduced
franchise auctions which, from next January, will ensure that virtually
nothing is shown in peak viewing time which does not make a profit. That
should take care of ITV.
But the BBC is a much bigger, older, tougher problem. It was created at a
time when the scarcity of technical resources, specifically wavelengths, was
seen as necessitating a monopoly, and thus a collectivist system of support.
By the 1980s collectivism was seen in Downing Street as synonymous with
socialism, socialism was synonymous with communism and so the BBC was a
hotbed of reds, QED. What was needed was the firm smack of market forces to
bring the arrogant BBC into line with everything else in the country:
education, local government, trade unions, industry and so on.
When Margaret Thatcher was succeeded by John Major, many broadcasters who
believed that the BBC should resist the call of the market heaved sighs of
relief. Since the licence-fee system provided two highly successful national
television services and five highly regarded radio networks for less than
the cost to the viewer of a single movie channel on the Astra satellite, and
since the BBC had proved year after year, its superiority in international
programme contests, its future should, surely, be secure. Thus it comes as
something of a shock to them now to hear their own bosses countering Grade's
charges with Thatcherite arguments about competing in the marketplace.
Yet this may not be the BBC's worst problem. Much has been said about the
corporation's need to maintain its success in the popular sector of the
programme spectrum if it is to sustain its claim on the licence fee, and it
is a reasonable argument.
Yet what should really have been worrying Mr Hussey this week is not just Mr
Grade's attack, but the fact that the BBC seems to have lost the sympathy of
David Attenborough, probably the most highly regarded broadcaster this
country has ever produced, and of John Tusa who was a superb television
broadcaster and more recently an inspiring managing director of the World
Service. Attenborough now says that the very things which gave the BBC its
unique stature and strength are being destroyed, and Tusa says he is
leaving.
It would be bad enough to lose its soap opera audience, but once the BBC
loses the loyalty of Britain's middle class intelligentsia, it may as well
start folding its tents.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SANDRA Bernhard is best known in the UK as the up-front gay who formed a
two-girl ratpack with Madonna. Yet this footnote to history was enough to
fill the 3,000 seater Playhouse twice in a night, and to persuade me that
Madonna was probably running hard to keep up with the feisty Bernhard.
She wanders on stage like a stoned-out freak and is guided by one of her
four-strong band to the mike where she performs her own version of 'Fever',
a long bitch about virtually everyone who inhabits Vanity Fair and Versace.
Poor old Joni Mitchell is quickly dismissed as a 'hippy freak'. You realise
that as a development of the 'sex and shopping' novel Bernhard has perfected
the 'sex and shopping and song' show.
What makes it thoroughly enjoyable is that Bernhard seems a genuine free
spirit - no discreet costume changes for her, but a full frontal thrust into
a succession of bizarre dresses - and more surprisingly, owns a rich and
full ranging voice. So you are caught by an accomplished raconteur, with
some informed insights into a twilight world, who then slides into some
evocative songs. Her version of 'Woodstock' was quite tingly.
Bernhard calls her show 'Giving Till It Hurts', which is pretty
self-indulgent. Beneath the bravado, there is something vulnerable about
Bernhard - the body is held defensively; the songs seem therapeutic; the
calls for the gays in the audience to come out slightly desperate.
This is a peep into a world where fantasies are forced into realities; where
ambition is no more than a six-page spread in Vogue; where dreams come true
only on stage when the audience applauds. Bernhard is odd and talented,
perfect late night diversion.
Women are big in this year's Fringe. The huge Jo Brand won a Perrier
nomination; the simply gigantic Thea Vidale deflates criticism with her foul
mouthed and funny polemic on what women want, like, and need; and the slim
and demure Louise Rennison was my personal favourite with her reminiscences
of girlhood in Leeds, New Zealand and London in the 1960s.
Rennison's delivery is completely natural, almost conversational asides
which makes her general immersion into sex and drugs and rock'n'roll seem
charming, funny, even innocent. She survived a car ride with Led Zeppelin: a
back-stage disaster with Pink Floyd: and, in the title of her show at the
Assembly Rooms, 'Stevie Wonder felt my face'. If only all lives of
experimentation and over-indulgence proceeded so sweetly.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Arts: Rigoletto and Ariadne - English National Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST week's curtain-up on the 1992-93 English National Opera season filled
the Coliseum with the sombre chords of Rigoletto, and then with the
chrome-shiny decor and hip-thrusting body-language of Jonathan Miller's
celebrated Fifties New York updating. This production was supposed to have
been retired from service a few years back; but in hard times its
crowd-pulling tendencies amounted to an offer ENO could not refuse, and it
has been hoist into harness once more.
I have no quarrel with that. Miller's time-travelling correspondences have
never made true Verdian sense under the vividly detailed surface (for if the
Duke is a minor villain, not a real political force in the land, his abuse
of power for private ends is hardly a shocking matter). But at its best,
when tautly delivered, the show has allowed the company to re-create the
opera's emotional relationships with a raw dramatic urgency that is its own
best justification.
Unfortunately, that all-important tautness seemed woefully absent on
Thursday, and, without the staging, declined into just another operatic
costume-drama, a bit tatty round the edges. It had an under-rehearsed look
and - as a result of Michael Lloyd's expansive but too often slack-muscled
conducting - sound. No concern for all-embracing word-clarity was evident;
no effort had apparently been directed toward basing the drama on the
discipline of the singing line.
This particularly affected Cathryn Pope's first attempt at Gilda. The jury
is still out on whether her problem is miscasting - as the quantity of
strained high phrases might seem to indicate - or inadequate schooling (for
Miss Pope's considerable experience has been built up on types of
soprano-writing very different from Verdi). I lean to the second opinion,
and suspect that she will find eventually her own way into the music, and
thence into a character that on this occasion proved so elusive.
As 'Duke' and Rigoletto we had the original 1982 cast-members, Arthur Davies
and John Rawnsley. Time has coarsened the tone of the former and taken much
of the house-filling vocal spin out of the latter. But both still know how
to hold the stage, and in this context the gift proves precious. As a small
bonus there were also Terry Jenkins's Borsa, always freshly inventive, the
dusky alto richness of Patricia Bardon's Maddalena, and the genuine dramatic
imagination shown by Michael Druiett's lumbering, sweaty Sparafucile.
On the whole, though, a disappointment.
Next evening, another ENO revival, but this time a much more cheering one:
an Ariadne on Naxos that made a big-house success of this marvellous but
infinitely tricky small-house, chamber-orchestral opera.
In 1983 Graham Vick's production had consistently botched the difficult
points; now, as mounted by Lynn Binstock, the routines of the Prologue have
been tidied up a good deal (if not completely) and the plainness of the
Opera becomes a vehicle for some powerfully effective principal
performances.
To the new conductor, Alexander Sander from Vienna, must go main credit for
the feeling of apt scale, plausible balance and forward movement that
underpins the whole reading.
Two large-voiced dramatic sopranos return to their roles: Rita Cullis, a
Composer lacking vulnerability and charm but filling the theatre with
brightly focused sound, and Janice Cairns, an Ariadne of noble personality
and heart-warmingly bold, risk-taking approach to the exposed vocal lines.
The great event of the evening was, however, the first London Zerbinetta of
the American Cyndia Sieden - astonishingly sweet, true, and free of coyness.
In company with a trim quartet of zanies led by Paul Napier-Burrows, she
turned the Strauss-Hofmannsthal re-invention of the commedia dell'arte into
one of opera's most savoury pleasures.

THE National Youth Theatre (NYT), founded in 1956, is now a mature
institution. Its alumni have contributed to the English stage as actors and
technicians. To see an NYT show is to see one future in English theatre.
Now at The Place Theatre, Euston, the NYT presents a devised 90-minute
multi-media piece called Maps For Lost Lovers. It makes a refreshing change
from usual London theatre fare.
Maps For Lost Lovers offers a first opportunity to see these actors; it also
suggests what theatrical material will look like within a decade. It most
resembles the new forms of computer virtual reality and hypertext, where you
choose what to see and how to see it.
There are 14 actors in many roles, no plot, three stills projectors, two
video projectors and a series of gaff-rigged screens (one per actor) which
float in an ultra-violet twilight.
The text (by director Dean Byfield) passes from one medium to another, now a
voice, now an image, now a projected page.
At the heart of the show lies the horror of loneliness and the pain of
togetherness, repeated in open-armed yearning and fights between the ever
shifting couples on stage. The action follows wishes and hopes transformed
and compromised by the environment. Gestures and text repeat themselves:
'Will the one I love steal me a car with bullet holes down the side? Will it
make me run down the street and use my voice again?' is first said, then
projected, then represented.
Sharp scenes emerge, including a wonderful exchange where a blindfolded
actor instructs her partner to say those most and least personal words, 'I
love you' proving they belong to everyone and no one: 'Say it like a
surgeon. . . say it like you're angry.' Another fine scene has the cast in a
frenzy of preening and primping at a nightclub, settling by force of custom
into a uneasy embraces.
The acting is sure-footed, the design and filming (Laura Hopkins, Caroline
Rye) enlightening, and the ambient music (Andy Price) an aid to reflection.
Since Gutenberg made everyone a reader and the photocopier made everyone a
publisher, this form of multi-media 'hyper-theatre' makes everyone a
director.

Thank goodness for BBC2. Even if the channel seems to be as besotted with
the US as every other network in Britain, at least it still presents fresh
and, quite often, intelligent programmes. While BBC1, ITV and Channel 4
concentrate on soap operas, embarrassing game shows with Anneka Rice and
repeats, BBC2 is offering all sorts of different material.
The Shetland Sessions (7.40) is the first in a series featuring local and
international folk musicians recorded at the 1991 Shetland Folk Festival. At
8.10 the channel begins a three-part 'Timewatch' special on McCarthyism: The
Un-Americans. With the cold war over, this is said to be the first
investigation to concentrate not on the famous Hollywood targets but on
ordinary men and women who were persecuted for supposed communist
sympathies.
Today's 'ScreenPlay' (9.00) is David Edgar's first original television
drama, Buying A Landslide. The title is a reference to Joseph P. Kennedy's
reported statement that he was happy to buy an election for John Kennedy
'but not a landslide'. Edinburgh Nights (11.15) pays tribute to the man who
made the National Film And Television School what it is, Colin Young.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Arts: Tchaikovsky - Edinburgh International Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS the Edinburgh festival reaches the middle of the final week, its portrait
of Tchaikovsky is nearly complete. The composer has proved to be a rewarding
subject, mainly because his life's work spans such a variety of media -
opera and ballet, concertos and symphonies, vocal and choral, all had a
representative showing in this year's programme.
Less attention has been paid to setting his music in context, although the
Royal Scottish Orchestra's pair of concerts over the bank holiday weekend
each gave a nod in that direction. The first offered a triple novelty: three
Hamlet scores, one each by Tchaikovsky, Prokofiev and Shostakovich, the last
a melange of his film score and theatre music, arranged by the evening's
conductor, Gennady Rozhdestvensky.
This was a clever piece of programme-planning. It told us little about
Shakespeare's Hamlet, but a lot about the personalities of the three
composers. While Prokofiev and Shostakovich viewed the play from the
outside, commenting on the issues with irony and detachment, Tchaikovsky's
nature led him instead to try to enter the protagonist's soul. His music is
overtly emotional and in Hamlet's tortured, introspective character it is
easy to see the composer feeling some personal identification.
Given the interest of the programme, it did not matter greatly that the
orchestra's playing was less than brilliant. But when Neeme Jarvi arrived a
couple of days later to conduct it in some of the best-known Tchaikovsky
scores, the untidiness of the playing did make the music's technicolour
virtuosity pale rather.
This time it was chronology that provided an added dimension, as the concert
included both Tchaikovsky's first and last surviving orchestral works - The
Storm Overture and the Sixth Symphony. In between Peter Donohoe, the
festival's resident Tchaikovsky pianist, played the First Piano Concerto
with power and delicacy, if not enough insight always to make the music
spark into life under Jarvi's dampening direction. In the last five minutes,
though, Donohoe really did set the fireworks blazing.
* * * All of this was the public Tchaikovsky. The private man remains more
of an enigma and the festival's most important single gesture was to
familiarise us with one of the composer's rarely-heard private utterances,
the unaccompanied Liturgy of St John Chrysostom. Under the rigid conventions
imposed on composers of music for the Russian Orthodox Church, Tchaikovsky
was required to adopt a style far removed from that of his worldly self. The
result is music of heartfelt simplicity and no small expertise.
There could hardly have been a more inspired idea than to site this
performance at night in St Giles's Cathedral on the Royal Mile. Under Arthur
Oldham's direction, the Edinburgh Festival Chorus made the rafters ring with
singing of glorious concentration and power, the basses emulating the
imposing growl of a native Russian choir. Choral music in the silence of the
night here demands to become an annual festival event.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Reform of public services 'flawed'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government's campaign to improve public services has been seriously
undermined by weaknesses in its systems for measuring value for money,
according to Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of
British Industry.
Mr Davies, a former head of the Audit Commission, the public spending
watchdog, praises the government's record on reforming schools and the
National Health Service in a pamphlet issued yesterday by the Social Market

He says, however, that the drive for better quality in public services is
impeded by the Treasury's twin roles of controlling spending and promoting
value for money.
Until June Mr Davies was controller of the commission, where he was at the

government and the National Health Service.
Mr Davies recommends strengthening the Cabinet Office efficiency unit to
promote value for money and extend the use of market mechanisms to improve
quality of services.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Salary restraint hits top earners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHAIRMEN of Britain's largest companies received more modest pay rises
last year according to data from Pensions Investment Research Consultants, a
private research service.
PIRC, in reviewing the salaries of the highest-paid directors of the
FTSE-100 companies, found an average pay rise of 2 per cent was awarded. The
average salary last year was Pounds 398,667.
UK companies are not required to disclose the remuneration package of their
chairman but must do so for the highest paid director - who in most cases is
the chairman.
The survey of 94 of the FTSE-100 companies found that 39 paid their highest
paid director above average last year. The highest-paid director of an
FTSE-100 company was Lord Hanson, chairman of Hanson. Second was Mr Bob
Bauman of SmithKline Beecham.
PIRC noted that the aggregate figures highlight some of the intricacies
associated with detailing chairmen's remuneration packages. For example, the
remuneration package of Sir Ian MacLaurin, chairman of Tesco, fell by nearly
27 per cent to Pounds 1,084,000. But this represented a decline in his
performance pay - his basic salary rose by 55 per cent to Pounds 606,000,
PIRC said.
There are also some distortions in the data. At Argyll the 87.8 per cent
increase awarded to Sir Alistair Grant, the chairman, largely reflected the
disbursement of a Pounds 444,000 long-term bonus which is payable only on a
three-year cycle. While next year's package is expected to be considerably
lower, PIRC noted that he also received a 14 per cent increase in basic
salary to Pounds 416,000.
Among the lowest paid directors at Britain's largest companies are the heads
of the water companies. Anglian Water's highest paid director earned Pounds
107,000, the lowest of any in the FTSE-100 group - 11.5 per cent more than
1990.
The Pounds 203,192 payment to the highest paid director of Scottish Power
represents a 94.9 per cent pay rise over 1990. Legal and General awarded its
highest paid director remuneration of Pounds 215,871, a 17.3 per cent cut
from the year before.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Lloyd's agency in fresh takeover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AJ ARCHER HOLDINGS, one of two Lloyd's agency groups listed on the Stock
Exchange, yesterday announced that it would continue its expansion by
acquiring a fellow agency, Kellett Holdings.
Mr Brian Kellett, the owner of Kellett Holdings, is to become chief
executive of the new group. Mr Kellett is a prominent non-marine underwriter
and a member of the Lloyd's council, the London insurance market's governing
body. Last month Archer bought another Lloyd's agency, Cuthbert Heath.
The move signals further rationalisation at Lloyd's as businesses seek to
reduce costs and improve efficiency after their worst trading losses ever.
Pre-tax losses for 1989, which were announced in June, in line with the
three-year accounting system of Lloyd's, amounted to Pounds 2.06bn. Chatset,
the research company that monitors Lloyd's, forecast last week that losses
for 1990 will amount to Pounds 1.5bn.
The combined capacity (the capital base) of the syndicates managed by Archer
amounts to Pounds 573m, making the agency the second-biggest after Sturge
Holdings, whose managed syndicates this year have a combined capacity of
Pounds 955.96m. Murray Lawrence has a managed capacity of Pounds 534.46m.
Mr Kellett, referring to the rise in premium rates at Lloyd's, said: 'The
consolidation of Lloyd's agencies into larger and more economic units will
enable us to take advantage of the improving market conditions.'
Archer members' agencies will handle the affairs of 663 Names, the
individuals whose assets support underwriting.
Mr Richard Maylam, chairman of Archer, said that he had been looking at
potential acquisition targets since last year. Following the market's
difficulties, agencies were 'much more willing to become part of a larger
group'.
Kellett shareholders will receive 2.25m paid-up Archer shares and a deferred
cash consideration as well as profit commissions received by Archer from the
Kellett businesses.
Kellett net assets amount to about Pounds 640,000. It is proposed, subject
to the approval of Lloyd's, that the acquisition will be completed before
the end of the year.
Other agencies to make acquisitions this year include: Stewart Underwriting
(which has taken over the business of Miles Smith), Crowe Underwriting
(which has taken over AR Mountain), Castle (which has agreed terms with
Edward Williams Coutts &amp; partners) and Cox (which has taken over the
business of CW Rome).

FT  02 SEP 92 / Labour go into attack on economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR Labour frontbenchers will tomorrow launch the party's autumn
campaigning with a commitment to an emergency programme of measures to help
revive the economy.
The proposals, to be discussed at a meeting of the shadow cabinet's economic
sub-committee, broaden the range of remedies the opposition is urging on the
government. A few Labour backbenchers have criticised the economic team for
giving ministers too easy a ride.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said yesterday that there was a growing
clamour among businessmen for a change in government policy. Labour says the
absence of business and consumer confidence is one of the main barriers to
recovery, and that unless the fear of unemployment can be lifted, people
will not spend instead of saving.
The central elements of the party's recovery programme are measures to
reduce unemployment, encourage investment and boost the housing market.
Labour wants these measures introduced with co-ordinated action in the
European Community to consider employment and fiscal measures and concerted
pressure on the Bundesbank to signal an interest rate cut.
There was, Mr Brown said, growing recognition in Germany of the need for
lower interest rates in the light of the increased sluggishness of the
German economy. He emphasised that Labour had no policy for devaluation, but
said that the meeting of EC finance ministers in Bath on Friday should
consider the case for revaluation.
Mr Brown also called on Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to hold an urgent
meeting with building societies to discuss whether housing associations
could buy up some unsold properties to help to get the housing market
moving.
He renewed his warnings that unless the government took action, there was a
risk of an irretrievable loss of industrial strength.
He said: 'What is becoming increasingly clear is not only that the economy
is stuck in recession far longer than ever the government promised, but also
that we face the loss of industrial capacity which may never be replaced.'

FT  02 SEP 92 / PowerGen calls for N-levy cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POWERGEN, the privatised generator, has joined some of the UK's biggest
companies in appealing to the government for a cut in their electricity
bills through a reduction in the 11 per cent 'nuclear levy' on bills to
large users.
Large energy consumers have intensified their warnings in recent weeks that
without lower electricity prices they will not be able to compete with
overseas companies.
PowerGen said yesterday that it has been discussing one possible solution to
the problem - removal of the nuclear levy, the subsidy electricity users pay
to Nuclear Electric, the state-owned generator - with large consumers and
the Department of Trade and Industry since before the general election.
The DTI is considering the proposals and is understood to have become
slightly more receptive than it was before the election. Observers believe
that may be due to the arrival of Mr Michael Heseltine as trade and industry
secretary.
PowerGen says large users, who enjoyed subsidised electricity prices before
privatisation, are the one group that has failed to benefit from the
government's power sell-off.
Nuclear Electric, which receives Pounds 1.2bn from the levy, increased its
profits this year by 48 per cent to Pounds 482m. This, say PowerGen and
other campaigners, shows there is scope for reducing the levy.
Mr Alf Roberts, PowerGen commercial director, said large users could pay a
reduced levy, or be allowed to enter into lower-priced contracts.
The second option, by tying up a significant amount of Nuclear Electric's
output in the industrial market, would raise demand in the market for
coal-generated electricity, and could give a boost to the coal industry as
it prepares for privatisation.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Council tax valuations are issued
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPLEMENTATION of the council tax came a step closer yesterday with the
release to councils of draft property valuations which will form the basis
for government decisions about how much people will pay under the new
system.
More homes were in the lower bands of the eight-band system than expected,
the Department of the Environment said. But officials denied this would
inevitably mean higher bills for people in low-cost homes because the total
number of properties was higher than expected.
They emphasised that it would be impossible to estimate the size of next
year's council-tax bills until the government had decided the scale and
distribution of government grant and the transitional relief scheme.
Figures produced by the department last year were based on 21m properties in
Great Britain, but the draft valuations suggested that the total would be
about 22m.
Mr Jack Straw, shadow local government minister, blamed falling house prices
in the recession for pushing homes into lower bands, and warned that this
would make the tax even more regressive, leaving those in the lower bands to
pay proportionately larger amounts.
Officials need the valuation figures, which enable estimates to be made of
the tax base in each area, to prepare detailed proposals for ministers to
consider. Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, has already made clear
that he intends to use the increasingly strict regime for capping, or
limiting, local authorities' budgets to prevent bills rising too steeply. In
July he rejected outright the bid by the local authorities for Pounds 45.5bn
total spending next year.
Ministers face a sensitive choice in deciding how to divide the money
available between grant - which would curtail the rises in the tax levels
set by councils and affect how the new tax is perceived - and a transitional
relief scheme, which would limit the real increase faced by any one
household.
Ministers have signalled that they do not feel obliged to meet the estimate
of an average Pounds 400 bill for a band-D property (worth Pounds
68,000-Pounds 88,000 at April 1991) made last year. Some officials now
predict that the average bill for a property in band D could be about Pounds
550.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Kevin Maxwell bankruptcy case adjourned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOVES which would make Mr Kevin Maxwell Britain's biggest bankrupt were
adjourned again yesterday after a private hearing at the High Court lasting
nearly three hours.
Robson Rhodes, liquidators of Bishopsgate Investment Management, issued a
bankruptcy petition against Mr Maxwell after obtaining a Pounds 406.8m
judgment against him in July. Mr Keith Oliver, Mr Maxwell's solicitor, said
the matter had been adjourned 'until at the earliest, Thursday September 3'.
He added: 'Given the private nature of the hearing, and the fact that the
hearing continues, it would be inappropriate for Mr Maxwell to say
anything.'
The dispute before the court is over Robson Rhodes' use of an expedited
procedure allowing a petition to be filed within the three weeks a debtor is
normally given to comply with a statutory demand for payment of a judgment
debt.
The matter first went to the bankruptcy court on August 17, when it was
adjourned until yesterday for the court to hear Mr Maxwell's opposition.
Earlier yesterday the prosecution of Mr Kevin Maxwell, his brother Ian and
their colleague Mr Larry Trachtenberg on charges of conspiracy to defraud
and theft involving Pounds 135m was adjourned until December 1 by City of
London magistrates.
None of the men was present at the 1 1/2 -hour hearing at which the
prosecution said it was hoped the case would be ready for transfer to the
crown court early next year.
All were remanded on conditional bail, Mr Kevin Maxwell on sureties
totalling Pounds 500,000, Mr Ian Maxwell on sureties of Pounds 250,000 and
Mr Trachtenberg on sureties of Pounds 300,000.
The magistrates varied Mr Kevin Maxwell's bail condition which had required
him to live either at 31 Jubilee Place, Chelsea, London, or at Hill Barn,
Hailey, Wallingford, Oxfordshire after being told that the Chelsea house had
been sold. Mr Maxwell must now live at the Oxfordshire property 'or at any
address approved by the Serious Fraud Office with 24 hours' prior notice'.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Ulster talks reopen today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROUND-TABLE talks on the political future of Northern Ireland will resume in
Belfast today after a 40-day recess. The talks will enter what the
participants believe to be the most important stage of the three-strand
talks process which started in April.
Preliminary discussions took place yesterday to agree an agenda, establish
ground rules and organise a manageable negotiating structure.
The main talks will involve three days of meetings each week. They will be
held initially at Stormont Castle in Belfast and will then move to Dublin,
probably in the last week of this month.
It will be the first time since the partition of Ireland in 1922 that
Unionist political leaders have travelled on official business to Dublin.
The talks are part of Strand Two of the three-strand process. The aim is an
agreed formula for self-rule in Northern Ireland to replace the 1985
Anglo-Irish agreement.
Strand One involved only political parties while Strand Two will include the
Dublin government.
Strand Three will involve discussions between the British and Irish
governments. A month has been set aside for the current round of talks,
which will be chaired by Sir Ninian Stephen, a former governor-general of
Australia.
Talks in July were seen as a preliminary phase, and the real negotiations
are now expected to get under way.
Signs of flexibility will be sought - for example, on whether the Irish
government is prepared to relax or amend its constitutional claim to
Northern Ireland, and on whether the unionist parties are prepared to
concede a role for Dublin in an Ulster administration.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Lucas pension trustees attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PENSIONERS of Lucas Industries are citing trust law in their battle to
reverse a Pounds 150m payment from the scheme to the company.
A group of 16 pensioners has served summonses on 10 trustees of the scheme,
alleging that the trust barred any payments from the scheme to the company.
Four of the trustees are employee representatives and the rest company
officials.
Mr Douglas Taylor, one of the pensioners in the group, said that Lucas
Industries Pension Scheme operated under an unusual 'irrevocable trust'
deed.
The deed specifically barred not only direct payments to the company but any
amendment which could have allowed such a payment. Furthermore, the deed
provided that on winding up, any surplus should be used for the exclusive
benefit of pensioners.
The pensioners are not alleging that the company behaved improperly in
connection with the scheme.
Lucas Industries last year obtained permission from the Superannuation Funds
Office of the Occupational Pensions Board to extract a portion of the
surplus for itself. At the same time, a further Pounds 220m of surplus was
to be used for enhanced benefits to scheme members and a further Pounds 250m
of surplus was to be left in the scheme to pay for possible benefit
increases mandated by law.
Lucas Industries has made no contribution to its pension scheme since 1985
and will not do so for the foreseeable future, the company said.
The pensioners say the trustees had no authority to ask the board to
apportion the surplus.

CHARTERAIL, the pioneering rail-freight company which announced last week
that it was calling in liquidators, yesterday did an about-turn and renewed
efforts to stave off its collapse, Richard Tomkins writes.
Mr Robin Gisby, managing director, said the move followed a weekend during
which a range of potential shareholders had expressed interest in plugging
the company's funding gap.
Charterail announced that it was going into liquidation last Thursday after
British Rail, which owns 22 per cent of the company, declined to cut its
haulage rates or invest more money to ease the business's financial
difficulties.
A meeting of the company's directors yesterday was expected to result in the
appointment of liquidators. Instead, the directors decided to continue
efforts to find more funding and to reopen negotiations with BR over the
haulage agreement.

FT  02 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Gulf Air in Dollars 600m Airbus order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIRBUS Industrie strengthened its grip on the Middle Eastern aircraft market
yesterday with an order worth almost Dollars 600m (about Pounds 300m) from
Gulf Air.
Gulf Air, jointly owned by Oman, Qatar, Bahrain and Abu Dhabi, is buying six
Airbus A340s, the biggest aircraft in the Airbus range, and taking options
on another six.
Gulf Air will be the first Middle East carrier to operate the A340 when it
receives the first in spring 1994. Each aircraft will be powered by four
engines made by CFM International, a venture between General Electric of the
US and Snecma of France.
The purchase is in addition to plans by Gulf Air to invest Dollars 1.7bn
over the next three years in 18 new aircraft, flights to 10 new destinations
and more facilities and personnel. Gulf Air is a long-established customer
of Airbus. It has ordered 12 Airbus A320s, a smaller model, two of which are
in service on routes within the Gulf.
The order is a boost for Airbus after Emirates, another expansion-minded
Middle Eastern airline, decided to buy Boeing's new model, the 777. The A340
is a new model set to enter service with Lufthansa early next year.
Three of the world's automated airline ticket reservation systems are
linking their computers. The tie-up is between Amadeus, owned by Air France,
Lufthansa and Iberia; Worldspan, owned by TWA and Delta of the US, and
Abacus, owned by five Asian airlines. Worldspan and Abacus also have stakes
in each other.
The link will allow travellers who arranged itineraries on one network to
change their plans through a travel agent which subscribes to one of the
other two. The arrangement goes some way to improving the competitive
positions of Amadeus, Worldspan and Abacus against the two world leaders,
Sabre, owned by America Airlines, and Galileo/Apollo, owned by 11 airlines
in the US and Europe.

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN was urged yesterday by Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director-general, to
accept tariffication (recalculating subsidies as tariffs) without exception,
a reference to Tokyo's refusal to make a concession on rice imports.
While Mr Dunkel encouraged Tokyo to work for a successful end to the Uruguay
Round of world trade talks, Japanese officials said they were concerned
about possible trade barriers raised by the North American Free Trade
Agreement (Nafta), linking the US, Canada and Mexico.
Mr Dunkel told Mr Kozo Watanabe, Japan's international trade and industry
minister (both pictured right), that Gatt may review Nafta under the regular
review mechanism.
Japanese officials would like a special inquiry to clarify if Nafta is
'trade-creating' or not. Japan has cited the recent dispute with the US over
the local content of Hondas produced in Canada as an example of potential
pitfalls of the Nafta accord, and would like Gatt confirmation of Nafta
regulations.
Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) was relieved that delays in
Uruguay Round negotiations let Japan keep its rice import ban; the party
feared a concession would have hurt it in an upper house election in July.
The LDP won the election easily, but the Tokyo government has not moved to
allow rice imports; Mr Dunkel's assurances that tariffication is 'not
liberalisation in the true sense' are unlikely to prompt a sudden policy
change. He leaves for Seoul today.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Collor impeachment process begins: Brazilian lawyers and
journalists accuse president of 'losing moral authority'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRASLIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL'S first impeachment process was set in motion yesterday with a formal
petition to the president of Congress against President Fernando Collor, who
has been linked to a multi-million-dollar corruption scandal.
The request was presented by the heads of the Brazilian Bar Association and
Journalists' Association in an emotional ceremony in the Green Room of
Congress. The room was packed with congressmen, union leaders and
journalists. The 20-page document accused Mr Collor of 'losing all moral
authority to govern the country' and of 'sullying the image of the state'.
The impeachment request is the first formal step to ending Mr Collor's
mandate and comes only half way through his five-year term. The president's
determination not to resign means the country now faces weeks of political
uncertainty and economic paralysis.
The charges against Mr Collor, elaborated in the request, include 'lying to
the nation' and receiving - along with his wife, ex-wife and mother - 'huge
quantities of money and goods of illicit origin', through a scheme of
'phantom account holders and 'trafficking of influence' by Mr Paulo Cesar
Farias, his friend and former campaign treasurer.
The petition follows publication of a damning congressional report
concluding a three-month probe into Mr Farias' activities.
This report was initiated after accusations against the president by Mr
Collor's younger brother. It has provoked widespread calls for the
president's resignation or impeachment.
Few believe Mr Collor can survive the impeachment process and he is growing
increasingly isolated in the battle to save his political career. His
ministers have made clear in an official note that they are only staying on
for the sake of the country. Last night members of the Liberal Front, Mr
Collor's remaining supporters, were meeting to discuss withdrawing their
backing.
A commission will now be set up by Mr Ibsen Pinheiro, the president of
Congress, which will meet for 10 days to decide whether to accept the
impeachment request. If accepted, it goes to the lower house where Mr Collor
has 20 days to present a defence before a vote is taken. A two-thirds
majority is needed for approval, at which stage Mr Collor would be suspended
for 180 days while he is judged by the Senate. Mr Pinheiro expects the
congressional vote to occur this month.
Mr Collor may also face a legal process. Yesterday the congressional report
on corruption, together with more than 40,000 cheques which were used as
evidence, were taken to the office of the attorney-general, who will decide
whether to take legal action.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Accountants link in challenge to US litigation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE six leading accountancy firms in the US have united in a campaign to
change the liability system, to try to reduce their exposure to litigation.
The current US liability system is 'out of control' and 'seriously lacking
in logic, fairness and balance', the firms say in a statement to partners
and clients being circulated this week.
Their campaign reflects concern in the industry about the escalation in
litigation, mainly against auditors to companies which have collapsed or
been subject to sharp falls in their share prices.
The groups are launching an intensive lobbying drive to persuade legislators
in federal and local government to introduce a process of litigation which
would assess claims against defendants in proportion to their degree of
responsibility.
Under the existing system of 'joint and several liability' every defendant
is liable for up to 100 per cent of the value of a claim, no matter how
limited its role. Accountants are often taken to court because they are
perceived to have 'deep pockets', according to the firms.
The campaign is an unusual collaboration between the so-called 'big six'
firms, the largest accountancy organisations by fee income and staff both in
North America and around the world which compete fiercely against each
other.
The firms - Arthur Andersen, Coopers &amp; Lybrand, Deloitte &amp; Touche, Ernst &amp;
Young, KPMG Peat Marwick and Price Waterhouse - are collaborating with the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and other professional
and trade bodies to bring about reform.
They also criticise the fact that there is no provision in the US legal
system for the recovery of legal costs by defendants, regardless of the
merit of the case brought against them. This encourages firms to settle
cases rather than risk larger costs by fighting.
The statement says the total costs of settling and defending lawsuits among
the six groups was Dollars 477m (Pounds 239.6m) last year, representing 9
per cent of auditing and accounting revenues, up from 7.7 per cent in 1990.
It says the cost of litigation is a serious threat to the financial
reporting system, the strength of US capital markets and the competitiveness
of the economy. It estimates that there are now about 4,000 outstanding
lawsuits facing the US accountancy profession as a whole, with a value of
Dollars 30bn in claims.
A survey among the six groups last year showed the average claim was for
Dollars 85m, the average settlement was Dollars 2.7m and the average legal
cost per claim Dollars 3.5m.
The larger firms complain that their insurance premiums are far higher than
for smaller counterparts, with sharp reductions in policy limits and a rapid
increase in deductibles to more than Dollars 25m.

FT  02 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Plan for maritime aircraft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIX EUROPEAN aircraft makers have grouped to produce a maritime patrol
aircraft. The initiative comes from Dassault Aviation of France and British
Aerospace, with Deutsche Aerospace of Germany, Construcciones Aeronauticas
(CASA) of Spain, Alenia of Italy and Fokker of the Netherlands.
Through a new 'industrial group', Europatrol, they plan to seek government
agreement on a common aircraft and mission system for use throughout Europe;
they hope the aircraft will be exported worldwide and the new mission system
be suitable for updating current aircraft.
France has been pressing for a joint maritime patrol project through the
Independent European Programme Group (IEPG), made up of Nato members. The
companies will lobby governments to set up an outline IEPG 'staff target'
for the aircraft. The UK has been considering Dassault's Atlantique 2 as an
option to replace its ageing Nimrod patrol aircraft.

FT  02 SEP 92 / World Trade News: US set for showdown with China - Nancy
Dunne and Laurie Morse on a lunge at Beijing's trade wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE and LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUSH administration is girding for a high-stakes showdown of
'constructive engagement' in an attempt to force China to remove its import
barriers.
If it succeeds, China will promise to publish its rules, laws and
regulations and agree to end product bans and quotas, import licensing and
technical barriers to trade, such as phytosanitary (health and safety)
standards, which present illegitimate impediments.
Success would also mean critics of Beijing will have lost an excuse for
attacking the growing US trade deficit with China, which is heading for over
Dollars 15bn (Pounds 7.5bn) this year, and probably precipitate another
collapse of the drive in Congress to place conditions on China's Most
Favoured Nation (MFN) status. Failure will mean President Bush will have to
lose face or impose billions of dollars in sanctions against the country for
which he claims a special affinity, having been the first US envoy there in
the 1970s.
The deadline is October 10, one year from the day the US formally filed a
Section 301 complaint against China for denial of market access. In
preparation, the US has released a list of products, worth Dollars 3.9bn,
which could be targeted for 100 per cent tariffs. Similar threats of
retaliation, stemming from China's failure to protect patents, softwear,
trademarks and other intellectual property from pirates, produced an
agreement in January. But the whole exercise had to be endured: deadlines,
threats, a list of potential sanctions, pleas by importers to keep sanctions
off their products, and a last-minute settlement hailed by one and all.
Most analysts see a similar conclusion to the current imbroglio. US
officials argue the administration is helping China prepare for the day it
may return to Gatt. The Chinese know a breakdown in talks could embolden
congressmen to step up their criticism of China's MFN status. The Senate
soon will vote on legislation, passed by the House of Representatives, which
would require the president to accompany his yearly extension of China's MFN
status by a report showing progress on human rights. China would be required
every year to free more political prisoners, stop exporting 'slave labour'
goods and abide by treaties governing export of missile technology and
nuclear materials.
Should China not meet these conditions, tariffs would be increased on
exports from state-controlled Chinese industries, a feat the administration
argues would be impossible to accomplish. Mr Ira Wolf, assistant US trade
representative, told the Senate Finance Committee last month: 'Targeting
exports of state enterprises, while appealing in theory, is unworkable in
practice'. Suggestions have been made that failure to obtain a new accord
and subsequent sanctions would spur China to hit back through its US wheat
purchases.
Beijing has been notably absent from the wheat market since November, 1991,
leaving a gaping hole in the US export picture. China is the second largest
US wheat customer; the former Soviet Union is the first, and it can now only
buy when the US agriculture department extends credit. But China continues
to receive regular shipments of US wheat, which it bought in a few large
purchases last autumn. Wheat traders are confident China will return as a
buyer once it has assessed the size of its own crop and is convinced US
wheat prices have fallen to their harvest lows.
China can use its wheat imports as a trump card. In the 1980s, it abstained
from the US wheat market until the US agreed to keep China's textiles
exports flowing. The longer it waits, the lower US prices will drift. But
China was successful in playing its wheat card before the Tiananmen Square
incident, and before most in the US Congress became convinced trade
sanctions should be used over its human rights violations. That was also
before the Soviet Union collapsed, when China seemed the more benign
communist superpower. The current climate might give Congress more resolve
in a trade stand-off.
Failure by Beijing to buy wheat before the November elections could hurt Mr
Bush in the US farm belt, where he is tarnished by his failure to make
progress in disputes with the EC. But the Chinese would be more likely to
time a purchase to help him: despite his recent stand against Beijing, he
has been an ally for years. Mr Bush's opponent in the presidential election
campaign, Mr Bill Clinton, threatens a tougher human rights line.

<TEXT>
CALIFORNIA'S Governor Pete Wilson vetoed a key bill yesterday, threatening
to unravel a compromise budget aimed at ending the state's worst financial
crisis since the Great Depression, Reuter reports from Sacramento.
The Republican governor, who had strong-armed legislators into accepting
most of his demands in a Dollars 57bn (Pounds 28.6bn) austerity budget,
contended the education bill could result in a Dollars 1.9bn deficit.
The Democratic-controlled legislature had passed the measure needed to
complete the budget package and wipe out a Dollars 10.7bn deficit.
Mr Wilson's veto did not immediately sink the budget plan, but he has vowed
not to sign the overall spending package until enabling legislation has been
passed.
After weeks of haggling the governor and the legislature have come to terms
on other deep spending cuts - Dollars 1.7bn from health and welfare
programmes and Dollars 1.3bn from aid to local governments.
California has been without a budget since July 1, when the legislature
failed to pass a new spending package on time and the richest US state ran
out of money.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US economy is likely to remain weak in the run-up to November's
presidential election, another batch of disappointing figures indicated
yesterday.
The Purchasing Managers' Index - a closely-watched gauge of conditions in
manufacturing - fell to 53.7 per cent last month, against 54.2 per cent in
July.
The official index of leading indicators rose only 0.1 per cent in July, a
smaller increase than would be expected in a robust recovery. Construction
spending, meanwhile, fell 0.6 per cent, its second consecutive monthly
decline.
The Purchasing Managers' Index remains above the 50 per cent threshold that
indicates an expanding manufacturing sector, but has failed to gain momentum
since the spring and is no higher today than a year ago.
Mr Robert Bretz, a spokesman for purchasing managers, said the economy
continued to grow last month but 'lacked a strong upward momentum'.
He said, however, that a component of the overall index measuring new orders
had remained steady at 59.8 per cent, a relatively high reading. This
suggested growth would continue in coming months.
The index of leading indicators pointed to a flat economy. Five of the 11
indicators - led by building permits - contributed positively while five
dragged it lower. One indicator, the average work week, was statistically
unchanged.
The small rise in the index failed to offset a 0.3 per cent decline in June,
leaving doubts about the pace of growth in coming months.
Yesterday's indicators are the latest in a line of poor figures. This week
the Commerce Department reported an unexpected 2.6 per cent decline in new
home sales in July. This followed reports of falling consumer confidence and
sales of durable goods in July.

FT  02 SEP 92 / World Trade News: EC, US agree to seek end of oilseeds row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR EC and US trade officials agreed yesterday to try for a solution to
their long-running dispute over oilseeds subsidies by the end of this month.
The move confirmed the truce they agreed at the end of July is still
holding, and raises hopes both sides still have their eye on the greater
stakes of an end to the Uruguay Round world trade talks under the aegis of
Gatt.
Washington is delaying a hit list of Dollars 1bn (Pounds 502m) in EC food
and drink exports which would bear punitive tariffs under US trade law. But
the EC would almost certainly retaliate if it felt the US were acting
outside multilateral accords, with the risk the worsening row could scupper
the Uruguay Round.
The oilseeds dispute began in a 1990 Gatt ruling finding that the EC
discriminated against US oilseed exporters, who were guaranteed duty-free
access to the Community during the 1962 Kennedy Round of Gatt talks. The EC
amended its regime in August last year, in line with the reforms to its
Common Agricultural Policy finally pushed through in May.
In April, a reconvened Gatt panel rejected the EC changes as insufficient.
Brussels insists the panel exceeded its brief by basing its judgment on the
'final act' of the Uruguay Round published last December, which as yet has
no agreed status, aspects of which the EC is seeking to negotiate.
The EC responded to one of two options suggested by the April ruling,
offering to negotiate compensation for the US. Washington and the US
soyabean lobby say this does not address damage to soya producers.
Brussels says the EC is acting within Gatt dispute rules, while refusing to
change its oilseed subsidy regime. 'If no deal comes by the end of
September,' one said, 'that doesn't mean the US is entitled to retaliate
unilaterally.' The EC hopes to settle the matter at a Gatt council meeting
on September 29.
The question is whether Gatt and the US will accept that the EC's farm
reform, which switches emphasis from price support to direct income payments
to farmers who must take land out of production to win compensation, will
restrain EC output of all farm produce including oilseeds.
Brussels says it will, and these payments should be allowable in a final
Uruguay Round deal, where it is hoped to include a definitive oilseeds
settlement.

</HEADLINE>

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NICARAGUA'S hopes of receiving more than Dollars 100m (Pounds 50.2m) of
promised aid from Washington have been dealt a blow after a report by the
Republican staff on the US Senate foreign relations committee called for an
indefinite suspension of all US help.
The report on Monday charged that the government of President Violeta
Chamorro is controlled by the left-wing Sandinistas, maintains the largest
army in Central America, has fraudulently channelled money and aid to its
friends, and has failed to return land to US citizens that had been
illegally confiscated.
Mr Antonio Lacayo, the president's son-in-law and minister of the
presidency, described the report as 'false and full of slanders'. But the US
State Department yesterday called the report 'far-reaching and disturbing'
and is sending a delegation to Nicaragua to take up the issues raised.
Ms Deborah De Moss, who wrote the report, said it was almost certain
Nicaragua would not receive the money this year, and that its findings had
received support from both Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
The Dollars 116m of aid has been on hold since the end of May after Mr Jesse
Helms, the right-wing US senator, protested at the continued influence of
the Sandinistas in Mrs Chamorro's government and the failure of the
government to return land to the US citizens.
The aid is critical to Nicaragua's economic stabilisation programme. Were it
to be suspended indefinitely the government would have to slash spending to
keep to IMF targets - an almost impossible task given the budget cuts it has
already made. If it missed IMF targets, further multilateral aid might be
put on hold.
The US administration has agreed Nicaragua will be given Dollars 50m to meet
IMF financial commitments if the government removes Sandinista commanders
from the police force and draws up a strict timetable to reform the army and
return land to US citizens. The remaining Dollars 66m, Ms De Moss said,
should only be issued when all land was returned to the 465 US claimants.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TAIWAN yesterday liberalised its import regime on brandy, vodka, gin and
other spirits, allowing the private sector to import liquor - previously a
government monopoly.
The move came into force the day after Baroness Thatcher, former UK prime
minister, called in Taipei on the Taiwan government to scrap remaining trade
barriers. UK and French trade officials have complained to Taipei of
discriminatory taxes on Scotch and Irish whiskies and French armagnac and
cognac.
As the private guest of Citibank and a Taiwan newspaper, Baroness Thatcher
said: 'You now have an obligation to open your markets to the goods and
services of others, and get rid of restrictions of all sorts.'
Taiwan let private companies import whisky in April last year, when whisky
sales topped Dollars 200m. Scotch and Irish whiskies are subject to a
monopoly sales tax of Dollars 17 a litre; 'other whiskies', mainly US, are
taxed at Dollars 8. French armagnacs and cognacs are taxed twice as much as
other brandies, at Dollars 40 per litre. Officials say higher taxes are
levied on EC liquor for its quality and matching price. So far, private
imports of spirits have been limited to the US and EC.

</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bush is expected to inform Congress soon that he intends to go
ahead with the sale of 72 F-15 aircraft, worth some Dollars 5bn (Pounds
2.5bn), to Saudi Arabia.
Some Jewish leaders said yesterday that they had been informed of the White
House decision and executives of McDonnell Douglas, which manufactures the
aircraft, have been increasingly confident of a favourable response to the
Saudi request.
Before that Mr Bush is likely to announce today his approval for the sale of
150 F-16 aircraft to Taiwan when he visits General Dynamics in Texas. The
sale has been opposed by China.
Saudi Arabia's contribution to the air exclusion zone over southern Iraq,
the presidential election campaign and Mr Bush's decision to support Dollars
10bn in loan guarantees for Israel have all being working in favour of the
F-15 order getting the go-ahead.
The decision will be a disappointment for British Aerospace which was hoping
to fill the gap for Saudi Arabia with additional Tornado aircraft if the
F-15 sale did not proceed.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, strongly criticised the proposed
sale earlier this month and Jewish organisations in the US will campaign
against it, especially if Saudi Arabia is to be sold a variant of the F-15
which is more advanced than those in Israel.
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are the only Gulf countries which publicly backed
the decision by the US, France and Britain to ban Iraqi aircraft from flying
south of the 32nd parallel.
To refuse or further postpone the F-15 sales would be politically
embarrassing to Saudi Arabia at a time when its commitment to the US Gulf
policy has never been stronger.
McDonnell Douglas has also warned Mr Bush that without the Saudi order the
F-15 production line would soon have to be closed with the loss of many
thousands of jobs directly and more in ancillary industries.
With unemployment having risen for most of the past year in the US and Mr
Bush lagging in the opinion polls the president would have to present
powerful arguments for not securing the McDonnell Douglas jobs.
General Dynamics has warned that it will have to dismiss nearly 6,000
workers in Texas, the president's home state, if the Taiwan order is not
approved.
Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic challenger for the presidency, has been
campaigning hard in Texas and believes he has a better than even chance of
capturing the state in November.

FT  02 SEP 92 / A US policy on Iraq that excludes nothing: Bush's tougher
stance may have consequences for all concerned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE possibility of renewed US air strikes against Iraq will remain high  -
at least until voters pass judgment on President George Bush in early
November - but the impact of the latest development in American Middle East
policy seems certain to trouble whoever occupies the White House well beyond
next year.
By creating an air exclusion zone over southern Iraq, Mr Bush has led the US
a step deeper into the quagmire he sought so hard to avoid by limiting the
Gulf war to the expulsion of Iraqi troops from Kuwait.
Saudi Arabia has had to accept an active American military presence for the
foreseeable future, something both sides wanted to avoid. The alliance
created to win the Gulf war victory can no longer stand the strain of public
examination, as has been made clear by the questionable insistence of its
leading members that United Nations Security Council resolutions cover the
present military action. And by providing protection for two thirds of the
Iraqi population, the US, Britain and France must take a greater
responsibility for that country's political evolution.
For obvious political reasons, Mr Bush has chosen to present this latest
military action as essentially humanitarian: to protect the Shia population
of southern Iraq against further suffering at the hands of President Saddam
Hussein. To have suggested that the primary target is the removal of the
Iraqi leader could but cast doubts on his overall Gulf war strategy at an
electorally sensitive moment.
Less than 18 months ago, the Shias of southern Iraq were deemed of far less
consequence to the western-led alliance than the Kurds in the north, even
though their treatment at the hands of Baghdad was equally repugnant. Now,
the Bush administration has persuaded itself that not only are the Iraqi
Shias worthy of protection but that they care little for their
co-religionists in Iran and that Tehran stands faint chance of drawing them
into its sphere of influence.
It is a bold shift of attitude for a government whose priority throughout
the last decade was to contain Iran and its export of militant Islamic
fundamentalism, even to the extent of lending support to Mr Saddam.
One immediate consequence has been to unite most of the Arab world, Iran and
Turkey in opposition to the air exclusion zone which they fear will divide
Iraq into three, with the ruling Sunni minority controlling only the
landlocked central sector and almost none of the country's oil resources.
The longer that Mr Saddam or his group retains power, the less likely it
will be that the Kurds, and eventually the Shias, will be willing to
relinquish the political gains they have made.
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are the only two governments in the Gulf actively
supporting the allied action and by so doing are emphasising, their
dependence on Washington. Early this year, the mood in Riyadh was one of
self-congratulation. The Americans had appeared from over the horizon, had
done the job, been paid and were going home. There must be less jubilation
now. The sound of US warplanes taking off can again be heard. While some
officials in Washington are congratulating themselves on the extra security
provided for western oil supplies, others are wary of the October election
in Kuwait, which is unlikely to enhance the image of that country's rulers.
How these pressures and commitments evolve in the short term may depend on
the fate of Mr Saddam. His support at the centre may have been enhanced by
the new threat posed to the unity of Iraq, but there is no doubt that
sanctions are biting deeper.
If the latter is bearing heavily on the Iraqi leader, he might well step up
his defiance of UN resolutions, sure that Mr Bush will react militarily and
hopeful that the effect will be to distract the public and unite them
against America. He has nothing to gain by accepting the status quo.
The worst that can happen to Mr Bush is that he will not be re-elected,
despite having led his country to its greatest self-acclaimed feat of arms
since the Second World War.
The sight of Mr Saddam still in power would be a miserable bequest to his
successor, the more so since the US has in the past month chosen to bind
itself more closely to unpredictable players, and to events which will not
be controlled by military power alone.
Russia, aligning itself more closely with the west, announced yesterday it
was sending two warships to the Gulf to help enforce United Nations
resolutions on Iraq, Reuter reports from Moscow.
The armed forces chief-of-staff, Colonel-General Viktor Dubynin, told
Itar-Tass news agency that the anti-submarine ship, Admiral Vinogradov, and
a tanker, Boris Butoma, would sail from Vladivostok and be in the Gulf
before the end of the month.

A FURTHER decline in consumer spending in Japan was signaled yesterday by an
18.6 per cent plunge in car sales during August compared with last year.
The decline is one of the steepest on record and is certain to dash any
lingering hopes of a recovery in car sales in the second half of the year.
The severity of the decline is also an indication of a further erosion of
consumer confidence amid signs that Japan's labour market is slackening
considerably.
Total vehicle sales, including trucks, were off by 16.3 per cent, measured
by vehicle registrations.
None of Japan's leading vehicle makers escaped the decline, although Nissan
sales were particularly hard hit, falling 25.2 per cent. Nissan said on
Friday that it expected to post a net loss of Y20bn (Pounds 80.6m) in the
current fiscal year.
Vehicle sales in the first eight months of the year were down by 5.9 per
cent.
Mr Tsutomu Hata, finance minister, said yesterday that the total size of the
government's package of emergency economic measures, announced on Friday,
would reach Y12,200bn, compared to the Y10,700 originally announced. The
increase is accounted for by higher spending by public utilities, including
power and gas companies and by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone.
Mr Yasushi Mieno, the central bank governor, meanwhile said that Japan's
industrial sector needed to continue with extensive cuts in production in
order to reduce excess inventories. Mr Mieno said that the process of
adjusting inventories, which had begun in the spring, had come to a
temporary halt.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE growing problems of the Australian Labor party were underlined yesterday
when Mr John Bannon, premier of South Australia, resigned in the wake of
ADollars 3bn (Pounds 1.1bn) losses incurred by a state-owned bank.
Mr Bannon has been under pressure since it emerged last year that property
lending by State Bank of South Australia would cost taxpayers ADollars
2.5bn, later increased to ADollars 3.15bn.
Mr Bannon, Australia's most senior state leader, said he was taking
political responsibility for the bank's losses to give Labor a chance of
winning the next state election, due in 1994.
However, his departure after 10 years as premier may also mark the beginning
of the end of a decade in which Labor has enjoyed uninterrupted control of
the federal government and dominated the six state governments.
Mr Bannon was one of a group of Labor leaders who rescued the party from
oblivion following the defeat of Mr Gough Whitlam's federal Labor government
during a constitutional crisis in 1975.
The group, which dominated Australian politics through the 1980s, included
Mr Bob Hawke, prime minister from 1983 to 1991, and Mr Neville Wran, Mr John
Cain and Mr Brian Burke, who were respectively premiers of New South Wales,
Victoria and Western Australia.
All have left office in the wake of declining popularity and, in some cases,
financial problems. Mr Burke, who was later ambassador to Ireland, faces
criminal charges in connection with alleged corrupt relationships between
Labor politicians and Western Australian businessmen.
Labor has lost control of New South Wales and Tasmania, and is widely
expected to be defeated in Victoria in October, in Western Australia next
year, and in South Australia in 1994.
The federal government has been revitalised in the last nine months under
the leadership of Mr Paul Keating, but trails the opposition conservative
parties by about 10 percentage points. A federal election must be held by
next June.
The only bright spot for the party is in Queensland, where Labor took office
in 1989 following a corruption inquiry which fatally damaged the former
National party government. Queenslanders are expected to return Labor in an
election later this month.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Tokyo bribery scandal claims leading politician
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN INFLUENTIAL Japanese politician, Mr Kiyoshi Kaneko, the governor of
Niigata prefecture, resigned yesterday, prompting the country to wonder who
will be the next to fall in a scandal over alleged bribes by a parcel
delivery company.
The resignation followed a confession last week by Mr Shin Kanemaru, vice
chairman of the ruling Liberal Democratic party, that his political
secretary had received Y500m (Pounds 2m) from Tokyo Sagawa Kyukyo, a parcel
company.
Mr Kanemaru stepped down as party vice chairman and said he would resign as
leader of the LDP's largest faction, though the faction's members voted
unanimously on Monday for him to retain that post 'to prevent confusion in
the party'.
The downfall of Mr Kaneko, aged 60, apparently came after a tap on the
shoulder from Japanese prosecutors investigating Tokyo Sagawa, alleged to be
behind Y500bn in illegal payments to senior politicians. Money was donated
to win friends in high places, and prosecutors suspect that legislative
favours were sought by the rapidly expanding company.
Mr Kaneko has denied illegally receiving Sagawa donations to support his
1989 election, though his campaign workers have admitted taking at least
Y100m and Japanese newspapers suggest that his office received Y300m. The
governor said it is 'not appropriate' to comment on the allegations until
the investigation is completed.
'For several days, I contemplated my future actions and decided to take
political, ethical and all responsibilities for the confusion incurred in
prefectural politics,' Mr Kaneko told prefectural officials in Niigata, on
the western coast of Japan.
Under the Political Funds Control Law, an individual can donate a maximum of
Y1.5m to a politician, while companies capitalised at more than Y105bn are
permitted to donate as much as Y100m to a party or politician over a year.
Mr Kaneko's resignation is another stain on the LDP, as he was supported by
the ruling party and had frequent contact with Mr Kanemaru, regarded as the
party's power-broker because of his ability to raise campaign cash.
Tokyo Sagawa was able to cultivate ties with senior politicians because of
the enormous cost of Japanese political campaigns, and lists are circulating
in Nagatacho, Tokyo's political district, naming a dozen politicians said to
be under investigation for receiving Sagawa money.

Officials said the economy may improve in the second half as the onset of

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Suharto of Indonesia, opening the summit of the Non-Aligned
Movement (NAM) yesterday, warned that 'the new world order' had yet to
change the 'old patterns of domination of the strong over the weak and rich
over the poor'.
He spoke of 'the absurdity of net financial resources now flowing from the
developing world to the developed countries' and was supported by Mr Boutros
Boutros Ghali, secretary general of the United Nations, who described
poverty as 'the last challenge we must take up at the close of the century'.
Mr Suharto called for the 'revitalisation, restructuring and
democratisation' of the UN. This received the tacit backing of Mr Boutros
Ghali who told delegates 'the voice of the Third World, the voice of three
quarters of men and women who live on this planet, must be represented,
heard and understood'. Mr Boutros Ghali said NAM and the UN had 'produced a
story of partnership and practical co-operation' but, in a review of his
organisation, he noted many of its activities were focused on NAM member
states.
He estimated at 15,000 the military personnel under UN command in the former
Yugoslavia - a founding member of NAM. Almost 2m refugees there were under
UN care.
The secretary general said the UN in Somalia was operating 'under conditions
of military hostility' and planned to increase its forces from 500 to 3,500
to assist the famine relief effort. In Afghanistan, the UN is pressing for a
cessation of hostilities and organising humanitarian aid, while in Cambodia
it is engaged in 'a vast effort at post-conflict nation-building'.
Mr Boutros Ghali said the end of the Cold War was 'a harbinger of concord
and unity', but he warned 'the temptation to dominate, either worldwide or
regionally, remains'.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Somalia provides key test of UN resolve: Other African
states may need to be pulled from the debris of the Cold War
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations decision to commit at least 4,200 blue berets and support
staff to help restore order and distribute humanitarian relief in
war-ravaged Somalia represents the most dangerous and extensive operation
the UN has undertaken in black Africa.
The move could also establish a precedent for the role of the UN in the
post-Cold War era on a continent beset by crises, civil war and famine
caused by ethnic conflicts.
Not since the Katanga crisis in southern Zaire in the early 1960s has the UN
sent armed troops to a conflict in Africa.
And although last week's unanimous decision by the Security Council to
dispatch a substantial force to Somalia was taken for ostensibly
humanitarian reasons - relief workers are trying to alleviate starvation
threatening 4.5m people - it is inevitable that the UN will be sucked into
an even greater role in peacekeeping operations and forging a political
settlement between the warring clan factions.
Some observers even go as far as to say that given the complete collapse of
government, law and order and civil society the UN will be forced to
consider some form of trusteeship for Somalia before the process of nation
rebuilding can begin.
Behind the Security Council's decision lie a number of factors:
international criticism that the UN has not done enough to prevent
starvation in Somalia; guilt that the world is paying more attention to the
'rich man's war' in Yugoslavia and ignoring the plight of faraway,
impoverished Africans; the interventionist bent of Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali,
the secretary general who has pushed harder than any other UN official for a
fully fledged military intervention; the relatively recent opportunity
created for armed intervention in Africa by the end of the east-west
conflict; and a growing recognition that solving Africa's problems when the
rot has set in so deeply is going to take a sustained international effort
and significant resources.
More importantly the decision also recognises a principle long argued by
African relief experts themselves: that saving human lives must override the
surreal claims to sovereignty made by African warlords, dictators and rebel
leaders.
For the past 18 months a group of African intellectuals has said that the
world's acceptance of this humanitarian principle in Kurdistan last year, in
the face of opposition from President Saddam Hussein should be extended to
Africa.
They say that a number of other African countries such as Sudan, Zaire,
Angola, Mozambique and Liberia - all victims of the Cold War - either have
disintegrated into ethnically-based civil war and famine or are in danger of
doing so and therefore should be candidates for some kind of international
intervention despite the opposition of their putative governments which make
claims to sovereignty.
The risks of not intervening now, they say, are that the situation will only
deteriorate further until images of skeletal children dying from starvation,
like those from Somalia, will become increasingly commonplace in the
continent.
'The west has got to stop responding to Africa's crises on an emergency
basis when it is too late to save hundreds of thousands of innocent women
and children who give no legitimacy to the governments which claim to
represent them,' Mr Abdul Mohamed, an expert on humanitarian relief in the
Horn of Africa, said yesterday.
'We've got to get beyond the band aid mentality - rushing in when the alarm
bells have almost stopped ringing because everybody is dead. We must work to
create some longer term preventative solutions so the crises stop being
endemic.'
Somalia is a fitting place for the UN to start given that both Washington
and Moscow, who played cold war politics by proxy in the Horn of Africa and
built up a huge weapons stockpile, bear so much responsibility for the
severe crisis now facing the devastated country.
However, whether the UN intervention in Somalia will mark the beginning of a
fundamentally new approach to intervention in Africa's disaster cases will
depend on the success of an operation which is fraught with dangers.
Last Friday, two unarmed UN military observers, part of an international
team of 50, were shot and serious wounded by clan gunmen in the anarchic
capital of Mogadishu. Several of Somalia's warlords, particularly General
Mohamed Farar Aideed, leader of the coalition Somali National Alliance and
Colonel Omar Jess, leader of the Somali Patriotic Movement which controls
the area around the southern port of Kismayo, have threatened in the past
that they will attack UN troops who enter the territories they hold without
their permission.
The prospect of shoot-outs between blue berets and marauding Somali gunmen,
at least in the initial phase of the operation, is almost inevitable.
Such a situation will call for determined action rather than faint hearts
and it is unclear if the UN has the political will to risk the loss of lives
of blue berets in an African basketcase with no economic or geopolitical
importance.
Furthermore, given that the numbers of troops will probably have to be
increased significantly as the operation unfolds, the UN will have to make
the decision about whether it is prepared to cover the extensive costs of
such an operation.
Already estimates suggest that the first six months of the military
operation will cost at least Dollars 130m (Pounds 65.3m).
Observers say that if that commitment is missing the UN intervention, on a
short-term and limited basis, could cause more problems than it solves.
However, if the commitment is there, Somalia could prove the testing ground
for a positive UN role in contributing to resolving the crises which are
afflicting the continent.

THE TROIKA of EC foreign ministers will arrive in Johannesburg today on a
two-day visit in which they hope to finalise a proposal to dispatch up to 20
European observers to monitor township violence in South Africa.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, left London yesterday to
head the mission, which the ministers hope might also catalyse progress
towards a resumption South Africa's stalled constitutional talks.
With Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the Danish foreign minister, Mr Fernando Diez
Barroso, the Portuguese deputy foreign minister and Mr Hans Andriessen, the
EC Commissioner for external affairs, he will meet leaders from all parties
to the talks and members of the National Peace Secretariat, with which the
EC observers would work.
The observers, to be drawn from experts in community policing across the EC,
will join those already pledged by the Commonwealth under a United Nations
sponsored plan to assist South Africa's year-old National Security Accord
monitor and end violence in the townships.
Between 30 and 50 observers are expected to take part in the proposed
monitoring.
The EC ministers also expect to discuss ways in which they could offer
material support, perhaps including training, for the South African police.
Their visit will include a trip tomorrow to the Alexandra township for talks
with a local dispute resolution committee formed as part of the peace
accord.
The EC team saw signs that parties to the Convention for a Democratic South
Africa are inching towards a possible resumption of talks.
Former Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda said yesterday he had accepted an
invitation to mediate between the African National Congress and the Inkatha
Freedom party, Reuter reports from Lusaka.
The invitation had come from the peace secretariat.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Management: Thanks for the memory - Health Check
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Dr MICHAEL MCGANNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Modern managers are always complaining of memory loss. They say they cannot
remember conversations, dates, names and appointments. Help is at hand: in
the vast majority of cases, mild memory lapses can be corrected.
Judging by the growing weight of literature on the subject, there is no
single memory system, but multiple systems with different functions. Memory
functions can be divided into two: declarative (or explicit), in which we
learn and remember with awareness, and non-declarative (or implicit) in
which we learn without being aware of the process of information storage and
retrieval. This process is a delicate one, and can be affected by your
life-style.
Memory failures are often due as much to a failure to acquire and store
information, as to disruptions in the process of transforming the
information into more permanent memories.
There is some evidence that the memory works better if the individual is in
the same state of mind at the time of retrieval as at the time of storage.
This could mean that if you are given information after having had a few
drinks, you will be better able to retrieve it in the same inebriated state.
Throughout the literature on memory, there is constant reference to
attention or awareness. This is one of the keys to better memory. If you are
mentally 'elsewhere', you have little chance of registering that bit of
information. The more you perceive the information to be trivial, the less
likely you will be to recall it.
To an extent, this is normal. You are bombarded with facts and faces all
day, every day: your brain censors what you should retain and store. Without
this function, you would be buried under mountains of useless information.
Memory skills can be developed with practice and with regular use.
Attend to to the present moment. A useful drill to practise at the airport,
on planes or in traffic jams is to bring your mind to focus on a single
object in front of you (such as a pencil) and concentrate on it for one
minute. It may not sound long, but within 20 seconds or so, your active mind
will be distracted and will tend to drift.
Another trick is to make a conscious effort to pay attention to the names of
people you are meeting for the first time. This not only helps you to
remember the names, it is provides good practice for being in the present
moment.
To reinforce the connections between ideas as they are stored, try using
mnemonic devices, tools designed to link otherwise isolated ideas.
Generations of music students have used the mnemonic devise 'Every Good Boy
Deserves Fudge' to learn the notes on the lines on the treble clef. Create
your own mnemonics to give you 'memory handles'.
Get plenty of exercise to bathe the brain memory centres in oxygen-rich
blood.
Get enough rest to let the brain relax after a day of stimulus bombardment.
This includes five minute 'power naps' and deep breathing during the day.
Fatigue will impair your concentration and your ability to remember.
Excessive alcohol and uncompensated stress will also compromise your memory
skills.
The author is the medical director of the Insead Business Health course.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Management: Bouquets in a French vineyard - Nicholas Lander
looks at a project which employs mentally handicapped people
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chateau de Lastours, a wine property which employs only the mentally
handicapped, sprawls over crags above the motorway that joins the South of
France to Spain.
Since Lastours first released wine in 1977 it has won on average 12 prizes
every year.
It exports all over the world - Belgium, Switzerland, Japan and Germany -
with the UK the biggest market. It has insisted on quality, and then used
this as a management tool to instil pride in its workforce.
The windswept piece of land was bought for a mere FFr600,000 (Pounds 63,000)
in 1970 by the Comite Centrale d'Enterprise of a Marseille bank, Societe
Marseillaise de Credit, and established as a Centre d'Aide par le Travail.
Comites centrales were established by Charles de Gaulle in 1945 to encourage
companies to set up organisations to look after the welfare of their staff.
The Marseille bank doubled the amount available for investment and specified
it should be for the mentally handicapped.
The scheme appealed to Jean-Marie Ligneres, hired as a newly-qualified
oenologist in 1970, who has been managing director of Lastours since 1977.
He recognised that he would have to supply the mentally handicapped
workforce not just with an occupation but work that would produce recognised
results. That way, he felt, their handicap could be lessened.
The rebuilding of Lastours took seven years and the first vines were planted
in 1973. Fifty hectares of stones were cleared by outside contractors.
A village of small apartments, including married quarters, was built for the
workers; there are tennis courts, rugby and football pitches and a swimming
pool and all the buildings necessary for the making and ageing of the wine.
The total investment by 1980 was FFr50m.
Today, Lastours exudes the bustle, as well as the commitment, of a kibbutz.
Visitors are continually drawn by new exhibitions and concerts as well as
wine.
During the 1970's a big management decision was taken. As work on the
vineyard neared completion, Ligneres realised that there would be a need for
someone with specific psychological expertise at the top. Aware that two
'chiefs' might lead to conflict, Ligneres enrolled as a psychology student,
first at Montpellier then Toulouse.
His doctoral thesis awarded in 1983 stressed that the mentally handicapped
must be offered the possibility of being involved in the whole work process
rather than repetitive, bitty jobs which allow them neither contact with the
finished product nor bring recognition and dignity.
From the beginning Lastours has concentrated on red wines rather than white
because red wine making offers more processes for the whole team to be
involved in. Red wine takes two years to make compared with nine months for
white wine and it also offers the possibility of ageing and cellar work
which most white wines do not.
Ligneres has involved all his staff in every process from the back-breaking
pruning of the vines to the more sociable manning of wine stands in France
and abroad.
Limited to a workforce of 60, of whom a third are women, Lastours is
inundated with applications for places. The working week is 40 hours of
which five are stipulated compulsory recreational time, and the pay is about
FFr1,800 per month plus board and lodging.
Recruiting good management has been the toughest challenge. The reputation
of Lastours has attracted more than sufficient applicants, although Ligneres
occasionally wishes for the fresh ideas that a higher staff turnover might
bring. He manages with a team of 40, including ancillary workers, 12
specialist teachers, a psychiatrist who visits for three hours a week and a
psychologist for six hours a week.
As a financial organisation, Lastours is in an unusual position because it
pays no interest to its bank.
Last year it generated a turnover of more than FFr50m and although it has
been in profit since 1990, it stresses that all profits are and will be
reinvested.
This somewhat artificial financial environment can make its competitors
jealous - particularly when in 1987 Lastours declassified a lesser vintage
to maintain its reputation.
Although commercial considerations are important, they are secondary at
Lastours. Growth has consistently been 40-50 per cent a year but the company
has to ensure that the wine's success does not put too much pressure on the
workforce.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Management: Back at work but life is still one long holiday
 -Diane Summers examines the problem of flagging productivity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Holidays are supposed to refresh employees and allow them to return to work
full of enthusiasm. Productivity, it might be thought, would increase after
a break.
The opposite is true, according to Helen Pitcher, a director of personnel
consultants Cedar International.
August has come to an end, and with it the traditional holiday season - but
British industry, far from operating on full throttle, is still idling, she
says.
Pitcher first noticed employees' poor productivity after holidays by
examining the computer records of her own company. Cedar has 10 consultants
and 11 other staff who are engaged in research and administration.
Everyone at Cedar fills in an electronic timesheet, allocating the hours
they have worked in a day between 'chargeable' and 'admin' time.
'We do an analysis of the accounts each month and we found a substantial
drop in productivity over the summer.
'We thought that was because people were away but then we discovered the dip
continued well beyond the holidays,' says Pitcher.
Timesheets showed that chargeable hours were lower and admin hours were
higher after an employee returned from holiday. Admin is the 'dump code' for
hours spent chatting by the coffee machine, she explains.
A close look at the figures also revealed lower productivity before an
employee went on holiday, and showed that work done before an individual
went away was often of a lower standard.
Comparing notes with other companies, Pitcher found the syndrome was common.
'Line managers complained that first there was the time lost before a
holiday when employees were running around getting their currency and
tickets.
'Then there was the rush to get work finished and the increase in mistakes;
next was the return, the showing of photographs, and so on; finally there
was the slow process of getting back into the swing of things.'
Managers are often afraid of appearing to be kill-joys, says Pitcher.
'They're not very good about saying 'I'm glad you had a good holiday, can
you now concentrate on the job please?'' she says.
Pitcher calculates that five days should be added to each week of holiday to
arrive at the true cost of time off.
Figures from Incomes Data Services, the pay and conditions research group,
show the most common basic holiday entitlement is 25 days in the UK - the
figure is not very different elsewhere in Europe - and added to that are
eight days for bank holidays in the UK, making at least 33 days off.
Using Pitcher's formula, employees lose a total of 66 productive days
because of holidays.
Cary Cooper, professor of organisational psychology at Manchester
University's Institute of Science and Technology, is not surprised by
Pitcher's findings.
'There's a sort of 'holiday infection' that contaminates everyone around the
person who has been away,' he says.
As a stress guru, Cooper is emphatic that the solution is not to cut
holidays. 'We need them, there's no question about that,' he says.
Instead of the two- or three-week holiday, taken at the peak of the season,
he suggests shorter, more frequent breaks.
Not only is this better for the individual, he argues, but the employer also
benefits. With shorter holidays there is not the big build-up associated
with longer breaks.
There is less chat, less disruption of colleagues' work and a shorter time
to get over disappointment if the holiday has not measured up to
expectations.
The shorter, more frequent break can also be taken when an individual
actually needs it. The tell-tale signs are: constant irritation, difficulty
in concentrating, hostility, losing a sense of humour, and not listening to
people.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Labour council tackles Nalgo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LABOUR-led council has for the first time acted against a trade union
under Conservative employment laws. The public sector union, Nalgo, was
yesterday ordered by a High Court judge to call off a month-long strike
involving 1,100 council staff in the London borough of Newham.
Mrs Justice Ebsworth granted Newham Council an injunction against the union.
The strike followed a ballot at the end of July over compulsory redundancies
in the authority's poll tax collection department. Nalgo will appeal today.
The judgment is the first to apply Section 7 (3) of the Employment Act 1990
in testing what a union may do in the days preceding a ballot.
The judge said it was 'clearly arguable' that the union had promoted the
strike call before the ballot and was therefore in breach of union
legislation. The act says there must be no call for action or authorisation
of such action before the ballot.
Counsel for Newham said that before the ballot of the council's Nalgo
members, in which about 63 per cent voted for the indefinite stoppage, the
union's executive had authorised the escalation of a strike over compulsory
redundancies at the council's benefits and housing section.
The judge ruled, however, that there was a genuine trade dispute in
progress.

FT  02 SEP 92 / TUC pressure mounts on Willis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN WILLIS, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, is under
strong pressure to clarify his future on the eve of this year's annual TUC
congress in Blackpool.
Mr Willis, who will today open the traditional pre-congress press
conference, has so far made no response to growing speculation that he will
announce his early retirement today or, more likely, at the TUC general
council meeting tomorrow.
TUC colleagues say that Mr Willis, who is 59, has privately indicated his
intention not to carry on until he is 65. But he has never spelt out when he
might retire.
Several senior union leaders say that if Mr Willis does not announce that he
will go either in January, when he is 60, or at next year's congress, they
will force him out.
Most senior union leaders are privately critical of Mr Willis's eight-year
leadership of the TUC and hope he will leave within a year, but none has
told him so to his face.
Speculation about Mr Willis's future is an annual pre-congress event, but
the doubts are widely believed to be more serious this year. Several
colleagues and union leaders believe he is unlikely to last more than one
further congress in his post.
The pressure is stronger, partly because last year's pre-general election
reluctance to rock the boat has disappeared. More important, Mr Willis can
no longer count on the backing of the TGWU general union. Mr Ron Todd, the
former TGWU general secretary, prevented any move against Mr Willis but Mr
Bill Morris, the new leader, feels less loyalty.
It had been thought that one of the biggest obstacles to persuading Mr
Willis to leave voluntarily was his commitment to the European Trades Union
Congress, where he has served a year of a four-year presidency. Some TUC
officials, however, suggest it would be possible for Mr Willis to continue
in office at the ETUC for a year or two after leaving his TUC job.
If Mr Willis does announce his departure he is almost certain to be
succeeded by Mr John Monks, his deputy, who is already effectively in
day-to-day control of the organisation. The new deputy leader is likely to
be Mr Brendan Barber, head of policy and organisation.
The TUC has calculated that the percentage of manufacturing company profits
allocated as dividends has risen from 22.8 per cent in 1985 to 74 per cent
last year. It complains that this reduces the amount companies have from
their own income for investment.
This calculation, slightly higher than estimates made by the Bank of
England, is based on Central Statistical Office data covering all
incorporated companies and not only quoted ones. The figure appears in a TUC
memorandum on industrial partnership and competitiveness which has been sent
to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary.
The document also stresses that there is an important link between
short-term attitudes to employment - exemplified in the 'hire and fire'
culture - and short-termism in other aspects of corporate strategy. The TUC
says that labour market de-regulation has encouraged employers to compete
exclusively on price and not on design and quality.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Hopes raised for report on failed bank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE were indications last night that an official report into the Pounds
42m collapse of an Isle of Man bank may soon be published.
They came after two former senior executives of Savings and Investment Bank
were among five men who appeared for sentencing at Manchester Crown Court
yesterday for conspiracy to defraud shareholders and creditors of a company
in fraudulent land deals.
About 4,000 investors lost money when the bank collapsed in 1982. But the
Chadwick Report into the collapse was not published because Mr Robert
Killin, the bank's managing director, and Mr John Cunningham, general
manager, faced criminal charges.
The two men were among five found guilty of fraud by a jury at Manchester
Crown Court. They used the bank's money in a Pounds 550,000 fraud over a
land deal in Lancashire.
Manx MPs later voted for 'modest' ex-gratia payments for investors but
shelved the decision until they had seen the Chadwick Report's conclusions.
Mr Fred Kissack, Manx government chief secretary, said last night the
decision on whether to allow publication rested with the island's High
Court, which commissioned the report and had been waiting for the mainland
trial to finish.
He said that on the assumption the court would allow publication, 'then we
will publish'.
The court was told that plots in Baxenden, Lancashire, and Rastrick, West
Yorkshire, were each bought for Pounds 80,000 by three of the men. But
Pennine Commercial Holdings paid Pounds 635,000 and Pounds 180,000 for them,
said Mr Roderick Carus QC, prosecuting.
Mr David Knott, Pennine's managing director, directly benefited from the
illicit profit of the Pounds 550,000 Baxenden deal, the court heard. So did
Mr Killin, of Southport, and Mr Cunningham, of Newton Mearns, Glasgow.
Mr Carus said the Rastrick land was bought by Mr Geoffrey Tankard, a
Bradford solicitor of Ilkley, West Yorkshire. He was Pennine's chairman and
benefited from the inflated value when he sold it on to the company. He also
agreed to the other fraudulent deal, the court heard.
Mr Carus said that legal executive Mr Ronald Brockenbrow, of Chorlton,
Manchester, who was the secretary and a director of Pennine, knew of the
improper trading, while surveyor Mr Roderick Heaton, of Chelmsford, provided
a false valuation to justify the price Pennine paid for one plot.
Mr Knott admitted conspiracy in August 1989. He was jailed for six months
with the balance of a two-year term suspended.
Mr Cunningham and Mr Tankard were given 12-month jail sentences and Mr
Brockenbrow and Mr Heaton six months, all fully suspended. Mr Killin will be
sentenced later date.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Review of fines for late VAT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CUSTOMS and Excise has launched a review of its default surcharge system for
companies that do not pay value added tax contributions on time, after
criticisms of its operation.
The review comes as part of a wider examination of the VAT penalties system
announced earlier this year. It will examine the effectiveness of the system
of progressive penalties - designed to encourage timely compliance.
The system has been criticised as indiscriminate, providing insufficient
warning before fines are incurred, and for being particularly hard on small
businesses.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Luxury car production suffers sharp decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRODUCTION by loss-making specialist carmakers fell sharply in the first
half of this year under the impact of the recession in the UK and in
important foreign markets.
Output by Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, a subsidiary of Vickers, was 43 per cent
lower than in the corresponding period a year ago at 618, while production
by Jaguar, a subsidiary of Ford of the US, fell 25 per cent to 10,260.
Group Lotus, a subsidiary of General Motors of the US, suffered a 68 per
cent fall in output to 505 from 1,559 in the first half of last year. Aston
Martin, the luxury sports carmaker which is 75 per cent owned by Ford,
produced only 23 cars in the first half compared with 121 a year earlier.
Jaguar, Aston Martin and Lotus have all announced further redundancies
recently, while Lotus has been forced to abandon production of its main
model, the loss-making Elan sports car.
TVR, the privately-owned sports-car maker based in Blackpool, was the only
specialist producer to buck the trend with a 9.1 per cent increase in
production to 420.
According to figures released by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders, overall car output in the first half of the year declined by 1.1
per cent to 686,747.
Rover, a subsidiary of British Aerospace, was hardest hit among the volume
carmakers with an 11 per cent fall in output to 203,822 (including
production of the Honda Concerto, the Land Rover Discovery and Range Rover).
Nissan provided the main boost to UK volume car output with an 18 per cent
increase to 74,214.
UK commercial vehicle output jumped by 25 per cent in the first half of the
year to 138,925. Land Rover, the four-wheel drive vehicle division of Rover,
is raising output of its Discovery range by 10 per cent from 500 to 550 a
week in response to higher demand from the UK and overseas markets.
The company said yesterday that in spite of weakening demand for new cars in
Europe, sales of four-wheel drive leisure vehicles had remained strong.
The Discovery, which was introduced in the UK in late 1989, has been helped
by launches in Japan, Australia and the Middle East in the past 12 months.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Company 'green' reports criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEWER THAN half the companies mentioning environmental issues in their
annual reports are providing information of much value, according to Company
Reporting, the Edinburgh-based monthly monitoring service.
In a sample of 570 company reports 23 per cent address environmental
matters, compared with 10 per cent in a survey in July last year.
But 12 per cent of the sample contained statements which are 'usually vague
or meaningless, lacking any real information content', Company Reporting
says.
Nine per cent of companies disclosed specific details on their environmental
policies, compared with 5 per cent in the previous survey. Even among those
providing this information, there was wide variation in the level of detail.
Only three companies - Imperial Chemical Industries, RTZ and Thames Water -
disclosed the costs of environmental protection measures adopted.
An environmental audit - in which the company's performance was
independently scrutinised - was mentioned by 3 per cent of companies, but
none gave details of the results or measures taken to address issues raised
by the audits.
Company Reporting says Ford and Grand Metropolitan are among the better
examples of reports giving information on 'green' issues. It highlights
statements by BAT, British Airways, Hanson and Allied Lyons as 'of little
value'. In a separate analysis, Company Reporting notes that 19 per cent of
companies publish a statement of corporate objectives.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Inept east German police fail to act
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE COLITT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE near-paralysis of the east German police in the face of rightwing
violence against asylum seekers in Rostock last week may have surprised
those who recall the swift suppression of opposition by the Communist police
state before its collapse in 1989.
It also contrasted sharply with the tough tactics used by the west German
police against many of the protesters at the economic summit in Munich in
July.
But the police in the former East Germany - as in other Communist countries
 -were in reality a remarkably inept arm of coercion. Far more effective
intimidation was assured by the all-seeing state security force, the Stasi,
and its tens of thousands of informers.
'Policemen in the East were part of the system of blindly obeying orders,'
says Mr Dieter Schenk, deputy president of the Berlin police.
Rank and file policemen were generally loyal servants of the old regime.
After unification their senior officers remained largely in place and only
at the top were commanders replaced by west German officials.
In a state unable to conceive of any threat but a political conspiracy,
legions of police often proved incapable of coping with riots by football
hooligans. These were the forerunners of the frustrated youths in Rostock's
Lichtenhagen estate last week.
The fall of communism, and the police's patent ineffectiveness in halting
this, led the inedemoralised force to adopt a virtually invisible profile
after unification. This was dramatically evident in Rostock at the start of
the rightwing attacks.
Some of the problems encountered in east Germany were avoided in eastern
Berlin, where policemen in the eastern part of the city East were
immediately assigned a Western 'minder' counterpart after unification.
The trouble in Rostock obliged Bonn to draft in thousands of reinforcements
from the west to back up the eastern force and prompted Monday's
announcement that the five east German states would get help setting up
special anti-extremist surveillance units.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Yugoslav president backs Panic
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR MILAN PANIC, prime minister of the unrecognised rump state of Yugoslavia,
was yesterday fighting for his political survival, as the country's
president, Mr Dobrica Cosic, swung his weight behind him.
He faces a no-confidence motion, possibly on Friday. It is seen as the
beginning of a showdown in his power struggle with Serbia's President
Slobodan Milosevic.
Mr Cosic, a writer regarded as the spiritual leader of all Serbs, said he
was 'surprised' by the motion brought against Mr Panic by Serbia's governing
Socialists.
Defeat for Mr Panic could mean an end to the peace process and the London
conference, which has already lost momentum since failing to agree a
timetable to halt fighting in the Balkans.
Mr Cosic is said to be prepared to back Mr Panic, the Belgrade-born US
millionaire seen by many Serbs as the only figure who can rescue them from
international isolation.
In a TV interview last night Mr Panic said: 'We (Yugoslavia) have promised a
lot and signed at least 60 agreements but we have never said 'Sorry it's our
fault' when the agreement was broken. The world, I must say publicly, sees
Mr Milosevic as a man who does not keep his word.' His interview is likely
to shock viewers in Serbia unaccustomed to criticism of Mr Milosevic and
Serbia's role in Bosnia.
The motion of no-confidence in Mr Panic is being backed by 68 Socialist and
ultra-nationalist Serbian Radical deputies, who accuse him of betraying
Serbian interests at the London conference.
Serb forces yesterday were reported to have lifted their five-month siege of
Gorazde. The mostly Moslem defenders gained control of the town where 70,000
people have been trapped with little food and medicine. Serb fighters
withdrew 12 miles from the town, according to eyewitnesses. It was unclear
whether fighting would continue.
Five members of the UN force in Sarajevo were wounded in a mortar attack
last night, Reuter reports. An Egyptian colonel and two French officers were
seriously injured and two other French soldiers slightly wounded.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Moslem victims locked up in cattle sheds: Lara Marlowe
visits two Serb prison camps in Bosnia with a CSCE delegation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LARA MARLOWE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVER the next few days, a delegation from the Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe, will report back after an inquiry into human rights
in Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Led by Sir John Thomson, a former British ambassador to the United Nations,
it visited prison camps set up by the Serbs in Bosnia. The Serbian
authorities claim the camps at Manjaca and Trnopolje, both visited by Sir
John's delegation, are the only ones left in north-western Bosnia. However,
relief officials suspect thousands of Moslem women and children - the
families of the men imprisoned in the other two camps - may be held at
Duboj, north of the republic.
Most are victims of the 'ethnic cleansing' of the Kozarac community near
Prijedor, where 22,000 people have been expelled from their homes.
Serbian officials want to exchange prisoners for Serbs held by Moslems. They
expressed anger at the international outcry over the camps and told the CSCE
delegation that 6,000 Serbs allegedly held in Croatian and Moslem-run camps
had been ignored. At Manjaca, high in the mountains near Banja Luka, 3,640
male prisoners are housed in the cattle sheds a former dairy farm surrounded
by barbed wire, Alsatian guard dogs, watch-towers and minefields.
Lt Col Bozidar Popovic, the camp commander, claimed to Sir John that all the
inmates were military POWs. But humanitarian aid officials who have
interviewed them concluded that all but four of the internees - including
390 men under the age of 16 or over the age of 60 - are civilian victims of
'ethnic cleansing'.
Although some have gained 20 kilos since food improved with visits to the
camp, many still appear emaciated. Col Popovic, who shouts at all times and
frequently cites the Geneva Convention, is apparently trying to blackmail
the Bosnian government, led by President Alija Izetbegovic, and relief
officials by refusing to make preparations for winter, saying that he hopes
'humanism will prevail on the other side'.
The transfer of Manjaca's Moslem prisoners to the Moslem-held area of Bosnia
might alleviate the men's suffering and in some cases allow them to be
reunited with their families. But it would also aid the Serbs in achieving
their goal of an 'ethnically pure' Serbian Bosnia.
The 2,000 inhabitants of the Trnopolje 'open reception centre' in
north-western Bosnia, live just a few km from their former homes in Kozarac
and can see the minaret of their mosque from the carpark where they sit
shirtless in the hot sun under makeshift tents.
The prisoners say that more than 5,000 Moslems from Kozarac were killed by
Serbian militiamen when the town was 'cleansed' late in May.
As Sir John discovered, some are allowed to walk to their plundered and
dynamited houses to pick fruit from their gardens.
Serbian refugees have moved into the few homes that were left standing.
In theory, the Moslems are free to leave, but they have no homes to return
to - in most cases, they have been completely destroyed - and Serbian gunmen
near the camp fire shots at night to intimidate prisoners.
Mr Milomir Stakic, the mayor of Prijedor, told the CSCE delegation that the
Serbs were fighting 'Moslem extremists' in Kozarac, and that Moslem
survivors of the fighting there continue to attack Serbian forces from the
nearby Kozara Mountains - once a Serbian stronghold against the Germans.
But the Moslems, indistinguishable from their fellow south Slavs, are
secular. Even in the few Mosques still standing, there is not the slightest
hint of fundamentalism, either in dress or ritual.
In regions which have not yet been completely ethnically cleansed, Moslem
households are required to fly a white flag to show they have no weapons in
their house, and 'as a sign of our loyalty', says the local Imam in the
village of Cela, about 15km from Trnopolje.
The white flag on the Cela mosque did not stop drunken Serbian soldiers from
setting fire to it in August, killing an old Moslem man and throwing his
body into a well. Fifteen men were arrested and held for several days for
'interrogation'. One never returned. Another has been sent to the Manjaca
prison camp. The Imam has stopped making prayer calls from the minaret, and
villagers have promised not to hold any meetings.
A Serbian policeman stands outside the mosque each Friday, presumably to
monitor sermons. Villagers are afraid to travel into Prijedor.
'We have made a deal with the local Serb authorities. We will not oppose
them, and they will not harm us and they will protect us,' the Imam told Sir
John and his fellow delegates who are to draft a report on their visit when
they return to London at the weekend.
'Until now they have kept their word. But we don't know about the future.'
Back in neighbouring Croatia, western diplomats have little hope in the
implementation of the London Conference. Few believe that even if Bosnia's
Serbs give back a tiny percentage of the territory they have seized, they
will allow the Moslems to return.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Bulgaria to resume paying debt interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BULGARIA WILL start paying off overdue interest on its Dollars 12bn foreign
debt on September 15, ending a break of more than two years in debt
repayments, Mr Ivan Kostov, finance minister, said yesterday, Reuter reports
from Sofia. 'The first payment will be 25 per cent of Bulgaria's overdue
interest,' he said.
Bulgaria's last communist government suspended payments of principal on
foreign debt in March 1990 and froze interest payments in June of that year.
The country owes Dollars 10bn to more than 300 commercial banks and Dollars
2bn to the Paris Club of official creditors.
Mr Kostov said Bulgaria would pay Dollars 10m each month but did not specify
how the money would be shared between the commercial banks and official
creditors. He also said further negotiations with the London Club of
commercial creditors had been set for October 5.
The start of payments would not affect the exchange rate between the
Bulgarian lev and the dollar on the Bulgarian currency market, where daily
turnover is around Dollars 40m.
Last month, Mr Kostov called on the Bulgarian central bank to scale down its
dollar buying on the foreign exchange market in a move interpreted by
economists as an attempt to boost the lev to make dollar-denominated debt
repayments cheaper. But the bank countered by saying that the lev had
strengthened against the dollar and that the currency had achieved internal
convertibility.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN politicians are warning of a possible foreign boycott of German
products and a halt in investments in east Germany as a result of continuing
militant rightwing attacks on asylum seekers in the East.
Mr Heiner Geissler, deputy parliamentary leader of the Christian Democratic
(CDU-CSU) party, yesterday cautioned against the danger of a boycott if
people believed internationally that racism was being resurrected in
Germany.
'Every third job (in Germany) is dependent on foreigners buying our goods,'
Mr Geissler said.
This week right-wing militants in Brandenburg, which surrounds Berlin,
assaulted hostels for asylum seekers in Cottbus and two other towns.
Brandenburg had previously attracted pledges of considerable foreign
investment and was held in high esteem among its foreign partners, he said.
More than 100 policemen in Cottbus prevented almost as many young extremists
on Monday night from assaulting a hostel filled with nearly 1,000 asylum
seekers. The youths had attacked the hostel on the previous three nights.
Young right-wingers also threw stones at a hostel housing mainly Romanian
gypsies near Leipzig who had fled there after their tents were set afire on
Sunday.
A group of youths also hurled Molotov cocktails and paving stones on Monday
night at a hostel for foreigners in Lubz in the state of
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
The attacks against asylum seekers began there last week in Rostock.
The previous night a monument in Berlin to tens of thousands of Jews sent to
the death camps by train from 1940 to 1944 was badly damaged by explosives.
Mr Eberhard Diepgen, Berlin's Mayor, condemned the attack as an 'ugly
provocation.'
Mr Rudolf Seiters, the German Interior Minister, announced at an emergency
meeting on Monday that Bonn would strongly support the five east German
states in setting up special police and surveillance units to combat
extremism.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Swedish capital flows out
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AS MUCH as SKr22.1bn (Pounds 2.3bn) of capital flowed out of Sweden last
week in the crisis of financial confidence that forced the country's Central
Bank last Wednesday to raise its interest rate by 3 percentage points to 16
per cent, writes Robert Taylor in Stockholm.
The size of the capital outflow, which was published by the Central Bank
yesterday after the markets closed, was much larger than expected. It is the
biggest outflow since last November after Finland's devaluation of the
markka forced the Swedish Central Bank to raise its interest rates by 6 per
cent.
The total amount in Sweden's capital reserves has fallen to SKr95.2bn.
During the past two days the money markets and the bourse in Sweden have
remained nervous about the immediate economic outlook. But yesterday's news
about the magnitude of the capital outflow could lead to further anxiety
when trading resumes this morning.
Short-term interest rates have continued to rise since the middle of last
week. Yesterday the bourse general share index fell by 2.6 per cent. This
followed a 0.9 per cent decline on Monday.
Sweden's centre-right coalition government continues to insist no new
economic measures are needed to deal with the financial crisis.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Far right rises as Hungary's economy sinks: Issues of race
and territory have swept in with the new political season
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HUNGARY'S far right, restless but dormant for the past two years of moderate
conservative government, has burst into life without warning. Its issues of
race and territory swept more mundane matters of budgets and economic reform
off the agenda as parliament reconvened this week as the new political
season began after the summer recess.
The political talk is suddenly focused on the danger of 'Balkan chaos' and
Hungary's prized stability - which made the country the favourite for
western investors - is looking surface-deep.
What stirred the waters was an article in the party weekly by Mr Istvan
Csurka, a vice president and leading ideologist of the Hungarian Democratic
Forum, the ruling centre-right party. It has been received as a manifesto so
explosive that it has been termed an 'intellectual Molotov cocktail'.
Mr Csurka, a former novelist with the bulk - both physical and political -
of a Jean Marie Le Pen, called true Hungarians to arms in a tract which
opponents have described as nothing less than a foundation for Hungarian
neo-Nazism.
He demanded an end to moderation and compromise, linking Jews, communists,
liberals, the International Monetary Fund and bankers in a conspiracy to
destroy the government and smother Hungary's national revival.
Anti-Semitic remarks littered the text, with Mr Csurka writing of the
influence of 'the Paris, New York and Tel Aviv networks' and of 'the
Hungarian Jewish position of hegemony'.
In a sideswipe at western interference, he accused the IMF of pulling the
strings behind the new financial elite, comparing the institution to the
occupying Red Army which propped up the communists.
He even called into question the Trianon peace treaty, the territorial
settlement after the First World War which cost Hungary 60 per cent of its
land area and left 3.5m ethnic Hungarians living in neighbouring states.
With borders starting to unravel all over the Balkans and eastern Europe, he
relished 'the opportunities to create a new Hungarian living space'.
Mr Csurka's essay can - and has been by opposition politicians - be
dismissed lightly as the rantings of an anti-Semite who has come out of the
closet. More significant, however, has been the reluctance of Mr Jozsef
Antall, the moderate prime minister, and the party he leads, to condemn the
author outright and force his resignation.
After a week of mounting pressure, the prime minister this week belatedly
and begrudgingly distanced himself from Mr Csurka's standpoint, describing
parts of the essay as 'politically mistaken and harmful'.
But Mr Antall reassured Mr Csurka and his Volk-national right-wingers that
there was an important place for them in the governing party. The latter's
national committee went even further in support of Mr Csurka, concluding in
its communique: 'The bulk of the essay's foundations are very useful in
working out the Hungarian Democratic Forum's new programme.'
It is the party's accommodation of Mr Csurka's outburst, rather than the
words themselves, that is causing observers to look more seriously at the
challenge from the far right.
Mr Csurka, one of the founding heroes of the Forum, is believed to command
the allegiance of up to a third of the ruling party's activists. Mr Antall,
an innately cautious personality, can ill afford to force a deep split
within his own party when both his coalition partners are also increasingly
rebellious. He is even less disposed to react at a time when his government
is trailing badly in the opinion polls and still reeling from two
by-elections at which ministers suffered humiliating defeats.
But Mr Csurka's constituency is more than just a faction within the Forum,
and the debate about his essay goes beyond internal party politics. He has
articulated the frustration of many Hungarians with the government's
apparent inability or reluctance to purge those people who made their money
or influence under the former communist regime. Their indignation has grown
as Hungary's economic depression has deepened and thrown the growing wealth
of communists-turned-businessmen into relief.
Furthermore, Mr Csurka's extreme rhetoric taps a strong Hungarian vein of
virulent nationalism and anti-Semitism. In their hearts, many Hungarians
have not given up the territories they lost after the first world war, nor
stopped casting around for scapegoats for this national tragedy.
Territorial ambition and racism led to Hungary's wartime alliance with Nazi
Germany when 600,000 Hungarian Jews died, most in German concentration
camps, but up to 100,000 in Hungary at the hands of Hungarians, according to
Jewish leaders.
But even Forum supporters who admit the anti-Semitism in Mr Csurka's
thinking do not want to see him forced out. 'Csurka cannot be evicted from
the political scene. The best place for him is the Forum because the Forum
can moderate him,' says one.
The opposition predictably sees it the other way around. 'Your party is the
prisoner of Csurka,' said Mr Laszlo Kover, an opposition leader, pointing
accusingly across the parliamentary chamber at Forum MPs.
Their disagreement leaves open the question, and it is an old one: when
moderates pander to extremists in order to tame them, who controls whom?

FT  02 SEP 92 / Commercial property market faces'double dip'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE stalled recovery in the UK economy threatens to produce a 'double dip'
in the commercial property market, according to a report by an independent
research group.
The Investment Property Databank, which analyses institutional property
portfolios worth Pounds 40bn, says the slow recovery in investment returns,
which began last year, has run out of steam. It blames an accelerating fall
in rental values.
The slide in rental values, which was largely confined to London and the
south-east until the start of this year, has now spread to northern England
and Scotland. Industrial property, which performed relatively well until
this year, suffered a particularly sharp decline in rental values.
The IPD review shows that annualised total returns (which measure yields and
rental movements) have slipped from 3.6 per cent at the start of 1992 to 1.4
per cent in June and may fall below zero in the second half of the year.
In the past three months, investors have sharply reduced their expectations
of total returns for 1992, according to a survey of fund managers by IPD.
Total returns are now expected to be barely positive in 1992, whereas in
April they were expected to be 5-6 per cent.
The IPD statistics show that the pressures on the commercial property market
have changed markedly in the course of the recession.
In 1990, the fall in the market was chiefly due to a rise in yields - the
ratio of income to capital value - as investors lost confidence in property.
Since then yields have largely stabilised but capital values have come under
intensified pressure from the decline in rents. The fall in rental values
has accelerated from 5.2 per cent a year to 8.3 per cent in the course of
1992.
Retail property is the best performing sector while the office sector is the
worst performer.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Socialists reject calls for Mitterrand to quit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH government and Socialist party officials yesterday rejected calls for
President Francois Mitterrand to resign to ensure a 'Yes' vote in the
September 20 referendum on European union.
Instead, they took heart from two opinion polls suggesting that the 'Yes'
vote was creeping up.
In an article in the newspaper Le Monde, Mr Alain Minc, a leading leftwing
liberal, suggested Mr Mitterrand should announce he will stand down once
France ratifies the Maastricht treaty.
The call, repeated by Mr Dominique Baudis, executive president of the
centre-right CDS party, echoes earlier rumours within the Socialist party
that Mr Mitterrand was considering early retirement.
But Mr Mitterrand is expected to confirm that he intends to carry on as
president when he appears tomorrow evening in a live TV debate with Mr
Philippe Seguin, one of the main anti-Maastricht campaigners in the divided
opposition Gaullist party.
Mr Minc argued that if Mr Mitterrand offered to resign, the referendum would
not be affected by his falling popularity. 'He alone can turn back the
temptation to regicide which . . . is assassinating France,' Mr Minc said,
referring to the surprise emergence of a majority against Maastricht in some
recent polls.
No mainstream opposition leader has called for Mr Mitterrand to sacrifice
his job to the treaty. His second seven-year term runs to spring 1995.
Mr Laurent Fabius, first secretary of the Socialist party, scorned the idea
Mr Mitterrand should quit. He said: 'The president of the republic cannot
put his resignation in the balance, because one cannot mix a referendum on a
major question and internal political deadlines.'
Officials at the Elysee palace said Mr Mitterrand had not changed his
position that he saw the referendum as a vote on Europe rather than on his
personal record and that domestic politics should be left to the
parliamentary elections next March.
Mr Mitterrand called the referendum after the Danish vote against Maastricht
in June, hoping he would split the opposition and help revive the treaty.
To the government's alarm, support for Maastricht has dwindled. Polls in
early June showed nearly 70 per cent backing for Maastricht, but there were
narrow majorities against it in three out of six polls last week.
In the past few days there have been signs the tide may have turned again as
the government has stepped up its previously muted pro-Maastricht campaign.
Of two polls published yesterday, one showed 53 per cent in favour and the
other an even split. On Monday, another poll came out with a 53 per cent
majority. Both yesterday's polls showed a decline in the number of undecided
voters, to 23 per cent and 16 per cent respectively, which will help assuage
government fears that the treaty could fall through lack of interest.
Mr Michel Rocard, a former Socialist premier, told party members he was
convinced the 'Yes' vote would win. A 'No' vote would strengthen nationalist
forces and would be suicidal for farmers dependent on European Community
subsidies, he said.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Dollar hits new low against D-Mark: Pound pushed nearer ERM
floor European shares fall on fears of interest rate rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FRESH WAVE of investment in the D-Mark yesterday pushed the dollar to a
new low against the German currency and depressed share prices across Europe
on fears of increased interest rates.
The stronger D-Mark created further tension in the European exchange rate
mechanism, depressing several of the weaker currencies against the D-Mark
and pushing both sterling and the Italian lira closer to their ERM floors.
The pound's London close against the D-Mark of DM2.7825 was its lowest level
since Britain joined the ERM in October 1990. However, the dollar's weakness
pushed the pound above the Dollars 2 level during the day for the sec ond
time in two weeks. In London, the pound later finished a shade lower at
Dollars 1.9970, up slightly less than 1 cent on the day, although it ended
in New York at Dollars 2.002. Early today in Tokyo it was quoted at Dollars
2.0035.
The stronger D-Mark triggered widespread investor disquiet at the prospect
of higher interest rates in Europe at a time when economic activity is
generally weak.
On the London stock market, the FT-SE 100 index of leading shares finished
14.2 points down at 2,298.4, just above the day's lows. Bourses in Paris,
Frankfurt and Milan all fell by between 0.6 per cent and 1.6 per cent.
The move out of dollars into D-Marks was assisted by a report from the US
National Association of Purchasing Managers, which underlined the slow
nature of the US economic recovery.
If pressure continues on weak ERM currencies, including the pound, lira and
French franc, European central banks may be forced to support them. That
would happen either by the central banks intervening on the foreign
exchanges to buy the currencies, or by lifting borrowing rates.
As investors switched funds from dollars into D-Marks, the US currency fell
to a new all-time low of DM1.3895. Although it later gained ground slightly,
by the New York close it remained more than 1 pfennig below Monday's close
at DM1.39. In early Tokyo trading today it was quoted at DM1.3892.
Against the D-Mark, the pound drifted down during the day, losing more than
half a pfennig. It closed in London within half a pfennig of its ERM floor
against the D-Mark of DM2.7780, before firming slightly in New York to
DM2.7840.
The lira also came under pressure, closing in London at L764.6 to the
D-Mark, down from L763.75 the previous night and close to its floor of
L765.40.
European stock markets were given little help from Wall Street where, in
quiet trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average shifted only weakly to
higher levels. At the close in New York it stood at 3,266.26, up 8.91.
On the currency markets, there was no clear sign of central bank
intervention to support either the dollar or sterling in generally thin
trading. However, at one stage in European trading, the dollar was lifted by
unsubstantiated rumours of intervention by the US Federal Reserve to buy
dollars for D-Marks.
Traders reported widespread selling of dollars for D-Marks from
international currency investors, particularly large fund management groups.
Such investors have recently bought D-Marks in volume because of the big
difference between German and US interest rates.
In Britain, the three-month interbank rate, an indicator of where the market
thinks base rates are moving, remained at about 10 1/2 per cent. That
indicated perceptions that base rates, now at 10 per cent, are likely to
move up by  1/2 a point in the near future.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Patten may act over doubts on GCSE standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
URGENT ACTION to rectify an alleged decline in standards in the GCSE exam is
being considered by Mr John Patten, the education secretary.
He took the highly unusual step of issuing press comments yesterday after a
report by the schools inspectorate cast doubt on the reliability of this
year's results, sent out last week.
The inspectorate's report has yet to be published, and has not been made
available. However, according to Mr Patten, it expressed 'little confidence
that standards are being maintained' and that 'the evidence could point to a
gradual erosion of standards since the introduction of the GCSE in 1988'.
In particular, the inspectorate was concerned at the objectivity of marking
 -especially of coursework - and about assessment of spelling, punctuation
and grammar.
Results for this year's GCSE, the main exam for 16-year-olds in England and
Wales, showed more than half of all pupils achieving the top three grades,
generally considered to be the pass standard. In 1987, the proportion
achieving grades A to C in O level, replaced by GCSE a year later, was 39.8
per cent.
The examination boards said the improvement was due to teachers' increasing
familiarity with the exams and better preparation of pupils.
Mr Eric Forth, schools minister, last week appeared to endorse this view,
congratulating pupils and parents and commenting: 'We can look forward to
seeing more students than ever continuing in education beyond the age of
16.'
However, Mr Patten yesterday backed Tory critics of the GCSE examiners. He
said the inspectorate's report, given to him last week, indicates 'possible
problems with the independent groups that conduct the GCSE exam'.
The inspectorate visited the four examining groups responsible for the GCSE
in England to observe the different stages in the examination process.
Mr Patten has asked the boards to comment on the report by the end of the
month.
He will then consider appropriate action - though it is not clear what that
might be, short of eliminating all coursework (now mostly limited to 20 per
cent of total marks) or seeking to instruct boards to reduce the proportion
of higher grades awarded in future years.
Mrs Ann Taylor, Labour's education spokesman, said Mr Patten's decision to
comment on an unpublished report 'is a clear indication that he wants to
affect its reception before it is released'.
Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head
Teachers, said the report was 'a slap in the face' for young people who had
just received their results.

TABACALERA, Spain's state-controlled tobacco manufacturer and distributor
which has a near-monopoly status in the domestic market, raised its
first-half pre-tax profits by 4.8 per cent to Pta9.7bn (Dollars 106.6m).
Income from tobacco sales and also from monopoly revenue earners such as
state paper, including postage stamps, increased by 5.3 per cent in the
first six months of 1992 compared with same period last year.

<TEXT>
ALUSUISSE-LONZA, the Swiss aluminium, speciality chemical and packaging
group, said net income tumbled 23 per cent in the first half to SFr85m
(Dollars 67.4m) but forecast a 20 to 40 per cent rise in net income for the
full year.
Mr Theodor Tschopp, chief executive, said the group, formerly concentrated
in aluminium, was seeing the first fruits of its recent diversification.
The group had been able to increase operating margins in its chemicals and
packaging divisions, compensating for falls in the aluminium division due to
oversupply in world markets. Group sales rose 4 per cent to SFr3.3bn, with
aluminium sales up 2.2 per cent to SFr1.8bn. Chemical sales rose 5.5 per
cent to SFr791m. A-L Packaging sales were up 6.1 per cent to SFr655m.
Mr Tschopp said no upturn in market conditions was expected in the second
half in the primary aluminium and other commodity sectors. The large
forecast improvement in profit for the full year would be realised mainly
due to a poor result in last year's second half.

OERLIKON Buhrle, the Swiss armaments, engineering and shoe retailing group,
returned to profit in the first half for the first time since 1985.
Net profit was a nominal SFr5.3m (Dollars 4.24m) on sales up 10 per cent to
SFr1.6bn. In the full year for 1991 the group recorded a SFr187m loss and
incurred restructuring costs of SFr700m.
Mr Hans Widmer, the chairman who was brought in last April to rescue the
group, forecast that cash flow in the full year would reach more than
SFr200m and the group would be in profit.
Net debt stood at SFr1.72bn at the end of June, down SFr59m since the end of
last year, and the manpower has been cut from 26,437 at the beginning of
1991 to 16,487.
Mr Widmer said the group's focus had shifted to rebuilding its businesses.
New orders in the first half in the civilian businesses were up 9 per cent
to SFr1.3bn and the Contraves military business, specialising in
anti-aircraft missile systems, received a further SFr1bn in orders.
Among the group's divisions, the Contraves business remained the biggest
loss-maker with a SFr75m operating loss on sales of SFr597m in the first
half, attributable mainly to a contract in Canada.
Sales of the Bally shoe subsidiary were up 9 per cent to SFr546m and
operating profits were SFr33m.
Balzers, the vacuum pump and anti-wear coatings group, had a SFr42m
operating profit on a 7 per cent rise in sales to SFr230m.

<TEXT>
GEORGIA accused Russian forces of killing several of its soldiers in a
missile attack in the Black Sea region of Abkhazia yesterday, but Moscow
angrily dismissed the charge, Reuter reports from Moscow.
Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the Georgian leader, said army commanders had told
him several Georgians had been killed by Russian fire while crossing a river
near the Abkhazian capital, Sukhumi. News agencies quoted him as telling the
governing State Council that rockets had been fired from a Russian Defence
Ministry laboratory.
The number of dead was not confirmed.
Moscow quickly denied the accusations as a 'fabrication'. A spokesman told
Moscow Radio that some Russian army facilities were being 'systematically
shelled by Georgian formations' but the troops were remaining neutral.
Mr Shevardnadze said the incident could jeopardise talks with President
Boris Yeltsin tomorrow aimed at seeking an end to fighting between Georgian
forces and Abkhazian separatists in the unstable Black Sea region.
The former Soviet foreign minister said he had immediately telephoned Mr
Yeltsin to seek an explanation. 'Yeltsin assured me he could officially
declare that no order had been given for Russian troops to interfere in this
conflict,' Mr Shevardnadze said.

THE European monetary system is so strong that it would easily survive
French rejection of the Maastricht treaty in the national referendum on
September 20, Mr Henning Christophersen, the European commissioner for
economic affairs, said yesterday, Reuter reports from Copenhagen.
'It is my opinion that there is both the liquidity and the political will to
maintain the EMS system,' Mr Christophersen, a Dane, said at a seminar
arranged by the Danish financial daily newspaper Boersen.
'The EMS has proven to be so strong that it will easily be able to survive a
French 'no' vote,' he said.
There have been fears that a French rejection might not only sink European
Community plans for economic and monetary union outlined in the Maastricht
treaty, but also threaten the system of exchange rate management within the
EMS which imposes strict limits on the extent to which member currencies can
fluctuate.
The Maastricht treaty on political, economic and monetary union in the
Community has already been narrowly rejected by Danish voters in a June
referendum, and a 'no' vote by France would effectively kill it.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Business and the Environment: Alternatives under scrutiny
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
User industries may be responding slowly to the phase-out of CFCs, but the
chemical manufacturers are rapidly expanding their range of substitute
materials.
The two largest manufacturers, Du Pont of the US and ICI of the UK, say they
have already invested around Dollars 900m (Pounds 452m) on research into
alternatives and plants to produce them.
By the end of 1992 Du Pont will be producing 13 alternative refrigerants to
replace CFCs. Four of the products are pure hydrofluorocarbons which have
zero ozone depletion potential (known as ODP): HFCs 134a, 125, 152a and 32.
The remainder of Du Pont's products contain hydrofluorochlorocarbons, used
either pure or in blends. These HCFCs do some damage to the ozone layer
though their ODP is at most 5 per cent of CFCs. Although Greenpeace says Du
Pont should not be developing HCFCs, the company says they are essential
'bridging products'.
Both Du Pont and ICI are concentrating on HFC 134a for large-scale
manufacturing. Du Pont has two 134a plants in the US (at Ponca City,
Oklahoma, and Corpus Christi, Texas) and one opening in Chiba, Japan, later
this year.
ICI's original 134a plant at Runcorn in the UK will be supplemented by 134a
facilities due to open in the US and Japan over the next year. The UK
company will close its large CFC plant at Runcorn in 1993 and take supplies
from Akzo, the Dutch company.
Du Pont and ICI will stop producing CFCs for sale in developed countries by
the end of 1995, though Du Pont says it 'may produce in developing countries
until year end 1999 to meet domestic needs if deemed necessary under
Montreal Protocol obligations'. Clive Cookson

FT  01 SEP 92 / TUC looks at impact of Japanese
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY Japanese companies in the UK are more willing to work with trade unions
than are British employers, according to Mr John Monks, TUC deputy general
secretary.
Mr Monks says in an article in Personnel Management magazine that while UK
companies have derecognised unions many Japanese companies have recognition
agreements with TUC affiliates.
He says it is too early to assess the impact of Japanese companies on
industrial relations in Britain. Some Japanese production and personnel
systems appeal to British unions, particularly skill-building, abolishing
status distinctions, emphasising quality and pushing creativity and
responsibility to the shopfloor.
On the negative side he points to disparity of pay between lead companies
and subcontractors, the treatment of women workers and the lack of
independent status for unions outside a company. Accusations of social
control are equally worrying, he adds
Mr Monks says Britain is the largest recipient of Japanese inward investment
in Europe and the TUC is studying Japanese labour relations. UK companies
had to respond to the challenge of meeting Japanese efficiency standards.
Super-unions will erode the identity of union members with strong industrial
traditions or special professional interests, according to Mr Roger Lyons,
leader of the MSF technical and professional union. His statement follows
the announcement that talks about a possible merger are to be held by the
GMB and TGWU general unions.
Mr Lyons urged unions to concentrate on individual services to members,
although he admitted the 600,000-strong MSF, itself the product of a merger
between ASTMS and TASS in 1988, had learned 'the hard way'.

   KIEV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UKRAINE yesterday said it would introduce a voucher scheme next week to
allow all Ukrainian citizens to take part in a planned privatisation
programme.
Mr Valentyn Symonenko, minister of the economy, said that by September 5
every Ukrainian would be allotted 30,000 roubles to be held in special bank
accounts and valid only for the purchase of state property.
The government plans to gradually sell state property, beginning later in
the autumn.
Although the mechanism is similar to a plan unveiled in Moscow last month,
Mr Symonenko said there were fundamental differences between Kiev's and
Moscow's economic strategies. 'Immediate transfer to the market economy is
unrealistic, as the Russian experience demonstrates,' he said.
Mr Symonenko, a former Communist party boss from Odessa who was recently
granted the authority to rule the economy by decree, also sought to smooth
over differences between Ukraine and the International Monetary Fund which
last month warned that unless Ukraine began to implement its paper reforms
it would not receive a credit package.
'There are no global differences between what we are doing and what the IMF
is suggesting,' Mr Symonenko said.
He is due to present an economic reform package to parliament on September
16.
Mr Symonenko said his plan would focus on rationalising the huge state
enterprises, which in his view could not be quickly privatised but in the
current climate of administrative chaos were running amok.
Mr Symonenko also cautioned against too hasty an introduction of the
hryvnia, Ukraine's long-awaited separate currency, warning that if the new
currency was introduced before the economy is stabilised, 'it will just be
paper'.
Russia has agreed to pay Belarus's portion of the former Soviet Union's
foreign debt in return for its neighbour's share of former Soviet assets,
Itar-Tass news agency said yesterday, Reuter reports from Moscow.
It said Moscow had agreed to pay Belarus's share of Dollars 3.5bn out of the
total outstanding foreign debt of around Dollars 70bn. In return, Russia
will receive assets including part of the Belarussian entitlement to former
Soviet property abroad, under an agreement published by the Belarussian
government.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HONG KONG'S liberals suffered a setback on Sunday when Mr Martin Lee's
United Democratic (UDHK) party lost its New Territories West Legislative
Council seat to a pro-China independent candidate in a by-election.
This was the first liberal seat to fall since a sweeping victory in last
year's direct elections.
A low turn-out - despite a tight contest - raised some concern over Hong
Kong's appetite for its new slice of democracy. Only 32 per cent of the
eligible voters turned out, compared with the disappointing 39 per cent
average in last year's elections.
Yesterday's winner Mr Tang Siu-tong, picked up 51 per cent of the vote. Mr
Tang had shunned the support from Hong Kong's growing number of political
parties, relying on grass roots backing from rural areas. By contrast, his
United Democratic opponent Mr Albert Ho, was viewed as an outsider in the
district.
The two men were fighting for the seat vacated by United Democrat Mr Stephen
Ng, who died of leukaemia in June.
Mr Lee put a brave face on the loss. 'We will take heed. We go away this
morning with greater determination to be united both as a party and also
with the other democratic groups.'
Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's new governor, paid a visit to the New
Territories on Sunday to watch Hong Kong politics in action and he gave
further proof of his desire to speed up the democratic process in Hong Kong.
'I want to see our governing institutions and the participation of the
public in the management of our affairs in Hong Kong more deeply rooted in
the community,' he said, after visiting the polling station.
At present, only 18 of the 60 seats on the Legislative Council are directly
elected.

BOEING, the Seattle-based aerospace manufacturer, yesterday named Mr Philip
Conduit, the well-respected executive vice-president of its commercial
airline operations, to be president of the company and a member of its board
of directors.
The move is seen as possibly positioning Mr Conduit, aged 51, to take over
the Boeing chairmanship in four years' time, when the current chairman, Mr
Frank Shrontz, is due to retire.
The post of president has been vacant at Boeing since 1988, when Mr Shrontz
moved up to become chairman.
Boeing also said that Mr Alan Mulally, 47, will succeed Mr Conduit as
vice-president and general manager of the 777 division. Mr Conduit had
previously overseen development of the Boeing 777, the company's new
wide-bodied twin jetliner.
Mr Conduit will have three product divisions reporting to him - the
commercial airline group, the defence and space group, and computer
services.

The hectic pace and unpredictability of the computer industry can prove
addictive. Terry Radford, a 46-year old veteran of Olivetti, Sperry Univac
(now Unisys) and Apricot, is returning to the world of bits and bytes after
a spell in charge of the European operation of Ampex, a US supplier of video
systems to the broadcasting industry.
Recently appointed general manager of Data General's UK and Irish
operations, he likens it to 'coming home'. 'It took me a whole morning to
settle in'.
Data General, one of the pioneers of the minicomputer industry, has had a
rough ride over the past few years but Radford believes the company is over
the worst: 'It has got its product strategy and production costs right while
others still have to make that transition'.
It now specialises in 'open' systems, which follow broad industry standards
rather than proprietary designs, and has recently won orders from Customs &amp;
Excise and the Department of Employment. Open systems come as second nature
to Radford. At Apricot (now ACT) he is still remembered as 'Mr Unix' (after
the most popular open systems design), and as someone who did a lot to put
Apricot on the open systems map.
Now his principal task is to restore Data General's lustre in the most
challenging circumstances. 'What I have to do is to persuade customers that
it is fashionable again to buy from Data General' is how he puts it.

MATTHEW CLARK, the drinks producer and distributor that has been seeking to
enter the cider market, has named Michael Cottrell, non-executive chairman
of Taunton Cider, to the same position on its board. He succeeds Francis
Gordon Clark, 57, who has retired after 17 years as chairman.
Keen to penetrate the growth cider sector, the company was disappointed last
year to lose out to a management buy-out when Allied Lyons was disposing of
cider and Babycham maker Showerings.
But the recently floated Taunton is hardly now a target of the smaller
Matthew Clark. Cottrell, 53, has been on the latter's board since May 1991.
Born in Gibraltar, he entered the trade via the family business, wine and
spirits specialist Saccone &amp; Speed. S &amp; S, which started on the Rock, was
purchased by Courage back in 1962; he stayed at Courage, rising to managing
director between 1982-1987, but leaving six months after the acquisition by
Australian brewing group Elders. ' I suppose I had become rather possessive
about Courage' he remarks.
He then spent eighteen months at Lord Delfont's First Leisure - a Courage
client - latterly as chairman and chief executive, but 'there were really
too many people at the top of the company' and he did not feel 'stretched'.
He tried headhunters Russell Reynolds for two years - mostly working on
clients within his beloved 'booze business' and now divides his time between
a handful of non-executive positions in the drinks trade as well as looking
after S &amp; S Gibraltar, part of the old family company, bought back, from
GrandMet, in 1987.
He knows Matthew Clark chief executive Peter Aikens from the Courage days -
Aikens having been chairman of Courage Brewing.

FT  01 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Quiet day broken by late fall
for Dow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
A LACK of direction from overseas markets left US share prices little
changed in light trading yesterday, in spite of some more bad economic news,
writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 10.26 down at 3,257.35. It spent all
day hovering just a few points either side of Friday's close, and only a
late burst of selling sent the index into a double-digit loss. The Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 eased just 0.81 to 414.03, while the American SE composite was
0.40 softer at 380.78 and the Nasdaq composite 0.45 off at 563.11. New York
SE turnover was light at 161m shares.
With the foreign exchange markets subdued by the holiday in the UK, quiet
overseas equity markets and little movement in US bond prices, share trading
was thin in New York. Investors were also reluctant to enter the market
ahead of Friday's employment report for August.
The day's economic news was not positive, but it had little effect. New
single-family home sales fell by 2.6 per cent in July, and the rise in June
was revised down to 5.3 per cent from a previously estimated 7.9 per cent.
The Chicago Purchasing Management Association's index for August declined
from July's 59.2 per cent to 58.4 per cent, indicative of a slowdown in
manufacturing activity in the midwest.
Compaq put on Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 32 3/8 in turnover of 2.5m shares
after the big computer company stated that it had entered into a pact under
which it will receive licensing rights to the PostScript software produced
by Adobe Systems. The latter, quoted on the Nasdaq market, shed Dollars  1/2
to Dollars 32 1/2 .
Merck dipped Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 48 5/8 after Mr James Keeney, an
analyst at broking house Mabon Securities, lowered his rating on the drug
group from 'buy' to 'hold', saying initial prescriptions for Merck's Proscar
drug are below expectations. Other drug stocks retreated, Johnson &amp; Johnson
relinquishing Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 49 1/4 and Pfizer also losing Dollars
 7/8 , to Dollars 77 1/4 .
Whirlpool firmed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 35 5/8 but Maytag eased Dollars
3/4 to Dollars 13 1/4 after Kidder Peabody, the securities firm, initiated
coverage of the two appliance manufacturers with a 'buy' rating for
Whirlpool and a 'hold' for Maytag. Kidder recommended that investors switch
out of Maytag and into Whirlpool.
Canada
TORONTO stocks ended mixed to firmer, with solid gains in the gold and
silver and real estate sectors.
The TSE 300 index was 0.1 off at 3,402.9 after moderate volume of 25.1m
shares valued at CDollars 274.9m, but rises outscored declines by 323 to
219. The gold and silver index added 1.47 per cent at 5,340.5.

THE Bovespa index finished 6.7 per cent down at 32,671 yesterday, writes
Bill Hinchberger in Sao Paulo, following President Fernando Collor's promise
on Sunday night to resist pressure to resign. Last week a congressional
committee charged the president with malfeasance in a corruption scandal.
The drop followed steady gains last week, both in the index and in trading
volumes. Moving inversely to Mr Collor's standing, weakened by the loss of
political support and mass demonstrations, the index rose by 27.4 per cent.
Turnover grew steadily from a level of Dollars 18.5m on Monday, when the
parliamentary inquiry presented its findings, to last Friday's Dollars
107.5m.

FT  01 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent feels the absence of
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON's closure for the bank holiday yesterday affected levels of trading
on the Continent, writes Our Markets Staff. Country by country, share prices
moved both ways, the recovery in Germany contrasting with the painful
erosion of Nordic equity values.
FRANKFURT saw German stock market turnover fall from DM4.7bn to DM4.2bn as
equities extended their recovery from last Tuesday's lows, the DAX index
rising 24.78, or 1.7 per cent, to 1,541.25.
Dealers saw no fundamental reasons for the upturn, but Ms Barbara Schumacher
at Merck Finck in Dusseldorf noted that the DAX had doubled a gain of about
12 points which it registered an hour before the official close.
Daimler continued its uptrend after last week's interim results, putting on
DM14 to DM628 for a gain of nearly 8 per cent since its rebound from 1992
lows began last Wednesday; yet, on analysis, some observers were wary of a 3
per cent drop in oper-ating profits of the car business, on a 9 per cent
rise in turnover.
They also said that gains in chemicals lacked discrimination, with Bayer, up
DM5.70, a good buy on its recent progress report but Hoechst, DM6.50 higher
at DM245, seen as distinctly less attractive.
The big rise of the day among DAX stocks came from Lufthansa, severely
depressed by the problems of the international airline industry but DM8
higher at DM102. Yesterday, talks with unions on a cost-cutting programme
entered a final phase and DAG, the smaller of the two unions concerned,
offered a year's wage freeze.
Among other bombed-out stocks, Metallgesellschaft rose DM10.50 to DM328.50
and Mannesmann DM5 to DM235.50.
PARIS ended slightly lower as London's absence and continued uncertainty
ahead of the Maastricht referendum reduced turnover to just FFr860m. The
CAC-40 index closed 2.65 down at 1,684.88 after a high of 1,695.60 and a low
of 1,679.01.
Eurotunnel continued to gain on growing optimism of an early resolution to
the dispute with TML. The stock added FFr1.30, or 3.6 per cent, at FFr37.70.
Among smaller stocks, household appliances maker Seb fell FFr24.90, or 6.1
per cent, to FFr384.10 after disappointing six-month results.
STOCKHOLM was held back by firmer domestic interest rates, as the
Affarsvarlden general index slipped 7.3 to 772.7, in thin turnover of
SKr260m, against SKr532m.
The construction group Skanska saw its B free shares drop as low as SKr66 on
news that the company will lose SKr500m to SKr600m this year because of
unauthorised currency speculation by the president of its finance
subsidiary. They later recovered to close a net SKr3, or 4.2 per cent, down
at SKr69. Trading in Skanska shares had been halted for 35 minutes pending
the announcement.
OSLO dropped 4.2 per cent on news of deepening troubles in the country's
financial sector. The all-share index was 14.11 weaker at 318.89 in thin
trading worth NKr154.8m.
Yesterday, a Norwegian court appointed a committee to work out how the
investment company, Investa, could repay its debts after winning court
protection from its creditors over short-term borrowings of NKr2.8bn.
ZURICH featured some action in second liners as the SMI index firmed by 5.9
to 1,751.6. Adia bearers, second on the active list, rose SFr15 to SFr218 on
news of a SFr200m loan from its majority shareholders, Mr Klaus Jacobs and
the German retail chain Asko. Oerlikon-Buhrle, also actively traded, rose
SFr7 to SFr446 ahead of today's conference, at which the engineering and
armaments group is expected to confirm that it is making a profit after
several years of losses.
MILAN had a colourless day as traders felt the absence of London. 'Nobody
wants to do anything, the market is without direction,' said one broker in
Milan. The Comit index shed 2.67 to 390.93, a new low for the year, in
turnover estimated at around Friday's L45.7bn.
Weakness in market leaders set the tone for the day's trading, with Fiat
losing L51 to L4,019 and Generali falling L120 to L26,130. Montedison showed
little reaction to news that chairman Mr Giuseppe Garofano was to be
interviewed in connection with a wide-ranging investigation into the
financing of political parties by companies.
AMSTERDAM ended mixed after a thin session. The CBS Tendency index eased 0.2
to 109.9. In the financial sector, ABN Amro and Aegon, both ex-dividend,
fell a net 60 cents and 80 cents respectively, to Fl 42.80 and Fl 59.90.
MADRID fell in flimsy trade, the general index closing 0.64 off at 204.97 on
a day distinguished only by block trades in the chemicals company Cepsa.
VIENNA started the week in a buoyant mood, advancing 2.5 per cent on the
back of gains on foreign stock markets. The 18-share ATX index rose 18.22 to
735.58 while the broader bourse index put on 4.04 to 348.41.
ISTANBUL gained as hopes for lower bond and deposit rates were refreshed by
a newspaper report that sharp rate cuts were awaited at the Treasury's
auction this week. The 75-share index climbed 40.63 to 4,157.83.
The FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index was unavailable yesterday because of the
holiday in the UK.

FT  01 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets: Tentative revival leaves Helsinki in
wary mood - Robert Taylor peers through the Finnish gloom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the past two years, the Helsinki bourse has been a serious casualty of
Finland's deepest-ever recession, and the horrific damage sustained by the
Nordic financial sector. It remains in a wary mood in spite of signs of an
economic recovery.
More than half of Finland's companies are experiencing an upturn, but this
revival in the 'real' economy has not been reflected so far in share prices.
Towards the end of last week Helsinki's forestry share index had dropped by
some 20 per cent this year, and by 16.5 per cent in the previous 30 days.
And while the metal sector had risen by as much as 40 per cent in the year
to the end of May, it has fallen recently by a little more than its forestry
counterpart.
Last week the central bank was compelled to raise its tender rate from 15.5
per cent to 17 per cent, in a move designed to stem capital outflows and
calm international financial markets.
Ever since last November's 12.3 per cent devaluation of the markka, the
Finnish money markets have been nervous due to an intermittent lack of
confidence in the country's fragile centre-right coalition government's
ability to stick firmly in future to a fixed exchange-rate policy.
However, a fortnight ago, Mr Michel Camdessus, head of the International
Monetary Fund, made some positive remarks about the economy. He pointed to
signs of modest but still positive economic growth, an upturn in industrial
output, low inflation and a clear improvement in industrial competitiveness.
A similar note was struck last week in the authoritative annual report on
Finland from the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development.
The OECD forecast the likelihood of a 3.3 per cent increase in Finland's GDP
in 1993, encouraging after two years of economic contraction.
It also suggested a 5.5 per cent rise in industrial output next year after
modest 1 per cent growth in 1992, as well as a strong export-led recovery.
Unemployment may remain at around 11 per cent but the other main economic
indicators provide some encouragement for the markets.
Such outside opinion stems from the growing optimism in Helsinki in both the
forestry and engineering sectors. Mr Pentti Vartia, head of ETLA, Finland's
main independent economic forecasting institute, is encouraged by the fact
that the country, in a remarkably short time, has managed to replace its
lost markets in the former Soviet Union with new ones in the west. 'The
recovery has been much faster than we expected,' he says.
The real trouble hobbling the market is the continuing uncertainty about the
future of Finland's fragile financial system. Bank shares have collapsed,
weighing down the overall Hex average. The state has established a FM20bn
(Dollars 5.2bn) guarantee fund to assist banks and other financial
institutions in trouble with non-performing loans and credit losses. Few
observers believe, however, that Finland has yet weathered the storm which
has shaken the financial sector across the Nordic region in the past few
years.
Last year, listed Finnish companies made financial losses totalling FM16bn
between them. This year, bourse analysts estimate that the deficit will
narrow to FM9.7bn, with as much as FM6.5bn of that figure due to the
lamentable position of the banks. As a result, Finnish shares are cheap by
some standards. The book value of limited companies is FM123bn but this
contrasts with a market value of FM52bn at the end of July.
Mr Juhani Erma, head of the Helsinki bourse, is hopeful that the outlook
will change next year with the removal of rules which prevent foreigners
from acquiring more than 20 per cent of the voting rights, and 40 per cent
of the equity, of a Finnish company without official authorisation from the
state. The traditional distinction between restricted and free shares will
also end. At present only around 12 per cent of shares traded in Helsinki
are free.
Last week the government proposed the lifting of foreign ownership
restrictions from January 1, and parliament is expected to discuss the
proposal in the autumn.
These reforms are necessary as Finland becomes part of the 19-nation
European Economic Area next year and they could stimulate a good deal of
foreign interest in Finnish equities. It has been estimated that as much as
FM16bn of new foreign investment could be attracted by the changes.
The near-term outlook for the stock market, however, depends on the success
of the government's economic strategy. And there are some anxieties for the
autumn.
First, there are doubts about the political situation and whether the
present government can survive much longer. Many believe that it may have to
be reconstructed after the October local government elections, which could
bring heavy losses to the coalition partners.
Secondly, there are worries about the next round of wage negotiations. The
government and employers would like to see no rise in wages for the next
three years; the unions can be expected to resist although, in the presently
grim labour market, they might settle for some kind of cost-of-living
protection and no real income improvements.
There is also uncertainty about the forthcoming Finnish negotiations on
membership of the European Community, due to begin formally early next year.
The latest opinion polls suggest that a clear majority of Finns want their
country to join the EC and it is possible that the markka may achieve
associate membership of the European Monetary System.

FT  01 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei ends above 18,000
in volatile trade
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tokyo
SHARES made modest gains in a volatile session and the Nikkei average rose
90.33 to 18,061.12, closing above 18,000 for the first time since June 3,
agencies report from Tokyo.
The market opened lower on profit-taking, with the Nikkei bottoming at
17,711.16 after 30 minutes of trading. But strong buying of incentive-backed
issues helped to lift share prices. The Nikkei swung between positive and
negative territory for the rest of the session, closing near its day's high
of 18,119.63.
Volume shrank to 550m shares from Friday's 850m. Advancing issues outpaced
those declining by 676 to 344, with 102 stocks unchanged. The first section
all-share Topix index was up 5.54 at 1,385.51.
Traders said strong selling by foreigners was countered by buying by
domestic individuals and dealers, while institutional investors remained on
the sidelines. However, they added that sentiment remained positive
following the government's stimulative package, announced last Friday.
Construction and financial issues were bought on expectations that they will
benefit from the government's Y10,700bn worth of measures aimed at boosting
public works projects and helping the debt-laden financial sector. Aoki Corp
gained Y35 to Y552 and Chiyoda Corp Y110 to Y1,860.
Real estate companies declined in spite of statements by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa,
the prime minister, that government funds would help purchase real estate
used as collateral for non-performing bank loans. Mitsubishi Estate finished
Y20 down at Y1,010 and Mitsui Real Estate Y30 cheaper at Y1,080.
Nissan Motor weakened Y37 to Y582 after Friday's news that the car company
expected to incur its first loss since 1946 and that it was omitting its
interim dividend.
Aids-related issues saw strong buying interest. Most heavily traded was
Green Cross, which rose Y160 to Y1,740. Meiji Milk climbed Y106 to Y1,060
and Okamoto Industries Y200 to Y1,430.
Roundup
PACIFIC RIM markets were mostly firmer yesterday with the exception of
Australia and Manila. Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur were closed.
SEOUL rose confidently in active trading and the composite index ended 23.59
up at 562.80. The index has risen 19.3 per cent since the government's
support package on August 24. Turnover increased to Won428.18bn from
Saturday's Won292.22bn.
TAIWAN closed higher across the board as a strong rebound continued. The

Daniel Ludwig, who died last week at the grand old age of 95, was an unusual
tycoon. In his hey-day he was an even more important figure in the
international shipping industry than Paul Getty or Armand Hammer were in the
oil industry, and yet he never craved respectability like they did. He was
in business to make money and seemingly couldn't care less what people
thought of him.
He had been in the shipping industry longer than either the late Aristotle
Onassis or Sir Y K Pao and led the development of the super-tankers. At its
peak, Ludwig controlled a fleet of around 4.35m tonnes. However, unlike
several of Europe's shipping families, such as the Cayzer's, Niarchos's and
Moller's, he seemed unable to protect his huge fortune by diversifying
successfully away from shipping.
As a result there is a danger that he will be remembered more for ventures
such as his ill-fated Amazonian Jari project and investment in failed US
thrifts, than for his contribution to the development of world shipping.
Ludwig was more invisible than most billionaires. However, a few anecdotes
survive. One of the more memorable concerns a ship which Ludwig had used as
security for a bank loan and had gone missing in a hurricane.
'How's my collateral?' a worried banker asked Ludwig. 'When we find the
godamn thing I'll let you know,' replied the tycoon.

The opening of the Non-Aligned Movement conference in Jakarta prompts
recollections of an earlier event stage-managed by the Indonesians to
commemorate the founding Bandung conference in 1955.
In 1985 several ageing statesmen, who had attended the original conference,
gathered again in the hills above Jakarta. Among them was a frail, but
mentally alert delegate from Sri Lanka. He congratulated the Indonesian
foreign minister on the excellence of the reunion but had one minor quibble.
'In 1955 your then President, Mr Sukarno, looked after our every need.'
'Indeed?', said the Indonesian official.
'Yes sir. He even supplied special coupon books by which we were able to,
how shall I say, avail ourselves of the services of certain charming young
ladies who were in attendance at the conference.'
'And did you use the coupons?' asked the Indonesian.
The Sri Lankan gentleman extended his now bent frame to its maximum height.

Whatever happened to Professor Roy Goode's Pension Law review committee? It
is nearly three months since the Government set up the review in the wake of
the Maxwell affair and not a peep has been heard out of it.
The committee was given 12 months to produce its report, although if the
committee felt that changes should be initiated urgently, it would produce
interim findings before publishing its formal report. At the end of June a
consultation paper was promised 'within a few weeks'. But so far nothing has
been heard of the good professor and his plans for conducting public
hearings. It is a hideously complex subject with a lot of big, vested
interests to be tackled , but it all seems to be taking a long time.
Time was when occupational pension scheme members meekly accepted what the
trustees judged fit. However, the decision of some Lucas Industries'
pensioners to sue the trustees of the company's Pounds 2bn pension fund, is
yet another example of the growing restiveness about the role of pension
fund trustees.

Dan Pena is one American entrepreneur it is almost impossible to get rid of.
Having been edged off the boards of two companies most executives could be

The former chief executive of Great Western Resources is making the most of
his latest setback. 'My entire life has been built upon the crushed bones of
those who continued to remind me, 'Dan, you can't do that',' says Pena.
No surprise then that Pena's latest venture is a series of 'You Can't Do
That]' executive seminars in the academic serenity of his 525-year-old
Scottish castle. The title will be especially meaningful to Pena's fellow
visionaries who remember his tenure at GWR, where his expenses claims and
company loans sparked a shareholder rebellion last year.
The week-long seminar will focus on 'what they didn't teach you in graduate
school and what you may not have encountered in the real world'.
The tuition doesn't come cheap. For Dollars 13,000 Pena can offer six nights
in his Ghost Suite, complete with haunt. However, he's throwing in a black

Pena thinks about Dan Pena, the mailing shot includes his memorable line,

FT  01 SEP 92 / Letter: Victims of slump in UK housing market need urgent
help
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD HILKEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am disappointed to hear the chorus of bank and building society
chairmen calling for measures to stimulate the housing market. The problem
with this market is that, in spite of the decline, it is still too
stimulated. House prices are too high in relation to earnings. Too high a
proportion of our capital is tied up in overvalued property, so preventing
it from being used as security for other investments.
What we should be looking for is a way to protect the victims of the slump
while allowing the fall in prices to continue and not encouraging more rises
in earnings.
Of the groups needing protection, occupiers seem to be attracting more
sympathy - although their motives for over committing themselves may not
have been different from those of the over-keen lenders. They should not now
be rewarded for greed or protected from the consequences of folly.
The Rowntree Foundation's proposal of selective support for interest
payments may provide one short-term solution; another may be to limit the
freedom of mortgagers to evict to those cases triggered by fraudulent
behaviour rather than misfortune.
There would have to be matching protection for lenders. Here the issue is
their solvency. It should not be impossible to devise a guarantee allowing
these lenders to continue trading with part of their portfolio frozen but
secured by government. Such support should be linked to the relationship
between house prices and earnings.
The present situation in which revenue subsidies are spent annually to prop
up house prices is unsustainable and, in the case of much mortgage interest
tax relief, unjust.

Sir, As the parent of a recent international baccalaureate student I think
Andrew Adonis' contacts ('Not always a class act', August 21) dismiss the
value, potential and the recognition of the IB too easily.
The IB syllabus is wider and more up to date than A-levels. This is
recognised by many parents wanting their children to be better equipped. The
same is true of many universities, including Oxbridge, which value the wider
and more rounded perspective of the IB student.
I asked the headmaster of an A-level public school why his school did not
offer the IB option and was given a surprisingly unenterprising answer:
'Because there is only room for one IB school in Kent.'
If there is a problem with recognition of the IB it lies not with the
parents or the universities. Rather, it lies with schools and the
appallingly low level of promotion by the IB authorities.

FT  01 SEP 92 / Letter: Selling Czechoslovak privatisation short
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr WOLFGANG LAFITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Before dismissing the progress made in Czechoslovakia (Leaders, 'No
free lunch', August 21) there are a number of matters you should consider.
Mass privatisation has been implemented this year against the background of
economic stability and the rule of law. Reforms to this end have been
effective but painful, with living standards dropping by more than 10 per
cent. This is certainly no 'free lunch'.
Privatisation gained political acceptability through relentless promotion by
domestic politicians, including its champion, Mr Vaclav Klaus.
I agree that some promises made by fund managers to attract the vouchers of
citizens cannot be met. This may well undermine the confidence of the
population in fund managers, but not in the whole system of mass
privatisation. Yet fund managers triggered the correct conviction among
people that the vouchers represented value - albeit not as great as some
operators suggested. And some 8.5m citizens, almost 80 per cent of those
eligible, participated.
It is true that most fund managers are not experienced - the fund managed by
our group is the largest foreign operator, the sixth largest in the Czech
Republic - and initial confusion was inevitable. But accountability of
management to shareholders will increase; restructuring of companies by
shareholders' syndicates involving foreign partners with cash and management
expertise will occur; and a heavy dose of entrepreneurship is about to enter
the system. A stock market is emerging, and we believe prevailing liberalism
and low prices will attract investors. You may scoff at some companies on
offer, but don't sell the whole system short.

FT  01 SEP 92 / Letter: End copier anti-dumping duties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr SIMON HOLMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As a lawyer for a Japanese photocopier manufacturer accused of
'dumping' in the EC, I would like to comment on your 'Copier makers still
fighting Japan' (August 25).
The Commission makes findings of dumping in situations which no independent
observer, and few economists, would consider dumping. For example, in the
original 1985 investigation, many Japanese companies' prices on the EC
market were considerably higher than prices in Japan. Despite this, the
Commission awarded my client a dumping margin of some 35 per cent.
The advantages of copiers made by Japanese owned companies flow from the
efforts to improve production processes and reduce costs - which are passed
on to users.
Every industry has to remain innovative to be competitive, and anti-dumping
measures are no substitute for competitive practice.
You rightly observe that 'the most important question' is whether it is in
the 'Community's interest' to continue imposing duties on Japanese
photocopiers. Rank Xerox, Oce and Olivetti/OCI now represent about a quarter
of total EC production. If anti-dumping duties are imposed to enable them to
increase their prices and profits, the rest of the industry (largely
Japanese owned) will be able to follow suit.
This means that, for a given benefit to the complainants, the burden on
European users of photocopiers is magnified several times.
Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner, said in November last
year that anti-dumping duties in the original photocopier case cost EC
consumers 'over Ecu400m a year, which is twice the value of the total
production of the European companies which had sought protection'.
The EC should now let the anti-dumping duties on copiers die a graceful
death.

FT  01 SEP 92 / How freight hopes have finally been derailed: The collapse
of Charterail last week calls into question the future of railfreight in the
UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last November Mr Malcolm Rifkind, then transport secretary, visited a
pioneering railfreight operation called Charterail and declared: 'I have
seen the future and it works.'
Unfortunately, he was wrong: it doesn't. Charterail, hailed by a succession
of transport ministers as a revolutionary means of getting freight back onto
the railways, last week called in the liquidators. The question left in the
wake of its collapse is whether rail has any future as a means of carrying
freight in Britain.
One reason why the question deserves an answer is that there is a
near-universal desire to see freight switched from road to rail. Lorries are
noisy, smelly and unsightly; they clog up the roads and frighten other road
users; and the goods they carry could often be transported by rail at much
lower cost to the environment.
For more than a century, between the demise of the canals and the rise of
motor transport, rail dominated freight transport. Even the smallest rural
town on the rail network had its goods shed or siding. Freight going from
one town to another would be loaded into a rail wagon and hauled to a
marshalling yard, where it would be assembled into a train with other wagons
going in the same direction and eventually delivered to its destination.
The trouble with this kind of operation was that it consumed vast resources.
A locomotive and crew were required to get the wagon from the town to the
nearest marshalling yard; vast tracts of land, locomotives and manpower were
required to operate the marshalling yard itself; and a wagon might have to
go through the marshalling process at several different yards before being
delivered by another locomotive and crew to its ultimate destination.
Road transport, once it had got into its stride, was easily able to outstrip
railfreight on both speed and price. All the road transporter needed was a
driver and a lorry to pick up the goods and take them directly to their
destination. By 1955, road had replaced rail as the main means of inland
goods transport. It has been widening the gap ever since.
Today, operating without the benefit of state subsidy, British Rail's
loss-making freight operations have been pruned to the point where they play
an almost insignificant role in the transport of goods. The few remaining
areas where they still give road transport a run for its money are mainly in
the point-to-point delivery of trainloads of goods going directly to a
single destination: for example, coal going from coal mines to electricity
power generating stations, or containerised goods going from ports to inland
distribution centres.
Under growing environmental pressure, successive UK transport secretaries
have expressed a desire to reverse railfreight's seemingly terminal decline.
The difficulty is that most goods have to start and end their journey by
road, which means incurring heavy handling costs at the start and end of the
rail section of the journey. So great are those costs in relation to the
total that they can only generally be justified over distances of around 200
miles or more, where rail's greater speed comes into play. In a country as
small as Britain, the average journey length is much shorter than this.
The revolution Charterail offered was to bring handling costs down by
introducing special road trailers that could be driven straight onto
swivel-action rail wagons without the need for costly lifting equipment. The
consequent reduction in handling costs should have made rail competitive
over shorter distances.
Operationally, Charterail's services were a success. The experiment failed
because Charterail could not make the business pay in the face of cut-throat
competition with road transport. The main reason for that, the company said,
was that it relied on British Rail not just for the use of its railway
tracks, but for the supply of locomotives and crew; and it could not afford
the rates BR was charging for the total haulage package.
The failure of the Charterail experiment paints a gloomy picture of the
outlook for railfreight. The so-called intermodal transport service it
offered was regarded as the best last hope for the revival of domestic
railfreight in Britain. As a private company - albeit 22 per cent owned by
British Rail - it was also held up as an example for other private sector
freight operators to follow.
On the face of it, it might seem that the prospects for operations like
Charterail's would improve after privatisation. Charterail, after all,
claimed that excessive charges by BR were to blame for its demise. In a
privatised environment, the railways' new owners might prove more responsive
to the market.
Unhappily, it will not quite work like that. Under the plans currently
proposed, BR will remain owner of all Britain's railway tracks after
privatisation. Even if freight train operators like Charterail are able to
supply their own locomotives and crew, they will still have to pay whatever
BR asks for the use of its tracks: and these costs seem likely to go up
rather than down.
This is because BR's present method of charging an extra train to run on its
tracks is a somewhat arbitrary one based on the marginal extra costs it
incurs as a result of the presence of the train. After privatisation, BR -
or Railtrack, as it will then be called - will be required not only to
introduce a system of charging every train operator the full commercial cost
of its use of the tracks, but also to charge enough to deliver an 8 per cent
return on its assets.
Higher track charges seem inevitable, with obvious consequences for
railfreight. Even under the existing regime, BR's Railfreight Distribution
subsidiary contrived to lose Pounds 118.7m on turnover of Pounds 174.9m in
the year to March; so although the private sector might be expected to be
rather more effective at making freight profitable than BR, the implication
is that there is a lot more pruning yet to come.
One compensating factor is that the opening of the Channel tunnel will open
up new opportunities for railways to attack the market in long-distance
freight to and from the Continent, where rail's speed advantage over road
will come into its own. But Continental freight represents only a tiny
proportion of Britain's total. The rest seems destined not only to stay on
the road, but to grow at rail's expense.
The process is not necessarily inevitable. Environmentalists and the rail
lobby point to a sharp disequilibrium between charges to road users and rail
users. For a lorry owner, access to the roads, in the form of the annual
vehicle licence fee, typically represents only 4 per cent of total operating
costs, while for BR, track costs amount to 48 per cent of the total.
The playing field could be levelled by one of two means. Railways could be
made like roads by giving train operators free access to them on payment of
an annual licence fee. Alternatively, roads could be made like railways by
introducing heavy charges for their use through some form of electronic road
pricing. Either, however, would take an act of considerable political
courage. Neither seems forthcoming.

FT  01 SEP 92 / Letter: Caribbean banana exports need British protection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr COWAN COVENTRY and Ms JENNY BORDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article, 'Latin American banana producers attack EC quota plan'
(August 20) ignores the critical importance of this issue for the economies
and people of the eastern Caribbean.
Latin American banana producers have legitimate concerns about restrictions
on their banana exports in the EC system. But the interests of Caribbean
exporters in maintaining their preferences must not be overlooked.
Dominica, for example, would stand to lose 70 per cent of export earnings
and employment for half its workforce if, as the US and Latin American
exporters insist, the existing system of preferences is withdrawn.
Britain has a special responsibility, both because it is the main protected
market for Caribbean exporters and because it is president of the European
Community.
It should use this authority to protect the interests of Caribbean
exporters. It should also press for aid to help Caribbean efforts at
diversification out of banana production.
Trade preferences for Caribbean banana producers may conflict with the EC's
obligations to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). But surely
this merely underlines the inadequacies of a treaty which places the
principles of free trade above the interests of vulnerable communities?

FT  01 SEP 92 / Troubled city loses its head: Letter from Rostock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Driving northwards to the Baltic city of Rostock, past the placid lakes of
the east German coastal countryside, hate and violence seem far away. Even
Rostock's city centre, with its tall buildings rising like a red brick cliff
along the main street, suggests stability rather than anger, order rather
than turmoil.
But a few miles from the city in the soulless housing estate of
Lichtenhagen, the scars of violence are all too visible. It was here, in
sight of the shipyard cranes which testify to the city's former maritime
glory and present anxiety, that right-wing extremists threw Molotov
cocktails at the building where 20,000 asylum-seekers were housed, prompting
widespread condemnation and reawakening ugly memories.
It will take a long time for Rostock and its 240,000 inhabitants to live
down the ugly events of the past week. 'I'm sad Rostock has got into the
press this way,' says a 66-year old pensioner. 'The city where I was born
has come into discredit. It's not true that only fascists live here; they
are only the minority.'
Locals say the vicious rioting which broke out against foreign asylum
seekers was the culmination of months of frustration at the inability of
local, state, and federal politicians to deal with the problems arising from
Germany's generous open-house asylum policy.
Even many who condemn the violence, and blame the police for not reacting
fast enough, admit that the people of Lichtenhagen - who face immense social
and economic changes following unification - were put under extreme
pressure. Families of Sinti and Roma gypsies from Romania had occupied a
prominent area outside the main shops, pestering passers-by, begging, and
allegedly stealing from shop counters. 'Politicians had allowed things to
drag on. People here felt molested,' says Steffen Garschke, who runs a shoe
repair shop overlooking the scene.
The violence perpetrated by right-wing thugs, local youths and extremists
from other German towns, erupted during a peaceful demonstration called to
draw attention to the problem. It escalated after police failed to stop the
first wave of attacks and ended with Vietnamese refugees (against whom there
is no real local resentment) being evacuated from a block where they had
also come under attack.
The roots of this brutality can be traced to the Nazi era, but more recently
to the former East German regime and the way it cut off most contact with
the outside world. In the past three years, the joy of unification has been
replaced by disappointment as the economic gulf between east and west
Germany closes only with painful slowness.
'A lot of people don't have jobs here,' says Jurgen Winter, 46, a soldier
who does not know whether the German army will still have a place for him
next year. 'Only one out of four youngsters can get an apprenticeship. The
tendency to violence among 14-year-olds is frightening.'
Defenceless foreigners are clearly an easy target, especially in the
knowledge that most asylum-seekers are not political but economic refugees.
To many in the east, frightened about their own future, foreigners are a
scapegoat upon whom most of their ills can be ignorantly blamed.
Politicians may have seen this, but action has been slow and calls to alter
the constitution to stem the inflow and speed up the asylum process have yet
to bring results. In their confusion and mistrust, many in Lichtenhagen
applauded and egged on those attacking the asylum hostel.
It is this partial complicity in the baiting and attacking of foreigners
that the people of Lichtenhagen will find hard to live down. They have had
one taste of retribution with the huge left-wing demonstration that swamped
the suburb on Saturday. Those watching from balconies were subjected to
shouts of 'Nazis out'.
More than 3,000 police in full riot gear were on hand. The demonstration
drew more than 10,000 people. Although it was fairly peaceful, with none of
the feared clashes between right- and left-wing extremists, there was an air
of underlying menace.
With its traditional strength in shipbuilding, one of the most international
of industries, Rostock has certainly not been xenophobic in the past. Even
under the communist regime, Cubans and Angolans were employed in industry.
At the Warnow yard, north of Lichtenhagen, the giant cranes are a symbol of
past strength, present doubts, and hopes for the future. Now, 3,100 people
work where 6,000 were once employed. 'The uncertainty over the future is
dreadful,' says Holger Haefke, yard spokesman.
If Kvaerner, the Norwegian shipping company, does buy the Warnow yard as it
has stated, and as many locals hope, the yard's workers will have an assured
future, with DM500m of promised investment. There is work until the end of
next year, but the presence of four cargo ships - built for the Russians who
now cannot afford them - shows how markets have collapsed.
Much of east Germany lived off Soviet contracts. Their disappearance is one
reason why Rostock lacks confidence in its future. This helps explain -
though by no means excuse - the roots of the violence. 'Frustration
gradually came to the boil,' Mr Haefke says. 'But it got to a level which
can only be condemned.' Unfortunately for Rostock, that condemnation has now
assumed worldwide dimensions.

FT  01 SEP 92 / The FT Interview: Banker from the Old School - Peter
Ellwood, chief executive of TSB, speaks to David Barchard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At exactly 4pm last Monday Mr Peter Ellwood became the chief executive of
TSB, the bank that has recently been saying 'ouch'. He takes over a bank
that has been reshaped and remoulded countless times since it came to the
stock market in September 1986.
From 1989, he presided over TSB's retail banking operations and so has not
been implicated in the succession of accidents to befall TSB. These include
the purchase of Target in 1987, an insurance company which had to be sold
off three years later at an Pounds 80m loss because it duplicated TSB's own
successful insurance operations, and Mortgage Express, which had to be
closed down because of heavy losses on its mortgage book.
Perhaps the most ill-fated deal of all was the acquisition of Hill Samuel, a
City merchant bank, for Pounds 777m in 1987. It was made into TSB's
corporate lending arm. Last year Hill Samuel was forced to make a bad debt
charge of Pounds 436m after many of its loans made between 1988 and 1990
went sour. In doing so, it plunged the entire TSB group into a Pounds 47m
loss for 1991.
'Sure the Pounds 777m purchase price of Hill Samuel and the history of
Target are well documented. But people who say the story of the TSB is one
long succession of disasters should look at the massive strengths of this
organisation and not be wholly preoccupied with the problems of the past,'
Mr Ellwood says. 'If you look at the total TSB group, the vast majority
consists of the retail banking and insurance businesses which are among the
most successful operations of their kind in Europe.'
After such costly misadventures, he believes that TSB's prospects depend
entirely on the success of retail banking core activities.
'Your strategy has got to start by accepting that there are too many players
in our market and only a relatively small number of them will survive. The
ones that will survive will be those that have a preoccupation with the
customer and that means giving value for money,' he says.
For Mr Ellwood, creating a lasting bond between customers and their banks is
the only way to ensure survival in the 1990s. 'It is still a fact that more
people get divorced than change their bank account,' he says. 'We want to
keep it that way.' As a result, he puts a premium on pleasing the customer
and earning their loyalty.
Instead of seeing his new appointment as a poisoned chalice, Mr Ellwood
regards it as an opportunity to show that TSB can outshine the pack.
'We could have a strategy that said why don't we milk the customer (with low
savings rates) and hope that nobody notices. I think that is outrageous and
not sustainable.' So under Mr Ellwood the TSB has embarked on a policy of
upgrading its savings products.
This policy is the result of the deregulation of Britain's financial markets
since the 1980s; a process which increased competition and prompted banks to
become more responsive to customer needs. Mr Ellwood, whose career has been
the model of an old-fashioned clearing banker, contrasts this with his own
early experiences in the industry in the 1960s when customers did not count
for much.
'Frankly it was dead easy for banks to make money when I joined my first
bank as a cashier in the early 1960s', a time when the industry, with just
four clearing banks, was heavily regulated.
At the same time, Mr Ellwood recognises that the traditional lending
business of the banks is shrinking. Amid the uncertainties of Britain's
worst recession in 50 years, with low inflation and high real interest
rates, customers are naturally reluctant to borrow. TSB's lending, like that
of all the other high street banks, has fallen sharply. In its most recent
half-year results the loan book of Pounds 17.6bn was down by 6 per cent on
the previous year.
'We became a consumer-hungry society in the UK in the 1980s. People did
borrow too much and I accept that they were encouraged to borrow. Now people
feel a lot more wary about getting themselves into too much debt and it is
not in any bank's interest to see overleveraged customers'.
The jovial Mr Ellwood concedes that he is himself a mild casualty of the
fallout from the 1980s housing boom.
'I can remember how I felt when buying my house in 1988 and then seeing its
price go down.' After the unprecedented peak in houses prices in the
late-1980, he believes that house prices have returned to levels more in
line with the long-term trend of the past 30-40 years.
When Mr Ellwood arrived at TSB in 1989 - after more than 28 years at
Barclays where he rose to be chief executive of Barclaycard - the group had
six different mortgage lending arms and loans were the name of the game.
In today's market, he believes that the battle between banks is for products
such as high-quality savings accounts and pensions rather than loans. At the
same time, the shakeout in the financial services industry is forcing banks
to cut their costs on an unprecedented scale: among the clearing banks, some
20,000 jobs have been shed since 1989, and there's no let-up.
'Income is going to be hard to come by so our cost base has got to come
down.' he says.
The TSB's response to recession has been two-fold: cutting jobs and
improving the quality of services. 'Over the past three years we have
reduced the head count by 5,000 to 25,000. I suspect that is bigger in
percentage terms than for any other financial institution in this country,'
he says. More cuts are likely.
The second prong of attack on costs has been its 'quality improvement
programme', launched 18 months ago and designed to ensure that branch staff
make fewer of the mistakes that irritate customers, such as erroneously
processed loan applications.
'The quality process means that branch staff stop doing things twice or
three or four times and get things right first time.' he says. In north
America, he adds, banking quality improvement programmes have been able to
reduce sharply operating costs by ensuring each task - such as sending out
correct account details - is not unnecessarily repeated.
One snag in Mr Ellwood's strategy of wooing customers with higher interest
rate products, is that interest costs to the bank rise. The long-term gains
come only over a much longer period from selling a range of financial
services.
This, he says, explains why profits at TSB's group operations remained flat
in the first half of this year, with operating income rising by only 0.3 per
cent. At Barclays, by contrast, operating income from UK banking rose by an
impressive 22 per cent even though much of it was wiped out by bad debt. The
good news though for TSB is that the number of its customers, Mr Ellwood
says, is growing faster than at any time since the 1986 flotation.
He cites such factors to support his view that TSB group can hold its own
against its rivals even though with total assets of Pounds 25.6bn it is only
half the size of Lloyds and less than a quarter of Barclays or National
Westminster.
Sceptics believe that the relatively small high street banks are going to
find the struggle increasingly difficult because they do not enjoy the
economies of scale of the industry's giants.
But Mr Ellwood insists, not entirely convincingly, that the contest is not
as unequal as it looks. 'There is no really strong evidence, for example,
looking at technology costs that the top two banks can really provide money
transmission services more cheaply than we do,' he says.
Nor is he very concerned that the arrival of the single market next year
means that TSB needs a foothold in other EC countries. 'Mass retail banking
in Europe is nowhere near the top of my agenda,' he says, an acknowledgement
perhaps that TSB group is in no position to make such a move.
Instead, the danger may be that the recession will leave British banks,
including TSB, weak and vulnerable to foreign takeovers. 'I think the vast
majority of plcs in the UK feel vulnerable. Sure there are risks . . . The
answer is to run your own business damned well.'

FT  01 SEP 92 / Keynes v classics at Jackson Hole: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Waking up cold this weekend, I was momentarily disoriented. Then I
remembered. I was attending the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City's annual
economics symposium: I had traded the muggy summer heat of Washington for
the crisp mountain air of Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
I won't pretend the intellectual peaks scaled at the conference matched the
grandeur of the Grand Teton mountain range, but there were some telling
insights. The challenge this year was to explain why growth had slowed in
all industrial countries and to propose cures. Rightly, the focus was on the
secular slowdown in growth since the early 1970s, rather than recent
recessionary forces. In the US, for example, the recession has reduced per
capita consumption by less than 2.5 per cent whereas slower productivity
growth since 1973 has cut consumption by about 30 per cent.
On policy, the conference broke into two factions, which might be dubbed
'Cambridge v the classics' or 'Clinton v Bush'. I am referring, of course,
to Cambridge, Massachusetts - the home of Harvard and the MIT - rather than
Cambridge, England, which was not represented. The Cambridge contingent
argued forcefully for investment incentives to spur growth. Lawrence Summers
(temporarily on leave at the World Bank) and Bradford De Long, a Harvard
colleague, claimed that investment in equipment and machinery offered
returns to society as a whole that far exceeded the private return of 10 per
cent or so typically earned by individual companies. The reason was that
such investment had big 'spill over' effects - actions by one company would
help diffuse new technologies raising returns throughout industry. There was
thus a case for public subsidies such as the permanent investment tax credit
advocated by Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate.
Other Cambridge economists advanced parallel arguments for increased
investment in 'human capital' (education and training), which is another
plank of the Clinton economic plan. The relative merits of investment in
equipment, infrastructure and human capital were left unclear. In
conversation Mr De Long said the social returns to equipment investment
could be 30-40 per cent a year or even higher, making this appear by far the
best bet. Mr Summers, however, later scaled this back to 25-30 per cent,
arguing that he didn't want to be caricatured as 'Mr Equipment'.
Many of the more conservative participants at the conference found the
Cambridge arguments hard to swallow. Mr Kumiharu Shigehara, the OECD chief
economist, said reduced investment spending didn't explain the growth
slowdown since the early 1970s. The fundamental causes of slower growth
included high and variable inflation and growing 'structural rigidities'.
Repeating the favourite mantra of his predecessor, Mr David Henderson, he
said the cure lay in ancient verities, such as moves toward price stability,
the liberalisation of markets and the removal of distortions such as trade
barriers.
Other conservatives claimed the growth slowdown was illusory: on a long
historical perspective the capitalist system was performing about as well as
could be expected. Per capita growth in the industrialised countries of 1.9
per cent a year since 1973 looked poor set against the 3.5 per cent growth
between 1950 and 1973, but compared well with most other periods. Growth,
for example, averaged only 1.6 per cent a year between 1900 and 1913, which
is not a period generally considered depressed. The exceptional growth after
the Second World War was powered by special factors such as the rebuilding
of Europe and Japan, the reversal of protectionism in the inter-war years
and unsustainable growth of government spending.
Mr Michael Darby, a former Bush administration economist, took a different
and equally sceptical line. Growth hadn't slowed in the past two decades, it
was just being mismeasured. The main reason was the shift from goods
production to services, where productivity was poorly measured and often
assumed by definition to be zero. He overstated his case but a related
puzzle suggests the statistics may be faulty. The productivity growth
slowdown has been accompanied by a big increase in wage inequality which is
normally attributed to technical change, such as the rise of information
technologies. But new technologies are usually associated with faster rather
than slower growth. The circle could be partially squared if much of the
service sector and high-tech output associated with new technologies were
being systematically understated.
The conservatives made some good arguments at Jackson Hole. But I felt the
momentum was with the Cambridge neo-Keynesians, who cared less about history
and more about improving the future. It is clear that economic battle lines
are now being redrawn. Conservatives have had great success arguing against
activist counter-cyclical policies.
But new theories of economic growth, emphasising the importance of human
capital and the divergence of private and social returns on many forms of
investment, have opened a new realm for government intervention. Activist
governments, it will be increasingly argued, may not be able to prevent
periodic recessions, but they can do much to transform long-run growth
prospects.

FT  01 SEP 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: Strains in the ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR'S weakness will continue to preoccupy dealers this week, but the
strains in the exchange rate mechanism are now of the first importance in
Europe, writes James Blitz.
At the end of last week, the instability in the ERM was acute. The D-Mark,
which should ideally be at the centre of the European Monetary System's
grid, was at the top, pushing several currencies towards the bottom of their
bands. The Italian lira breached its ERM floor against the D-Mark several
times.
There are three possible courses of action to combat the crisis: Central
banks could continue to intervene to support sterling and the Italian lira.
'Such intervention will buy time,' said Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at
DKB International in London, 'but it will require a change in economic
fundamentals to fully work.'
The second possibility is a raising of interest rates by countries with the
weaker currencies. 'This is the least desirable option and is likely to be
the most counter-productive,' added Mr Lyons. In the UK's case an increase
in interest rates will give a better return to sterling investors, but would
worsen perceptions of Britain's economic plight.
Thirdly, Germany could reduce interest rates or revalue the D-Mark. Although
the German economy is slowing, there is little sign that the Bundesbank will
cut rates before the year's end.
A realignment still seems the best way out of the problem. The traditional
obstacle here has been French intransigence because a weaker franc will
upset their good record on inflation. But after last week's debacle, the
franc is less than 3 centimes off its floor against the D-Mark. Faced with
the prospect of raising rates, the French may give way on realignment, after
all.

FT  01 SEP 92 / Survey of Saxony (10): Committed rebuilder - Profile of
Heinz Eggert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEINZ EGGERT is a tall man whose casual dress and spontaneous manner belie
his inner toughness. He has forthright views about how Germans in east and
west should react to unification and is not shy of expressing them.
He certainly does not look, or talk, like a typical minister, although he
has headed Saxony's interior ministry for almost a year. Mr Eggert, has
brought to the job the committed outlook of one who suffered under the old
regime and is determined a new start should be made.
'I want to see that yesterday's people don't become tomorrow's masters,' he
says. 'I don't want our children to experience what we went through'.
Thus he is prepared to work an exhausting day from 7.30am until 11.00pm.
Often, he goes out later to tap the views of people in the bars and cafes,
especially those frequented by extreme left- or right-wingers.
He is unsure whether he will continue with this gruelling job after the
legislative period ends in 1994. He sees little of his wife, four children,
dog, and 12 rabbits. What keeps him going is the huge task of rebuilding an
administration which will oversee the painful transition to the free market.
Having been hounded by the Stasi (security forces) himself - he even found
out his doctor had given him energy-draining drugs - the railway
worker-turned-theologian has thrown himself wholeheartedly into his new
task.
'German unification has brought enormous opportunities for Germany and
Europe, but these also mean enormous responsibilities. We have to shoulder
these,' he says.
It has meant harsh decisions. Even before he took on the minister's job in
Dresden, he dealt severely with former members of the old regime when head
of the council in the small town of Zittau, near Czechoslovakia. While
believing people can change for the better, Mr Eggert has no patience with
those who made others suffer.
'I can't tolerate the use of taxpayer's money to pay people who used their
positions to harm or degrade others,' he says. The obvious cases - those who
worked or informed for the Stasi - have been dismissed, including 800 police
officers. But there are numerous cases of people whose careers were
intertwined with the old regime and who are now hard to remove under west
German law.
Mr Eggert finds this frustrating. 'The legal apparatus of west Germany is
not suitable for a time of reconstruction in the east after 40 years of
communist dictatorship'. Also taking up time is the need to deal with
extremists, particularly those on the right who have whipped up violent
resentment against foreign asylum-seekers at a time of acute economic and
social uncertainty.
In Mr Eggert's view, the fundamental problem goes beyond the housing
shortages, unemployment, rising prices and other upheavals. West Germans
should be ready to give up some of their cherished prosperity and advantages
to help those in the east rebuild their lives. They should not see unity as
something to be simply welcomed as if nothing had really changed. 'It is the
challenge of the century'.
But east Germans, too, should not hark back to the simplicity of the old
days, when pressures were fewer, though living standards were lower. He
feels that the press, unshackled after cravenly toeing the party line,
expresses a far more negative attitude than east German people themselves.

FT  01 SEP 92 / Survey of Saxony (11): Trumpet it loud - Cultural tradition
is vital to attracting investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'WHEN Saxony's cultural landscape was created, the region was one of the
richest in Germany. Today, it is one of the poorest', says Mr Hans Joachim
Meyer, the state's minister for science and culture.
That, in a nutshell, is the nature of the problem faced by Saxony and the
rest of east Germany as officials wonder how all the theatres, opera houses,
orchestras, museums and other cultural assets are to be paid for at a time
of increasing financial stringency in Bonn.
Compared with the rest of east Germany, Saxony has by far the best chance of
prosperity once economic reconstruction is completed. But when viewed
against the west German states, it is, as Mr Meyer points out, poor indeed.
Around 60 per cent of east Germany's cultural institutions (excluding former
East Berlin) are in Saxony. They range from the grand and world-renowned,
like Dresden's Semper Opera and Leipzig's Gewandhaus Orchestra, to humble
and little-known local museums and theatres. Even the survival of the most
famous music and theatre houses is not entirely without doubt. Bonn's
politicians, alarmed by the cost of unity, are proving tough.
Yet the continuation of Saxony's cultural traditions is vital to its
economic and financial health. Visits to the opera, to the art and
historical museums, and to Saxony's gracious palaces such as Moritzburg and
Pillnitz are essential elements in the itinerary of visitors, whether from
Germany or abroad. The range of cultural attractions encourages companies,
with managers and their families, to move to the state.
'In Germany, a city with no culture attracts no investment,' is the blunt
comment of Mr Peter Fittig, the councillor responsible for culture in
Chemnitz, a city whose bleak post-war architecture is relieved by its
elegant Opera House, whose restoration is nearly complete. While his may be
an extreme view, it contains plenty of truth.
Yet while it seems inconceivable that Saxony could lose any of its cultural
heritage, the need to find more funds to help pay for the 250 museums, 19
big theatres and orchestras, and numerous other facilities is acute. In the
unity treaty, the Bonn government agreed to pay DM900m towards the financing
of east Germany's cultural assets. This was cut to DM780m this year and the
1993 figure has been slashed to DM350m.
Saxony receives the lion's share of this money (which also goes to east
Berlin), with 42 per cent. But the latest reduction is proving the last
straw. 'This is totally unacceptable,' says Mr Meyer, who has written a
sharp letter to the Bonn minister responsible.
At DM900m, Bonn's contribution represented half the cultural financing needs
of the eastern states; at DM350m, it will be only 10 per cent. The states
and local authorities of east Germany are in no financial state to make up
the difference themselves. Local authorities of all five states will have to
raise their budget spending on theatres and orchestras from DM120m to DM317m
at a time when they are heavily in deficit.
Inevitably, cuts will be made. Mr Meyer, a professor of English, says these
have started. A committee of experts from all over Germany is looking at
solutions and prominent cultural figures such as Ludwig Guttler, trumpet
virtuoso with the Dresden Philharmonic, are doing their best to lobby the
Bonn politicians.
The present situation is very unsettling, says Mr Wolfgang Schonfeldt,
business head of the Semper Opera. 'We have to keep up the artistic rhythm -
uncertainty is damaging.' The opera house's annual budget is around DM60m,
only around DM10m of which it can meet itself; the rest comes from state and
federal funds. 'Next year, we will need DM80m,' he says. Wages are going up
and guest conductors and soloists will not always settle for low fees.
Mr Schonfeldt needs to find another DM1.5m just to pay guest performers at
this year's three remaining premieres: Richard Strauss's Arabella, Gluck's
Orpheus and Eurydice and a mixed ballet evening. Next year, it hopes to
mount an ambitious ballet of Herman Hesse's novel, Steppenwolf. In line with
the Semper Opera's status, Mr Schonfeldt reckons it will soon require an
annual DM100m a year, similar to the yearly budget of the comparable Munich
opera.
What about sponsorship? Corporate funds are being sought, but cultural
sponsorship is less developed than in the US or Britain. Mr Meyer believes
sponsors are needed, but as a supplement to state support, not a
replacement. It seems inevitable that some of Saxony's theatres and
orchestras will be amalgamated, with some disappearing. With modern
transport, however, not every town needs its own stage and musicians.
'Sometimes,' jokes Mr Meyer, 'it is said that Saxony's orchestras are so
close together that they can hear each other if they play loud enough.'

FT  01 SEP 92 / Survey of Saxony (8): Crash clean-up - Quentin Peel examines
the environment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the ironies of German unification is that the appalling pollution
which used to poison the air of East Germany has dropped dramatically - not
because of any great clean-up campaign, but because half the industries
which caused the problem have closed down: cleaner air has come hand-in-hand
with unemployment.
And yet the inheritance of environmental havoc wreaked by the former
communist regime, and by the Soviet army of occupation, promises to be a
burden on the impoverished communities of the east for decades to come.
If the whole of East Germany was an environmental disaster area, the state
of Saxony can claim to be the worst affected region of all.
Dr Dieter Angst, the appropriately-named state secretary for the environment
in Dresden, says that in the west environmental debates are largely
ideological. 'There we were just debating about figures after the decimal
point,' he says. 'Here we are talking about tonnes. We are carrying out
emergency repairs to the environment here, not preventive treatment.'
The problems he has to tackle are all too obvious. In the north and east are
the huge expanses of opencast brown coal mining: great lunar landscapes,
dotted with abandoned machinery, pits, and pools of stagnant water, where
nothing has ever been contemplated to return the land to nature. In the
south and west, the mining devastation has been caused by the desperate
search for uranium to supply the Soviet nuclear weapons' programme in the
1950s, 1960s and 1970s - rape-mining, they call it in the Erz mountains.
Dr Gu Hasel, a geologist in the mining industry, tries to explain how it
happened. 'At first we could see how things were being allowed to collapse
and deteriorate,' he said. 'But then we got used to it. We had no
opportunity to compare our conditions with the outside world. So then you
ceased to notice it any more.'
The uranium mines (run as a 'state within a state' with virtually their own
laws and permits by the Soviet-German Wismut enterprise) sold arsenic-rich
radioactive tailings for road repairs and farm construction.
Some went into the floors of milking parlours. 'It was only when they
realised the milk was radioactive that they traced it back to the mines,' Dr
Hasel said. 'They simply did not care. It was criminal irresponsibility.'
In spite of the industrial closures, air pollution is still far above
western and European Community norms. By 1996, Saxony has to reach the EC
standard of a maximum of 2,500 mg of sulphur dioxide per cubic metre of foul
air from its brown coal-burning power stations. At the moment, Dr Angst
says, the level is somewhere between 3,300 and 12,500 mg. Leipzig and
Chemnitz are the worst affected.
Yet the most urgent environmental problems with which the state government
must deal are perhaps the least obvious: providing clean drinking water, and
sewage treatment systems.
Where drinking water is concerned, both surface water and underground
reservoirs are heavily polluted by chemicals, heavy metals, and nitrate
fertilisers - the highest priority for treatment.
If anything, the sewage problem is worse. At least 90 per cent of the
population has access to water mains. Most have no proper sewage treatment
system at all.
Dr Angst calculates the entire cost of environmental repairs to the land
alone at DM11bn; he has an annual budget this year of DM684m. More than
DM500m of that goes on sewage treatment, clean air programmes, rubbish
collection and disposal.
Yet the only pollution which is the responsibility of Bonn is that caused by
Wismut. Everything else is supposed to be paid for by the Saxony government
and the bankrupt local communities.
'Our first task is to avert the immediate dangers, which means cleaning up
the water and air,' says Dr Angst. 'I don't have to recultivate the brown
coal mining areas immediately. Nor should we borrow for these long-term
projects.
'But the popular feeling is that, after years of ignoring it, suddenly
everything must be done, and done by the state. The thinking is coloured by
this situation where the state did everything: this incapacity, this
abrogation of decision-making, is still all-pervasive. People don't and
won't think how they should resolve their problems themselves.'
Bringing the eastern environment up to western standards is going to be a
very long and expensive haul, and one which will fall overwhelmingly on the
public purse. It will take 10 years at least to reach those standards on
clean air; as far as the land and water are concerned, it will probably be a
battle lasting 30 years.

FT  01 SEP 92 / Survey of Saxony (9): Straight talk helps - Profile of Kurt
Biedenkopf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN Dresden's fledgling state parliament, even the opposition parties are
wary of attacking Kurt Biedenkopf. In spite of the severe problems affecting
Saxony as it shakes off the remnants of communism and moves into the more
exposed atmosphere of the free market, the state's Christian Democrat (CDU)
prime minister enjoys a high degree of popularity and respect.
This stems from his mixture of straight talking about the present and
well-argued optimism about the future. At a time when many east Germans feel
neglected by Bonn, Mr Biedenkopf is the western politician who came to offer
help and has stayed to see his work through.
'There is no precedent for what we are doing', he says of the monumental
task of dragging what was - if only for four decades - a separate country
into the modern economic and industrial world. He believes East Germany
would have collapsed anyway in a few years if its citizens had not taken to
the streets and toppled the Honecker regime.
Mr Biedenkopf, was one of the first to assess the real cost of unification
with east Germany, whose economy turned out to be industrially and
economically more moribund than most experts thought. The stagnating East
German system, he says, was kept going by exploitation of the people, the
economy and the environment. 'But every exploitation comes to an end, since
there is nothing left to exploit'.
Politically, Mr Biedenkopf, a legal professor, has always been a thorn in
the side of Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Mr Biedenkopf may be a lot smaller than
the towering Mr Kohl, but he is intellectually faster on his feet and is not
shy of showing it.
But while he is sure of his own views, Mr Biedenkopf has been careful not to
appear an arrogant, know-all westerner, something of which long-suffering
east Germans have had enough experience.
He makes the point that Saxony, before the 1914-18 war, had the highest per
capita gross national product in Germany, higher even than the
industrialised Ruhr. Like neighbouring Bohemia, in Czechoslovakia, 'Saxony
played a pioneering role in European industry'.
Even after 45 years of communism, he believes this can be revived.
Volkswagen is building a car plant near Zwickau, Siemens is investing
heavily in the state and Dresdner Bank has returned to its original home.
But it will be a long haul before economic and social conditions are akin to
those in the west. 'It will probably take a generation'.
Mr Biedenkopf is confident that the Saxons, and other east Germans, can take
the strain in the intervening years. 'The problems are huge. But they have
been absorbed in a way you couldn't ask of people in west Germany,' he says.
Strikes and demonstrations are inevitable, although these can turn nasty as
with the violence against asylum-seekers in the town of Hoyerswerda. 'Such a
huge stress in such a short time, amounting to a radical change in people's
way of life, is bound to cause eruptions.'
He is thankful that most people in Saxony, according to opinion polls, still
regard their positions as better or at least no worse than a year ago, in
spite of the physical and psychological turmoil they are going through. But
he believes, like Heinz Eggert, his interior minister, that unity must be
regarded as a challenge for all Germans, not just those in the east.

FT  01 SEP 92 / Survey of Saxony (4): Where they spend it - Dresden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DRESDEN, the state capital of Saxony, is a city with a magnificent and
turbulent past and a potentially glittering future. The present-day reality
contains elements of both, as Dresdeners struggle bravely with the
frustrations and hopes of recapturing the city's former prosperity and
elegance.
The past can be seen from the views of Dresden in its heyday painted by
Canaletto. High over the baroque city, sited so dramatically on the River
Elbe, soars the Frauenkirche (Church of our Lady), the beautiful domed
protestant church.
When Dresden was battered by Allied bombs early in 1945, the Frauenkirche
collapsed, its baroque heritage seemed lost for ever, and Gerhart Hauptmann,
the Nobel prize-winning author, was moved to utter the cry that has become
part of the city's legend: 'Those who have forgotten how to cry will learn
again through the destruction of Dresden.'
The Frauenkirche is still in ruins, but strenuous efforts are being made to
raise funds for its reconstruction.
Other renovations are under way. The baroque Zwinger Palace, built in the
reign of Augustus the Strong, Saxony's ruler in the early 18th century, is
being smartened up. Most ambitious of all, the elector's palace is being
wholly rebuilt.
All of these buildings were severely damaged in 1945. Under four decades of
communist rule, more old buildings were swept away, leaving Dresden, and its
522,000 people, with its fair share of bleak, nondescript apartment and
office blocks as well as districts that have survived war and need
refurbishing.
Through all its hardships, the city's heart has continued to beat strongly.
As Saxony - like the other east German states - has been recreated under
German unity, so has its state capital regained its pride and identity.
Dresdner Bank, headquartered in Frankfurt, was quick to open up premises in
the city of its origin. Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, the state premier who made his
political name in west Germany, presides over the government in an imposing
building overlooking the Elbe.
In summer, open air cafes and restaurants are buzzing and the view from the
restored Bruhl Terrace above the Elbe, with its broad riverside meadows,
allows a glimpse of Dresden's past glories.
For the inhabitants, however, there are more urgent - and mundane -
considerations. The city's infrastructure is in a woeful state, housing is
inadequate and social tensions have increased. The city council is having a
hard time grappling with these problems, hampered by inexperience and lack
of money.
In time, the hurdles will be overcome. With a rich cultural history - Wagner
grew up there and Kokoschka painted there - its breadth of academic and
scientific institutions, and status as capital of a state striving to revive
its former industrial prominence in Germany, Dresden promises again to
become one of the most fascinating and exciting of European cities.

FT  01 SEP 92 / Survey of Saxony (5): Where they trade it - Leipzig
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THE people of Leipzig have one thing in mind when they look towards the
future, it is that they want to recreate the glories of the past.
For many centuries the city was an important trade, manufacturing and
cultural centre: Leipzig's role as a trade centre dates from 1165, when it
was granted the right to hold markets; its university was founded in 1409;
Johann Sebastian Bach was cantor of its Thomas Church for 27 years; Richard
Wagner was born in the city.
Before the war, Leipzig was as important an industrial centre as the Ruhr.
More recently, its 1989 mass demonstrations helped provide the momentum
which led first to the fall of the Berlin Wall eventually to reunification.
The old town centre did not suffer as much as Dresden during the last war
and so Leipzig is one of the more attractive cities of east Germany. A drab
communist past is rapidly being swept away as new vitality enters the city.
With branches of 60 banks established in the city, Leipzig is now rivalling
Dusseldorf as the second most important financial centre in Germany after
Frankfurt.
Marketing, advertising agencies and public relations companies are choosing
Leipzig as a base in the new Lander. Shops and restaurants abound in a way
that would have been inconceivable a year ago.
But the transition to a market economy has brought its trials. Not everyone
has been lucky enough to have found a job as a banker, builder or waiter.
Unemployment is high in Leipzig. At the end of June the figure stood at just
over 10 per cent (although this is less than the near 13 per cent figure for
Saxony as a whole).
Although unemployment in Leipzig is gradually coming down, Mr Claus Von der
Decken, a Potsdam-born engineer who worked in the west before returning to
Leipzig to run the local branch of the Treuhand, says the general business
climate is less favourable than it was last year. 'The chief difficulty is
that wages have gone up faster than productivity,' he complains, 'and wages
are much cheaper across the border in Czechoslovakia and Poland.'
For Hannes Buss, who has just exchanged a comfortable post in Augsburg for
that of head of Leipzig's business promotion bureau (Amt fur
Wirtschaftsforderung), the main task for the coming year is to 'go on the
offensive' in order to attract industrial investors.
He regrets that for all Leipzig's attractions as a business centre, it has
failed to draw investment from west German car manufacturers or printing
machinery companies. 'The potential is there, the workforce is well-educated
and adaptable, and the infrastructure will soon be fully in place.'
Investment tends to be in the service sector. An ambitious example is that
of SachsenLB, the newly created regional bank serving the government of
Saxony and savings banks.
The bank, which will also pursue commercial business, is to employ 250
people by 1994-95, a five-fold expansion from the present headcount. Its
shareholders, which include the Sudwest LB (the Stuttgart-based Landesbank
for South-West Germany), are investing a total of DM500m.
On a larger scale are plans to invest DM1.2bn in new premises for the old
trade fair. Its former role as a bridge between the communist world and the
west has vanished and it is now concentrating on hosting fairs in three
areas: the environment, transport and industrial technology.

FT  01 SEP 92 / Survey of Saxony (6): Where they earn it - Chemnitz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CITY of Chemnitz had the dubious distinction under the East German
communist regime of being renamed Karl-Marx-Stadt - a move quickly reversed
when the political tide turned.
Yet the communist philosopher's huge stone head still dominates the city
centre and there are no plans to remove it. In spite of the unfortunate
associations with the past, the city is keeping Marx as an inhabitant.
His presence has nothing to do with any links between Marx and Chemnitz,
Saxony's third largest city with nearly 300,000 people. The only connection
is that Chemnitz has long been an industrial centre - it was known as
Germany's Manchester - with a strong working class tradition.
People there like to repeat that 'Chemnitz is where the money is earned,
Leipzig where it is traded and Dresden where it is spent.' Chemnitz lacks
the attractions of the other two. It was badly bombed in the last war,
rebuilt on grim utilitarian lines and is now struggling to readjust itself
as its industry suffers in the transition to the free market.
From the heyday of silver mining in the nearby Erzgebirge ('ore hills') in
the Middle Ages, through the textile boom of the 19th century, to
engineering and cars in the modern industrial era, Chemnitz has been at the
centre of economic development in Germany and Europe.
'Chemnitz was the cradle of the machine tool industry in Germany,' says Mr
Matthias Weissbeck, manager of Niles-Simmons, a lathe manufacturer bought by
a US concern (and thus with a relatively secure future). The company was
able to keep near the forefront of technical development under the old
regime, mainly because it sold as much as a third of its products to the
west.
Today it employs about 250 people and hopes to move up to 400. To slash
costs, it has cut staff; it buys more parts from outside instead of making
everything itself, as was common under the former regime. In those days it
employed 1,600.
The same process is taking place at Heckert, a name well known in the
industry but clouded by uncertainty. Heckert, which makes machine centres
and milling machines, has cut jobs from 4,300 to 500 and is slimming down
its product range and size to a profitable level. 'Heckert was the flagship
of the East German machine tool industry,' says Mr Wolfgang Sittig, joint
managing director.
The company is far from enjoying that role in a united Germany. Now that the
Russian market, which took 80 per cent of sales, has collapsed, Heckert has
to make its way in the west, where the industry is in hard times and
potential buyers are thin on the ground. Yet the mood is determinedly
optimistic. 'It is costing us a lot of sweat, but we think we will survive,'
says Mr Manfred Friedrich, Heckert's other joint manager.
The survival mentality is strong in Chemnitz. New business parks are planned
and improvements to the infrastructure under way. But the economic turmoil
is tremendous, with only around a fifth of the jobs from the old GDR
remaining.
This is especially true of sectors such as textiles where low-cost foreign
competition is intense. New jobs are not being created fast enough and half
the working population is jobless or in job-creation and training
programmes.
There are positive signs. Some are economic, such as the robust commitment
of Mr Jakob Langenauer, a Swiss businessman, to the textile machinery
company, Chemnitzer Webmaschinenbau, which he now heads after his
imagination was captured by the fall of the Berlin Wall. 'Confidence is the
most important thing in competing with western companies. People here are
well educated, intelligent, and ready to work together,' he says.
In December of this year, the reopening of the restored Opera House at
Chemnitz should help confidence along. It was here, for the first time. that
Wagner's Parsifal was performed outside Bayreuth. For those with the
patience to sit through it, Parsifal will again be staged in Chemnitz this
year.

FT  01 SEP 92 / Survey of Saxony (7): The dinosaur wakes - Philips overhauls
a telecommunications factory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STAIRWAYS at Philips' telecommunications factory in Bautzen still bear
the unmistakeable look of the old East German style of industry: crumbling
concrete and a few faded photographs of local landscapes.
But inside the offices, and in the main assembly shop, it is obvious that an
important overhaul has already taken place. New computer terminals stand on
the desks, new carpets line the floors, new paint covers the walls and, in
the assembly shop, there are new production lines.
Little expense has been spared to transform the scruffy old plant producing
transmission equipment for the Soviet and Comecon markets into a new
operation catering for the mighty Deutsche Telekom's rather more demanding
requirements.
From the moment unification became a reality, it was obvious that
telecommunications would be one of the first and biggest markets to be
opened up for western suppliers.
The East German network lagged far behind the west in both density and
sophistication, its development hampered by western restrictions on
technology exports and East Germany's mania for keeping communications under
the control of its security services.
Deutsche Telekom plans to spend DM55bn by 1997 to bring the new federal
states up to the level of the old.
PKI (Philips Kommunikations Industrie) - the Nuremberg-based German
telecommunications subsidiary of the Dutch multi-national, already an
important contractor to Deutsche Telekom - could have easily produced the
necessary transmission equipment back in the west. It decided instead to
invest in the east.
'It was clear from the start that whoever wanted to be in there would have
to get a base in the east,' says Mr Uwe Bartsch, administration manager at
the plant. 'Deutsche Telekom decided it would favour those contractors who
had investments in the region.'
This was undoubtedly the most important reason why Philips came to Bautzen.
A second consideration was the prospect of opening up new markets in eastern
Europe.
'Before unification, the factory in Bautzen exported up to 80 per cent of
its products to the rest of Comecon. They had excellent contacts with the
East, where we had no real contacts at all,' Mr Bartsch said.
So Philips bought RFT Fernmeldewerk in Bautzen from the Treuhand
privatisation agency for an undisclosed sum, promising to keep at least 350
jobs of the 1,000 employed there, and drawing up an investment programme
totalling DM75m.
Today the plant has been substantially modernised and about DM36m of the
investment cash has been spent.
The second reason for Philips coming to Bautzen has not worked so well:
instead of expanding, the eastern markets have collapsed.
Russia and the former Soviet republics are buying only about 25 per cent of
what they used to buy, because of the shortage of foreign exchange. Although
Russia and Germany have finally agreed on export credit guarantees, 'we are
still waiting for the Russians to decide what they want in concrete terms,'
Mr Bartsch says.
However, he is convinced Philips does not regret its move. Although
productivity is lower than in the west, so are wage costs - at least until
1994. With the investment subsidies available, that provides a big cost
reduction. The work force still lacks the support system needed to match
western productivity, but Mr Bartsch reckons it will catch up by next year.

FT  01 SEP 92 / Survey of Saxony (3): VW takes economic lead - Andrew Fisher
looks at the region's largest corporate investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN is the most obvious symbol of Saxony's economic regeneration,
hesitant though that may yet be. At Mosel, near the town of Zwickau, VW
already employs 2,300 people and will have twice that number in two years'
time.
Visitors to the Mosel site, where a big plant is being constructed, are
guided along the country roads by the VW emblem which the local authorities
have allowed to be painted on to their signs. VW did not have trouble
persuading them. It is investing nearly DM5bn in east Germany, most of that
in Saxony, at the Mosel car plant and the Chemnitz engine facility.
The presence in Saxony of the largest corporate investment in east Germany
is proof enough, if proof were needed, that this is the region with the best
chance of economic success. 'Every investment has a symbolic character,'
says Mr Gerd Heuss, general manager at VW Sachsen. 'But this is also an
investment with new standards of technology and equipment.'
From the mid-1990s VW will produce up to 250,000 cars a year from the new
plant being erected beside the building where the choking little Trabants -
the butt of numerous jokes - were made.
VW is already assembling cars in the existing building - completely
revamped; the products and manufacturing methods are light years away from
those of the Trabi days. In July, in Mosel, VW started production of its
latest Golf model. It aims to turn out a daily average of 380 cars next
year, having reached 250 a day in 1992 with the old model. The new plant
will be capable of 1,200 a day from 1994.
VW is already trying out some new techniques which will be used in the new
facility. Whole 'front-end' assemblies of bumpers, lights, grilles and
radiators are delivered by a local supplier and inserted straight on to the
car. The same is true of instrument panels, wheel and tyre units, seats and
other units.
Components makers such as Siemens, VDO, Alibert of France and Britain's GKN
have already set up local operations. VW works with nine components system
suppliers and plans to raise this to 15. Mr Heuss says VW hopes to save up
to 15 per cent of component costs - parts and materials account for some 60
per cent of total manufacturing costs - by having assembly systems delivered
as they are needed.
The benefits for the area are already considerable, though Saxony as a whole
is afflicted with the same economic upheaval as the rest of east Germany.
Zwickau, an historic town which once drew its prosperity from the silver
mining in the nearby hills, is undergoing a revival as the result of VW's
nearby presence.
Apart from jobs at VW, at least 20,000 more will be generated at supplier
companies by its investment in east Germany, also including a cylinder head
plant in Eisenach, Thuringia. Most of these supplier jobs will be in Saxony.
VW now buys DM1bn worth of east German-made parts a year.
One part of the new Mosel plant is already operating. With the help of 123
orange robots, body panels are made for the Golfs being assembled next door.
All that remains of the old days is the sight of a few Trabis in the VW car
park.

FT  01 SEP 92 / Survey of Saxony (2): Industry battles to catch up - Past
economic mismanagement carries a high price tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE centre of Dresden, a big yellow sign proclaims that the war-bombed
ruins of the Taschenberg Palace, now a gaping baroque facade, are to be
turned into a luxury hotel.
An hour along the motorway, in Chemnitz, the remnants of a demolished
chemical factory are being removed to make way for a new business park.
Piles of scrap machinery lie next to a neat red brick building which will be
retained as a link with the past.
Further west, the cathedral in Zwickau - near to the site where Volkswagen
is building a big car plant - is covered in scaffolding. At one end of the
dark, vaulted interior, restorers put back a gilded female figure on the
high 15th century altar. Across the road, Horten, the West German store
group, has installed itself in modern premises. Jeans and T-shirts are on
sale in an old, unpainted building nearby.
Signs of regeneration such as these abound in Saxony, the state in eastern
Germany which once led the country in industrialisation.
It was here that the world's first mechanical cloth-weaving looms, portable
typewriters, and single-lens reflex cameras were made. Chemnitz and Zwickau
were important centres of the pre-war car industry; the four-ring emblem of
Audi (a VW subsidiary) represents the four Saxon companies that merged to
form the carmaker.
Long before that, the state had prospered from silver mining in the Erz
mountains. But while Saxony can look back to a rich economic and cultural
past, linking up with that tradition after more than 40 years of central
planning is proving costly and traumatic. Few local companies can survive in
their pre-unification form, if at all, a notable exception being Meissen,
the renowned porcelain manufacturer.
As in the rest of East Germany, industry in Saxony was subordinated to the
ruthless demands of communist planners. Production targets came before
environmental needs, selling to eastern Europe took precedence over
satisfying local consumers, and industrial concentration supplanted
diversity.
The sorry results are plain to see. Industry lagged well behind western
standards of innovation, technology, and productivity as output was forced
ahead and investment neglected. With the coming of the D-Mark, the
unsuitability of many products for western markets and the unrealistic cost
basis of East German industry were ruthlessly exposed. The collapse of
Comecon was a further blow.
Among the hardest hit sectors have been textiles, electrical and electronic
goods, iron, steel, and metalworking, timber and plastics processing, and
engineering. Because Saxony accounted for a third of East Germany's
industrial output, the state is paying the price for economic mismanagement.
While unemployment is below eastern Germany's average, at about 14 per cent
or 326,000 people, a further 101,000 are in temporary job creation schemes,
150,000 are being retrained, and 122,000 are on short time. Many more have
simply retired early.
Investment to create new jobs is flowing in, but it will take years before
Saxon industry catches up with the west. Along the way, though, the state
will obtain some of the world's most modern facilities. Apart from big
corporate investors such as VW, Siemens, Bosch, MAN, Linde, Quelle, and
Degussa from Germany and Philips (Netherlands), Enso-Gutzeit (Finland), the
Swiss-Swedish ABB, Tarmac (UK), Coca-Cola, and Philip Morris (US) from
abroad, there is a high volume of spending on new infrastructure.
By the end of the century, some DM15bn will have been spent on
telecommunications in Saxony. Last year, DM1.8bn went on roads and DM2.5bn
on the rail system, with DM2.75bn being spent this and next year on the
energy network. Large sums are going on the refurbishment and reconstruction
of public buildings and facilities. 'Saxony had the telecoms and traffic
infrastructure of 1939,' says Mr Rudiger Thiele, state secretary at Saxony's
economics ministry.
Large though the flow of new business investment may be - some DM50bn,
including future spending commitments - it lags behind the region's needs.
Officials would like more foreign investment. 'Foreign companies can't
ignore east Germany and Saxony,' says Mr Walter Rogg, chief executive of the
Saxony Economic Development Corporation. 'Lots of companies are waiting to
see how things develop. The infrastructure will be better later, but
financial incentives will not be so generous and the best workers will have
been taken.'
Mr Helmut Wotte, head of the Dresden branch of the Treuhand, the East German
privatisation agency, agrees. 'We need a more international touch in our
investments. Some companies, like the Japanese, want hard and fast
information; they are only interested in companies they can assess under
their own standards.' Yet companies in Saxony have not reached the stage at
which this is possible.
Hence it is mostly German companies, motivated by both national and business
considerations, which have taken the investment plunge. It is not only in
manufacturing, construction and services where this has occurred. They were
also quick to snap up opportunities in the food and drink sector, where
investment in breweries, dairies, slaughterhouses and other facilities is
likely to total about DM3bn. Saxony's beer and wine, at least, will survive
the transition to the free market.

FT  01 SEP 92 / Survey of Saxony (1): Hungry to succeed - Restoring the
prosperity of Saxony, once one of Germany's richest regions, is an important
task in the difficult and costly reconstruction taking place after the
country's east-west reunification. Andrew Fisher reports on progress so far
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the greatest economic transformations of the century is taking place
in eastern Germany, and the exciting, arduous, and highly frustrating
process is at its most visible in the state of Saxony.
Anyone visiting the region today would find it hard to imagine that Saxony
was once one of the richest parts of Germany, with an industrial tradition
that would have kept it at the forefront of European prosperity but for 12
years of Nazi tyranny (including the devastation of the Second World War)
and 40 years of Communist domination.
Despite the surge of private and public investment into the state and the
intense efforts being made to improve the ragged infrastructure, it takes
only a brief walk round any city, town, or village to realise that the task
of reconstruction is enormous. Many roads are still rutted, rail travel is
slow and unreliable and the dirt and neglect of decades is proving hard to
scrub away.
Yet the same walk is also likely to reveal enormous progress. Before the
Berlin Wall came down in November 1989, and the German border was flung
open, East Germany's streets were drab and lifeless, the range of goods in
the shops was pathetic by western standards and queuing was a way of life.
Today the queues are gone. Shop windows are varied and colourful and city
streets are full of life.
Because the economic, social and psychological relics of the past are
proving more costly and time-consuming to overcome than most people expected
 -and many politicians led them to believe - the transition from communist
central planning to the opportunities, and risks, of the free market is
accompanied by much discontent and protest, as well as hope and optimism.
On balance, the positive still outweighs the negative in most people's
minds. Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, the conservative Christian Democrat (CDU) prime
minister of Saxony, constantly quotes opinion polls which show that people
in Saxony are still generally more satisfied with their present situation,
and with the future outlook, than they were previously. He has never hidden
the awkward truth of the real state of the old East Germany, and the immense
costs and efforts required to drag it up to western economic standards.
'People do not lack confidence and they mostly see the future positively,'
he says. Because he was not one of those who painted too rosy a picture of
prospects in the election year of 1990, people in Saxony are mostly prepared
to believe Mr Biedenkopf when he talks of the tremendous opportunities in
store for the state. Certainly, the local Social Democrat (SPD) opposition
has no-one with anything like his stature, and knows full well that
attacking him would not bring it popularity.
One of the strengths of Saxony, with a population of 4.9m, is its strong
sense of identity - although the communists tried to obliterate this when
they abolished the individual states. Cities in Saxony, notably Leipzig,
were a powerful source of grassroots opposition to the scorned regime of
Erich Honecker in its final days. Like Dresden, Leipzig had been in constant
struggle with East Berlin, the former East German capital which enjoyed
extensive political and economic privileges.
Today, Dresden is the capital of Saxony, with Leipzig developing as a
commercial and financial centre. Both places are full of building sites,
around which essential road repairs and improvements cause constant traffic
hold-ups. But these inconveniences show the speed at which reconstruction is
proceeding, despite the horrendous handicaps of property disputes,
administrative delays caused by inexperience and the sheer weight of work,
and the economic disruption stemming from the collapse of the old economic
system.
The challenge is inspiring, however, and often dispiriting. Numerous
officials, managers and other experts have come from the west to participate
in the economic, political and social rebuilding of Saxony. With good
accommodation in short supply (and outrageously priced when available), and
a crushing workload, such a degree of commitment is not to be entered into
lightly.
One such 'transplant' is Mr Rudiger Thiele, state secretary at Saxony's
economics ministry and a former senior official in the Bonn Chancellery.
Like many of his colleagues in Dresden and in the rest of the state, he sees
the task of restoring the state's prosperity as invigorating, essential in
the creation of a new identity for a country still coming to terms with
unification between the capitalist west and the once-communist east.
'In west Germany, people have become rather smug and self-satisfied,' Mr
Thiele says. 'Years of prosperity make people lethargic. Here, people are
hungry to succeed. A new generation is developing which has to be tough to
be successful against the established systems and structures of the west.'
This view is in line with Mr Biedenkopf's assertion that east Germans are
capable of bearing more economic and social burdens than people in the west
because of efforts they have made to break with the past and their belief
that their lives will improve.
For the moment, though, they are living in a very uncertain present.
Unemployment and short-time working are high. The least competitive, most
inefficient, and most environmentally offensive of the old companies have
closed; the survivors struggle to become more productive by shedding staff
and closing peripheral operations.
A new layer of Mittelstand (small- and medium-sized) businesses is growing
up in what was formerly East Germany to provide a much-needed dose of
entrepreneurial vigour. Under the old regime, these were squeezed into big
industrial combines, so that the Mittelstand's contribution to economic
prosperity, vital in West Germany, was crushed.
At this stage it is hard to assess the impact Mittelstand companies will
have on Saxony's economy, or how robustly they will develop. More attention
has been directed to the big headline investments such as those of
Volkswagen, Siemens and other German and foreign concerns. It is these which
give Saxony a positive sense of its economic destiny, and offer hope that
today's tribulations will be tomorrow's successes.
But Saxony's future also depends on the survival of its cultural heritage,
kept alive through the years of dictatorship and Stalinism. This ranges from
the big opera houses and orchestras of Dresden and Leipzig - where Kurt
Masur, a key figure in the events that toppled the East Berlin regime,
conducts the famed Gewandhaus orchestra - to smaller establishments around
the state. While these are a vital part of Saxony's attractions, they are
proving increasingly hard to pay for.
It is unclear how far Bonn will continue helping to finance Saxony's
cultural assets. Mr Hans Joachim Meyer, the English professor who is
minister for science and culture, is doing his best to prise more money out
of the German federal government. But the provision of funds for culture
depends on the health of the economy, and the Bonn government is trying
desperately to control the flow of money to the east.
'We have to accept the need for a prolonged period for the reconstruction of
east Germany,' Mr Meyer says. 'People here will have to accept lower
standards of living for a longer time and people in west Germany will have
to pay for the east for longer.'
In Saxony, people are resigned to some difficult years before their efforts
and patience pay off. When they do, however, the state will be ready to take
its place among the most prosperous and vibrant, as well as scenically
attractive, parts of Germany.

RESULTS DUE
THE interim results season, which had taken a breather during most of
August, springs back to life on Thursday with a clutch of companies
reporting.
Williams Holdings, the industrial conglomerate, is expected to have suffered
a fall in half-year pre-tax profits from Pounds 76.5m to around Pounds 73m.
Earnings per share are also likely to be down to 10.5p from 10.9p. The
interim dividend is expected to be unchanged at 5p. Most of Williams'
divisions have been affected by the recession on both sides of the Atlantic
and are expected to show a fall in profits. This is expected to more than
offset contributions from Yale and Valor, the locks and domestic appliances
group, bought last year in an agreed deal.
Rolls-Royce, the aircraft engine maker, continues to claw its way back from
its dismal interim results last year. Pre-tax profits should be back to
nearly Pounds 40m from Pounds 11m a year earlier. A positive factor has been
the slow recovery in sales of engine spares.
Burmah Castrol, the lubricants, chemicals and fuels company, is expected to
announce interim pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 of about
Pounds 78m, resulting in net income after tax and minorities of about Pounds
39m. This compares to profits and net income of Pounds 72.2m and Pounds 33m
respectively for the first half of last year. Lubricants, which includes
Castrol automotive oils, is expected to have performed well although the
chemicals division is expected to be down.
Ladbroke should edge ahead about 5 per cent to interim pre-tax profits of
Pounds 100m-Pounds 105m. The picture at none of its main divisions is
particularly exciting.
T&amp;N is likely to turn in a creditable Pounds 30m in interim pre-tax profits,
up from Pounds 20.3m a year earlier. Although the car parts business remains
very tough, it has picked up market share and won orders on new vehicle
models.
Reckitt &amp; Colman, the food and household products maker, has had a static
first half with pre-tax profits close to last year's Pounds 128m. Cookson,
the materials maker, is also likely to have had a flat first compared with
last year's Pounds 34m. But its heavy rationalisation programme of the past
year is starting to pay off.

FT  01 SEP 92 / Economics: Focus turns to Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE focus this week turns to Germany where important data on the real
economy are due. The figures will be watched all the more keenly following
the recent turmoil on the currencies markets.
In June, German industrial production fell by 2.1 per cent and although the
drop was explained away by an early start to the summer holidays, industrial
output has fallen month-on-month since April. Another drop in July could
improve sentiment towards the dollar, since the weaker the German economy,
the sooner the Bundesbank is likely to cut interest rates.
But according to Ruth Lea, chief economist at Mitsubishi Bank, there are
still no signs of serious recession in west Germany. 'So on this count there
is not room for early Bundesbank easing,' she says.
Unemployment in west Germany is forecast to rise by 20,000 as employment
prospects weaken. However, the unemployment rate for west Germany, at around
6 per cent is still lower than in France, the UK and Italy.
In the UK, figures for August's official reserves should give some
indication of the extent of the Bank of England's intervention to support
the pound last month.
Other economic highlights of the week are listed below. The median of
economists' forecasts from MMS International are in brackets.
Yesterday: UK, Bank holiday, markets closed; US, new home sales (587,000),
August Chicago national association of purchasing managers index, August
agricultural prices; Canada, second quarter real GDP, second quarter
consumption, second quarter nominal current account, June real GDP at factor
cost; Japan, July construction orders, July housing starts (up 1.7 per cent
on year), July construction starts, August trade balance; Australia, July
current account, seasonally adjusted (ADollars 0.99bn deficit).
Today: US, July leading indicators (up 0.1 per cent), August NAPM index
(54.0 per cent), July construction spending (up 0.5 per cent); Japan, August
foreign exchange reserves.
Tomorrow: US, July factory orders (down 1.8 per cent), July factory
shipments; UK, August official reserves (down Dollars 800m).
Thursday: Germany, Bundesbank holds regular council meeting, second quarter
GNP, west (down 1 per cent), August unemployment, west (up 20,000), July
employment, west (down 15,000), August vacancies, west (down 5,000), August
unemployment, east (up 10,000), August short-time work, east (down 25,000).
Friday: Switzerland, August Zurich CPI, August federal CPI (up 0.4 per cent
on month, up 3.7 per cent on year); Canada, August employment growth, August
unemployment rate; Japan, July trade balance, July current account, August
foreign bond investment; New Zealand, second quarter producer price index
for inputs and outputs; Finland, 1993 budget presented.
During the week: Germany, July trade balance (DM2bn surplus), July current
account (DM4.5bn deficit), July industrial production (up 0.5 per cent on
month), July manufacturing output (up 0.5 per cent on month); Switzerland,
second quarter GDP (down 0.4 per cent on year), August unemployment rate (3
per cent); Italy, August CPI (up 5.4 per cent on year).

FT  01 SEP 92 / International Bonds: Ecu market close to collapse as union
hopes fade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ECU bond market, built on the assumption of European monetary union,
appears to be close to collapse, after prices dived again and liquidity
evaporated last week.
A series of opinion polls showing that a majority of French voters are
preparing to reject the Maastricht treaty on European monetary and political
union in this month's referendum sent a further shock wave through the
market, which was still reeling from the blow delivered by Denmark's
rejection of the treaty on June 2.
'The market is effectively closed,' said one marketmaker, after attempts to
revive liquidity by resetting marketmaking guidelines failed.
The price of the Paribas 10-year Ecu bond index dropped to 97.64 late last
week, from 100.13 the previous week. Ecu bonds issued by France and the UK
held up better than most, while Italy's bonds due 2011 again bore the brunt
of selling, dropping from more than six points to 86.30 in the course of
last week. The Italian issue, now yielding 11 per cent, is starting to look
cheap, in terms of relative value. But the market has become so illiquid,
that such valuations have lost much of their significance.
'The downside for the Ecu market at this point is no longer value but
liquidity,' one trader said. 'Even if the bonds theoretically hold value,
the fact that it is impossible to sell paper means that investors will not
buy.'
Consequently, it is difficult to see where the floor for the market lies.
Already, the yield of the Paribas 10-year index stands at 9.77 per cent, 50
basis points more than the theoretical yield compiled from the yields of the
component currencies. Prior to last week's sell-off, the margin was around
20 basis points.
'Ecu bonds are offering tremendous value, but there is always the risk that
they will offer even better value next week,' said Mr Bob Tyley, head of
bond analysis at Paribas.
As fund managers reassess their portfolios ahead of the French referendum,
there is little incentive to hold Ecu bonds. If the French vote yes on
September 20, the Ecu bond market is undoubtedly set to rally. But if they
vote no, it is likely to be worse hit than other markets. Given the degree
of political uncertainty surrounding the referendum, few fund managers want
to take a strong view on the outcome.
'Some of the higher-yielding European markets, like Italy and Spain, offer
better prospects,' according to Mr Michael Burke, bond analyst at Yamaichi
International. While they would suffer from a no vote, the lira and peseta
will still be viable currencies without Maastricht, while the Ecu would no
longer be an attractive investment for institutional investors, if European
monetary union is abandoned.
In the case of a no vote, a realignment of the Exchange Rate Mechanism is
seen as an increasingly likely prospect. Without the pull of monetary union,
the strains within the ERM, many economists believe, would become
intolerable. Here too, the Ecu bond market stands to pay a high price.
Further, if the French vote yes by only a narrow margin, a mood of
uncertainty could continue to depress bond markets at least until the end of
the year, when other countries, such as the UK and Germany, have ratified
the treaty.
There are also nuances of reaction within the Ecu bond market.
'The two-tier structure of the Ecu bond market is becoming more distinct,
reflecting the advances for the no vote over the last week,' said Mr Steve
Major, bond analyst at Credit Lyonnais. Mr Major places issues by France,
the UK, Spain, Denmark and Belgium in the top tier, since these issues will
receive official government support, even in the case of a no vote. The
lower tier consists of less liquid state-backed agency, sovereign and
corporate issues. 'A yes will lead to outperformance by the recently out of
favour tier-2 group but a no will favour the more liquid tier-1,' according
to Mr Major.
Not all potential sellers of Ecu bonds have been able to unload their stock,
either because of the market's illiquidity or because they do not want to
realise losses. But any attempt at a rally has been, and will continue to
be, used by asset allocators as a selling opportunity.
Further, the problems experienced by investors in offloading paper will not
be forgotten soon. Until a couple of years ago, institutional investors
eschewed the Ecu bond market, which was dominated by retail investors. Then,
the sponsorship of the market by European governments, in the form of large
Ecu borrowing programmes - coupled with extensive marketing by banks - drew
them in.
Now that their claims for the market have collapsed, how far should the
responsibilities of market participants go, and can they be blamed for the
current disarray? Certainly, the conduct of marketmakers has not been a
pretty sight. For the last two years, banks and securities houses have been
falling over each other to gain marketmaker status in the sector, keen to
gain a foothold in what could become Europe's bond market. Since the Danish
vote on June 2, the rush for the doors has been equally fierce.
Although there are nominally 44 marketmakers recognised by the International
Securities Market Association, the self-regulating body which oversees the
market, there have never been more than a dozen serious players. By the end
of last week, no one was actually making a market.
A one-day suspension of marketmaking in July, followed by a resetting of
marketmaking guidelines had already failed to reinject liquidity. Last week,
as liquidity diminished still further, a group of marketmakers led by
Paribas attempted to take matters into their own hands by again resetting
spread and size guidelines, in the hope of encouraging dealers to make
prices. Although a group of four marketmakers did make prices for a few
hours on Friday, the initiative failed, and market participants now seem
resigned to an almost total loss of liquidity at least until the referendum.
Given the surplus of sellers and non-existence of buyers, it is difficult to
see how the banks could remedy the situation. 'There is Ecu100bn of bonds
outstanding in the market. The street cannot be expected to buy the whole
market back,' one trader argued.
Little comfort, however, for the numerous institutional investors who bought
on the sales pitch that Ecu Eurobonds issued by European states were
quasi-government bonds, with comparable liquidity.

of Europe: 'If you open that Pandora's Box you never know what Trojan 'orses
will jump out.' Similar, if less earthy, advice is now on offer from the
European political and financial establishment, after a turbulent week on
the exchanges, about the risks of reopening the debate on monetary union or
prising apart the existing alignment of currencies in the exchange rate
mechanism (ERM).
As Community finance ministers prepare for a damage limitation session next
weekend in Bath, they would do well to remember that Pandora was a
headstrong girl (and that the hot spring water that they will be invited to
imbibe at this otherwise charming west country spa is thoroughly
sulphurous). Many in the markets are already convinced that it is too late
to prevent the Trojan horses taking a joyful jump.
Much of the turmoil last week came after opinion polls suggested that the
French might vote no to Maastricht in the forthcoming referendum. Yet the
damage has arguably been done already. Given that an overwhelming yes vote
is now almost inconceivable in the country that spearheaded the move to Emu,
the proponents of Maastricht appear to lack an adequate mandate.
That, certainly, appears to be the verdict of the Ecu bond market, which has
always been regarded as a bellwether for Maastricht's ratification
prospects. After the treaty was signed, Ecu bonds stood at a premium to
their underlying currency components. As the prospect for monetary union
waned, Ecu bonds went to a discount. Since July the market has gone into
spasm and banks have desperately looked for ways of reviving it. But to no
avail.
The Ecu bond debacle is less than reassuring for Euro-visionaries. But nor
does it follow that the countries whose currencies are under pressure will
be immediately be taken off the hook. Emu is one thing; the ERM another. And
it would be unwise to underestimate the depth of the commitment of Mr John
Major's government to this semi-fixed exchange rate system. The game for
Europe's finance ministers for the next three weeks will be to keep the ERM
show on the road. The only question is whether their contingency plans will
be obliged to incorporate a realignment.
Their problem is that if the prospect of monetary union has retreated, it
will be hard to restore investors' interest in convergence, the bond market
equivalent of Gresham's law whereby the most inflation-prone currencies
become strong, while the historically strong turn weak. Sir Thomas Gresham
was, incidentally, a notorious deflationist who wanted a strong currency to
reduce the cost to Elizabeth I of paying off foreign loans, regardless of
the consequences for unemployment. How apposite.
Without the prospect of Emu the inherent strains of the ERM also become less
tolerable. The dealers may have come back in from the window ledges after
last week's squall. But being shackled to the world's strongest currency can
be relied on to bring more squalls in the absence of policy change - and
bigger squalls on any change of US president.
Within the ERM itself there is no escape from the fact that the the link to
a post-unification D-Mark delivers inappropriate monetary policies to some
members, not least Britain, where debt deflation is being addressed,
bizarrely, by rising real interest rates. Yet realignment within or
devaluation without the ERM would present huge credibility problems for
sterling. Their manageability, if it came to that, would depend on what
accompanying fiscal and monetary steps the government chose to adopt.
The government is hoping that something will turn up - or rather, that the
D-Mark will turn down. But if post-war history is any guide the likely
outcome is months of turbulence, followed by capitulation to political and
market pressure. The outcome for Mr Major, who took Britain into the ERM,
and his chancellor Norman Lamont, might be terminal. But the verdict of
historians on the prime minister could prove kinder than that of his party.
After all, when Sir Isaac Newton, master of the mint, took Britain on to the
gold standard in 1717 he hadn't the remotest conception of what he was doing
either.

FT  01 SEP 92 / US Money and Credit: Dollar's decline highlights tussle with
data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DECLINE in the dollar over the past week and a half has brought to the
fore a tussle between the US currency and a motley collection of economic
statistics over the direction of the nation's credit markets.
The plunge in the currency which began on August 21 sharply reversed a
two-month rally in the bond market which had been prompted by Wall Street
starting to conquer its fears of inflation, the bond market's biggest
bug-bear.
However, by the end of last week the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury
issue had risen to 7.42 per cent, against 7.35 per cent a week before and
7.31 per cent two weeks earlier.
Trading on US bond markets was quiet yesterday as investors and dealers
stayed on the sidelines ahead of this week's important employment report for
August. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  7/32
at 98 1/8 , yielding 7.401 per cent. The two-year note was slightly firmer,
up  1/32 at 100 3/16 , to yield 4.118 per cent.
There are probably three inter-linked reasons for this unusually powerful
currency impact on the credit markets. The first, and most important, is
that Wall Street thinks the dollar's plight reduces the freedom of the
Federal Reserve to cut interest rates again. For this would increase the
large interest rate differential between the US and Germany and place the
dollar under greater pressure.
Second, the market fears a weakening currency could encourage foreign
investors to sell their investments in dollar-denominated assets, or at
least not buy new ones, thus reducing demand for both equities and fixed
income securities.
Third, a low dollar makes imports more expensive, and this could help give
an upward bias to inflation. However, given the vast size of the domestic
market, relative to imports, this concern is of minor consequence.
Behind the dollar's decline lies a direct policy conflict between the US
government, which has slashed interest rates to promote growth, and the
German government, which is keeping interest rates high to choke off
inflation.
This clash is not going to be resolved quickly, so the dollar is likely to
remain weak for some time - at least until the German economy shows more
concrete signs of cooling, which will reduce the pressures for yet tighter
German monetary policy.
Those short rallies the US credit markets have enjoyed over the past week
have been due to further evidence that the domestic recovery from recession
is proceeding at the pace of a snail.
Money supply numbers released last Thursday saw an unexpected decline in M2,
while Wednesday produced a surprisingly sharp decline in orders for durable
goods. On Tuesday, the Conference Board reported that consumer confidence
had fallen to its lowest level since March.
This week the market will be focusing on Friday's employment report - the
most important early snapshot of how the economy performed in August.
Many analysts are forecasting a drop in unemployment, from July's 7.7 per
cent to between 7.6 per cent and 7.5 per cent. Payroll employment is
expected to rise between 145,000 and 250,000 people.
These raw figures are misleading, because most of these jobs will be due to
the temporary employment of deprived youths under a Federal summer work
creation programme.
The figures will doubtless be seized by both the Democrats and Republicans
to support their cases in the presidential election campaign, which is
likely to cast an increasingly heavy shadow over the bond market in the
weeks ahead.
Many on fiercely Republican Wall Street have yet to take on board just how
far President Bush remains behind in the polls and the increasing
possibility of a Democratic victory.

FT  01 SEP 92 / UK Gilts: Currency contortions cast a cloud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GILTS came under pressure as sterling found itself in the crossfire of
turbulence in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System.
With a strong D-Mark continuing to put other EMS currencies under strain,
the pound fell last week against the German currency, closing on Friday
night within about 1 pfennig of its DM2.778 floor.
The weaker sterling reduced demand for gilts, with prices slipping back
along the yield curve. That corresponded to a rise in yields of about 20
basis points (0.2 percentage point) with the increase being most significant
for shorter dated gilts.
With currency markets tense during much of last week, the Bank of England
found less than rapturous welcome among investors for its auction of Pounds
2.5bn of 8 3/4 per cent Treasury stock maturing in 2017. This was
oversubscribed by a factor of about 1.2, rather smaller than for earlier
gilt auctions of this type.
Also, the recent fall in gilt prices meant the Bank gained rather less funds
from the exercise than it might have hoped for. The cash will enable the
government to finance this year's public sector borrowing requirement, which
is expected to add up to more than Pounds 30bn.
One school of thought among gilts observers is that the Bank's large
requirement to sell bonds to fund the PSBR will at some point almost
certainly draw in large numbers of overseas buyers. Demand from these groups
would help underpin sterling.
However, a less optimistic gloss is that the weakness in sterling, assuming
the currency remains fragile for the foreseeable future, may frighten away
overseas buyers and cause them to purchase government bonds issued by other
countries instead.
Overshadowing events in the gilt market - and all the other main bond
markets in Europe - has been indications that France might reject European
economic and monetary union in its referendum on September 20. That could
lead to large selling of gilts, as well as of bonds denominated in other
currencies regarded as weak, while German government bonds would probably
see higher demand.
Since the Danish rejection of the Maastricht treaty in early June, yields
for German bonds have come down slightly, while those for other countries'
bonds have risen.
While the difference between gilt yields and German bond yields has
increased over this period by roughly 40 basis points, the comparable figure
for French bonds has been about 70 basis points. In the case of Italian
bonds, the yield spread has increased by 120 basis points. On the basis of
these figures, the extra 'risk premium', in the form of higher interest
rates, that investors demand for holding gilts compared with German bonds
has been somewhat less than the additional premium demanded for French and
Italian bonds.
However, that is probably not all that comforting to gilt investors, given
that the French franc and the Italian lira are two of the other extremely
weak currencies in the EMS grid.

FT  01 SEP 92 / Nordic Region: Confusion reigns over Sweden's role in
European monetary union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NORDIC financial markets are in a jittery state.
In Sweden, concern about the economic situation and the possibility of a
devaluation prompted a sharp outflow of currency in the middle of August,
forcing the Riksbank - Sweden's central bank - to hike up its key lending
rate twice in the space of a week.
The rise in Swedish rates had repercussions in neighbouring Finland where
the central bank quickly raised its tender rate in order to prevent a
currency outflow.
The 3 percentage point rise - from 13 per cent to 16 per cent - in the
Riksbank's marginal lending rate last Wednesday took the markets by surprise
as the Riksbank had raised the rate by one percentage point only the
previous week.
The initial rise in the marginal rate, from 12 per cent to 13 per cent, was
a response to a large capital outflow of SKr9.9bn in the week ending August
21 (compared with an outflow of SKr394m the previous week).
The market's nervousness was partly blamed on Mr Allan Larsson, an
opposition Social Democrat and former finance minister, who questioned
whether Sweden should join a single European currency. His comments, which
were published in the Swedish press, left the markets confused about
Sweden's future role in European economic and monetary union, and came at a
time when the markets were losing their confidence in the ability of the
centre-right minority government to push ahead with the tough economic
measures needed to reduce Sweden's budget deficit.
The initial rise in the marginal rate appears to have had little effect,
with dealers estimating that a further SKr10bn or so may have flooded out of
Sweden last week.
Prime Minister Carl Bildt said last week that the fixed exchange rate policy
would be maintained and said the government would push ahead with its policy
for growth. Mr Bildt's four-party government has promised to cut back on
public spending, but it has faced problems in passing some of its spending
cuts in the parliament because it is in a minority.
'What worries the market is the growing budget deficit and rapid rise in
unemployment,' says Mr Thomas Franzen, economist at Svenska Handelsbanken.
'Although the market is quite confident about the government's economic
policy, there is a real worry about whether the government can get these
measures through Parliament.' Mr Franzen warns that the public sector
borrowing requirement for the 1992-1993 fiscal year could reach
SKr150bn-SKr160bn.
The Riksbank's 3 percentage point rise in the marginal rate pushed up bond
yields initially, but since then, yields on treasury bills and bonds have
fallen back again.
Last week's rise in Sweden's marginal rate prompted an immediate hike in the
Bank of Finland's tender rate, from 15.5 per cent to 17 per cent, in an
attempt to prevent an outflow of capital. The rise pushed up yields, with
the seven-year bond yielding 13 per cent.
Dealers warn that while the Bundesbank keeps German interest rates high and
the European bond markets remain preoccupied with the forthcoming French
referendum on the Maastricht treaty, there is little chance that the Bank of
Finland will be able to lower interest rates. The government has a heavy
funding requirement this year, but so far about two-thirds of its funding
has been done abroad in other currencies, thereby putting less pressure on
domestic interest rates.

CREDIT Lyonnais, the state-controlled French bank, is restructuring its
senior management by appointing Mr Michel Renault in the newly created post
of joint director general.
Mr Renault heads Credit Lyonnais's domestic retail banking interests. He
will continue to be responsible for this area as joint director general, but
will also assume responsibility for the rest of its commercial banking
operations.
The improved performance of Credit Lyonnais's domestic banking business was
one of the few bright spots in the group's 1991 results when net profits
fell to FFr3.16bn (Dollars 637m) from FFr3.71bn in 1990 after it was forced
to double its client risk provisions to FFr9.5bn because of loan losses.

COMINCO, the Vancouver-based metals and fertiliser producer, has sold its 46
per cent stake in Australia's Aberfoyle mining and exploration group for
CDollars 135m (USDollars 113.4m), writes Bernard Simon in Toronto.
The buyers are various Australian and international institutions which have
been pressing Cominco for almost a year to part with at least a portion of
its stake in Aberfoyle.
The approaches were initially turned down, but were given consideration as
Aberfoyle's share price rose from less than ADollars 4 to its present level
of more than ADollars 5 a share.
The Canadian company expects to use the proceeds to help finance projects in
Chile, Mexico and, possibly, Turkey. Cominco is committed to providing
USDollars 110m in equity for the Quebrada Blanca copper mine in northern

<TEXT>
CANON, the Japanese camera and office equipment maker, yesterday reported a
14 per cent fall to Y56.4bn (Dollars 448.4m) in pre-tax profits for the
first half, while Chinon Industries, another camera maker, announced that it
would withdraw from the domestic market.
The announcements came as other companies cut profit estimates for the first
half to the end of September, including Kyocera, the electronics company,
which revised down its pre-tax forecast by 8.8 per cent to Y17.7bn, compared
to Y21.9bn for the same period last year.
Japanese news agencies reported that the leading department store operators
Takashimaya and Sogo announced downward pre-tax profit revisions of 50 per
cent and 37 per cent respectively for their first half to the end of August.
Each of the companies blamed worse than expected performances on the
continued slowing of the domestic economy, but said they were confident of
increasing domestic sales in the second half, given the assistance of the
government's stimulatory package.
The package came too late for Chinon, which is to halt domestic sales of its
camera brand later this year. The company also makes information equipment
but executives admitted yesterday that it is now dependent on camera exports
for earnings and overseas sales have been weak.
Chinon reported a pre-tax loss of Y2.2bn last year and had forecast the same
for the current year.
Canon said that its consolidated sales rose 0.7 per cent to Y928.8bn in the
first half to the end of June, with camera sales down 7.4 per cent and sales
of business machines 2.2 per cent higher.
Sales of optical and other products were 0.5 per cent lower.
For the full year, Canon is expecting a 3.2 per cent increase in
consolidated sales to Y1,930bn, but a 15 per cent fall in pre-tax profit to
Y124bn, and a 12 per cent fall in after-tax profit to Y46bn.
Kyocera, which is the leading maker of ceramic packages for integrated
circuits, said sales for the September half are likely to fall 6 per cent to
Y148bn. For the full year, the company forecast sales of Y318bn, about the
same as last year, reflecting its confidence in a second-half economic
recovery.
Japanese department stores have been bruised by the unexpected weakness in
consumer spending in recent months, and Sogo said that demand for most lines
had fallen, leading to an expected 9 per cent decline in its first half
sales. For the full year, it forecast a 34 per cent fall in pre-tax profit
to Y4.8bn on sales of Y292bn, down from Y310bn.
Takashimaya expected a 4 per cent fall in its first-half sales to Y393bn.
Its full-year pre-tax profit forecast was revised downwards from Y12.8bn to
Y9bn.

<TEXT>
BALTICA Holding, Denmark's biggest insurer, plunged to a loss of DKr991m
(Dollars 176m) in the first six months compared with the DKr762m profit in
the first half of last year.
Group equity capital shrank to DKr7.92bn from DKr9.20bn.
Insurance operations returned a DKr256m profit, down from DKr520m last year.
'The result shows that our primary business area is doing well,' said Mr
Peter Christoffersen, group chief executive.
The losses arose from large write-offs of property-related investments and
the falling value of the bond and share portfolio.
Property write-offs were DKr650m, including a substantial provision to cover
involvement in a large office complex under construction in Gibraltar.
The value of strategic shareholdings in France's Compagnie Financiere de
Suez and Sweden's insurer Skandia declined by DKr297m, while last year these
holdings showed a gain of DKr305m. Since June 30, the value of the strategic
holdings has fallen by a further DKr160m.
Baltica's banking subsidiary made a DKr142m loss as loss provisions rose.
This compared with a DKr42m profit last year.
The group forecast a better second-half result on condition that share and
bond values at the end of the year did not deteriorate from the level at
June 30.

FORENENDE, one of Norway's four biggest insurers, said yesterday that
first-half operating profit had declined to NKr262.7m (Dollars 45.6m) from
NKr278.5m a year earlier.
The group blamed the decline on a NKr54m fall in net currency gains. Group
premium income rose 6 per cent to NKr1.016bn while non-premium income
advanced 20 per cent to NKr1.146bn.
Forenende said that first-half sales rose 13 per cent to NKr2.251bn while
assets at end-June were up 20 per cent from last year at NKr18.646bn. The
acquisition of four finance companies constituted the majority of the growth
in turnover and gross assets.
The group is in the process of being acquired by Gjensidige, another
Norwegian insurer, which controls 75 per cent of the company. Gjensidige
expected to complete the takeover by August 1993.
Forenende said the acquisition was dependent on the elimination of the
company's 10 per cent limit on shareholdings and a 5 per cent limit on
voting rights. It added that the board and management were positive that it
would be acquired by Gjensidige.

HAFNIA HOLDING, the Danish insurer which suspended payments on August 20,
yesterday announced a first-half loss of DKr3.87bn (Dollars 686m) compared
with a DKr530m profit in the previous corresponding period.
The deficit was due primarily to a DKr2.15bn loss on its shareholdings in
Swedish insurer, Skandia, and Danish insurer, Baltica.
Negotiations are continuing with both companies to find ways of disposing of
these holdings, the company said yesterday.
A fall in the value of other securities caused a further loss of DKr655m.
The holding company's assets were transferred in August to a new holding
company, Hafnia Holding 1992, which left the debt in the former holding
company, which is in the hands of the receivers.
'This construction gives Hafnia a much better chance of continuing its
business than a traditional suspension of payments,' the company said.
The model chosen enables the parent company to provide financial support to
its subsidiaries.
This would not have been possible under a traditional suspension, said the
group.
The new holding company has equity capital of DKr5.9bn.
High administrative costs and substantial loss provisions against
engagements by Hafnia Marine &amp; Industrial Insurance were additional factors
in the first-half collapse.
Last week, the group announced the dismissal of 524 employees in Denmark, or
about one-fifth of total staff in Denmark.
Reductions are also being made in staff at Economic, the group's UK insurer.
The result in the second half would depend on two factors, success or
otherwise in efforts to sell the shareholdings in Baltica and Skandia and
developments in the Danish share and bond markets, the company said.

FT  01 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Boustead advances 6% despite Singapore fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOUSTEAD, the industrial trading group recently acquired by Jack Chia-MPH,
the Singapore-based trading company, has announced a 6 per cent rise in
pre-tax profits for the first half of 1992.
Mr Jack Chia, the eponymous chairman, plans to use Boustead's London quote
as the base from which to expand his group in Europe. He is currently making
a mandatory offer for the minority in Bousteadco Singapore, the listed
subsidiary.
Boustead's pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 1.04m to Pounds 1.1m on sales of
Pounds 38.4m (Pounds 40.7m).
Several businesses in the UK showed profit increases while market conditions
in Singapore remained depressed. Profits at Bousteadco Singapore declined by
22 per cent, although they showed an improvement over the second half of
1991.
The overseas tax charge rose from Pounds 221,000 to Pounds 401,000 because,
under Singapore law, Boustead could not offset losses between subsidiaries
against tax.
There was an extraordinary loss of Pounds 348,000, being provisions covering
the closure costs of overseas divisional activities after the profit on the
disposal of Bousteadco's travel and shipping agency business.
Earnings per share and the interim dividend are unchanged at 0.7p and 0.35p
respectively.

FT  01 SEP 92 / UK Company News: British Coal picks contenders to buy its
smokeless fuel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Coal is discussing the sale of its smokeless fuel businesses, Coal
Products, with two rival management buy-out groups and Anglo-United, owner
of Coalite smokeless fuel.
BC yesterday said that while it would consider offers from all parties, it
had narrowed down the main contenders to those three.
Coal Products made an operating profit of Pounds 2m for the year ended March
28. Last year it had debt of Pounds 50m; it has not yet filed its separate
accounts for this year.
However, the business is seen as having good potential to generate cash
given BC's recent decision to close the loss-making Avenue Coke and Chemical
plant near Chesterfield, which produces Sunbright fuel for the domestic
closed fire market.
The two rival MBOs are led by Mr Steve O'Donoghue, the former finance
director, and Mr David Foster, the operations director.
While Mr O'Donoghue appears to have the backing of the majority of Coal
Products managers, the emergence of two rival MBOs could put the British
Association of Colliery Management in a difficult position. It has been
promised funds to help draw up an employee buy out bid.
BC said it would back the bid which offered the 'best value' for its
business. At the moment it was inclined to sell Coal Products piecemeal.
While the struggle between two rival MBOs is believed to favour an outside
buyer, Anglo's negative net asset value and debts of more than Pounds 200m
has led some BC directors to question whether the company could afford to
buy Coal Products.
Anglo remains confident of putting together an attractive financial package.
If it acquired Coal Products it would be expected to close some of the
plants.
Anglo currently produces about 400,000 tonnes of smokeless fuel for the open
fire market. That is only about 50 per cent of its total capacity because it
believes there is already too much capacity in the market.

FT  01 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Knives come out in battle for Simpsons -
The City watches as allegations fly across the restaurant table
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YOU smell Simpsons before you see it. At noon each day the aroma of grilled
meat wafts on to Cornhill, reminding City dealers lunch is being served -
much as it has been for the past 235 years.
The chop house, packed with pinstripes, dishes up traditional food. But the
owners, Simpsons of Cornhill, have found an unappetising item on their plate
 -the prospect of a battle for control of the board.
Internal strife at companies boasting only four outlets - in this case
Simpsons, the Jamaica Inn, Dell'Ugo and Palio - does not normally arouse
much interest in the City. But this fight has been given added spice by the
characters involved and the assets at stake.
On one side of the table, the board is being defended by Mr Roy Ackerman,
once deputy chairman of the Kennedy Brookes restaurant chain, and Mr Paul
Reece, a former director of Midsummer Leisure. Rattling their knives on the
other side, sits Mr Robert Klapp, former chairman of Select Appointments,
and Mr Alan Crompton-Batt, an existing director on the four-man Simpsons
board.
The protagonists are not fighting merely for two City taverns and a couple
of west London restaurants; they are competing for control of a group in
which they see enormous potential. Mr Ackerman, who turned the Kennedy
Brookes chain into a group consumed by Forte for Pounds 173m, intends to
repeat the performance with Simpsons. 'I hope to have the best group of
restaurants in the south east and London,' he said.
His optimism is shared by Mr Reece, who helped develop the Firkin pub group
which fetched Pounds 9.7m in 1990.
The two culinary executives floated Simpsons last August for Pounds 2m.
Their aim was to develop a group of restaurants linked by traditional
themes. They were backed by Mr Crompton-Batt, a former director of Wheelers
seafood restaurants and a one-time inspector for Egon Ronay guides.
Since then, according to Mr Crompton-Batt, the dream has gone sour. He
claims standards have slipped at Simpsons and the board has abandoned its
themed-restaurant strategy by opening two nouvelle restaurants - Dell'Ugo
and Palio.
The complaints prompted dissident shareholders to join forces in a bid to
influence the company. They were rebuffed, however, at an emergency general
meeting last week when the board refused to allow voting on a resolution to
elect Mr Klapp and City lawyer Mr David Offenbach as directors.
The rebel group, which claims to control 40 per cent of the shares, now
hopes to oust the board at a second EGM.
Mr Klapp has no illusions about Simpsons' prospects. 'This could be a very
important group, but this board is not fit to run it,' he said.
Criticism of the company has stung the board into a robust defence.
Dismissing the rebel campaign, Mr Ackerman claims they have no catering
experience and no institutional support. Mr Reece, meanwhile, has accused
the Klapp group of using offshore transactions to increase pressure on the
board.
The rebels have drawn most of their support from stakes held by overseas
companies. Mr Klapp's Spread Trustee company, registered in the Channel
Islands, acquired a 20 per cent stake from entrepreneur Mr David Rowland. Mr
Klapp sold on 10 per cent to Mountjoy, registered in the Turk and Caicos
Islands, and is relying on another 8.5 per cent recently acquired by Capital
Resources of Perth, Australia.
Mr Reece also suggested Mr Klapp, who stepped down from Select Appointments
after the company lost Pounds 2.4m in 1990, could not manage the business
successfully.
According to many regulars at Simpsons, however, both the board and the
dissident group have misjudged the attitude of shareholders.
Brokers and dealers have not bought shares as a speculative investment in a
growing company. Instead, they have taken a stake to preserve their
favourite watering holes.
Mr John Fouracre, a foreign exchange dealer who has lunched at Simpsons for
more than 30 years, said: 'This is an unlikely investment prospect. People
just want it to stay the same; if it's trading successfully through the
recession, then they're happy.'
In this year's trading, the company has seen turnover grow from around
Pounds 25,000 a week to more than Pounds 80,000. The share price has fallen
from a post-flotation peak of 54p to close at 31p at the weekend. . But Mr
Reece said: 'We are still within our bank facilities and there are no
significant lines of credit.'
The board denies it is being over-acquisitive or profligate. 'We are being
prudent. We have looked at dozens of projects but we will only buy at the
right time and the right price,' said Mr Ackerman.
He hopes his cautious approach will curry favour among shareholders at
Simpsons. Watching diners enjoying chump chop followed by jam roly-poly last
week, one member of staff commented: 'This lot likes things the way they
are. You'll never move them.'

FT  01 SEP 92 / UK Company News: IoM Steam drops 56%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE first half of 1992, pre-tax profits of Isle of Man Steam Packet fell
56 per cent, from Pounds 821,000 to Pounds 360,000. Turnover rose 3 per cent
to 11.3m.
Passenger traffic declined by some 5-6 per cent, said Mr David Dixon,
managing director. However, the freight business held steady.
Although fares increased in line with inflation, the decline in passenger
traffic held back the advance in sales.
Profits were depressed by a series of one-off factors, including Pounds
145,000 in redundancies and Pounds 265,000 in overhaul costs. Last year,
those costs had been taken in the second half.
Earnings per share were halved to 2.5p (4.9p). The interim dividend is again
3p.
Mr Norman Corlett, the chairman who led the fight against a hostile bid from
the Bermuda-based Sea Containers, is retiring because of family illness. An
announcement on his successor is expected shortly.
Mr Dixon said the situation remained uncertain with Sea Containers, which
launched and then postponed a hostile Pounds 17.5m bid in 1990. 'We think
(they) are being jolly rotten in not saying anything. It has been very
unsettling for management and staff.' Sea Containers holds 41 per cent of
Steam Packet.

FT  01 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Henlys confident of defeating Cowie bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HENLYS GROUP, the motor trader and bus and coach builder, yesterday said its
main shareholders had not accepted the Pounds 32.1m hostile bid from T
Cowie, the Sunderland-based motor dealer.
The offer, which closes at 1pm today, is expected to be close. Over the
weekend Cowie said its acceptances had increased to 33.76 per cent.
After talking to its main shareholders, which include Guinness Mahon, Morgan
Grenville Nominees, TSB Group and Standard Life Assurance Co, Henlys said it
was confident of defeating Cowie's bid.
Mr Robert Wood, chief executive of Henlys, said: 'Our feeling is that we
expect the majority of the big institutions, which hold 60 per cent of the
shares, to stay with us.'
Cowie's bid has been helped by Mr David Matthews, former chairman and chief
executive of Henlys who left the group last November. Mr Matthews is keen to
buy Henlys' coach and bus business.
Mr Wood said the majority of shares under Cowie's control comprise those
pledged by Mr Matthews and his associates - including Peter Cundill
Associates, the Canadian investment trust - and the 9.9 per cent Cowie
bought for cash in the market last week.

Over the 14 months ended February 28 1992, Stanelco made a pre-tax profit of
Pounds 80,000. That included seven months from the subsidiary Stanelco
Products, maker of induction heating and welding equipment.
The group formerly traded as Merchant Manufactory Estate Company, and was
reorganised at the end of last year. In 1991 the old group incurred an
operating loss of Pounds 1.58m, to which was added exceptional charges of
Pounds 11.6m.
Earnings per share were 0.02p (46.85p).

FT  01 SEP 92 / Fresh row looms over pension funds: Lucas pensioners seek
return of surplus; British Rail must repay Pounds 25m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LUCAS Industries and British Rail have come under fire for their handling of
pension fund surpluses.
Pensioners of Lucas Industries have issued a High Court writ against the
trustees of the fund, seeking the return of Pounds 150m transferred to the
company last November, while British Rail has been ordered to repay Pounds
25m, which it had clawed back from its pension fund.
Both organisations took advantage of the 1988 Income and Corporation Taxes
Act, which says if pension fund assets exceed its liabilities by more than 5
per cent it must reduce the surplus or lose its tax-exempt status.
The question of who owns any pension fund surplus - generally created by
heavy investment in the late 1970s followed by booming stock markets in the
1980s - has become increasingly contentious in the wake of the Maxwell
scandal. Pensioners feel entitled to some of the money, since it is a form
of deferred pay consisting partly of their contributions.
However, companies can argue that since they effectively underwrite any
potential deficiency, they should benefit from any surplus.
The legal change in 1988 allowed Lucas pension fund trustees to change the
deeds so some of the surplus could be transferred to the company, said a
spokesman for Lucas.
The payment of Pounds 150m to Lucas Industries - reduced to Pounds 90m after
40 per cent tax was levied - was approved last November by the Occupational
Pensions Board. The transfer allowed the company to announce profits for the
six months to January of Pounds 90.2m and an interim dividend of 2.1p.
At the time of the transfer, the pension fund had assets valued at Pounds
1.7bn, with a Pounds 600m surplus, now reduced to Pounds 225m.
According to a spokesman for Lucas Industries, the trustees acted 'with the
support of the trade unions and the vast majority of employees and
pensioners.'
But Mr Douglas Taylor and 69 other beneficiaries of the fund have issued a
summons against Lucas Pensions Trust (the trustees), asking the High Court
to decide whether the trustees in fact acted lawfully.
British Rail's accounts in 1992-1993 will include an exceptional item of
Pounds 25m, which it has to repay to its Pounds 7bn pension fund.
At its last pension fund review in 1990, British Rail decided to begin a
contribution holiday for the company and staff. When the decision was
implemented in September 1991, the holiday was backdated to the start of the
financial year in April 1991. In fact, such a claw-back is not allowed under
trust law, according to a British Rail spokesman.

FT  01 SEP 92 / Seatbelts fastened for a bumpy ride: Lufthansa is facing the
worst crisis of its 66-year history
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lufthansa is facing the worst crisis of its 66-year history, buffetted by
excessive costs, tough competition at a time of world economic weakness, and
the consequences of its own over-expansion.
The German airline will today announce a comprehensive package of job cuts,
fleet reductions, streamlining of routes, and other measures which it hopes
will save up to DM1bn (Pounds 300m) a year from 1995. It has managed to
obtain reluctant acceptance for its plans from the unions, uneasily aware
that Lufthansa's existence is at stake.
Mr Jurgen Weber, the chief executive, will have been in office for a year
when the Frankfurt-based airline's stringent Programme 93, worked out in the
face of mounting losses, is presented today. 'It's not been as I imagined it
would be', he said of the rough period Lufthansa has gone through since he
took over the top job.
Lufthansa's problems are partly due to the harsh economic and airline
industry environment in which it is now operating and partly to the
ambitious expansion by his predecessor, the prickly, overbearing Mr Heinz
Ruhnau.
In the three years to 1991, the group has increased employee numbers by
13,000 people to 62,000 (of which 50,000 are at the airline itself) and its
fleet by 120 aircraft to 275.
It has added to its domestic route network, on which it lost DM350m last
year, as a result of unification - new destinations in the past three years
include Berlin, Dresden, and Leipzig - and spent heavily on new aircraft for
all its operations, including the Condor charter line.
Group capital spending exceeded DM8bn in the three-year period.
Mr Weber, 51, is discreet about the policies pursued under his predecessor,
saying only: 'From today's viewpoint, we can only establish that we have too
many aircraft'.
Moreover, in the present dire state of the industry, it is hard to sell
second-hand aircraft. Those which it cannot sell are mostly parked in the
Arizona desert.
This year, it is taking 26 aircraft out of service. Eleven options on
aircraft for delivery next year will not be taken up and another eight
deliveries have been postponed from 1993 to the following year.
It has trimmed its European capacity this year by around 11 per cent on the
original plan and hopes to operate more cost effectively with its new
Lufthansa Express operation on domestic routes.
All this has meant tough negotiations with unions. DAG, the white-collar
union whose members include pilots, engineers, and technicians, made a big
initial concession when it offered to accept pay cuts and longer working
hours to help Lufthansa in its crisis.
The bigger oTV public sector union, representing lower paid staff, has also
come round in the end to the need for sacrifices.
It is little comfort to Mr Weber that other airlines are negotiating equally
bumpy squalls. In most cases, their costs are not as high as Lufthansa's.
British Airways is constantly cited as an example of how an airline can move
from being fat, lazy, and unpopular to lean, efficient, and profitable. Its
agreed purchase of a Dollars 750m minority stake in USAir, with which the
German company also held talks, shows that Lufthansa is now in no position
to take the initiative when it comes to expansion.
Lufthansa admits it could not afford the USAir price tag, though officials
say they are not convinced that the airline would have been the best
partner. Mr Weber also points out that British Airways had strong government
support when implementing its own recovery programme.
Even so, he is on the defensive in an increasingly unforgiving market.
Because of the differing terms of international airline agreements,
Lufthansa says it has a raw deal on the Atlantic. Unlike British Airways,
which has wide access to US destinations, Lufthansa is more restricted. Mr
Weber has fulminated against the unfairness of the US-German aviation
accord, urging a tougher government line.
He believes that the Bonn government is now ready, like the French, to end
the bilateral deal if Washington does not offer improved conditions. If
Lufthansa had similar access to the US, it would also make profits across
the North Atlantic instead of losing heavily, Mr Weber says.
As it is, Lufthansa has been reducing the proportion of its total business
accounted for by North Atlantic business from 30 per cent to around 20 per
cent this year, cutting flights to Charlotte and Philadelphia from
Frankfurt, to Miami from Hamburg and Dusseldorf, and to New York from
Hamburg.
It is still looking for a partner to help it develop the US market by
carrying Lufthansa passengers on to other destinations. According to Mr
Weber 'we are seeking a bride'.
Lufthansa is also interested in link-ups elsewhere. For example, it hopes to
take a stake in Malev, the Hungarian carrier. Mr Weber said: 'We are no
longer participating in a total struggle for market shares, but getting away
from this. This means more co-operation and stakes in shared operations.'
However, Lufthansa intends to be more aggressive in its marketing, drawing
on its strengths of geography through its central European location, quality
through its Germanic thoroughness and efficiency, and economic pull as the
national airline of one of the world's most prosperous countries.
If Lufthansa's strategy works, Mr Wever hopes it will break even again after
1995. For all on board, it will be a long and tough haul.

FT  01 SEP 92 / Skanska suspends senior executive
</HEADLINE>

SKANSKA, Scandinavia's biggest construction and property company, yesterday
accused a senior executive of unlawful foreign exchange speculation which is
estimated to have lost the company more than SKr500m (Dollars 97m).
Mr Leif Ottosson, 36-year-old president of its financial subsidiary, was
suspended from duties yesterday and police have been asked to investigate
whether a crime had been committed.
'Through his repeated and grave infringements of established risk limits and
guidelines, the president of the subsidiary has utilised the summer months
for extensive speculation in foreign exchange,' said Skanska. Mr Ottosson is
accused of infringing company rules and procedures more than 50 times.
The company said the losses would adversely affect the group's interim
results due to be published on October 19. In April Skanska said it expected
its profits after financial items for 1992 'not to be below' last year's
SKr1bn.
After requesting a temporary suspension of trading in its shares, Skanska
said the losses came to light yesterday as senior executives were finalising
figures for the interim report.
After trading resumed, the restricted shares closed down SKr3.50 to SKr68
and the free shares lost SKr3 to SKr69.
The finance subsidiary, Kapitalforvaltning, mainly manages Skanska's liquid
assets, trades in securities and foreign currencies and helps to arrange
outside borrowing.
Mr Lennart Hallberg, a company spokesman, said no one else was suspected to
have been involved.
According to Skanska, Mr Ottosson admitted he distorted reports to the main
board about activities of the finance company and changed figures in
Skanska's computer.
Skanska said it tightened internal security this year to prevent this kind
of manipulation. This involved weekly reports and meetings to monitor
foreign exchange business but these were terminated during the Swedish
summer holiday.
'It would have been impossible for Mr Ottosson to do what he did if the
procedures had been in force,' said Mr Hallberg. But while senior officials
took their vacation, Mr Ottosson was able to operate unchallenged.

FT  01 SEP 92 / Investa seeks protection from debts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI IN OSLO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTA, a non-listed Norwegian investment company, yesterday sought
protection from its creditors which are owed NKr3.4bn (Pounds 408m) as the
crisis in the country's financial sectors deepened.
The move inspired a 4.2 per cent fall in the Oslo bourse which closed 14.11
down to 318.89. Den norske Bank A shares, the country's biggest bank, fell
32 per cent to NKr2.50.
The decision to seek protection comes six days after Uni Storebrand,
Norway's biggest insurer, collapsed into the hands of state administrators
with debts of NKr3.6bn.
Of Investa's debt, NKr2.8bn is in short-term unsecured loans in the form of
debt notes and certificates which the holding company can no longer service.
Investa's domestic investments include property, shipping and listed
securities, and a 34 per cent stake in Euronav, a French shipowner.
Christiania Bank, Norway's second biggest bank, said it had loan exposure of
NKr1.085bn to Investa companies. Of the total, Christiania has loans of
NKr460m to Investa's holding company, NKr500m to Investa subsidiaries - of
which it has collateral valued at NKr425m - and a commitment of NKr125m to a
company controlled by one of Investa's owners, secured by stock in the
Investa group.
Den norske Bank said it had loans of NKr920m to the Investa group, of which
NKr280m was to Investa's holding company.
Mr Jarl Veggan, a DnB spokesman, said equity was left in Investa and the
bank was confident it would retrieve loan payments. He said Investa had said
its holding company had an estimated net value of NKr600m.
Investa said yesterday: 'The background for this decision is the current
crisis in the short-term money market, partly caused by Uni Storebrand's
suspended payments.'
Ms Janne Gro Rygg, a finance ministry spokeswoman, said the Uni Storebrand
crisis could have inspired caution in the short-term lending market and
influenced the financial future of other companies.
Investa said debt negotiations would have no immediate consequences for its
subsidiaries but several creditors had called in loans of the holding
company.

FT  01 SEP 92 / Economics Notebook: EC turmoil gives a tonic to Swiss franc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A welcome whiff of the good old days has returned to Swiss financial circles
in recent weeks, with the Swiss franc rising sharply in response - at least
in part - to political turmoil abroad.
Early last week, Germans had to pay DM1.13 to buy a Swiss franc compared
with only DM1.07 at the beginning of May. And Swiss short-term interest
rates were a full 2 per cent lower than German ones.
Those of us who do not expect a German bank to block foreigners' accounts,
or some other calamity to occur in Germany in the near future, may find
these trends a bit mystifying.
For many Swiss analysts, however, the explanation is simple. The European
Community is in such a state of turmoil that Switzerland and the Swiss franc
have recovered their safe-haven status.
Perhaps the assaults on the Maastricht treaty and the European Monetary
System look more spectacular when viewed from the calm banks of Lac Leman or
the Zurich See than they do on the spot.
The Swiss acknowledge that other factors are at work, such as the weakening
of the dollar and the sheer scarcity of francs stemming from the Swiss
National Bank's very tight monetary policy in recent months.
The franc may also have benefitted from an improvement in the SNB's battered
image.
In the spring, the central bank toughed out an attack on the currency,
letting short-term interest rates rise above 9 per cent. This was considered
brave because it courted the risk that banks would raise their mortgage
interest rates. But it was a pretty minor risk.
The banks need all the public support they can muster to win a national
referendum at the end of September on abolishing stamp duty on securities
transactions. They would not have won many friends by raising mortgage
rates.
Political events may continue to have an impact on the franc for at least
the next few weeks. The snag is that they could move the currency either
way.
A 'No' vote in the French referendum on Maastricht on September 20 could
boost the haven quality of the currency. But a 'No' in the Swiss stamp duty
referendum a week later - which is a strong possibility - would accelerate
the outflow of financial activity.
The result of another Swiss plebiscite on September 27, on a SFr15bn (Pounds
6bn) plan to drill two new rail tunnels through the Alps, could also hurt
the franc.
Switzerland's severe restrictions on alpine road traffic force more than 80
per cent of trans-Alpine freight tonnage, with its intolerable burden of
noise and fumes, to move through Austrian and French passes.
Austria and France insist that if the new tunnels are not built Swiss road
restrictions must be eased.
The stubborn burghers of canton Uri do not see things that way, and one can
almost imagine them implementing their second world war contingency plan to
blow up access to the Gotthard pass rather than tolerate more juggernauts.
Whatever happens on the political front, few expect the franc's strength to
last for long.
The Swiss economy has been in recession since the fourth quarter of 1990 and
most economists, in the wake of the July discount rate rise in Germany, have
revised downwards their forecasts for real growth this year to nil or close
to it.
*****
This recession in Switzerland's has been accompanied by an extraordinary
rise in unemployment.
Since the fourth quarter of 1990, more than 90,000 jobs have been lost, and
the number of unemployed is now the highest since the 1930s.
One hesitates to mention the official rate - 2.9 per cent in July - because
it is so derisory compared to that in other industrialised countries.
However, it is not the real figure, merely a head count of people who have
registered with cantonal employment agencies. The government believes that
the real rate is about double the official one.
The important point is the trend. From the early 1970s until late 1990, the
number averaged around 20,000 with little fluctuation either way. Then
suddenly it soared, with still no sign of any easing in the sharply upward
slope.
Apart from the cyclical downturn, one technical and two structural changes
are taking place, and economists differ on how much importance should be
attached to each.
Mr Stefan Wolter of the Union Bank of Switzerland believes the main factor
has been the improvement in unemployment benefits, which has led many more
people to register at the cantonal employment agencies than used to be the
case.
Mr Christophe Koellreuter, head of the BAK economic forecasting institute in
Basle, emphasises the change in behaviour of foreigners.
Job losses in the mid-1970s were much higher than those in the current
recession, reaching 300,000, but two thirds were gastarbeiters who went home
and most of the rest were women who also went home.
Today, Mr Koellreuter says, 'foreign labourers are more integrated in the
workforce'. In other words, they are not the first to be sacked when times
are tough.
The other structural change is more surprising. It looks as if the Swiss,
who we all thought were so efficient, have long had a variant of the old
British disease. It occurs mainly in services, especially banking, and is
the result of a Japanese style paternalism.
In today's cold, competitive world, paternalism is out. Even the big banks
and sacred national institutions like Swissair are turning people out in
their hundreds.
'There is no stigma to laying people off any more. It has even become a sign
of progressive management,' a Zurich banker said last week.

FT  01 SEP 92 / End abuses in Bosnia, says UN: International action urged to
curb Serb human rights violations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IMMEDIATE and concerted international action is needed to curb 'massive and
grave violations of human rights' in Bosnia-Hercegovina and elsewhere in the
region, according to the United Nations' human rights investigator for the
former Yugoslavia.
In a report released yesterday, Mr Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a former Polish prime
minister, says such violations are principally the result of the 'ethnic
cleansing' policy operated by Serbs in areas of Bosnia and Croatia which are
under their control.
Harassment, discrimination, the destruction of homes and mosques, and
detention, torture and killings are used to enforce the policy, the report
says. Moslems are the main victims.
The shelling of population centres and the shooting of civilians in besieged
Bosnian towns - Sarajevo, being the best-known example - were the 'greatest
threat to life' at the moment. But, the report warns, if the sieges are not
lifted before winter, 'massive numbers' could die from malnutrition, illness
and exposure.
Mr Mazowiecki says there is no evidence that Serbia, or the rump Yugoslav
federation which links Serbia and Montenegro, has tried to stop 'ethnic
cleansing' in Bosnia, where they 'clearly exercise very great influence'.
On the contrary, he warns that the 'most violent forms' of 'ethnic
cleansing' may be imminent in the Serbian provinces of Kosovo, Sandzac and
Vojvodina where there are large communities of ethnic Albanians, Moslems and
Hungarians respectively.
The report, circulated to the 53-member UN Human Rights Commission at the
weekend, says the 'multiplicity' of international activities in former
Yugoslavia has limited their effectiveness in helping victims of human
rights violations. Its main recommend-ations include:
An extended mandate for Unprofor, the UN protective force now confined to
Sarajevo and Serb-controlled areas of Croatia, to report on, stop and assist
victims of human rights abuses throughout Bosnia-Hercegovina.
The establishment of an international war crimes tribunal to investigate
'mass and flagrant' human rights violations; the stationing of human rights
monitors throughout the former Yugoslavia, and a guarantee that victims of
'ethnic cleansing' will have the right to return home under international
supervision.
Mr Mazowiecki, who was appointed in mid-August, has gone further than any UN
official in blaming Serbs for most of the atrocities. During his first visit
to the region last week, he says he found no evidence to back Serbian claims
of 'ethnic cleansing' by Moslems. Discrimination, harassment and
maltreatment of ethnic Serbs in Croatia - 'however repugnant' - cannot be
compared with the 'systematic use of violence employed against ethnic
Croatians and Moslems in Bosnia and Hercegovina'.
Other recommendations include the implementation of accords adopted at last
week's London conference on former Yugoslavia to neutralise heavy weaponry
and dismantle camps.

FT  01 SEP 92 / Japanese-owned ICL wins Brussels research contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ICL, the UK-based computer manufacturer, has overcome the politically
sensitive issue of its Japanese ownership to win a number of important
European Commission research contracts.
The projects are chiefly concerned with the development of 'intelligent'
computers which appear to reason like humans. Computer experts believe that
such 'thinking machines' will be commercially available well before the turn
of the century. The chief purpose of the research is to strengthen European
computer manufacturers' competitiveness with rivals in Japan and other
countries.
Siemens of Germany, Olivetti of Italy and Groupe Bull of France opposed the
awarding of contracts to ICL on the grounds that it is Japanese-owned. But
over the past two years, since its purchase by Fujitsu of Japan, ICL has
re-established its European credentials by staying at arm's length from its
new owner and maintaining its position as a leader in technological
research.
There has also been a change of mood in Brussels, with the recognition that
fortress Europe is no longer feasible and an acceptance that the EC's
members need ICL's input.
Success in bringing intelligent computers to the market first could give
European manufacturers a chance to retrieve their failing fortunes in the
global market.
One of the contracts ICL has been awarded is concerned with research
critical to the future of Jessi, the European microchip programme from which
the UK company was partially excluded two years ago after its purchase by
Fujitsu. The Japanese company owns 80 per cent, with Northern Telecom of
Canada owning the remaining 20 per cent.
So far ICL has been awarded five contracts in the latest phase of Esprit,
the European Programme for Research into Information Technology, worth a
total of about Pounds 1.5m to the UK company. It expects to be awarded a
further five or six. The value of the contracts, however, is comparatively
unimportant compared with the acceptance of the company as a full member of
the European computing community with a big part to play in its future.
Esprit, established in 1982, is the Commission's main research effort in
advanced computing. It allocated research funds to the value of Ecu1.6bn
between 1987 and 1992. The Commission pays 50 per cent of companies' costs.
Esprit is concerned with precompetitive research - developing basic
technologies on which individual companies can build competitive products.
It was set up in direct response to the Japanese 'Fifth Generation' project,
a multi-million dollar plan to co-ordinate research between Japanese
electronics companies and academic institutions to develop computers with
human reasoning powers. It failed, however, to fulfil its lofty ambitions.

FT  01 SEP 92 / MPs warn against collusion over bank charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POSSIBILITY of an agreement among the big four high street banks to
phase out free banking was greeted with warnings yesterday from MPs across
the House of Commons against possible collusion.
Mr John Watts, the Tory chairman of the all-party Treasury committee of MPs,
expressed unease at the idea of more extensive charges being introduced in
concerted action by the banks.
Recalling the committee's inquiry into the banks' relationship with small
business customers, he said that if there were widespread moves to introduce
new charges, the MPs might well want to look at the matter.
'It is certainly potentially a topic we might want to look at if there were
a substantial change in the basis of banks' charges.'
His remarks came as Barclays, the biggest UK high street bank, confirmed
that plans to reintro- duce charges for many current account holders were
'on the agenda'. The other three main banks also indicated over the weekend
that they were considering similar steps.
Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer affairs spokesman, has already written
to the Office of Fair Trading asking it to investigate whether there was
collusion against the public interest in the banks' plans.
Although Barclays, which has 6.5m current account holders, has no plans 'at
the moment' to introduce charges on accounts in credit, an official said 'we
are conscious that there is an imbalance between the 80 per cent who pay no
current account charges and those that are overdrawn'.
Over the weekend Mr Brian Pearse, chief executive of Midland Bank, said
there was no point in providing current account holders who never paid
charges with a service.
'Over time, hopefully, we'll persuade our customers you don't get anything
for nothing,' Mr Pearse said.
Midland has 4.5m current account customers, of which two-thirds do not pay
charges. A Midland official said yesterday that Mr Pearse's remarks were
general and long-term.
National Westminster and Lloyds also intimated they believed the days of
free banking in credit may be numbered.
'If only a small minority of your customers are paying bank charges, it's
something you look at,' an official at NatWest said.
Lloyds said UK customers with a current account took free banking for
granted but that Lloyds had more than 4m current account customers, of which
more than 70 per cent were effectively subsidised by the minority who became
overdrawn.

FT  01 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: British Gas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With the Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigation into British Gas,
the outlook for the shares is very uncertain. But investors can try to
estimate what the shares would be worth under various possible outcomes,
assuming that the government's doctrine of increasing competition is used as
the MMC's guiding principle. One way to achieve this would be to split
British Gas into a regulated pipeline business, which is a natural monopoly,
and several marketing companies which could compete to sell gas.
If the marketing businesses are assumed to earn returns similar to that of
the regional electricity companies, and the pipeline company is allowed a
higher rate of return than currently, then the value of breaking up British
Gas could be over 300p a share. But there are problems. At present there is
no sign that a demerged British Gas would be allowed to earn higher rates of
return.
Another approach, similar to that agreed with the Office of Fair Trading
this year, would be to allow British Gas to remain intact, but separate its
pipeline and marketing operations by internal Chinese walls, with outside
companies providing competition in marketing. British Gas has already lost a
substantial part of its firm contract market. Once again, unless the company
were allowed to earn higher returns from the pipeline operation, the profits
outlook would be poor and might not justify the current 240p share price.
One difference between the two models is the ability to cut costs - a
demerged company would have higher overheads, whereas British Gas as a
single unit might axe regional centres. That pulls the two valuations closer
together, but the central question remains the level of allowed earnings.
Competition can only be encouraged through higher gas prices or slimmer
profits on the pipeline. There can be little doubt which the government will
choose.

FT  01 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Bananas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Decisions by the Brussels competition authorities routinely influence stock
markets. Maastricht deliberations apart, however, the EC will seldom have a
better chance to move share prices than over the next two months when reform
of the EC's banana import regime moves to the top of the Council of
Ministers' agenda. Geest and Fyffes - UK importers with combined market
capitalisations of Pounds 450m - will be significant beneficiaries if the
present restrictive proposals by the Commission are adopted; Chiquita, Dole
and Del Monte, multinationals currently engaged in a fierce price war in
Germany and other continental markets, will be big losers if, as many
assume, their rearguard action for free trade fails to win the day.
There is no single EC market at the moment in bananas. Each member state has
its own arrangements, though there are broadly three different systems:
protected markets( France, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the UK) primarily
supplied by former colonies; freer markets in which banana imports from
non-preferred sources are subject to a 20 per cent tariff but no
quantitative limits; and Germany, where all bananas enter duty-free. The
idea as put forward by Brussels is to secure continued, unhindered access
for the guaranteed growers - the likes of the Windward Islands and
Guadeloupe - while setting an overall EC quota of 2m tonnes for those now
supplying the freer markets, predominantly Latin American (or so-called
dollar) producers.
Vested interests on both sides are powerful, but the protectionists look to
be winning the battle. They have exploited Brussels' knee-jerk anti American
instincts - depicting a free market dominated by US multinationals - and
convinced policymakers that without a helping hand some of the world's
poorest economies will collapse. Geest has played a leading part in the
lobbying, and its decision to sink an estimated Pounds 100m into new Costa
Rica banana capacity means that the level of its future profits is resting
heavily on the outcome. As the proposal stands, besides the safeguarding of
its Caribbean supplies the company will be allowed a good crack at importing
'dollar' bananas.
Considerable arm twisting may yet be required to convince the liberal
majority to go along with the Commission's plans, while Britain's position
in the protectionist camp may prove an embarrassment during its EC
presidency and at such a critical stage in the Uruguay Round.

FT  01 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Anxiety for the Ecu
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There must be some doubt as to whether the Ecu bond market will ever fully
recover following a second liquidity seizure inside a month. Agreement among
market makers on wider dealing spreads restored a fragile equilibrium the
first time around, but the imbalance of buyers and sellers last week risked
inflicting damage beyond repair. Institutional investors will be slow to
forgive. Having watched market makers pile into Ecu bonds and launch a
record volume of new issues last year, it can hardly be edifying to see them
now refusing to trade.
To be fair, extreme volatility has always been a feature of the Ecu market.
Yields are not anchored to any set of domestic economic fundamentals, so
shifts in sentiment have a disproportionate effect. Mathematics dictate that
Ecu bonds offer value when the yield rises above a theoretical level,
calculated from the underlying bond markets of countries which make up the
Ecu currency basket. But this complex method of valuation has counted for
little since the future of European monetary union was called into question
by the Danish referendum. At the 10-year maturity, Ecu bonds now yield a
full  1/2 percentage point more than theory suggests they should.
The future now turns on the outcome of the French vote. One might argue that
monetary union has already been factored out of Ecu bond prices, but a 'non'
vote will cast doubt on the future of the Ecu as a financial medium. Ecu
bonds will retain some value as a natural currency hedge, but the market
could be relegated to little more than a curiosity. Perhaps the biggest hope
is that European central banks - ironically, the Bank of France is chief
among them - have invested a great deal of credibility in the Ecu market. If
the French vote 'oui' on September 20, there will be some powerful interests
vested in restoring order.

FT  01 SEP 92 / Little cause for comfort: Japan's corporate sector faces
difficult times ahead despite the government's fiscal package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tokyo's financial mandarins have finally opened their eyes to the gathering
economic woes in Japan. And they don't like what they see. After months in
which they had appeared blind to the threat posed by falling share prices
and an increasingly dismal stream of economic news, the government has acted
to halt the deepening crisis in the domestic financial markets. At least for
the time being.
The government's overall Y10,700bn (Pounds 43bn) fiscal package - announced
last Friday - will increase public spending by an amount equivalent to
building five Channel tunnels and extending London's Jubilee underground
line with the spare change. Salomon Brothers Asia, an investment bank,
estimates that the programme will add Y7,600bn to aggregate demand, and
boost gross national product by 1.66 per cent, mainly next year.
At the same time, the ministry of finance's recent measures for the troubled
banking industry appear to have halted this year's collapse in share prices.
The Nikkei has risen by 25 per cent in less than two weeks on the back of
investors' positive response to the government's willingness to ease
pressure on the heavily-indebted financial sector.
Yet the combined package of fiscal and financial measures will do little to
ease the squeeze felt by many manufacturing companies that have been among
the worst hit by the deepening domestic downturn. The recent rally in
Japanese share prices may not last. Only when a recovery in corporate
profits finally arrives will the dangers of a further collapse in share
prices be over.
A series of poor corporate results last Friday highlighted the continuing
risks facing the economy. On the evening the government approved the
spending package and outlined emergency measures for the financial markets,
Nissan Motor, Japan's second biggest vehicle maker, warned of losses for the
year totalling Y20bn, a further 17 per cent cut in capital spending, and
plans to shed 4,000 jobs over the next three years.
Nissan was not the only big Japanese company to announce downwardly revised
profits forecasts. Similar announcements were made yesterday by computer
company NEC, consumer electronics group Toshiba, Komatsu, the heavy
equipment maker, retail group Mitsukoshi, Kyocera, the electronic equipment
maker, and a string of other companies. Much of the rest of Japan Inc. is
likely to follow suit in the weeks ahead.
These grim corporate developments are the result of the boom-bust cycle that
companies, as well as financial markets, have experienced over the past five
years. The years of cheap finance that artificially boosted land and
property prices and encouraged an unprecedented acceleration of corporate
investment are no more. The fallout from this re-adjustment promises to
produce plenty more bad news in the coming months.
The problems of both the banking and the corporate sectors have their roots
in the period during the mid- to late-1980s, when Japan came under enormous
international pressure to cut its huge trade surplus by expanding domestic
demand. Following the 1987 Louvre agreement to stabilise the fall of the
dollar, the Bank of Japan was required to keep interest rates low so as to
stimulate the economy and boost imports.
The consequences for the financial sector were turbulent. Low interest rates
and financial deregulation inflated the financial markets as property prices
and share prices soared and bank lending grew at an unsustainable rate. As
inflationary pressures grew, the Bank of Japan eventually raised interest
rates in 1989, pricking the economic bubble and leading to a decline in
stock prices and a collapse of the property market in 1990. The banks remain
burdened by bad debt and property prices continue to fall.
What Japan's economic bureaucrats have consistently failed to appreciate is
the extent to which the heady years also distorted investment and
consumption patterns. Company investments grew sharply because money was
cheap to borrow, while the rise in share prices cut the cost of equity
capital to low levels by global standards.
Growth in private sector capital equipment investment reached a peak of 16.6
per cent in 1989, and continued rising at a brisk pace of 12.4 per cent in
1990. Nissan, not atypical of manufacturing companies, tripled capital
investment to Y318.6bn in the three years to 1990, taking advantage of
market conditions to renew production facilities.
Manufacturers were also encouraged to invest by a brisk rise in consumption,
which was in turn supported by the tight labour market. Japanese companies
had responded to a blaze of publicity about domestic structural labour
shortages by taking on more workers. For employees, the high level of job
vacancies reduced the already low risk of redundancy, encouraging them to
spend more, mostly on expensive durable goods. Passenger car registrations,
for example, rose by 13.2 per cent in 1988 and 12.6 per cent in 1989.
The net result was a rise in investment that quickly became unsustainable
once interest rates rose, share prices fell and domestic demand began to
slow. Companies brought new facilities on stream only to discover that
demand had disappeared. Inventories began to pile up, even as production was
cut. Capital spending plans began to cut deeply into corporate profits at a
time when depreciation charges on previous investments were already rising
to a peak.
What was a powerful cyclical rise, has turned into an equally powerful
cyclical retreat. Companies have responded by cutting investment, reducing
bonus payments, curbing overtime and temporary employment, freezing hiring,
and even in some cases reducing overall staff numbers through natural
wastage. With employment now less secure than before, household consumption
began to slow in the second quarter of this year.
Yet, in spite of the accumulating evidence pointing to the economy's
slowdown over the past year, it is only now that the ministry of finance has
accepted that the private sector's pleas for government action amount to
more than just special pleading.
Why has the ministry been so slow to respond? Mr Masaru Yoshitomi, economist
at the Economic Planning Agency, said the government had misjudged the
severity of the downturn because some vital indicators on which it kept a
particularly close eye, such as plant utilisation, had only been declining
early in the year to levels seen in the late-1980s, prior to the upturn.
Finance ministry officials continually pointed to other indicators, such as
employment and bankruptcies, which showed the economy bearing up much more
so than in the 1973 and 1979 downturns following the oil price rise.
Financial indicators - falling stock and land prices, and the record slow
growth in the broad money supply - all suggested that things were much
worse, but were ignored.
Most important, the ministry of finance has remained stubbornly unwilling
until the past few weeks to reverse its policy of reducing government debt
and agree to anything more than a cosmetic fiscal boost. The Bank of Japan
has been cutting interest rates since July of last year. But low interest
rates alone would probably not have been enough to encourage the economy to
pick up. Certainly the US has found that recession accompanied by asset
deflation has proved extremely difficult to turn around by monetary policy
means alone.
And, in spite of the ministry's qualms, Japan benefits from being able to
use fiscal instruments on a much larger scale than the deficit-constrained
US. Japan's ratio of net state debt to GNP is a modest 7 per cent compared
to 36 per cent in the US. But more important, the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development has forecast that Japan will run a budget
surplus of 1.9 per cent of GNP this year compared to a US deficit of 3.8 per
cent. Tokyo can therefore afford a spending package of a magnitude denied to
Washington.
What has prompted the Japanese government to finally act has been the recent
plunge in consumer spending, downward forecasts of corporate profits and the
accompanying plunge in share prices. Government economists had consistently
maintained that the strength of consumer spending would sustain the economy.
The government's response has been a typical Japanese-style package of
fiscal measures. The package is designed to boost domestic demand and partly
offset the fall in private consumption and capital spending that threatens
to push growth to below 2 per cent this year. Economists in Tokyo estimate
that the increase in central and local government spending on public works
outlined in the package - totalling about Y5,000bn - will boost growth by
between 0.6 per cent and 0.7 per cent this fiscal year. The money will be
used to build roads, houses, airports, railroads, and sewers, all of which
are badly needed in Japan.
The actual boost to the economy, however, will be much smaller than the
Y10,700bn - 2.3 per cent of GNP - total package expenditure suggests.
Spending from the postal saving system - one of the government's most
important sources of domestic finance - for example, involves only a
redirecting of money towards special lending programmes, such as low
interest loans for small business, not new money. Several thousand billion
yen which will go towards the purchase of land will not make a direct
contribution to growth.
The government hopes the package will boost the economy by 2.4 per cent in
the 12 months from October, when a supplementary budget will be enacted to
raise the finance to pay for the measures.
Yet the spending programme offers nothing in the short-run for Japan's most
successful industries - cars and consumer electronics. Nissan, Toyota, Honda
and Japan's eight other vehicle makers all have overcapacity that needs to
be chopped ruthlessly
These companies, and hundreds of their suppliers will remain under pressure
to cut investment, wages and employment in the months ahead. Mr Paul
Summerville, economist at Jardine Fleming, expects 500,000 manufacturing
jobs to be slashed in the next 12 months. Even if employment increases in
other sectors of the economy, as the spending programme takes effect, the
difficulties in the manufacturing sector will continue to send shivers down
the spines of consumers, government officials and the stock market.
For sure, what Tokyo's mandarins see before them is not a pleasing sight.

THE POWER struggle within Japan's government has been resolved, at least for
the moment. And for once the strongest has not emerged victorious. The
unexpectedly large fiscal package of direct public spending increases and
tax reliefs confirms that the misgivings of the ministry of finance have
been overridden. The malign inaction that has undermined market confidence
over the past few months has gone. The financial markets are still
celebrating.
Only time will tell whether these celebrations are premature. But the
realistic, as well as the pessimistic, investor will not yet have been
convinced that Tokyo's bear market is over, in spite of a 25 per cent rise
in share prices over the past fortnight. It is not enough that the
government is, and is seen to be, taking its responsibilities seriously at
last. What counts is what the government can do to speed recovery by
persuading banks to lend and companies to borrow in order to invest for the
future. In fact, it can do very little.
The fiscal package, in so far as it involves direct increases in spending,
will boost domestic demand while accelerating much needed public investment
projects. Yet much of the stimulus from this fiscal boost will not arrive
until next year. In the meantime, companies will continue to cut back on
capital spending projects in the face of depressed profits and sluggish
consumer demand. There remains much bad news for the markets to digest.
The sagacity of the various, and often vague, schemes to boost share prices
and ease the plight of Japan's indebted banking industry are harder to
judge. But the suspicion remains that many, particularly the new private
corporation which will buy land from troubled banks, provide means of
concealing rather than solving the problems. Only if the government
subsidises the purchase of this land will the scheme be any more than an
accounting device to conceal the banks' losses from investors. But cutting
interest rates is a much better way to support the banking industry than
artificially holding up land prices.
Yet neither fiscal nor monetary policy can prevent a long and painful
work-out from the debt-overhang facing Japan, and the US and UK too. But
easing policy can make this process quicker and less painful. Regrettably,
neither the US nor the UK can afford anything more than a modest increase in
government spending without storing up debt problems of a different sort.
The UK has to live with very high interest rates too.
Japan's advantage is that it has both policy options at its disposal. The
government prevaricated too long before acting to ease fiscal policy,
undermining market confidence in the process. But the Bank of Japan can
learn from this mistake. It still has room to cut short-term interest rates.
It should do so now rather than wait.

FT  01 SEP 92 / Leading Article: College for all
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A RECORD number of students will embark on higher education courses in the
UK in a few weeks. About one in five 18-yearolds is about to set off to
college or university, and the proportion is set to rise to one in three by
the year 2000.
Increasing access to higher education is a laudable goal, provided standards
are safeguarded. It is not, however, in the best interests of the productive
economy that so much of the current growth should be concentrated in the
humanities and social sciences. The fault there lies in the schools, as
evidenced by a continuing decline in maths and science at GCSE and A-level.
Whatever form it takes, expansion raises two important policy issues as yet
barely addressed by the government. What quality of higher education should
students have a right to expect? And how is it to be financed?
So far, the government has done little beyond setting targets for expansion
and allowing polytechnics to call themselves universities. Targets without
resources should impress no-one. As for nomenclature, if allowing a London
polytechnic to call itself the University of Westminster silences the
Oxbridge snobs, all well and good. But the acute overcrowding to be found in
many of the former polytechnics will not be reduced by changing their letter
heads.
A number of fairly painless reforms could ease the burden. The government
should accept the recommendations of the Pearce Report, and give higher
education institutions greater freedom to borrow against their assets. It
should also encourage universities to move towards semesters to increase
their productivity, and be ruthless about concentrating research funding
only on those institutions with strong research records.
However, it also needs to contemplate several more painful reforms. First,
if student maintenance is means-tested and, increasingly, provided in the
form of loans rather than grants, why not students' tuition fees also? Most
students benefit enormously in terms of earning power from their degrees:
with public spending constrained, there is no reason in equity why those
capable of doing so should not repay at least part of the cost of their
courses.
Second, the government should consider ending subsidies for students who
wish to study away from home. There is a lot to be said for young people
going away to college, but not much for the state paying large sums for them
to do so. Perhaps student housing should only be built on a fully commercial
basis.
The government's job is to see that quality is maintained. The biggest
contributions it can make to that are to keep class sizes small, and to
ensure that academic pay is high enough to attract the ablest graduates into
university teaching and research. At present it is failing to do either.

FT  01 SEP 92 / Personal View: France to the rescue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HALE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the financial history of the 20th century is written, French and
British disagreements about how to manage the Germans are likely to rank
high on the list of factors which contributed to international monetary
crises.
During the inter-war years, France was so determined to inhibit German
recovery that it used the threat of gold withdrawals from London to
discourage Britain from reducing Germany's war reparations burden. As
Britain's balance of payments was already under strain, because of the
decision to return to the gold standard at an overvalued exchange rate in
1925, such French monetary mischief forced Britain to keep interest rates at
undesirably high levels and thus contributed to the economic crisis which
culminated in the abandonment of the gold standard during September 1931.
As a result of the forthcoming referendum on the Maastricht treaty, France
is poised once again to have a profound impact on the conduct of British
economic policy. But in contrast to the deflationary bias of French policy
during the early 1930s, the Maastricht referendum provides France with an
opportunity to break the exchange rate mechanism's monetary gridlock, which
is now strangling the British economy and retarding growth elsewhere in
Europe.
If France votes against the Maastricht treaty, there would be so much
turmoil in the currency markets that European governments would have a
politically convenient excuse to accept the ERM realignment that should have
occurred at the time of German unification. Such a realignment would then
set the stage for a significant decline in the level of interest rates
throughout Europe.
As in the inter-war years, French relations with Germany have played a big
part in creating the current European economic crisis. The French political
elite has been among the strongest advocates of European monetary union,
because it views this as additional reinforcement for creating strong
European federal institutions to control unified Germany.
But while such attitudes are historically understandable, they have
encouraged France to adopt a policy towards exchange rate realignment that
has crippled the process of economic adjustment in Europe. As a result of
France's opposition to any form of comprehensive D-Mark revaluation,
Europe's exchange rate target zones have increasingly become a political
totem promoting competitive deflation rather than a clearing price for goods
and capital maximising European trade and output.
The fact is that Germany has needed far more exchange rate flexibility since
1989 than the ERM permitted. Since unification, the government deficit has
expanded from barely 1 per cent of gross national product to about 7 per
cent and the large pre-1989 current account surplus has disappeared. Germany
has been reliving the Reagan fiscal experiment under the constraint of a
semi-fixed exchange rate system despite the need for significant real
exchange rate appreciation to reallocate resources from its tradeable goods
sector to government consumption.
In countries with weaker central banks than Germany's, such an adjustment in
the real exchange rate would have occurred through higher inflation. But
because of the Bundesbank's determination to contain inflation, Germany has
experienced a large rise in real interest rates, not the real exchange rate.
The D-Mark's real exchange rate has risen by only 5 per cent since 1989
compared with more than 30 per cent for the dollar during the early Reagan
years.
The British government was aware of the financial strains created by German
unification when it joined the ERM, but it clearly underestimated the
economic trade-offs they would pose compared with the perceived political
benefits of being an ERM member. The results of this error are clearly
apparent. The level of real interest rates is approaching 7 per cent despite
the most protracted recession since the 1930s, the bankrputcy of thousands
of entrepreneurial companies launched in the Thatcher years, severe real
estate deflation, and a rapidly growing stock of non-performing bank loans.
Britain's current account deficit is also at such high levels that the
country will soon be an external debtor, despite the large accumulation of
overseas assets which followed the North Sea oil boom of the early 1980s.
The deflation occurring in the British economy will ultimately create the
preconditions for improved competitiveness and economic recovery, but
probably not until the second half of the 1990s. As a result, the UK
government deficit is likely to rise to 6 to 7 per cent of gross domestic
product this year and remain there for much longer than official forecasters
now recognise, despite the Maastricht requirement that public sector
deficits converge towards 3 per cent of GNP during the mid-1990s.
Britain's forced convergence with German fiscal policy will help to
compensate for the weakness occurring in private investment, but these large
new budget deficits will be far less stimulative than the interest rate
decline and currency depreciation which offset the much maligned Thatcher
tax increases of 1981. The fact is that British household and corporate
balance sheets differ so profoundly from Germany's that the UK cannot escape
from recession until interest rates fall sharply. Such a decline will not
occur until Germany also experiences a slump or the ERM is realigned.
The problem for the British government is finding a face-saving way of
correcting its 1990 error. The government has invested so much political
capital in the ERM that it would be impossible for it to pursue a unilateral
realignment without the resignation of the chancellor. But if France votes
No, the UK government will have the perfect excuse to promote the
realignment of European exchange rates which the Bundesbank itself advocated
more than two years ago.
How would the financial markets react to such a development? Perhaps the
most instructive guide is how they reacted to Britain's decision to abandon
the gold standard in 1931. As the gold standard had been the dominant
monetary regime for several decades previously, the psychological trauma
associated with the decision to abandon gold greatly exceeded the trauma
which would follow a decision to realign the ERM.
The authorities themselves were so apprehensive about the risk of a
financial panic that they closed the London stock market for two days, but
when it reopened share prices immediately rallied in expectation of an
improved economy. The bond market fell initially because of concern about
the threat of inflation but shortly thereafter it entered a multi-year bull
market. After peaking at 5 per cent in 1931, UK government bond yields fell
steadily to 3.08 per cent in 1934. Short-term interest rates also fell from
6 per cent to 2 per cent.
There is little reason to doubt that an ERM realignment would produce a
sustained rally in British equity prices. The outlook for the currency and
bond market would depend upon the ability of the UK government to produce a
multi-year strategy for promoting economic recovery without reviving
inflation. Such a programme would probably have to include a more
independent Bank of England in order to ensure that monetary policy did not
remain excessively stimulative after economic recovery began.
It also would be easier to revive the movement towards European monetary
union later in the 1990s if the leading players had exchange rates and
interest rates consistent with steady non-inflationary growth, not the
disequilibria and depression which have resulted from the impact of German
unification on the current system.
As a result of the previous tensions between Britain and France over the
issues of Europe and international monetary relations, there is rich irony
in the fact that Britain may now depend upon a popular referendum in France
to correct the ERM policy error which has produced the current slump.
But the Maastricht vote will not be the first time that France has helped to
inspire a benign change in Britain's monetary regime. After all, the
Westminster parliament created the Bank of England during 1694 in order to
finance a war with France.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE London conference on the former Yugoslavia had one overriding purpose:
to find ways of bringing peace to Bosnia and stability to the Balkans
without the use of external force. Ultimately, this may prove to be
impossible. But it is up to the United Nations and the European Community to
implement all its conclusions with the utmost sense of urgency. The
conference agreed on four documents which they will try to start
implementing in Geneva later this week. But if the documents are to have any
meaning, time is of the essence - as confirmed by the Serb bombardment of
Sarajevo at the weekend.
First, the UN Security Council must quickly amend the mandate of the UN
forces in Bosnia. All humanitarian aid convoys must be accompanied by
armoured personnel carriers, and protected by troops committed by Canada,
France, Spain and the UK. These convoys must be ready to move in and keep
the aid rolling when the Serbs lift their sieges of Bosnia's towns.
If there is any time lag, the Bosnian government forces will,
understandably, try to regain territory seized by the Serbs. This will
encourage the Serbs to continue the war. Backed by a military machine from
Serbia proper, they are in a position to do so.
The UN must also be ready to place all Serb artillery and heavy weaponry
under its control. There is no point in believing that Mr Radovan Karadzic,
head of the Bosnian Serbs, will order his forces to give up their weapons
without international monitors on the ground.
The UN should commit itself to a specific timetable as to when these
monitors will be sent, how the flow of reinforcements from Serbia into
Bosnia can be stemmed, when the ban on all military flights over the
republic will be implemented, and when tougher sanctions will be imposed on
Serbia. A lax timetable, or none at all, would be a recipe for failure.
Banning military flights should be coupled with placing all military
aircraft in Bosnia under international control. In Geneva, there must be
moves towards reining in Serbia's own military machine. If this is not done,
there is no reason to doubt that Serbia will use its aircraft and tanks
against the ethnic Albanians in the southern province of Kosovo.
Were that to happen, then Macedonia, whose independence has still to be
recognised by the EC, will be dragged into the war: its own ethnic Albanian
minority will defend their confreres in Kosovo. Since the UN and EC are not
prepared to arm the Moslems or back the documents with force, this form of
containment is essential.
The UN and EC must then draw up a financial package to provide shelter for
the tens of thousands of Bosnians whose homes have been destroyed by the
Serbs. There is also a need to create safe havens within Bosnia. Without
action now, the London Conference will have failed to stop the war, and
failed to stop it from spreading.

FT  01 SEP 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Badge of quality -
Charles Batchelor assesses whether BS5750 is too complex and costly for
small companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Geoff Smith could be the man to give quality a good name among smaller
companies in Britain. Smith, managing director of Alfred Bagnall &amp; Sons
(South Wales), a painting contractor, earlier this month achieved
accreditation for his company under British Standard 5750.
BS5750 is a quality standard which helps businesses adapt their management
procedures to reduce the chances of mistakes being made and to allow errors
which do occur to be traced and rectified. It is being adopted by a growing
number of British companies and other organisations as diverse as local
chambers of commerce and (in a modified form) by Notting Hill police station
in west London.
What was unusual about Smith's approach to BS5750 was that he made no use of
outside consultants to help in the lengthy and often complex qualification
procedure. After an initial approach to the British Standards Institution
(BSI), the main standards body for BS5750, Smith and his finance director
worked through the BSI handbooks and implemented the scheme themselves.
'When we went back to BSI they said we must come on an introductory course,'
Smith recalls. 'We told them we had already written a quality manual and
introduced all the procedures and that we wanted accreditation. They only
half believed us but when they got here and saw what we had done, they said
we had done a splendid job.'
Smith and his company seem set for a star role in promotional brochures put
out by BSI and the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). For after initial
enthusiasm for the idea of quality standards, BS5750 has run into increasing
criticism from smaller companies.
BS5750 has been criticised for being unduly complex and for imposing a heavy
burden on the smaller firm. It demands hundreds of hours of management time,
is costly and is not intended to improve the quality of a company's products
or services directly but only to improve the management process.
'The standard is written in mumbo jumbo,' says Bernard Juby of the
Federation of Small Businesses, which has been campaigning for it to be made
more comprehensible to small firms. 'Companies have to take on consultants
who regurgitate large chunks from the manuals and then charge an arm and a
leg.'
These claims were backed up earlier this month with the publication of an
Open University survey which showed that many small firms feared BS5750
would push up their costs without improving the quality of the goods or
services provided. While 2.5 per cent had already obtained BS5750 and a
further 25 per cent were in the process or intended to register, just over
half said it was not for them.
But what has particularly angered many small businesses is that they may
have no choice but to register if they want to retain their customers. Large
firms and government organisations increasingly expect their suppliers to
meet the standard.
Geoff Smith is convinced of the value of BS5750 despite the fact that it
took nearly one day's work a week for him and his finance director over two
years. The standard provides an external measure of the effectiveness of his
management controls, has increased efficiency and, in the past four months,
has improved profits by 10 per cent, he calculates.
Procedures for handling and placing orders have been formalised so as to
eliminate the small mistakes which took up so much management time. 'There
is paperwork involved but it cuts out the 2 per cent of the jobs which
caused 90 per cent of the problems,' he says.
Alfred Bagnall (South Wales) has already started to benefit from BS5750 but
with turnover of Pounds 1.3m and a workforce of 45 it is rather larger than
the very small businesses - employing up to 20 people - which are the main
cause of concern for the Federation of Small Businesses. (Bagnall is also
part of a larger Yorkshire-based company, but it received no help from head
office.)
The experiences of a small engineering company with sales of Pounds 250,000
and eight employees are more typical, according to the critics of BS5750.
This company, which prefers to remain anonymous, is currently half-way
through the accreditation process but is an unwilling convert to BS5750
under pressure from customers.
The managing director says he has had to change many of his procedures
radically and the cost, he believes, can only be met by reducing the quality
of the products he supplies.
The only way of continuing deliveries to some of his customers has been to
supply them through another company which is already registered for BS5750,
though this has reduced his company's margins.
This company has paid an external consultant Pounds 350 a day for 15 days
(though the government's Enterprise Initiative scheme meets half of the
consultant's fees) to help it produce a quality manual, but the managing
director believes he will need an extra employee to handle the paperwork.
'We have always worked to a high standard so the only benefit I can see is
that we will retrieve some of the customers we have lost,' he says.
The BSI remains convinced of the value of BS5750 for businesses of all
sizes. It points to the 20,000 UK companies which have achieved
accreditation and to the growing acceptance of the standard, or its
international equivalents ISO9000 and EN29000, in continental Europe, the US
and Japan.
'In general, companies find they are already doing 80 per cent of what is
needed to meet the standard,' comments Tom Harland, director of business
development at BSI Quality Assurance. Although the standard does not
directly set out to improve the quality of products or service, by
installing procedures which allow a company to identify what has gone wrong,
it has the effect of improving product quality, he says.
BSI and other UK certification organisations have, however, been forced by a
growing wave of protest from small businesses to consider ways of making
BS5750 simpler to implement. The Federation of Small Businesses initially
pushed for a less demanding standard for small firms but, realising this
would lead to small businesses being labelled as 'second class', is now
pushing for simplified manuals and easier implementation procedures.
'We have been looking at a more appropriate method of applying the system,'
comments Bernard Juby. 'We would like to devise a manual which would allow a
small business to take a step-by-step approach to implementing BS5750. It
should be possible to do that for under Pounds 50.'
As more large companies start to apply BS5750, it has become increasingly
important to devise a means to allow the 96 per cent of UK businesses which
employ fewer than 20 people to share the benefits of higher quality
standards.

'Business angels,' private investors of equity capital in small businesses,

This is one of the findings of a new study* of the non-financial
contribution of professional and 'amateur' investors carried out by the

Both angels and venture capitalists help to monitor financial and operating
performance and act as a sounding board for management, but private
investors also made important contributions to business strategy and to
product and market development.

should be done
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
It all began as a marketing ploy, David Chambers, managing director of
advertising agency Fenn, freely admits. 'We approached it in a
tongue-in-cheek way, thinking it would be good publicity if we became the
first company of our kind to get BS5750.'
Eighteen months on, the company has succeeded in getting its award but
Chambers says it would have been an expensive exercise just for the PR.
Fortunately, he is convinced the company now operates more smoothly and
profitably.
Chambers' company is based in north Manchester, has a turnover of about
Pounds 2m and employs eight full-time staff. Most of Fenn's work is
providing 'business-to-business' creative services - designing leaflets,
brochures and corporate stationary and handling trade and technical
advertising.
'An increasing number of our customers were themselves getting BS5750. There
wasn't exactly a threat, but there was the veiled suggestion that if we
didn't have it we wouldn't be able to deal with them,' says Chambers.
A DTI grant went towards hiring quality assurance consultants; other cash
costs associated with certification totalled about Pounds 4,000. However,
the greatest price to be paid was in time, says Chambers. He calculates that
he spent at least two months getting certification. Overall, he considers it
a 'relatively costly business' for a company of Fenn's size.
The expenditure of time on administering BS5750 continues. Fenn receives
six-monthly checks by external assessors and Chambers oversees monthly
internal audits. At the moment he has a backlog and July and August's audit
will take half a day's work.
'It's a paperwork chore and there's a lot of jargon - there's the
sinister-sounding 'corrective action report', for example. We've had very
good consultants but that whole area needs monitoring too, in my opinion.
Consultants are proliferating - you've now got consultants for the
consultants,' says Chambers.
In spite of the paperwork, jargon and time-consuming nature of operating
BS5750, Chambers is an evangelist. Businesses involving creative types have
always been poor on organisation, he says.
'But the last thing we want people to think is that it's creativity by
numbers. It doesn't impinge on the creative side but we do now know where
things are filed, what procedures are for work to be checked by the
customer, for example. There's a Bible for how the job should be done.
'If I'm run over by a bus, someone else would be able to come in and follow
the job through smoothly. It's no longer the case that when I go on holiday
I have to plaster everyone else's desks with notes before I go.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
FEW English artists have any real subject except England: it's the
well-spring from which they draw all their sustenance. It was to be expected
that Harley Granville-Barker - the Trollope of playwrights - would flounder
when tackling dethroned European monarchy, and so it proves. Barker
completed His Majesty, his final play, in 1923; this staging by the Orange
Tree, Richmond, is its world premiere. The director, Sam Walters, who
directed the first-ever production of Barker's The Secret Life at the Orange
Tree in 1988, does much to animate this curio.
As a comment on Europe, it throws off pre-echoes of present-day Romania and
ex-Yugoslavia; as a comment on kings, it suggests that monarchy is an
anachronism; as a expression of Barker himself, it reflects his own
abdication from the centre of British theatre. Its discussion is never less
than intelligent, though often less than dramatic. Barker always risked too
much wordiness and plot detail, and here went overboard on them. It hangs
fire.
The scene-changes in this production are more vivid than the play. Sam
Dastor is a world-weary king, monotonously gracious and resigned, not unlike
an Alan Bennett vicar. Caroline John's Queen, with a slight staginess that's
appropriate, has welcome energy and poise.
Meanwhile at the Royal Lyceum Theatre the Royal National Theatre has given
two rehearsed readings of The Secret Life. Here too the dominant note is
resignation, even abdication. The play is set on the cusp of the upper and
upper-middle classes, and - like His Majesty and unlike The Voysey
Inheritance and The Madras House - suffers from its narrow, privileged
social horizons. Its main life occurs in its varied depiction of relations
between men and women.
The Royal National Theatre should not be presenting a play-reading where
most of the cast project so poorly, indeed unprofessionally. I would call
Rachel Joyce's method of acting a fake-radiant drone if I could have heard
more than a third of her words, but I couldn't. Michael Gardiner inflicted
on two roles the same woollen consonants, cloudy vowels, soggy sibilants and
dull pacing. Helen McCrory's narration was drab and underpowered; one fears
for her reading of Barker's Ann Leete next week.
The cast offered incorrect pronunciations of 'loggia' and 'sine qua non'.
The characters who open the play by talking about Wagner mispronounce his
characters' names and have no notion of how his music goes. Manning Redwood,
Jo Stone-Fewings and Mary Mitchell all gave otherwise charming, detailed but
too subdued accounts.
I might fault Brenda Blethyn's Joan for its breathy little-girl voice - but
I was merely grateful for its audibility. Rosemary Martin and James
Laurenson were in another league - sharply focused characterisations alive
in every detail.
And, in the central role of Evan Strowde, Alan Howard gave an object-lesson
in every kind of projection. Every flick of his eyes, eyebrows, head, every
gesture or stab of his pencil conveyed the role's inner and outer lives.
Reading most of the role pianissimo, he always showed perfect mastery of
breath.
There's something burnt-out about Howard these days that adds an
exceptionally poignant restraint to his delivery. Using about five per cent
of his virtuoso technique, he dominated the endeavour, illumined the play,
and thrilled me to the marrow.
His Majesty was running at the St Brides Centre. It transfers to the Orange
Tree Theatre on September 3, where it runs until October 10

Joseph Mankiewicz's movie version of Anthony Shaffer's excellent thriller

FT  01 SEP 92 / Arts: Strauss and Messiaen - Salzburg Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS always risky to set out to produce a masterpiece, especially if you
are not sure what masterpiece it is going to be. That was more or less the
position of Richard Strauss and Hugo von Hofmannsthal after their triumph
with Der Rosenkavalier, 'their' Marriage of Figaro, when they decided to top
it with a grandiose, edifying fairy-tale opera which would be 'their' Magic
Flute.
That was Die Frau ohne Schatten (The Woman without a Shadow), about which
the first little problem was that nobody knew how the lighting-men were
going to arrange for the fairy-Empress to cast no shadow during most of
three long acts. In Gotz Friedrich's new Salzburg production, the soprano
Cheryl Studer had to keep shrinking into dusky corners and huddling against
the extreme sides of the Grosses Festspielhaus stage. Despite some lovely,
fluttery singing in the first act and a brave show of spirit in the third,
her character remained pallid, and no wonder.
As for the other half of the charmed couple without responsibilities
(shadowlessness equals childlessness), has any tenor since Jess Thomas made
a creditable fist of the Emperor? Thomas Moser made a careful, intelligent
attempt, but without beautiful tone in the high region where Strauss
exercises him most, there was always a sense of uphill struggle.
Of the complementary pair, though Robert Hale lent Barak the Dyer a sturdy
presence and a big baritone, full of sap and character, without the lyrical
smoothness and expansiveness to make the most of 'Mir anvertraut', the
opera's best number. As his surly, dissatisfied Wife, Eva Marton was
touching in mezzo-piano, but fiercely squally in forte: it was often
doubtful which note she meant to deliver.
It was left to Marjana Lipovsek as the malevolent Nurse - gorgeously sung,
and enhanced by an earthy sense of comic mischief that Hofmannsthal probably
never dreamed of - and Bryn Terfel's stentorian Spirit Messenger to fill out
their roles completely. Rolf Glittenberg's attractive sets were spacious,
uncluttered and old-fashioned enough at heart to answer to the authors'
prescriptions; but despite some flashy light-storms I thought Friedrich
simply failed to animate the action.
Heaven knows, the story is forced and awkward as it stands, and if tamely
walked through it makes a long and tedious narrative. Sir Georg Solti blew
up a magnificent storm in the pit, certainly, and the Vienna Philharmonic
must be the ideal orchestra for the piece (the many instrumental solos gave
great pleasure). Yet one pondered glumly whether this overweening opera can
really be revived: a few appealing tunes of 19th-century cut, an
unconscionable quantity of fluent, polytonal note-spinning and a lot of raw
theatrical noise, an ending protracted far beyond the point when nothing is
happening any more . . .
Olivier Messiaen's Saint Francois d'Assise was designed to be a masterpiece,
and Messiaen and everybody else knew exactly what he would be doing:
recycling all his familiar tropes on a grander scale than ever, as
devotional hagiography. At Salzburg, with two intervals, his eight 'scenes
franciscaines' took well over six hours.
There is nothing much like plot, nor anything remotely like development. It
would be bootless to argue whether or not St. Francois amounts to an
'opera'; it is a vast, unhurried aural spectacle, in which the solo voices -
Francis and several Brethren, an Angel and a Leper - sing gently and
deliberately in the interstices of the towering orchestral roars.
The latter were produced by the Los Angeles Philharmonic under Esa-Pekka
Salonen, with the utmost brilliance and panache. As the Saint, Jose van
Dam's serene dignity and authority were beyond praise; and rather like
Lipovsek with the Nurse in Die Frau, Dawn Upshaw brought a delectable sense
of celestial mischief to her Angel - and floated her dewy soprano to
perfection. Ronald Hamilton's Leper anguished robustly, and the contrasted
Brethren were cast from international strength: notably young Urban
Malmberg, Thomas Young and the evergreen Tom Krause.
Messiaen specified in elaborate detail just how the characters should be
dressed and behave. The director Peter Sellars wisely ignored most of that,
and staged St. Francois like a gigantic pop concert.
The show was visually dominated by a panoply of criss-crossing,
multi-coloured neon bars, often conforming to Messiaen's prescribed hues:
like Skryabin, the composer found deep significance in music-and-colour
correspondences. He did not pretend to generate drama where there was none,
but engineered a wealth of dazzling sights.
The set was hung and stacked with some three dozen television sets, multiply
showing images apparently filmed with a hand-held camera by a photographer
with severe palsy.
That was frequently distracting and irritating, though it did provide a lot
of birds for St. Francis to preach to; in particular, recurrent twitchy
views of a young man bearing a cross through rough terrain looked very Derek
Jarman, very indulgent.
Still, as a staging of a virtually unstageable 'opera', Sellars' work was a
kind of quixotic triumph.

FT  01 SEP 92 / Arts: A fickle world - Sponsorship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RODGER Broad is a popular man. He controls BT's arts sponsorship budget,
which at around Pounds 1.6m a year is the largest of any British company.
Naturally he attracts offers from arts organisations anxious to relieve him
of his cash - at least 50 proposals a week.
After almost 18 months in the job he has worked out a strategy. BT sponsors
the arts to improve its image, to show its customers, which embrace
virtually the entire population, that it is doing its bit to make life more
enjoyable. BT is not interested in boosting brand awareness; it is not too
concerned with corporate hospitality, although it does entertain at arts
events. It sees the arts as a generator of goodwill.
This controls Broad's decisions. Not for him the investment in Glyndebourne
or Covent Garden. His flagship sponsorships are events that cover the
nation, ideally reaching into the more obscure and neglected corners, and
involving consumers who have never before tried the arts. At the moment BT
supports two such arts activities, Northern Ballet Theatre, which brings
popular dance to medium-sized venues, and National Touring Exhibitions,
which under the control of London's South Bank, and with more than Pounds 1m
of BT's money over three years, takes art shows to small local galleries.
What makes Broad particularly attractive at the moment is that he is looking
for a third sponsorship in which to invest up to Pounds 200,000 a year. He
is concentrating his quest on the theatre and music, with the theatre the
favourite. Renaissance, Kenneth Branagh's touring company, is an obvious
candidate, but much depends on Branagh's availability and the ability of the
company to get along with BT. Broad seeks no artistic influence, but he
insists on well managed arts organisations, alive to PR and marketing
opportunities of mutual benefit.
Attached to the three flagships Broad envisages a fleet of ancillary
sponsorships in each field. Some are already in place - the controversial
New Contemporaries touring arts show, which should get BT support for at
least one more year, nicely compliments National Touring Exhibitions, while
standing in for the missing theatrical trail-blazer is the BT Biennial, the
creation by a successful author of a new play to be performed simultaneously
by about 70 amateur theatrical companies.
Broad came from BT's PR side. Until he took on his job he had never been to
the ballet. He is now an enthusiast. He reckons that if BT can ease more
first-timers into their local theatre or art gallery, he will have done his
bit for them and for BT. Some in the arts have taken exception to this
populist approach; the RSC was upset when BT failed to renew its sponsorship
of its small venues tour and instead put over Pounds 100,000 into Witness
for the Prosecution. Broad has no regrets. BT's money enabled the play to
visit more than 40 towns, many of which had never received a fully cast,
well staged, theatrical production.
BT's commitment to the arts seems set firm. The money comes from a total
community and charity budget fixed at a half of one per cent of profits,
which currently means Pounds 15m a year. The desired format is three big
touring sponsorships supplemented by lower profile ancillary help -
scholarships, management training, and the like. BT does not imagine that
its sponsorship of the arts will significantly alter the public's attitude
towards the company, but if it can expand the audience for the arts, it will
be happy enough.
* * * The nail biting starts soon for the RSC, as its agreement with its
biggest sponsor, Royal Insurance, which is worth Pounds 2.1m over three
years, approaches its natural end in 1993. Will the Royal renew ?
It has already done so once, and in the fickle world of arts sponsorship -
made even more fickle by the recession - a six year commitment is regarded
as par for the course.
But the Royal has done well out of the sponsorship, which has made its
chairman, Ian Rushton, the spokesman for corporate sponsors everywhere. Last
week the Royal contributed another Pounds 20,000. It is paying for 15
'signed' performances by the RSC which will enable deaf theatre lovers to
follow the show. It is also supplying an audio descriptive system to the
Barbican which gives a running commentary and enables the partially sighted
to enjoy the theatre that much more.
This extra help does not mean that the Royal will sign up for another three
years. Most likely it will support the Company into 1994, giving it time to
find another big backer. Despite the recession, the RSC has been successful
in attracting sponsors this year.
Unilever is supporting the Company for the first time, putting almost Pounds
50,000 behind the Kenneth Branagh Hamlet, which opens at the Barbican in
December. Meanwhile, two performances of the acclaimed Two Gentlemen of
Verona which arrives at the Barbican in October are being sponsored by the
Royal Mail, and one by AT&amp;T. * * * Since 1987 Digital, the computer company,
has been the main sponsor of the European Community Youth Orchestra,
investing Pounds 2.5m in what has become the finest, perhaps only, example
of the EC member countries working in complete harmony. Digital used the
ECYO to ease its way into Russia last December, and is currently supporting
it on a major European tour.
But after 1993 Digital will be looking elsewhere for a sponsorship vehicle.
This offers opportunities for a multinational to pick up the baton and
become associated with the best possible ambassadors in Europe, and for an
arts organisation, probably in visual arts, to attract the support of a
leading sponsor of the arts.
* * *
The Scottish Chamber Orchestra, which received Pounds 100,000 as the winner
of the Prudential Award for the Arts, is devoting the money to two projects
 -a specially commissioned music theatre work by James MacMillan, Visitatio
Sepulchri, yet another modern composition inspired by medieval religious
drama, to be presented at Glasgow's Tramway next May, and the revival of a
'Sang School' in the Border village of Ettrickbridge in October.

FT  01 SEP 92 / Arts: Welsh Symphony - London Promenade Concerts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY and ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sunday afternoon's Prom concert may have had a 'safe' programme, reasonable
enough for the family-slot in a Bank Holiday weekend, but it never sounded
like mere routine. Conducting the BBC Welsh Symphony, Tadaki Otaka was
freshly attentive to everything.
The longest piece was Max Bruch's G minor violin concerto, which has been
fading from the repertoire since the Second World War. Raphael Oleg
delivered it with searching affection, and complete command of its virtuoso
writing - in which he always found good musical sense; Otaka built up the
orchestral music to a grand Brahmsian scale. The central Adagio was both
poignant and imposing, as it should be. A worthy performance of this
concerto always makes one think that we ought to hear much more Bruch: it is
a pity that not much more Bruch actually lives up to this elevated standard.
Even the choice of concert-opener, Mendelssohn's familiar overture Calm Sea
and Prosperous Voyage, had an extra point here, for Elgar quotes it in the
penultimate variation of his 'Enigma' set which ended the concert.
There was another, more languishing seascape after the interval, when Ann
Murray sang Chausson's Poeme l'amour et de la mer+. She captured a sharp
sense of loss beyond well-bred feeling, almost persuading me that the darker
mezzo voice usually assigned to the piece is not strictly necessary;
meanwhile Otaka - and particularly his cellos - drew out Chausson's svelte
lines with assured poise.
Finally, the 'Enigma' Variations got a properly idiomatic performance,
emphasising both continuity and contrast: no sense of an old war-horse being
exercised, but rather of respectful, sympathetic rediscovery. Clearly, the
BBC Welsh orchestra is prospering with Otaka.
*****
Friday's concert in the Albert Hall was given over to the music of John
Adams. In the hierarchy of the proms such honours do not come the way of
many contemporary composers; that Adams was favoured is a measure of the
insidious popularity of his works and the brouhaha that has surrounded his
two operas, Nixon in China and The Death of Klinghoffer. Adams himself
conducted the London Sinfonietta whose director, Paul Crossley, was the
soloist in Eros Piano.
That piece, sandwiched between Shaker Loops and Grand Pianola Music, proved
the low point. Inspired by the music of Takemitsu it shows Adams' powers of
construction at their weakest, and its language of Skryabin, Berg and
Messiaen rechauffe at his flabbiest. At least Shaker Loops, which
established Adams as a distinctive voice in the 1980s, has stylistic
consistency and strength. There's a convincing integrity about the musical
material and a carefully plotted structure which owes more than a little to
Sibelius.
At least Adams is pleasantly unabashed about all these magpie tendencies,
consciously absorbing all the influences and allowing them to ferment. In
Grand Pianola Music they burst out in glorious profusion, throwing
19th-century triumphalism into the mix as well. The result is coarse-grained
 -there's nothing subtle about the scoring, and the big tune that caps the
second movement is irredeemably banal. But in this case it is done with some
panache and tongue firmly wedged into cheek; when Adams doesn't take himself
too seriously his music seems all the better for it.

FT  01 SEP 92 / P&amp;O unveils Channel battle plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
P&amp;O European Ferries, the biggest ferry operator between Britain and the
Continent, is to embark on an aggressive attempt to dominate the
cross-Channel market before the opening of the Channel tunnel next year.
It is to increase daily sailings on the Dover-Calais route by 20 per cent to
an unprecedented 25 each way, with departures every 45 minutes at peak
times.
The aim is to provide so many sailings that there will always be a P&amp;O
vessel loading on the berths at Dover and Calais. That means motorists would
be able to drive straight on to a P&amp;O ferry without having to queue.
The company will cut check-in times from 30 minutes to 20 minutes by
introducing a computerised port-handling system using machine-readable
tickets.
P&amp;O's strategy is aimed at increasing the appeal of its service ahead of the
opening of the Channel tunnel by improving speed and convenience. Heavy
investment in new vessels has also brought higher levels of comfort.
The company intends not only to defend its position against the tunnel but
to take market share from Sealink Stena Line, the other big ferry operator
on the Dover-Calais route.
The opening of the tunnel, scheduled for autumn next year, will bring
over-capacity and fierce competition on cross-Channel services. P&amp;O believes
only one ferry operator will survive.
The company has repeatedly tried to persuade the Department of Trade and
Industry to waive a Monopolies and Mergers Commission ruling and let it hold
merger talks with Sealink, but the department has replied that the opening
of the tunnel is still too far away.
Under its 1993 strategy, unveiled today, P&amp;O seems likely to have a
competitive edge over Sealink on the Dover-Calais route next year. It will
have more sailings (25, against 20 for Sealink); a higher peak-period
frequency (45 minutes, against 75 minutes); a shorter check-in time (20
minutes, against 30 minutes); and faster vessels, giving a shorter crossing
time (1 hour 15 minutes, against 1 hour 30 minutes).
Sealink has indicated that it has no intention of yielding to P&amp;O on the
Dover-Calais route. It has just emerged from an extensive restructuring,
which it says has given it a highly competitive cost base.
Both operators have been enjoying increases in passenger volumes of 20 per
cent to 25 per cent this year, largely because of the growing popularity of
self-drive holidays in France, the growth of short-break holidays and the
opening of Eurodisney.
Tariffs have risen beyond the rate of inflation, but many special offers for
individuals and discounts for tour operators have caused revenues to rise
less rapidly than the growth in volumes would suggest.

FT  01 SEP 92 / Government attacked on Land Travel collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government has come under fire for its failure to hold an inquiry last
year into the Land Travel holiday company in spite of warnings from the
company's auditors. The company collapsed just over a month ago.
Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour consumer affairs spokesman, yesterday published a
letter from Price Waterhouse, the company's accountants until August last
year, giving details of the heavy qualifications to the accounts they filed
in July 1991.
The accounts, for the six months to March 1991, recorded that the company's
liabilities exceeded its assets by Pounds 2.1m, and that Price Waterhouse
was not satisfied that Pounds 1.6m of debts and deferred expenditure was
recoverable.
The letter said: 'Our audit opinion is unambiguous and expresses very
clearly our concerns about the viability of the company.'
Soon after Land Travel collapsed, Baroness Denton, a junior minister at the
Department of Trade and Industry, confirmed that the DTI had some
discretionary powers to investigate cases if there was substantive
information giving good reason to do so.
Mr Griffiths - who is pressing for government compensation for the 40,000 to
50,000 people who lost money in the collapse - argued that the highly
critical comments filed with the Registrar of Companies amounted to
substantive information. 'It appears as though the DTI was asleep,' he said.
The DTI said that it would be logistically impossible to examine all the
thousands of accounts filed at Companies House. There was no mechanism for
highlighting those accounts that were particularly heavily qualified.
The department added that it had been unable to trace any complaints made to
it about Land Travel before its collapse, which could have acted as a
trigger for the exercise of the investigative powers.
The plight of would-be holidaymakers who lost money when the company failed
was worsened by the fact that Land Travel was not bonded by the Association
of British Travel Agents or the Bus and Coach Council.

FT  01 SEP 92 / Controversy crackles over the airwaves: Gary Mead on
arguments about how the BBC is being managed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR David Mellor, the minister responsible for the BBC, said this year that
he wished to see a wide-ranging debate about its future in advance of a
green paper on the corporation's future, due to be published this autumn.
Last week his wish was granted with a vengeance.
On Monday Sir David Attenborough, the naturalist and former controller of
BBC2, accused the government and the BBC of planning cost-cutting - not
officially substantiated - which amounted to 'suicide' or 'castration'.
On Friday Mr Michael Grade, chief executive of Channel 4 and former
controller of BBC1, attacked both the corporation's governors and senior
management. He accused them of 'brutalising' the corporation by a
'pseudo-Leninist style of management' whose approach to the government was
characterised by 'appeasement'.
Sandwiched by such attacks were suggestions that the BBC is facing its own
October Revolution. Among the rumours abounding were:
National radio networks 2 and 5 are to be axed.
Executives in both radio and television will soon be sacked
Sir Michael Checkland, the current director-general, is to step down several
months early to make way for Mr John Birt, his designated successor.
The BBC yesterday described such suggestions as 'wild speculations'.
Both Sir David and Mr Grade argued that their criticisms were inspired by a
desire to defend the BBC. Their anxiety is shared by current and former BBC
senior personnel. One described the condition of current management as that
of 'unholy confusion'.
Lord Nicholas Gordon Lennox, a BBC governor, took the highly unusual step at
the weekend of publicly defending both governors and management. 'I simply
do not recognise the picture painted by Michael Grade,' he said. He spoke of
the governors' 'inflexible intention to maintain everything that we believe
is best about the BBC'.
Underlying the sound and fury is gathering concern about the role of a
public-service broadcasting body and its funding in an era of squeezed
government finances and expanded competition from commercial television.
In May this year Mr Birt, BBC deputy director-general, won agreement from
the governors to redefine programme output and take it slightly up market.
That aim - to ensure the BBC provides something unique and does not compete
head-on with ITV and satellite channels - must be balanced with the
governors' determination that the BBC is not turned into an elitist ghetto.
Cutting across the debate about the content and style of BBC programming is
the question of the corporation's funding, currently by means of a
compulsory fee levied on all owners of television sets.
The green paper may contain clues to funding changes, in the context of
considering the larger issue of the basis for renewal of the BBC's charter
by the end of 1996.

FT  01 SEP 92 / London considers investor centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS FOR a promotion centre to 'sell' London and act as a 'one-stop shop'
for potential investors are under consideration by three of the capital's
authorities.
The City Corporation, Westminster City Council and the Docklands Development
Corporation have commissioned Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy and
management consultancy firm, to report on the viability of such a centre.
The CBI is also closely involved in the project.
If Coopers reported favourably, the centre could be in operation by the
start of next year.
Premises have already been secured and a blueprint for an arms-length
company to run the centre, with a private-sector chief executive, has been
drawn up.
The centre is expected to cost about Pounds 700,000 a year, met largely by
the three authorities in the first year but with growing contributions from
businesses and other London authorities in later years.
The move would complement the planned London Business Forum, which the
government proposes to set up later this year, as promised in the
Conservative election manifesto.
Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, will soon appoint the forum's
chief executive - expected to be a prominent industrialist - and has been
engaged in talks with the three authorities to ensure they do not compete
for the same functions and private-sector funding.
Mr David Weeks, leader of Westminster City Council, said: 'A one-stop shop
ought to be a valuable commercial resource. Coopers are looking at investors
in London over the past four years, and those who, while interested, failed
to invest.'
He added: 'The centre would be plugged into everything, from the London
property market and development scene through to arts and architecture.'
The City Corporation is particularly keen on the promotion side, after the
success of its architectural exhibition at the Royal Exchange.
It believes that a London-wide body with a full-time secretariat could also
deflect criticism over the absence of a strategic authority in London.

<TEXT>
SIXTH-form technology course in England and Wales are seriously inadequate
and needs to be reformed if the numbers of those proceeding to university
technology-based courses are not to continue declining, the Engineering
Council warns in a report published today.
It calls for technology A-level courses to be consistent with existing maths
and physics courses, and for a greater emphasis on practical application.
The report, written by Professor Alan Smithers of Manchester University, a
government curriculum adviser, says: 'The great difficulty with technology
at A-level is that hardly anyone seems to know what it is or how it is
expected to fit into the curriculum.'
It adds: 'It lacks any clear identity. Tortuous labels like Design and
Technology (Technology) and Design and Technology (Communication) not only
tend to get stuck on the tongue but leave the subjects largely unrecognised
in higher education.'
The council sets out an eight-point plan for reform.

INVESTMENT in the North Sea could total more than Pounds 18bn in the next
three years, a rise of 55 per cent over the past three years, according to
research by Arthur Andersen's Petroleum Services group.
Total output is likely to rise to 2.5m to 2.8m barrels of oil a day by 1995,
from 2.0m to 2.1m b/d this year. Government revenues are expected to be
about Pounds 12bn over the next three years.
Nine offshore fields are expected to start production this year, compared

A TOTAL of 50,000 women pensioners are unlikely to receive invalidity
benefit at the same level as men until the pension age is equalised,
although this may take many years, the government said yesterday.
The Department of Social Security is to challenge a ruling by the Social
Security Commission, the independent judicial body, that the government is
in breach of a European Community directive on equal treatment.
The commission ruled that the government discriminates against 60-year-old
women who face cuts in their invalidity benefit whereas men receive the full
amount until they are 65.

LLOYD'S of London has reported that 686 Names - the individuals whose assets
support underwriting in the insurance market - had resigned by last Friday.
It believed that the figure would be 1,600 by the end of the year.
The rate of resignation has showed a marked decline from last year, when
4,000 Names left the market. Lloyd's said this slowdown demonstrated a
returning confidence, but conceded it also reflected that those who were
doubtful about the market had resigned last year.

THE Institute of Directors has renewed its call for the Bank of England to
be made independent as a signal that the government is committed to low
inflation 'whatever happens to European monetary union', Daniel Green
writes.
In a letter to Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, Mr Peter Morgan, IoD
director-general, also called on the government to 'explain and sell its
strategy of long-term price stability to a society which has only known
inflated prices and unreal values'.
A list of recommendations to be included on 'an agenda for zero inflation'
include the scrapping of remaining controls on private housing rentals and
abandoning indexation in more areas of public spending.
The IoD said it regretted that nominal interest rates had not fallen with
inflation over the past year.

FT  01 SEP 92 / Banks want current accounts to pay their way: Customers have
grown used to a free-if-in-credit banking regime. But the sharp fall in loan
business during the recession means they are in for some changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR NEARLY a decade customers of the high street banks have been used to the
idea that current account services come free if they keep their accounts in
credit. This weekend the clearers indicated that they are considering
reintroducing some charges.
Mr Peter Radcliffe, banking director of Abbey National, one of the financial
institutions that pioneered the present free-if-in-credit current accounts,
believes that the end of this type of banking is less than three years away.
During the past two years the cost of current accounts to those who pay for
them - mainly customers with overdrafts - has been rising steadily. This
month for example, National Westminster will increase its quarterly
flat-rate fee for unauthorised overdrafts by 16 per cent, taking it to
Pounds 55 per quarter for overdrafts of more than Pounds 50.
This is typical of the way banks have been ratcheting up fixed-rate charges
on overdrafts for many months. They have also been keeping overdraft
interest rates at unprecedently high levels when rates generally have fallen
by a third.
In the summer of 1990 for example, the interest charge for an unauthorised
overdraft on Midland's Orchard account or a Firstdirect account was 37.6 per
cent. Today it is 37.4 per cent. Barclays' unauthorised overdraft rate has
risen from 35.4 per cent a year ago to 37.3 per cent.
Mr John Cheese, marketing director at Barclays, says: 'The fees for
unauthorised overdrafts are designed to be punitive. From the bank's point
of view it is not only that someone else is helping themselves to our money
 -overdrafts are also a very high risk form of lending.'
This does not entirely explain the steady upward march in overdraft charges.
Nationwide's FlexAccount, launched in 1987, had no charges until April 1990,
when it introduced fees of Pounds 10 for bouncing cheques and Pounds 7.50
for a warning letter. Since then the list of charges has grown steadily,
though only for customers with overdrafts.
In July this year Nationwide introduced a Pounds 10 monthly charge for
unauthorised overdrafts on top of a battery of charges introduced in June,
such as Pounds 6 for duplicate statements or stopping cheques. At the same
time it raised its cheque-bouncing charge to Pounds 20.
The charging system which emerged for current accounts in the 1980s has
become difficult for banks to sustain in the recession as their balance
sheets have been hit by bad debts. Consequently, customers with overdrafts
have been bearing a steadily heavier burden of bank charges.
The present charging structure dates back to the mid-1980s when the clearing
banks began to compete more fiercely between themselves for customers and
for the first time had to face a strong challenge from building societies
for current-account customers.
In 1984 Midland Bank introduced free-if-in-credit current accounts and the
other clearers followed suit. Three years later, with the launch of
Nationwide's FlexAccount, the market had its first interest-bearing,
mass-market current account. This, and the interest-bearing current account
launched by Abbey National the following year, swiftly picked up 1m
customers each.
To defend their customer bases, the high street banks felt obliged to offer
their own interest-bearing current accounts. In January 1989 Lloyds led the
way and the others soon followed. Although their interest-bearing current
accounts were launched alongside old-style accounts, customers swiftly
realised what they were missing out on.
The arrival of the new generation of interest-bearing current accounts on
top of free-if-in-credit banking meant that the banks were paying interest
on accounts that were totally free to customers. The only category of
customers who paid anything were those with overdrafts. The new accounts
carried much steeper overdraft charges than before.
By paying interest on current accounts, banks were deprived of their main
source of current-account income - the interest earned by lending money in
current accounts out at commercial rates of interest.
So, for example, Lloyds estimates that 70 per cent of its current-account
customers never pay any charges, while about 55 per cent have
interest-bearing current accounts.
The squeeze on the banks has been made harder by a sharp fall in the volumes
of their business because of the recession. This leaves them with high fixed
costs on their current-account operations, exacerbated by increased bad
debts from lending in the boom years of the 1980s. Meanwhile lending
activity - the side of their business from which their profits come in
normal times - has shrunk.
Mr Phil Nunnely, assistant general manager of retail banking at Lloyds,
says: 'The banks' asset books are declining and their net interest income
with it. So the banks are attacking the problem in two ways. One is to look
very closely at their own cost bases and find ways of improving costs, while
the other is to find means to boost their fee income.'
One way forward would be to charge the customers whom the banks find most
expensive, those who keep only small amounts of money in their accounts but
make a large number of transactions.
So far Halifax, the largest building society, has been the only large
financial institution to grasp this nettle. Two years ago it introduced a
charge for its 3.6m Cardcash account customers. They pay 60p each time they
use a cash machine which does not belong to the society. Earlier this year
it went further and introduced some transaction charges for Cardcash
customers who keep less than Pounds 250 in their accounts.
None of the clearing banks has yet done anything like this, but they have
noted with interest that there was no tidal wave of complaints from Halifax
customers about the charges.
Banks have found various other ways of enhancing their income. For example a
customer who takes out a loan today will almost certainly come under at
least mild pressure to take out an insurance policy guaranteeing that it
will be paid back - so ensuring that the bank gets a second stream of income
from the premiums. People running small businesses are especially likely to
find that any loan is conditional on buying insurance.
The clearers have also quietly done research into the views of customers on
possible methods of paying for current accounts. Their surveys tell them
that most people would prefer a flat monthly charge over the return of
transaction fees.
One banker says: 'Banks could say to their customers that their current
account would provide them with a monthly statement, a cheque book and five
transactions free and thereafter a monthly charge of Pounds 2 a month.'
So a two-step approach, beginning with charges for customers who do not keep
a minimum of money in their accounts, followed by quarterly charges, seems
to be under consideration.
Some banks are examining possible 'sweeteners' - services for their
wealthiest customers in return for charges. One possibility being examined
by more than one high street clearer is a telephone service, modelled on
Firstdirect, Midland's telephone banking arm. The plans under consideration
would enable wealthy individuals to by-pass the bothersome business of doing
all their banking through a branch during working hours.

FT  01 SEP 92 / Builders set up teams to seek failed rivals' work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH builders anxious to increase their revenue are establishing task
forces to bid for contracts left unfinished by failed rivals.
Contractors say competition among 'ambulance chasers' is growing, as
opportunities to win work through conventional tendering have declined in
the recession.
Try Group, a contractor and housebuilder, estimates that about a third of
its order book has been acquired from receivers of failed builders. The
company last year generated pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.2m on sales of
Pounds 114m.
Tarmac has established a special team to pursue contracts on unfinished
projects. It seeks to renegotiate terms with customers or financing banks
rather than to acquire the original contract from the receivers.
Construction companies that have competed against Try to acquire unfinished
contracts from receivers include Amec, Wimpey, Beazer, Raine Industries,
Sunley and Ward Group.
Mr Peter Howell, Try's managing director, said: 'There are risks in pursuing
this kind of work. You do not want to take over a project which was the
cause of the original developer or main contractor going into receivership.
'Speed is important to maintain commercial confidence in a project.
Decisions on whether to make a bid are usually made within two to three
days.'
Margins on unfinished contracts are often greater than on work from
conventional tendering - mainly because any money owed by the client for
previous work is paid to the company taking over the job, rather than to the
re-ceiver.
Mr Howell said: 'Most contracts won through normal tendering are lucky if
they do much more than cover overheads in the present depressed climate. By
comparison we would expect work from receivers to generate average margins
of between 3 per cent and 5 per cent - provided you have got everything
right.'
During the past 12 months the company has paid Pounds 1.6m to acquire
construction contracts worth Pounds 28m from receivers. This included Pounds
14m of work from the failed Isis and Pakefield construction companies.
Mr Howell said that the company was very pleased with business it had won
and would be looking to build on this success.

FT  01 SEP 92 / Rise in digger sales expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MARKET for hydraulic excavators, one of the most volatile sectors in
construction equipment, should experience a slow increase in demand in the
next five years after a difficult 18 months.
According to a report by Corporate Intelligence Group, the London-based
analysts, a neutral Budget in March, followed by the Conservatives' general
election victory, increased customer and supplier optimism.
It says: 'The outlook for the economy would appear to be for slow, but
gradual growth over the next two to three years, and this should lead to
general demand in growth for new excavators.'
The report adds: 'There is still the belief that when growth in the economy
is assured, probably in 1993, the UK will be in for another boom period,
because in the previous three years demand was low.'
The hydraulic excavator market fell from a record 3,815 units in 1988 to
1,460 last year, with factors such as the Gulf war and political uncertainty
reducing customer confidence.
The group says demand might edge up slightly this year to 1,540 units, but
this would not be enough to restore the majority of equipment suppliers to
economic health. On a brighter note, it forecasts the market could expand to
2,450 units by 1995.
The report says Komatsu of Japan took over market leadership from
Fiat-Hitachi in 1990. Komatsu has been the biggest beneficiary of the
decline in JCB's hydraulic-excavator sales since 1989, it says, but will
face greater competition this year from JCB's crawler-excavator joint
venture with Sumitomo Construction Machinery.

FT  01 SEP 92 / CBI sees end to wage-price spiral
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN is in a strong position to break the wage-price spiral that has
undermined previous recoveries, according to the Confederation of British
Industry.
Mr Robbie Gilbert, CBI director of employment affairs, said yesterday that
only one-in-three UK employers was quoting the cost of living as an
important upward pressure on pay. During the past year one-in-four
settlements was at or below 3.5 per cent and a similar number between 3.5
per cent and 4.5 per cent.
He added that pay settlements were ahead of inflation as the UK entered the
recession and the latest evidence from the CBI's pay databank showed that
business factors were now the most important determinants of pay.
Yet Britain's two main independent pay research groups, Incomes Data
Services and Industrial Relations Services, both publish reports today
saying the link between pay and inflation remains central.
IDS says: 'Not only do most private-sector employers report that the rate of
change in the cost of living is a very important factor in decisions on pay,
but inflation protection is still quite explicitly built into a number of
major pay settlements'.
IRS has found that a majority of employers plan a further reduction in pay
rises in the next year.
A poll of 280 employers indicates that the average settlement will fall from
the current plateau of 4.3 per cent to between 3 per cent and 4 per cent.
About a quarter of employers plan to give the same rise as last year and
only one in 20 plans a pay freeze. The most important upward pressures on
pay are labour productivity and inflation.

FT  01 SEP 92 / Economic roots of French 'non' psychology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXTRAPOLATING historical trends into the future is a risky business, as many
economic forecasters have discovered over the past year. But if the past
fortnight's shift in French opinion polls continues up to the referendum,
then most European interest rates will rise in less than three weeks. Europe
will wave goodbye to the Maastricht treaty, and quite possibly the exchange
rate mechanism too.
Why have the French apparently become so disenchanted with the Maastricht
treaty? Certainly, the French have a habit of inflicting embarrassing
surprises on their leaders from time to time. German unification, and the
subsequent crop of racial attacks in the eastern Lander, may have revived
painful memories in French minds. But there is also an economic cause.
France remains gripped by a sense of economic malaise, provoked by years of
high interest rates, slow growth and high unemployment, of which this
summer's strikes and riots are symptoms. Last week's economic data provided
more unwelcome news for the pro-Maastricht lobbyists. Seasonally adjusted
unemployment remained unchanged at 10.3 per cent in July, while gross
domestic product grew by a mere 0.1 per cent in the second quarter of this
year. Economists at Insee, the French national statistics office have
revised down their GDP growth forecast from 2.5 per cent to 2.2 per cent in
1992.
But hold on. Output in the UK economy is still falling after two years of
recession, the US is struggling to manage anything more than a meagre
recovery and Japan is also slowing fast. French growth of 2.2 per cent this
year does not look too bad in comparison.
The French economy has, in fact, done a surprisingly good job of shrugging
off the recessionary forces of the past year. The OECD's leading indicator
index, an amalgam of interest rates, share prices, business surveys and
other forward-looking statistics, is designed to predict movements in
industrial output by about six months. But French output has stubbornly
refused to follow the indicators' pessimistic forecast, as the chart shows.
Output has fallen in the last two months, but has performed better than in
the other main industrialised countries since last year.
France's problem is not no growth this year but slow growth over the past
half-decade. The government's policy of competitive disinflation within the
ERM has reduced French inflation to the lowest European levels but at a high
price in terms of persistent unemployment and lost output. French output
rose by 13 per cent between 1985 and 1990, compared to 17 per cent in
Germany, 18 per cent in Italy and 28 per cent in Japan. The OECD calculates
that the trend rate of growth of French industrial output was a modest 1 per
cent a year in the 1980s, the slowest of the six largest industrialised
countries.
The pain may soon be over. The main obstacle to French growth remains high
German interest rates. But Germany's leading indicators suggest a sharp fall
in output is in the pipeline. With German inflation also falling, the threat
of recession will eventually force the Bundesbank to cut its rates.
And after the pain, the gain: French hands may also be on Europe's monetary
tiller before long if the move to monetary union continues as planned.
Unless, that is, the French vote no and the prospect of Emu fades. All the
sacrifices of the last few years will then have been in vain.

FT  01 SEP 92 / Daniel Ludwig, the invisible billionaire: Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Daniel Ludwig, the reclusive shipowner and property developer who died of
heart failure at his Manhattan apartment last Thursday, was, in many
respects, an archetypal US billionaire.
Although Mr Ludwig was regularly described in later life as one of the
world's richest men and had interests ranging from hotels in the Caribbean
to coal mines in Australia, his origins were fairly modest.
He was born in 1897, in the small port town of South Haven, on Lake
Michigan, to a family closely linked to the shipping business.
Daniel Ludwig quit high school after eighth grade, and quickly followed this
example. He persuaded his father to lend him Dollars 5,000 (Pounds 2,510)
which was spent converting an old steamer into a barge. This became the
first of a fleet of vessels which Ludwig used to ply wood and molasses up
the shipping channels.
In 1921, he acquired his first ocean-going vessel, and by 1930 had moved
into shipping oil.
In 1936 the foundations of his business empire were laid when he hit on a
financing arrangement, whereby oil companies would charter tankers for
future oil deliveries while he used the charters as collateral to borrow
money to build the tankers.
By the end of the second world war he owned the nation's fifth largest
tanker fleet. He leased a shipyard in Japan, and started to roll out
supertankers.
By the 1960s Ludwig's business empire was becoming more diversified. At one
stage, he bought up 4m acres of Brazilian rain forest and planted gmelina -
a fast-growing tree, native to India - for pulp and lumber. He also added
hotels, coal operations, and various financial interests - including
investments in four thrifts now managed by the Resolution Trust Company.
He sold his Princess Hotel group to Mr Tiny Rowland between 1979 and 1981
for about Dollars 200m.
His personal life was equally complex. He divorced his first wife in 1937
after nine years of marriage, but refused to acknowledge her daughter as his
own. He married again later that year, but the second marriage produced no
children.
Mr Ludwig refused to be photographed for 20 years, relenting in 1985.
He always said he did not care what the world thought of him, though some
suggest that he found it more convenient to conduct business away from
prying eyes.
Despite this reclusiveness, Ludwig could not escape a reputation for being
tight-fisted - he was reknowned for taking commercial flights and walking to
work - and crusty.
He gave up talking to journalists in the 1960s, and a biography published in
1986 was appropriately titled The Invisible Billionaire.

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TENSIONS in Italy's Socialist party have continued to mount as more senior
party members have objected to the campaign by the party newspaper Avanti]
against the magistrates leading the political corruption investigation in
Milan.
The Avanti] attacks, inspired by Socialist party leader Mr Bettino Craxi,
have focused on Mr Antonio Di Pietro, the best known of the judges examining
the scandal, in which numerous Socialist politicians have been implicated.
The attacks have caused difficulties for Mr Giuliano Amato and Mr Claudio
Martelli, respectively Italy's premier and justice minister, senior members
of the Socialist party. The two have been widely criticised for taking part
in a party meeting in Rome last week, at which Mr Craxi discussed his
objections to the Milan investigations. Both men said they were not present
for that part of the meeting.
Separately, the inquiry is due to take a new turn this week, with the
appearance today before magistrates of Mr Giuseppe Garofano, the deputy
chairman of Ferruzzi Finanziaria, one of Italy's biggest private-sector
holding companies. Mr Garofano, summoned to explain unspecified political
donations, is expected to be one of a number of industrialists to be asked
to testify before magistrates.

FT  01 SEP 92 / Panic faces confidence vote: Serbs' move could jeopardise
Geneva peace conference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BELGRADE, SARAJEVO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE political future of Yugoslav prime minister Milan Panic yesterday hung
in the balance after a no-confidence vote was tabled in the federal
parliament.
A vote of no confidence would jeopardise the continuation of United
Nations/European Community-sponsored peace talks on the former Yugoslavia
which start this week in Geneva. Such a vote would also strengthen Serbian
nationalist extremists in the rump Yugoslavia.
A western diplomat yesterday said: 'It is a question of whether it was just
a warning shot across the bow or signals the end of Panic.'
The motion followed a bitter public row between the Belgrade-born California
businessman and Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic at the London
conference last week.
The vote of no confidence was supported by 68 parliamentary deputies from
the ruling Socialist party and its satellite Serbian Radical party, whose
ultranationalist leader, Mr Vojislav Seselj, commands a paramilitary wing.
Known as Mr Milosevic's favourite politician, Mr Seselj yesterday said all
30 members of his party backed the motion. According to parliamentary rules,
the no-confidence motion will be debated in three days. Parliament is
dominated by supporters of Mr Milosevic since the opposition in May
boycotted elections.
The deputies accused Mr Panic of going beyond his mandate at the London
conference.
The Yugoslav prime minister had called for talks with ethnic Albanian
leaders on the southern Serbian province of Kosovo. He also angered Serbs by
calling for the recognition of Croatia. He has pledged to end ethnic
cleansing in Serbia, where non-Serbs make up a third of the 9.8m population.
A delegation of 200 Serbs from Kosovo yesterday demanded to see Mr Panic
because of 'his ambiguous position on the status of Kosovo', in what was
clearly a co-ordinated attack. Mr Panic has vowed to lift United Nations
sanctions and revive the collapsing economy in what is left of Yugoslavia,
the truncated federation of Serbia and Montenegro. Deputies from Montenegro
yesterday opposed the vote of no-confidence.
Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the Portuguese foreign secretary, said the Geneva
conference could be the last chance for a settlement before the
international community was forced to intervene militarily.
The Bosnian government said yesterday its forces had broken out of a
four-month Serb siege of Gorazde and were mopping up pockets of Serb
fighters, Reuter adds from Sarajevo. Mr Ejup Ganic, a presidency member,
said fighting was still raging outside the Moslem town 60km south-east of
Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, after about 100 Bosnian defenders had pierced
Serb lines. There was no independent confirmation of his claim.

Norway's borrowing requirement over the next four years could be as high as
NKr80bn (Pounds 7.2bn) to finance a growing budget deficit, the central bank
said yesterday, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo. Mr Kjell Storvik, deputy
governor, said the state would extend one five-year and one seven-year
benchmark bond, and would issue a big new 10-year benchmark bond in
mid-October. Mr Storvik refused to be drawn on details of the bonds.

has already shut down production there, forcing GM to close two car assembly
plants. Late on Friday, UAW leaders at the second Lordstown plant, a smaller
car assembly factory, authorised strike action within five days.

EMBATTLED Brazilian President Fernando Collor has gone on the attack with a
broadcast to the nation in which he pleaded his innocence of massive
corruption charges and made clear that he will continue resisting all
pressure to resign.
'Those who think they can prematurely end my mandate as president are
fooling themselves,' he insisted in his first nationwide address since the
end last week of a three-month congressional investigation which accused him
of involvement in a multi-million-dollar corruption scheme.
Mr Collor's defiance means there will be no early end to the crisis. His
insistence on staying in power caused the stock markets to open 4.6 per cent
down. The main Sao Paulo index finished above its lowest, 6.7 per cent down.
Denying the charges, Mr Collor admitted erring, but said: 'We all make
mistakes. Mine was to underestimate the intentions of profiteers.'
He attacked rivals in Congress for blocking his modernisation programme,
accusing them of trying to 'sabotage my mandate in 10 days when 558 days was
not sufficient for them to approve legislation to modernise the port
system'. He said his mandate would not be over until all his projects had
been passed.
Mr Collor's defiant speech came amid mounting pressure from within his own
government to oust him, new charges against the first lady, and the
emergence of further evidence linking him to Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, the
businessman accused of masterminding the racketeering scheme.
Last night three senior ministers - Mr Marclio Marques Moreira (economy),
justice minister Mr Celio Borja and Mr Jorge Bornhausen, the president's
political co-ordinator - met amid reports that they might quit, but later
said they intended to stay on.
Mr Bornhausen had said he was considering resigning because of the
president's refusal to incorporate in his speech suggestions from the
Liberal Front, the main pro-government party.
Reactions to the address were generally negative. 'It was too little too
late,' said Mr Bolivar Lamounier, a political scientist.
A formal request for impeachment will be made this afternoon to Mr Ibsen
Pinheiro, president of Congress. Opposition leaders say they already have
more than the 336 votes necessary for the process to be admitted.

FT  01 SEP 92 / Hungary expects recession to worsen

<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HUNGARY'S recession is proving far deeper and more prolonged than expected,
according to a new batch of gloomy official forecasts.
The National Bank of Hungary, the central bank, is now braced for a fall of
5 per cent in gross domestic product this year, a drastic revision of its
original forecast of zero growth. Unemployment, currently just below 11 per
cent, is set to rise to 17-20 per cent next year, a government report to
parliament warns.
Expectation that output will continue to fall, after declines of 4 and 10.2
per cent in 1990 and 1991, is increasing pressure to stimulate the economy
while at the same time depriving the government of the budgetary means to do
so.
The government blames falling output on the wave of company failures
triggered by this year's new bankruptcy act. Another unforeseen dampener on
demand has been the rapid growth in personal savings, which rose to a ratio
of 14.3 per cent of income last year.
The growth in savings and the banks' reluctance to lend has boosted
liquidity and prompted a precipitate fall in interest rates. A three-month
treasury bill auction last week yielded an average 16.55 per cent, down from
35 per cent a year ago.
This has led to hopes that lower interest rates will stimulate
investment-led growth. The first tentative signs of that came last week with
the announcement of a 3.9 per cent rise in industrial production in June
from May.
The severity of the recession however is crippling the government's efforts
to contain the budget deficit within limits demanded by the International
Monetary Fund. Shortfalls in tax revenues and extra spending on unemployment
threaten to push this year's budget deficit to Ft220bn (Pounds 1.4bn), up to
8 per cent of GDP.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Ray MacSharry, the EC's Irish agriculture commissioner, has decided to
step down when the current Commission's four-year term expires at the end of
December, increasing the likelihood of a thorough shake-up in Brussels.
Naming his successor will be tricky for Dublin, where Mr Albert Reynolds'
coalition government will be constrained by its one-seat majority as it
searches for a commissioner who will wield comparable Irish influence.
Mr MacSharry's decision means three members of the 17-strong Commission are
now certain to be replaced, but the number of departures could rise to 10.
This could clear the way for a regrouping of functions, as well as a
reshuffle of portfolios. Commission president Jacques Delors wants to
streamline the Brussels executive, officials close to him say, but, like
much else in the EC, such plans depend on the outcome of the French
referendum on Maastricht.
Mr MacSharry, 54 and twice a finance minister under Mr Charles Haughey, was
asked to stay on by Mr Reynolds. But on Saturday he announced he was
retiring from public life altogether, as he has long insisted he would,
despite constant speculation he wished to return to Irish politics and
challenge Mr Reynolds for the premiership.
Mr MacSharry this May steered through the most radical overhaul of the
Common Agricultural Policy in its 30 years.
Obstinate and canny, with thorough mastery of a complicated brief, Mac the
Knife - as he was known in Ireland when he resolved a national debt crisis
with draconian budget cuts - persuaded farm ministers of the 12 into
accepting a package all of them had rejected as unthinkable.
His tactics also drew the US much closer to the EC position on farm subsidy
cuts in the Uruguay Round world trade liberalisation negotiations, although
a conclusion to the long-stalled round is now more likely under his
successor.
Favourites to replace him in the Commission - though not in the same
portfolio - are Ms Maire Geoghegan-Quinn, transport and communications
minister, Mr Padraig Flynn, justice minister, and Mr Michael Woods, minister
for the marine.
Ms Geoghegan-Quinn, 42, is the favourite. But the Fianna Fail-led coalition
fears her Dail seat would be lost in a by-election, bringing down the
government. Mr Reynolds already faces a rough autumn, as jobless totals
mount, an abortion referendum approaches, and the public inquiry into
government and party relations with the beef industry, which resumes this
week, dredges up more controversy.

FT  01 SEP 92 / Hard issues at non-aligned talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) today begin a six-day summit in
Jakarta which, following the end of the cold war, finds the founding
principle of the organisation to be in question.
Moreover, the delegates - including about 60 heads of state - will also find
themselves caught between the movement's traditional determination to
achieve consensus and the increasing difficulty of disregarding sensitive
issues of concern to its 108 members.
As pressing and dividing as any issue is the former Yugoslavia, which
chaired the movement until Indonesia assumed the post last Friday. While a
delegation from Serbia and Montenegro will attend claiming to represent
Yugoslavia, there will also be seats for separate delegations from
Bosnia-Hercegovina, Croatia and Slovenia.
Some NAM members, led by Malaysia, Saudi Arabia and Iran have condemned
Belgrade for the plight of the Moslems in Bosnia-Hercegovina while Mr Haris
Silajdzic, the Bosnian foreign minister, said that since the NAM was founded
to 'defend and help weak countries' then: 'if it doesn't punish Yugoslavia.
. .it has deviated from its original goal'.
However, Mr Farouk Khadoumi, Palestine's foreign minister, argued that 'The
debate about the Yugoslav issue is a waste of time. Let the United Nations
decide on the issues.'
Foreign minsters discussed the issue acrimoniously over the weekend, but
agreed only to postpone a decision on Yugoslavia's status until a further
meeting in New York on September 15.
For critics of the NAM, originally founded by countries determined to
promote foreign policies independent of the superpowers, such a decision was
typical of the movement's weaknesses. 'The movement strives to reach
consensus on foreign policy, but to do so it often fails to address major
world issues', said one western diplomat.
Where consensus is reached, moreover, the movement sometimes invites the
charge of hypocrisy. For example, a proposed declaration on the protection
of basic human rights is likely to be supported by the Yugoslav delegation
and other unlikely proponents such as President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire.
One issue likely to attract consensus is the proposal to restructure the UN
 -of which NAM countries account for about two-thirds of the membership -
and an expansion of the Security Council to limit the influence of the US.
Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous country, is also pushing for a
new approach to the economic relationship between developing and
industrialised nations. Many delegates have arrived warning that the
marginalisation of developing countries has bred a feeling of humiliation
which lies behind much of the world's armed conflict and terrorism.
President Suharto said recently the relationship between developing and
industrialising nations 'should not be haunted by an atmosphere of
confrontation'. He has stressed Indonesia's record - two decades of 6 per
cent annual GDP growth - has been achieved with an open economic policy,
even while arguing for the structure of international trade to be reformed.

FT  01 SEP 92 / Peres says Palestinians must limit demands

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, yesterday criticised the
Palestinian approach to Middle East peace talks, saying there would be no
progress unless they accepted limits to the scope of self-government in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Speaking shortly before the two sides opened their second week of
negotiations in Washington, Mr Peres said the Palestinians were seeking
sovereign powers while the agreed structure of the talks envisaged only
limited Palestinian self-rule during an interim stage.
'They have to come to terms with reality,' Mr Peres said. 'We are not
talking about independence. We are talking about self-government in the
territories for five years. This should be a sort of trial period which will
enable all of us. . .time to reach a permanent solution. The attempt to make
out of an interim self-government proposal a permanent solution is in vain,'
he told the Financial Times.
He added that the self-government proposals tabled by Israel last week - and
immediately attacked as inadequate by the Palestine Liberation Organisation
 -represented 'more of a risk' for Israel than for the Palestinians.
After yesterday's round of negotiations in Washington, Mrs Hanan Ashrawi,
the Palestinian spokeswoman, said that there were two sets of incompatible
proposals on the table. 'In a sense there is a deadlock and we are trying to
find a way out of it,' she said.
She added that the Israeli negotiating team had been told that its proposals
for self-government were not acceptable. However Mr Yossi Gal, the Israeli
spokesman, would only admit to 'a certain frustration' and said that he did
not want to characterise the situation as 'deadlocked'.
The foreign minister, one of the most 'dovish' members of Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin's government, was echoing frustration among ministers that
their peace overtures since taking office in July, such as curbing Jewish
settlements in the occupied territories, have elicited little response from
the Arab side.
Yesterday, Israeli authorities began releasing 600 of the thousands of
Palestinian prisoners held by Israel as part of a number of goodwill
gestures announced to coincide with the Washington talks. The army also
opened up some of the thousands of streets in West Bank and Gazan towns
previously sealed in retaliation against the Palestinian intifada, or
uprising.
Palestinians complained that the Israeli proposals contained nothing about a
withdrawal of Israeli troops and offered no real control over their own land
during the interim stage. They want to elect a governing authority with full
legislative powers. Israel has conceded elections for a council covering the
West Bank and Gaza, but wants to limit its size and restrict its powers to
that of a local authority.

UN WEAPONS inspectors returned to Iraq yesterday stressing that the
imposition last week by the US, Britain and France of an air exclusion over
the south of the country would not affect their work.
Aircraft from the US and Britain continued to patrol the area south of the
32nd parallel yesterday with no indication from the Baghdad regime that it
was prepared to challenge the new allied restrictions. French Mirage 2000
jets are due to join the patrols today.
The so-called 'no-fly' zone was imposed officially to protect the Shia
population from intensified attacks by the regime of President Saddam
Hussein, but some US officials concede that it is part of an overall
strategy to topple the Iraqi leader.
These officials had expected the previous UN weapons team to challenge the
Iraqi regime's refusal to permit inspections of government ministries, in
defiance of Security Council resolutions. Reports from Washington had
suggested President Bush would have been prepared to order air strikes to
ensure compliance.
However, no request was made to search a government ministry and the weapons
inspection team left Baghdad without incident.
Mr Maurizio Zifferero, the Italian who heads the new team, said on arrival
in Baghdad yesterday that his policy was 'not to be the cause of
provocation'.
He declined to say where the team would be carrying out its searches for
more evidence of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, but added: 'If this
visit is quiet and fruitful, it will be a success.'
Reuter adds from New York: UN Security Council members are contemplating
possible action over Iraq's alleged harassment of UN guards after a bomb was
attached to a UN car in northern Iraq, diplomats said.
The bomb was found on a UN car on Friday after it had passed a government
checkpoint. The UN said harassment against its personnel continued yesterday
when the windscreens of two vehicles were smashed in Baghdad.

FT  01 SEP 92 / Canadians to vote on changes to constitution
</HEADLINE>

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S prime minister, Mr Brian Mulroney, is expected to call a national
referendum in the next few days, in the hope of speeding ratification of
proposals for a new national-unity constitution.
The constitutional proposals, the most sweeping since the formation of
Canada 125 years ago, have recently received two important endorsements.
Quebec's ruling Liberal party gave its overwhelming support to the package
at a special convention in Quebec City. In addition, the federal New
Democratic party, one of two national opposition parties, has decided to
campaign in favour of the proposals.
The most likely date for the referendum, which would be the third in
Canadian history, is October 26.
The only strident opposition to the constitutional package so far has come
from Quebec separatists. Before last weekend's Liberal party convention,
opinion polls showed Quebecois split almost evenly between supporters and
opponents of the deal, but with a large pool of undecided voters.
The constitutional proposals, settled at a meeting of federal and provincial
leaders on Prince Edward Island late last week, are a careful compromise
between Quebec and the rest of the country. No region or population group
has been able to claim that it is either an outright winner or loser.
Key elements of the package include converting the Senate, the upper house
of parliament, from an appointed to an elected body; guaranteeing Quebec at
least 25 per cent of seats in the House of Commons; granting a limited form
of self-government to aboriginal people; and transferring various powers
from federal to provincial jurisdiction.
Speculation is mounting that Mr Mulroney, prime minister since 1984, may
resign if he succeeds in pushing the constitutional package through a
referendum and ratification by the provincial legislatures.

FT  01 SEP 92 / The ins and outs of realignment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Why all the talk about a realignment of the European monetary system's
exchange rate mechanism?
In the past few weeks investors have switched funds out of dollars and into
D-Marks, weakening the values against the D-Mark of many of the other nine
ERM currencies. One way to ease the strain would be to revalue upwards the
D-Mark in the grid, devaluing the weaker currencies.
What's behind the D-Mark's strength?
The German Bundesbank has pushed up its short-term interest rates to their
highest levels since the 1930s, to damp unification-induced inflation. The
US's interest rates are extremely low, because it wants to help economic
recovery. The big difference between German and US borrowing rates has given
investors every reason to buy D-Marks.
What about the September 20 referendum in France on European economic and
monetary union?
If the French vote No, as seems possible, the current timetable for Emu will
be scuppered. If that happens there will be less external pressure on
European Community countries to keep government borrowing and inflation low.
In that case, expect large selling of the weaker ERM currencies, including
the Spanish peseta, the Portuguese escudo, the Italian lira and sterling.
Is a realignment really on the cards?
That depends on your vantage point. The EC finance ministers last Friday
ruled out a realignment. Germany is not seeking a D-Mark revaluation and the
other 11 ministers do not want to devalue against the D-Mark, because they
feel this would weaken their countries' long-term effort against inflation.
So is this the end of the story?
Possibly not. The last time, back in 1987, that the strong D-Mark exerted
such severe strains in the ERM on the other currencies, the pressure for a
realignment became irresistible.
What happened?
On January 12 1987 the EC was forced to recognise that large central bank
intervention to depress the D-Mark, chiefly against the weak French franc,
would not work. Politicians arranged a realignment in which the D-Mark, the
Belgian franc and the guilder were all revalued upwards against the other
currencies. Britain was not involved because it joined the ERM only in 1990.
Right now, are there any other factors to worry about?
In several European countries - particularly France, Italy and Britain  -
economic activity is weak, yet interest rates remain high because of the
tight credit policies of the Bundesbank. According to some economists a
devaluation of these countries' currencies might allow them to cut interest
rates to spur growth.
So why doesn't Europe just go ahead and realign?
Governments are worried that any move to devalue would be punished by the
markets. Investors might think that, having devalued once, these countries
might do it again. As a result, interest rates might have to go up, rather
than down, because of the extra 'risk premium' that investors demand for
holding specific currencies.
What's likely to happen?
EC governments will do all in their power to keep talk of realignment out of
the markets until September 20, when the outcome of the French referendum
will be known. If further pressures build up in the ERM in the meantime,
expect large central bank intervention to sell D-Marks for other currencies
and hold the line.
What's the Bundesbank's position?
The German central bank would not be averse to a realignment, as a stronger
D-Mark would strengthen its anti-inflation drive. It might be in a position
to press Chancellor Helmut Kohl to accept the case for a revalued D-Mark on
the grounds that the Bundesbank might then be able to cut interest rates
more quickly.
What difference is there between now and 1987?
Then, France wanted Germany to revalue its currency against the French
franc, because the franc was suffering so much selling pressure. Now, France
is firmly against any change in the franc's parity against the D-Mark
because it has made good progress at pushing down inflation to German
levels.
What about the other countries?
If the markets did force a realignment, there is a strong chance of a
'two-speed' ERM developing. Countries such as Belgium, the Netherlands and
Denmark - whose currencies are regarded in the markets as strong and which
have generally kept their values against the D-Mark - might be prepared to
accept a realignment, so long as their currencies were moved up with the
German currency.
Where would Britain stand?
Along with Italy, Spain and Portugal, Britain might have to devalue against
all the other countries. However, one way for the UK to avoid losing face
might be for it to move at the same time to a narrow 2.25 per cent band
instead of its current 6 per cent band, thus helping to improve confidence
in sterling on the markets.
And France?
Expect some creative economics. France might be able to persuade Germany
that its currency should be regarded as 'strong' - and so should have the
same kind of upward revaluation as the D-Mark in any realignment - even
though the French franc itself has recently been under pressure.
What could help the EC ministers out of their plight?
A big Yes vote by the French would reduce the ERM tensions. If that fails to
happen, watch out for more currency fireworks.

FT  01 SEP 92 / Bundesbank warns Bonn on federal debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SENIOR Bundesbank official warned at the weekend that the central bank's
clamp on monetary policy would achieve little in the long run if the German
government and wage negotiators failed to control federal debt and pay
increases.
Mr Otmar Issing, a member of the central bank's policy-making council, told
a symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, that rising government debt would
sooner or later lead to higher taxation. This would push up prices and
inflation.
Speaking at the end of a week of turmoil in world money markets and
widespread criticism of the Frankfurt policy-makers - notably from the US -
Mr Issing presented a stout defence of the bank's policy and independence.
'A lastingly high rate of economic growth cannot be achieved through large
budget deficits and a passive monetary policy which tries to keep central
bank interest rates low,' he said.
Democratic fiscal policies, driven by political processes, had a tendency to
generate excessive government debt. There was a need for the central bank to
provide a counterweight: to try 'to contribute to a low and sustainable
level of government debt, as part of its stability mandate'.
Although Mr Issing did not name either the Bundesbank or the German
government in his speech, his aim was unmistakably to stiffen the resolve of
the German Finance Ministry. He made only passing references to the dangers
of wage inflation, hitherto the prime concern of the Bundesbank.
The ministry, run by Mr Theo Waigel, has promised strict budgetary controls
and reduced subsidies.
The target is an average 2.5 per cent nominal growth in federal spending
until the end of 1995. He, in turn, has also asked the largely independent
state governments to limit their expenditure growth to 3 per cent.
Firm projects put forward so far by Bonn, including a scheme to save DM11bn
(Pounds 3.9bn) on the health service this year and a DM5bn cut in the
federal labour office's subsidy, have run into powerful opposition from the
medical profession and drugs makers as well as civil servants in the labour
office.
Meanwhile, a handful of state governments have said they need to reduce
administrative payrolls, while others are examining the possibility of
raising further revenue through increased taxes on drinks, entertainment,
tourism and even prostitution.
A bank policy which was aimed at promoting capital formation and growth must
be highly credible, reliable and predictable, Mr Issing said.
'Attempted deception and stop-go policies aimed at short-term demand effects
are the best way of undermining investors' and savers' confidence in
monetary policy, and hence also in economic policy as a whole,' he said.
'The capital which the central bank possesses in the form of a high
credibility is thus. . . uselessly put at risk.'
If the Bundesbank eased its controls it would amount to an announcement
that, in future, monetary policy would be geared primarily to financing the
government budget and, ultimately, inflationary. That would be 'a signal for
a massive run on public budgets, which politicians. . . would find difficult
not to become caught up in'.
A strictly anti-inflationary policy was the best way to maintain stability
and restrain 'distribution struggles and excessive budget policies. In the
absence of a consensus among all those responsible, however, the central
bank, too, will ultimately be able to achieve little,' he concluded.

FT  01 SEP 92 / French pollsters shift into top gear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RARELY a day has gone by in France over the past fortnight without
publication of an opinion poll on next month's crucial referendum on the
Maastricht treaty.
Opinion polls, or sondages, are a familiar feature of French life. The
French are probably polled more regularly and thoroughly than any other
nation. This summer, as the threat of a negative referendum result has
grown, the pollsters have been busier than ever.
Newspapers and television news programmes are filled with political pundits
poring over the polls; the Paris stock market has fluctuated so wildly on
rumours and counter-rumours of the next set of results that the market
authorities have issued a stern warning about the dangers of sondage
speculation.
Polls are not only more prolific in France, they are also taken more
seriously. 'This is the land of Descartes,' said Mr Pierre Weill of Sofres,
one of the largest polling groups, refering to the 17th century
mathematician. 'Statistics are at the heart of France's intellectual
tradition.'
Political polling has a reasonably high level of accuracy. BVA, one of the
sector's leaders, claims a margin of error of less than 3 per cent. The
success rate raises the question of whether polls actually influence public
opinion. Mr Weill suspects that, while many committed voters may not allow
them to affect their decisions, the polls probably persuade uncommitted
voters.
This could prove crucial over the next few days, when new polls will show
how the French have responded to last week's news that, for the first time,
the anti-Maastricht faction could command a majority in the referendum.
Local authorities in Reims yesterday banned Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of
the French far right, from holding a campaign meeting against the Maastricht
treaty, Reuter reports from Paris.
The meeting, planned for next Sunday, was to have been held in front of the

FT  01 SEP 92 / Danes rule out short cuts to treaty accord

DENMARK is calling on the rest of the European Community to go ahead with
ratification of the Maastricht treaty this autumn without waiting for any
breakthrough in the confusion caused by its No vote three months ago.
Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the Danish foreign minister, said the EC could not
expect any 'smart moves' or 'short cuts' to resolve the imbroglio sparked by
the Danish referendum on June 2.
Britain says it will not re-submit the Maastricht legislation to parliament
until Denmark has come up with proposals to make the European union plan
more palatable to the Danish electorate. However, Mr Ellemann-Jensen told
the Financial Times he expected Britain to continue with the EC plan, agreed
in June, to proceed with ratification.
Even if France says Yes to the treaty in its referendum on September 20, the
Danish government believes the question of Danish participation may take
until next summer to be resolved.
This indicates that the fate of the treaty will be put on ice at least until
that date, as it cannot come into force until all 12 EC members have
ratified it.
'Those who expect a second Danish referendum before the end of the year can
forget it,' Mr Ellemann-Jensen said. Calling the Danish rejection 'a crisis
for our political system', he emphasised the care the government would take
to try to find a solution acceptable both to the electorate and to Denmark's
EC partners.
He hoped that a 'rough framework' might be worked out at the EC summit in
Edinburgh in early December. Any formula, however, would have to be put to a
second vote by the Danish people next year.
He declined to give firm ideas on how the treaty text could be refashioned
to overcome Danish objections.
The white paper on Maastricht promised by the Danes for the first half of
October is unlikely to contain definite proposals for a way out of the
impasse. It will mainly be a list of legal problems created for Denmark and
its partners by the possibility of a separate Danish path on Europe.
Mr Ellemann-Jensen, who campaigned strongly for the treaty three months ago,
said he felt 'very humble' about its rejection and considered, 'for 10
seconds', resigning.
Among the options being considered in Copenhagen are adding protocols to the
treaty to define more closely how EC decision-making can be brought closer
to the people - the so-called subsidiarity principle. Denmark also favours
building into the treaty provisions limiting Denmark's participation in
common European defence. This was a particular stumbling block with Danish
voters.
Mr Ellemann-Jensen said the latest opinion polls had shown that, although
opposition to Maastricht was even greater than in June, Danish support for
the EC and Nato was as strong as ever.

FT  01 SEP 92 / Industry chief resigns after rift with Kohl
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR HEINRICH Weiss, president of the Federation of German Industry, the BDI,
resigned in a storm of controversy yesterday after less than two years in
office.
Mr Weiss, 50, had been under fire for some months because of his abrasive
manner and go-it-alone leadership style. However, opponents said his fatal
offence was to damage industry's relationship with Chancellor Helmut Kohl
and other leading politicians.
He made little attempt to hide his feelings about Mr Kohl's lack of interest
in economics and business affairs - a characteristic which also irritated Mr
Karl Otto Pohl, former president of the Bundesbank.
The federation's leader is the main spokesman for 80,000 companies from all
sectors, grouped in 34 different industry associations.
His departure, at a time of rising economic gloom, marks an attempt by the
leadership of German industry to rebuild intra-industry consensus and
restore relations with Bonn.
He will be replaced temporarily by Mr Tyll Necker, currently one of eight
BDI vice-presidents, who preceded Mr Weiss in the top job.
Grass-roots members have complained that its interests have been neglected
while those of industrial giants such as Daimler-Benz have taken precedence.
Pay policy has become a particularly sore point. Smaller companies complain
that large groups have signed generous pay deals and then passed on their
increased wage costs to their suppliers.
Mr Weiss, who is also chairman of SMS Schloemann-Siemag, a Dusseldorf
engineering group, said yesterday that he was 'disappointed'.
He had tried to build the BDI into an effective service organisation to help
German industry with new challenges in the European Community, the former
German Democratic Republic and world markets.
But he had found little support, and members had been unwilling to pay
higher contributions, he complained.
Mr Weiss's resignation followed his vain attempt just over a week ago to
persuade his vice-presidential colleagues to sack Mr Ludolf-Georg von
Wartenberg, the BDI's managing director.
Opponents said Mr Weiss's constant attacks on government economic policy,
and particularly on the chancellor, had 'blocked the approaches to Bonn'.
The BDI was no longer welcome in Mr Kohl's office, they added, while the
federation had a long tradition of close and comfortable relations with
previous governments, including the Social Democrats.

FT  01 SEP 92 / Japan poised to bail out troubled banking system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese government took an important step towards a possible bailout of
the nation's troubled banking industry yesterday in a further measure to
bolster the economy.
Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, said the government was ready to
provide public funds to help banks liquidate non-performing loans. This
follows the Y10,700bn (Pounds 43bn) emergency spending package announced
last Friday aimed at boosting economic growth.
Although schemes to support the banking system have been widely discussed
during the past two weeks, Mr Miyazawa is the first senior government
official to endorse the idea of using public money to support such a plan.
Government backing for a bank bailout promises to be highly controversial,
with newspapers and magazines already questioning why taxpayers should foot
the bill for the imprudence and greed of the nation's banks.
'If the problem will cause instability in the nation's financial system,
neither the government nor the Bank of Japan can afford to remain idle,' Mr
Miyazawa said. In addition to fears of instability, Mr Miyazawa was
concerned that the accumulation of bad debt had reduced the banks' lending
capacity and contributed to economic slowdown.
In a scheme likened to the Resolution Trust Corporation in the US, the
banking industry has been drawing up plans to form a corporation to purchase
bad loans or land held as collateral for bad loans from the banks.
Analysts estimate that loans on which no interest is being paid currently
total between Y25,000bn and Y30,000bn.
The government would have to overcome substantial practical difficulties to
make the scheme work. It remains unclear how such a corporation would be
owned or managed, how land would be priced, or which banks would be eligible
to sell land to the scheme. Conflicts of interest among banks may also be
extremely complex.
Fear of a possible collapse in the banking industry was one factor behind a
plunge in the stock market two weeks ago to a six-year low. The market was
turned around, however, by Friday's measures and by further evidence that
the government would step in to support the financial system.

FT  01 SEP 92 / Lufthansa plans to cut 6,000 jobs in two years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
LUFTHANSA, the German national airline which has sunk deeper into the red in
1992, plans to shed 6,000 jobs in the next two years as part of a programme
aimed at annual cost savings of around DM1bn (Pounds 350m).
The airline, 51 per cent state-owned, is due to announce the job cuts today,
along with a package of other measures such as a slimming down of its route
network and fleet reductions. Unions signalled their broad acceptance last
night after prolonged and difficult discussions.
'We are going through a difficult time, the most difficult in Lufthansa's
history,' said Mr Jurgen Weber, chief executive. The group already has begun
to trim operations - capacity on European routes this summer is 11 per cent
less than planned - after falling into the red in 1991.
Mr Weber said Lufthansa expected an operating loss of DM1.2bn this year,
after one of DM800m in 1991. This excludes non-airline activities and
aircraft sales. Last year's net loss was DM426m against a profit of DM15m.

FT  01 SEP 92 / BT junior managers offered the chance to work from home
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANAGERS and professional staff at BT will have the right to apply to work
from home for the first time after the telecommunications company signed a
framework agreement with the Society of Telecom Executives.
Up to 8,000 junior managers and white collar workers are potentially
eligible under the new scheme, although BT said the eventual number who
choose to work from home is not expected to be more than 1,000 by the end of
next year.
In the first instance it expects several hundred to take advantage of the
agreement. The STE represents 30,000 junior and middle managers and
professional staff.
Mr Peter Archer, BT's director of employee relations, said: 'Teleworking
(working from home using modern telecommunication systems, computers and
modems) is an area which has been of growing interest to us for some time.
While not all jobs are suitable for teleworking, we have reached a framework
agreement with the STE which will apply to those people who want to work
from home.'
In the UK, more than 500,000 people are thought to telework full-time, with
a further 1.5m part-time. Some analysts estimate that, by the year 2010, at
least 20 per cent of non-manual workers in the UK will be working from home,
or near it. BT managers responsible for supervising employees on a
'day-to-day' basis will not be eligible for the scheme. However, about 8,000
of the STE's membership not involved in managing employees will be allowed
to apply to work from home.
The agreement ensures that those who do so will be eligible for additional
home expenditure and will have no change in their pay, annual leave or
pensions. Teleworking contracts will be renewed every year.
Mr Simon Petch, STE general secretary, said: 'People who want to work from
home for various reasons, such as those who do not like working in offices,
and the disabled, will have the chance to work from home for the first time.
It is amazing how much work you can get done.'
BT recently unveiled a pilot scheme allowing some directory inquiries
operators to work from home in Inverness, Scotland. This was designed as a
year-long experiment intended to demonstrate to other businesses the
potential of teleworking.

FT  01 SEP 92 / Holiday is no respite for pound and dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign and Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING and the dollar remained under pressure yesterday in thin holiday
trading, as strains in the European exchange rate mechanism showed few signs
of easing.
The Italian lira recovered slightly on foreign exchange markets, buoyed by a
surprise weekend meeting between the French and Italian prime ministers
which could presage the start of a Franco-Italian effort to persuade Germany
to cut interest rates.
In Britain, Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, called on the government
to urge the Bundesbank to signal an interest rate cut when it meets on
Thursday. This might stave off pressure on some of the weak European
currencies, and with it the possibility of increases in borrowing rates in
nations such as Britain, France and Italy.
Both the dollar and the pound remained little changed against the D-Mark,
while the Belgian central bank increased its seven-day advances interest
rate from 9.6 per cent to 9.7 per cent to bolster the value of the Belgian
franc relative to the German currency.
Upward pressure on the D-Mark yesterday was limited by Friday's European
Community statement ruling out an ERM realignment.
Some of the weaker ERM currencies, including the pound, Italian lira and
French franc, may encounter fresh selling pressure today, when European
foreign exchange trading returns to normal after yesterday's bank holiday in
Britain. This depressed European trading volumes to about one-third of their
customary levels.
In New York yesterday, the dollar closed against the D-Mark at DM1.4028,
just over half a pfennig down on Friday night's close and near its all-time
low. In early Tokyo trading today it slipped to DM1.4002. The pound held at
DM2.7885, little changed from Friday night, and roughly 1 pfennig above its
DM2.778 ERM floor.
Against the dollar the pound weakened slightly in New York to Dollars 1.988,
but opened in Tokyo today at Dollars 1.99. The lira was quoted last night at
L763.75 to the D-Mark, up from the close of L765.7 on Friday, when at one
point it dipped below its ERM floor of L765.4 to the D-Mark.
In Italy, no details were released of Sunday's one-hour meeting in
Versailles between Mr Pierre Beregovoy and Mr Giuliano Amato, the French and
Italian prime ministers. The session was interpreted in the Italian press as
indicating the birth of a Franco-Italian axis on the ERM.
The pressure on Italian interest rates was shown last night by an auction of
seven-year floating rate government bonds, on which the net annual return
was set at 14 per cent, the highest for years.
Dealers seem to have been unaffected by Friday night's figures showing a
sharp deterioration in Italy's balance of payments and foreign exchange
reserves.

FT  01 SEP 92 / French No vote would destabilise Europe, EC warns: Delors
threatens to quit as Commission head if Maastricht is rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR European Community officials - unnerved by growing opposition in
France to the Maastricht treaty - are warning that Europe's stability is at
stake in the referendum on September 20.
Mr Jacques Delors who, like President Francois Mitterrand of France, has
staked his reputation on the successful outcome of Maastricht, said that he
would resign as president of the European Commission in the event of a 'No'
vote.
Mr Karel Van Miert, the Belgian commissioner in charge of the environment,
said yesterday that rejection of the treaty would cut Europe adrift from its
only real anchor, the Community.
He joined Sir Leon Brittan, the UK's senior commissioner who runs
competition policy, with a warning that a French 'No' would undermine the
single market, due to start on January 1.
Springing to the defence of a French government which has so far run a
subdued pro-treaty campaign, Mr Delors said on Sunday while campaigning in
France that he would resign if Maastricht fell.
Yesterday in a radio interview, when asked whether he would remain in his
job if the French electorate rejected the treaty, he said: 'I wouldn't stay
on for another mandate if the 'No' vote won.
'This would be for the simple reason that as far as my colleagues are
concerned I do not see how I could overcome the handicap of the loss of
influence of France and all those who represent France in all the European
institutions.'
Adopting an even more vigorous tone, Mr Michel Sapin, French finance
minister, warned that a vote against the treaty would bring a halt to fresh
investment across Europe, higher interest rates and an end to European hopes
of creating a currency to rival the dollar. 'Instead of selling our Airbuses
in dollars, we will sell them in Ecus. Today we exercise a limited
sovereignty. Tomorrow, with others, we will have full sovereignty,' he told
a Socialist party summer school.
Recent polls showing a narrow majority against Maastricht have forced French
government ministers and Brussels officials to face up to the possibility of
French rejection and its impact on international financial markets.
When Danish voters turned down Maastricht, EC ministers hoped to save the
treaty through a French endorsement. A 'No' vote in France, one of the
driving forces towards European integration, was considered unthinkable.
An opinion poll yesterday showed a margin of 53 per cent in favour to 47 per
cent against. Six opinion polls last week predicted a close vote on
September 20. Three showed the 'No' vote winning by a margin of up to 53-47
and three others showed the 'Yes' ahead by up to 52-48.
Mr Sapin's remarks reflect the government's alarm at growing opposition to
the European union. The anti-Maastricht campaign has been aggressive, and
has often played on domestic rather than European issues, attracting protest
votes against the political establishment.
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, told the conference that the recent
polls were 'full of danger'. He added: 'Our efforts of the past 40 years in
favour of a reunited and pacified Europe risk being annihilated by the
convergence of conservatism and fear.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL GRADE, chief executive of Channel 4, made a strong attack on the
governors and senior management of the BBC at the 17th Edinburgh Television
festival last night.
Mr Grade, a former controller of BBC 1 who joined Channel 4 in January 1988,
accused the BBC of adopting 'a pseudo-Leninist style of management which
relies on the exercise of central control' to the detriment of programme
planning and production values.
He singled out the funding of the corporation as the most important issue
facing it. The government funds the BBC by means of a compulsory licence fee
 -currently Pounds 80 annually for a colour television. The BBC's charter
and licence to broadcast, granted by the government, comes up for renewal at
the end of 1996.
Describing the licence fee as 'in danger of becoming a dwindling asset', Mr
Grade said: 'The BBC seems prepared to pay too high a price in return for
the charter renewal . . . The present regime at the BBC has, mistakenly,
adopted a strategy which says there is no alternative to the licence fee
therefore they will do whatever it takes to secure it.
'They are putting in long-term jeopardy the very institution they are
fighting to protect.'
Mr Grade said he supported the continuation of the licence fee. The BBC 'was
never meant to be a business' but was established as 'a centre of excellence
in broadcasting'.
He accused BBC governors of having adopted a 'policy of appeasement' in the
face of the 'terrible battering it has taken from the government over the
last 10 years'.
Mr Grade argued that the BBC is a public service and must be sufficiently
funded to maintain its reputation for quality broadcasting. 'If you put the
BBC into competition for revenue, it ceases to be a public service.'

Mr Grade did not recognise the considerable changes in broadcasting since
the current BBC charter was issued in 1981 - 'changes which will accelerate
in the coming year,' Mr James said.

BRYANT &amp; MAY, the UK match manufacturer, has agreed to freeze the prices of
its branded matches until the end of next year, after the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission found it had abused its dominant position in the UK
market to make excess profits.
Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, said yesterday he had accepted
statutory undertakings from Bryant &amp; May to hold prices for branded matches
 -including Swan Vesta and Cooks Household brands - at the level which
applied on April 1 last year.
The company has also agreed to change its trading agreements to eliminate
discounts, exclusive promotion and sales, and minimum stocking clauses
applying to matches (whether branded or own label), disposable lighters and
other smokers' requisites.
Bryant &amp; May is part of Swedish Match, the Stockholm-based conglomerate
recently provisionally acquired by Procordia, the Swedish food and
pharmaceutical group. Its sale to Swedish Match in 1987 won approval by the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission.

FT  29 AUG 92 / Opren claimants lose court battle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST OF the remaining alleged victims of the banned arthritis drug Opren who
are claiming compensation had their actions dismissed in the Court of Appeal
yesterday.
In a test-case ruling, three judges decided that 13 of 16 representative
claimants were barred from seeking damages against Eli Lilly, the
pharmaceuticals company, because their actions started too late.
Lord Justice Purchas, sitting with Lord Justice Ralph Gibson and Lord
Justice Mann, dismissed appeals by 13 claimants against rulings by Mr
Justice Hidden that their claims were 'statute barred' under the 1980
Limitation Act which lays down time limits for starting civil actions.
The claimants, mostly elderly arthritis sufferers, allege they suffered
long-term or permanent side-effects as a result of the drug, which was
withdrawn worldwide in 1982.

SOUTHWEST Airlines plans to open a new reservations centre in Albuquerque
that will employ 465 people by the third quarter of 1993, Reuter reports
from Albuquerque.
Southwest Airlines, based in Dallas, is the only sizeable US airline to have
been consistently profitable during the recent industry upheavals.
Southwest, a low-cost/low fare operation, concentrates on flying
high-density commuter routes, rather offering national coverage via hub
operations.
Meanwhile, Trans World Airlines, one of the nation's bankrupt carriers, has
announced plans to close its New York reservations centre, with the loss of
around 450 jobs.
The closure is scheduled to take effect on October 25.
The airline currently emloys just under 28,000 people overall, and runs a
number of other reservations centres in the US.

<TEXT>
GENTING, the Malaysia based group mainly involved in gaming, plantations and
manufacturing, has confirmed that associate companies have amassed a total
5.83 per cent stake in Lonrho, the troubled British conglomerate.
After a confusing 24 hours in Malaysian corporate circles, with reports and
rumours giving Genting up to 10 per cent of Lonrho, Genting circulated
yesterday copies of a letter it had sent the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange
clarifying its position. Genting said that up to August 27 Genting Berhad,
the group's investment holding company, had purchased through its
subsidiaries a total of 25,366,000 Lonrho shares - representing 3.88 per
cent of the total Lonrho stock.
In addition it reported: 'we have been informed by Genting International
Ltd. (GIL) that one of its subsidiaries has, up to August 27, 1992 purchased
12,758,000 shares in Lonrho' - representing 1.95 per cent of the total
Lonrho stock. 'Therefore the combined Genting Berhad Group's and GIL Group's
equity investment in Lonrho would amount to 5.835 per cent' says the letter.
The move into Lonhro attracted great interest in Malaysia, with speculation
the group might take its holding to 10 per cent.

FT  29 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Richmond Oil accounts qualified as losses
mount
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUDITORS have qualified the accounts of Richmond Oil &amp; Gas, the natural
resource group which yesterday reported a dramatic increase in pre-tax
losses from Pounds 795,000 to Pounds 43.9m for the year to March 31.
Touche Ross, which signed off the delayed results yesterday, said Richmond's
ability to continue trading would depend on asset disposals. Furthermore,
the accountants stated, there were 'uncertainties' as to the value of some
intangible and tangible properties.
Mr Robert Fox, Richmond's chairman, said the group's future depended on the
sale of its coal bed methane interests. He added, however, that he was
confident the company could be returned to profit.
The company narrowly escaped a qualification last year by announcing the
sale of the coal bed properties in September. However, a dispute over
mineral rights prevented completion in April. Richmond had received some
Dollars 12.6m of the agreed Dollars 20m price.
Mr Fox said Richmond had to complete a deal on some of the remaining San
Juan methane properties in the next 60 days. He added that Richmond was also
intending to sell a stake of more than 50 per cent in its joint venture in
Siberia.
Losses last year were magnified by the foreclosure on Richmond Ranch,
purchased just two years ago for Dollars 80m. The company took an
exceptional charge of Pounds 37m as a result. Mr Fox admitted that, with
hindsight, Richmond had over paid.
Richmond also took a Pounds 4.8m write-down on its Texas Panhandle
properties. Restructuring costs brought the total exceptional charge to
Pounds 43.1m.
Operating losses jumped 87 per cent to Pounds 347,000 on sales 51 per cent
ahead at Pounds 11.4m. The loss per share was 48p (1p).
Richmond also announced a management reshuffle, with Mr Fox becoming chief
executive. Mr David Wilkinson would resign as joint managing director to
become chief executive of the Russian venture. The board had decided not to
send Mr Wilkinson to Siberia. He will be based in London and remains an
executive director. The SFO inquiry into aspects surrounding Richmond's 1989
flotation continues.

FT  29 AUG 92 / UK Company News: S African bank in talks to buy H Ansbacher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST National Bank of South Africa, one of the republic's largest
banks, yesterday said it was at an advanced stage in talks to buy Henry
Ansbacher Holdings, the small UK merchant bank.
If the negotiations prove successful it will be the first time a South
African bank has acquired a British bank. The takeover would need the Bank
of England's approval.
Mr Barry Swart, managing director of First National said 'We have had
in-depth talks with Ansbacher and hopefully we will reach a conclusion
within the next several weeks.'
First National was formerly an associate of Barclays before the British bank
disinvested from South Africa in 1986.
Ansbacher said discussions about being taken over by the British merchant
bank Singer &amp; Friedlander had ceased. Its shares remained unchanged at 26p.
The talks, along with the recent decision of the Standard Bank of South
Africa to open an office in London, mark the beginning of the republic's
attempts to re-establish itself in Europe with a view to earning hard
currency and attracting European investment into South Africa.
Senior directors of First National's merchant banking arm, First Corp
Merchant Bank, which acquired the merchant banking operations in South
Africa of Citicorp of the US five years ago, are leading the negotiations
with Ansbacher in London.
The British merchant bank specialises in South African and third world debt.
'We have found that we are unable to service our multi-national clients
satisfactorily without a European presence', Mr Swart said.
'We have therefore been looking to expand into Europe and London is an
obvious first port of call.'
He said his proposed takeover of Ansbacher was also motivated by the need to
extend its dealing services and trade South African securities in London.
Two of Ansbacher's main shareholders - Pargesa, the Swiss investment group
controlled by Belgians and Canadians, and Groupe Bruxelles Lambert, which
together own about 62 per cent of the shares - have backed the decision to
talk to First National Bank. The shareholders had been in talks with Singer
&amp; Friedlander.
Ansbacher recently unveiled interim pre-tax profits ahead from Pounds 1.1m
to Pounds 1.9m for the six months to end-June.
For the year to end-December Ansbacher incurred a Pounds 8.2m loss after
making heavy loan provisions.
The half-year profit increase was driven mainly by strong performances from
the off-shore operations and asset trading.

FT  29 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Recessionary problems put pressure on tyres
 -How falling volumes and increased competition has affected Kwik-Fit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN THE effects of recession start to permeate even the baked bean market,
what company can be said to be recession-proof?
Apparently, fewer by the day - to the severe detriment of their share
prices. Consumers long ago cut back on discretionary items such as cars and
furniture but now they are even trimming such staples as baked beans and car
tyres.
Take Kwik-Fit Holdings, which has a chain of nearly 500 centres throughout
the UK replacing mainly car tyres and exhausts. In May, its share price
soared to a high of 222p, nearly four times the level of August 1990. Since
then it has dropped as low as 94p and closed yesterday at 102p. At the heart
of the problem was the sudden cutting of profit forecasts from Pounds 36m to
Pounds 24m.
While the tale of dashed hopes has some features peculiar to Kwik-Fit, the
underlying story is that tyres - which account for half the company's sales
 -have fallen victim to the recessionary ills of lower volumes and price
pressures.
Buyers were drawn to Kwik-Fit's shares as the company achieved a two-thirds
increase in pre-tax profit in the year to February 29 to make a record
Pounds 32.1m.
Further growth was assumed. It was reasoned that drivers keeping their cars
for longer would fuel the replacement market. Add to this a legislative
change, which increased the minimum tread depth from 1mm to 1.6mm, and the
market was expected to grow by about 5 per cent this year.
With Kwik-Fit also boasting a strong balance sheet, after turning net debt
of Pounds 19.1m into Pounds 3.5m cash in 1991-92, investors who were bearish
on the UK economy and new car sales switched into the stock. 'It is a big
disappointment for them that it has not proved more recession-proof,' says
Mr Charles Burrows, at James Capel.
What happened was that publicity surrounding the new tread-depth law, which
came into effect on January 1, pulled sales forward. It is estimated that
distributors took about 2.2m tyres from the manufacturers in that month,
about 700,000 more than in January 1991.
After the January bulge, it was believed that the market - which amounted to
about 17.5m tyres last year - would settle down at a higher level. But by
the early summer the pattern was of lower sales - 1.4m in June compared with
1.7m the previous year.
Analysts say that what investors had forgotten in the case of Kwik-Fit was
the feature it shares with retail chains: high fixed costs.
'Its high operational gearing makes it very dependent on volume,' says Mr
Andrew Fitchie, at SG Warburg.
Other factors threatening its profits on tyres have also come into play.
Competition has increased as garages hit by falling car sales have put more
emphasis on the repairs and replacement business. And motorists have traded
down.
Mr Tom Farmer, Kwik-Fit's chairman and chief executive, says imports of
cheap tyres from eastern Europe and Taiwan have risen considerably. In May
importers supplied more than half the market.
Another measure of the switch to lower-priced products is sales of remoulded
tyres. Mr Richard Swann, advertising and public relations manager at ATS,
part of Michelin, says the group's remould factory 'is working flat out to
keep pace with demand'.
But at least the penny-pinching motorist is replacing his or her tyres.
According to the Tyre Industry Council, surveys carried out with the police
have found that between 15 and 25 per cent of cars have at least one bald
tyre.
There is some anecdotal evidence from the trade that the new law might have
cramped the sales efforts of the tyre outlets. More people have been asking
for the tread depth to be measured and if it tops 1.6mm, decide to leave the
tyre on for a few hundred miles more. In the past, they might have relied on
the fitter's advice on which tyres needed replacing.
Fleet managers keeping a tighter control on costs have been asking which
tyres must be replaced, instead of blithely ordering new sets.
One factor crucial to the life of a tyre is the number of miles the car
does. Some observers believe that the private motorist has started to cut
down on mileage as an economy.
But figures to confirm this are hard to come by. An Automobile Association
survey last year concluded that the average private motorist did 671 miles a
month, or just over 8,000 a year, but it had no historical comparison.
When it sought drivers' views in the spring of 1991, it found that 85 per
cent did not intend to change their motoring habits as a result of the
recession. Some of those who said they would mentioned cutting their
mileage.
The only up-to-date information comes from the Petrol Retailers Association.
Mr Bruce Petter, director, said the market for 'motor spirit' (excluding
diesel) was 2.1 per cent down in the March to May quarter. And 1991 was 1.2
per cent down on 1990.
Even this modest decline represented a worse performance than in the
depression of the early 1930s, when petrol sales kept going up.
Against this background of deferred spending and reduced activity, analysts
are expecting that the interim results from the motor trade will show falls
in the after-sales side of the business.
In Kwik-Fit's case, the continued growth of exhaust sales - a higher margin
operation than tyres - will limit some of the damage. The company responded
constructively to criticisms of the exhaust business in a Consumers'
Association report, published in Which? magazine in January.
If it makes Pounds 24m pre-tax for the full year, this will still be well
above the Pounds 19.4m made in 1990-91.
But investors are more likely to remember the sudden shock of this summer's
downgrade and it will take all of Mr Farmer's marketing flair to rebuild
credibility.

<TEXT>
Sinclair Goldsmith, the surveyors, estate agents and rating consultants,
finished the year ended May 31 1992 with a pre-tax loss of Pounds 525,000,
compared to Pounds 997,000 previously.
Mr Edward Langton, chairman, said the cutting of overheads led to a modest
profit, before exceptionals, in the second half.
Turnover fell 11 per cent to Pounds 2.77m and overheads were reduced 22 per
cent to Pounds 3.27m. Exceptional charges of Pounds 104,000 (Pounds 115,000)
related to costs of closing the Croydon office.
Losses per share were 3.68p (8p) and the final dividend is omitted, leaving
the year's total at 0.5p (2p).

Inishtech, the diversified Irish-based group, recorded a 15 per cent growth
in pre-tax profit for the opening half of 1992.
It rose from IPounds 3.09m to IPounds 3.56m, or Pounds 3.36m, as turnover
climbed 29 per cent to IPounds 24.2m. Earnings per share were 18.3p (16p).
Group activities cover the manufacture of disposable hygiene products,
protective packaging, industrial design and printing, and self adhesive
labels.
Since acquisition Douthwaites Florists Sundries had performed up to
expectations. In 1991 its pre-tax profit margin was 11 per cent and that
will have the effect of somewhat reducing the group's overall margin.

FT  29 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Improved position at Lincoln House
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite the worsened economic recession in the UK, Lincoln House, the
furniture maker, has continued to improve its position.
In the first half of 1992, it cut pre-tax loss to Pounds 24,000, against
Pounds 247,000 and Pounds 853,000 in the two corresponding periods.
Furniture making - other businesses have been discontinued - made an
operating profit of Pounds 99,000 (loss Pounds 31,000) on turnover of Pounds
4.06m (Pounds 4.61m). That was the result of substantial improvements in the
product range and customer base combined with tight managerial controls.
Mr David Harland, chairman, said that the large interest burden had been
partially addressed by the sale of Impala Displays and Mayers &amp; Shaw, but
'there is still some way to go in reducing this cost'.
Losses per share were cut to 0.15p (1.53p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Baldwin, the leisure, printing and property group, announced a reduced
pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.02m for the six months to April 30. Last time there
were losses of Pounds 2.23m.
Turnover was little changed at Pounds 4.2m (Pounds 4.24m). The tour
operating division, which accounts for two-thirds of group trading
activities, only recognises revenue on the departure of clients on holiday.
Hence there was little turnover from that source.
The company has issued legal proceedings to protect the value of its
holdings in London Clubs International and because of the uncertain value of
that investment the directors feel unable to declare an interim dividend.
Last time there was a 1.4p payment. They hope to pay a final of not less
than the total 2.8p paid in 1991. Losses per share fell to 7.98p (8.98p).

The continuing recession, exceptional cost cutting expenses and higher
interest charges left Fife Indmar, the engineering holding company, with
pre-tax losses of Pounds 236,000 for the half year to June 30. Profits last
time were Pounds 845,000.
Turnover edged ahead to Pounds 16.9m (Pounds 16.7m) but trading profits

Looking ahead, Mr Gavin Hepburn, the chairman, was confident that with the
distribution businesses continuing to do well, the action taken in other
divisions would have a beneficial effect on second half results.
Losses per share amounted to 1.53p (5.38p earnings) and the interim dividend

Arnotts, the Dublin-based stores group, saw its pre-tax profit decline by 16
per cent to IPounds 1.01m, or Pounds 952,000, in the half year ended July
31.
The result, down from IPounds 1.21m, followed more difficult trading
conditions exacerbated by renovations at the Henry Street store in Dublin.
The work disrupted business and contributed to a reduction in margins. It
should be completed by the end of October.
Turnover for the period was marginally ahead at IPounds 19.7m (IPounds

<TEXT>
SCOTTISH Heritable Trust, the carpet wholesaling, housebuilding, quarrying
and property group, reduced its pre-tax losses from Pounds 3.15m to Pounds
2.86m in the first half of 1992.
Turnover fell to Pounds 22.8m (Pounds 38.4m) reflecting the disposal of
Standard Fireworks and Hoskins, and accounting for Scottish Heritable Inc as
an associate, against a subsidiary last time.
Interest charges were halved to Pounds 1.9m. While the group had not been
able to comply with the debt reduction targets set out in the standstill
agreement with bankers, it had been successful in obtaining their continued
support.
The three carpet wholesaling companies in the UK, France and the US operated
at a loss. In housebuilding, the disposal of Hearthstead Homes in 1991 and
strong trading conditions in Tennessee led to a turnround to a profit of
Pounds 149,000 (loss Pounds 208,000).
Quarrying saw Texas and Arkansas profitable but Virginia turning into a
loss. The latter had since been sold for Dollars 19.7m(Pounds 9.8m).
Losses per share came to 8p (10.6p).

FT  29 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Crown selling French interests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CROWN Communications, the USM-quoted commercial radio group which owns LBC,
is close to selling its loss-making French radio interests.
Mr David Haynes, chief executive, whose Australian company Darling Downs TV
owns 37 per cent of Crown, said the deal would reduce the group's debt of
nearly Pounds 16m and remove a drain on cash.
RFM's main asset is a radio masthead, valued at nearly Pounds 12m in the
September 1991 accounts. Price Waterhouse, the auditors, qualified the
accounts because it could not say whether the value was fairly stated.
While the sale price, to a French company, was not disclosed yesterday, Mr
Haynes said it would be less than Pounds 12m, so there would be losses.
Last year RFM accounted for nearly half the group's pre-tax loss of Pounds
6.79m. It was also a significant loss-maker in the six months to March 31,
when the deficit amounted to Pounds 5.58m.
Mr Haynes said LBC, which runs the London radio stations, was cash neutral
and would soon move into a small surplus. That would be the 'only major
asset left' after the RFM disposal and the planned sale of a majority stake
in IRS, the advertising sales business.
The RFM sale is conditional on approval from the French radio authority.

FT  29 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Gerald Ratner's total pay listed as Pounds
574,452

<TEXT>
MR GERALD RATNER, who earlier this year was forced to step down as chairman
of Ratners jewellery chain after the company ran into financial
difficulties, received total emoluments of Pounds 574,452 in the year to
March 1.
Although this represented a 7 per cent pay cut from the previous year, the
payment came in a year when Ratners reported a loss before tax of Pounds
122m compared with a profit of Pounds 112m, when ordinary shareholders
received no final dividend and when preference shareholders saw their
dividends deferred.
Mr Ratner is also, apparently, receiving the same salary in his remaining
role of chief executive as he received in his previous position as chairman
and managing director.
This is in spite of turning over his responsibilities as executive chairman
to Mr James McAdam who took up the post on January 10.
According to Ratner's annual report, which is due to arrive on shareholders'
desks in coming days, Mr Ratner received Pounds 541,401 in the 11 months
before he gave up the chairmanship, equivalent to Pounds 1,573.86 a day.
In the 21 days left before the accounts were drawn up, Mr Ratner received
Pounds 33,051, equivalent to Pounds 1,573.86 a day.
Meanwhile, Mr McAdam was paid Pounds 15,377 for the period, equivalent to a
more modest Pounds 732.24 a day.
Mr McAdam was not returning telephone calls yesterday to comment on whether
he and Mr Ratner will continue on the same remuneration terms this year.

<TEXT>
GENEVA police have put out an international warrant for the arrest of an
employee of the Geneva branch of Lloyds Bank, following the discovery of
some SFr29m (Pounds 11.6m) in losses on unauthorised foreign exchange
dealings.
The branch specialises in portfolio management for wealthy individuals.
Lloyds would not reveal details of the incident, but said clients' money was
not involved.
Geneva investigators say the employee, who is of both Egyptian and Swiss
nationalities and is believed to have fled to Egypt, is a portfolio manager
for some of the bank's Middle East clients.
Many of these clients did not wish to break the Koran's prohibition on
interest-bearing investments, so they instructed him to put their money into
foreign exchange futures and other instruments only offering the possibility
of capital gain.
According to Mr Pierre Marquis, the investigating magistrate, the employee
created phoney accounts over the past five years for investing in foreign
exchange contracts. When these accounts went into loss, he created phoney
pledges of funds from the accounts of some of his clients to cover the
losses.
Lloyds said no other employees were involved.
This is the second time in a month irregularities in a British controlled
bank in Switzerland have come to light. Zurich based Rothschild Bank, an
affiliate of NM Rothschild &amp; Sons in London, had to shore up its equity base
following revelations of large loan losses, a breach of Swiss banking
regulations and the arrest of a former senior executive.

Managers at the company, which includes the Prontaprint copying chain, have
been negotiating an offer with potential financiers for some time.
The 'public to private' buy-out follows a 9 per cent decline in profits last
year.
A new company, Prontaprint 1992, has been formed to oversee the buy-out. The
offer is 40p cash per share. The shares of Continuous closed 4p higher at
38p yesterday.
Alternatively, investors can opt for securities in Prontaprint 1992.

FT  29 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Building materials
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's big falls in the shares of Meyer, Heywood Williams and Hepworth
suggest the script of that much hyped recovery story at the 'light' end of
the building materials sector can now be ripped up. July's 6 per cent fall
in the turnover of builders' merchants certainly seemed to have convinced
the market that Meyer, for one, will be unable to maintain its dividend this
year. As at the heavier end of the sector  - bricks, tiles and aggregates as
opposed to glass, pipes and boilers - the problem is as much one of
collapsing prices as it is of falling demand. Volumes in aggregates, bricks
and rooftiles, indeed, are so far holding up surprisingly well thanks to the
road programme and flat housebuilding activity. If the industry's
overcapacity could be sorted out, the long-term prospects at the heavy end
of the building material industry might be relatively more attractive.

FT  29 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Electricity
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The 12 regional electricity companies will have to get accustomed to being
judged individually rather than as a group. Next week's unbundling of the
package made available at privatisation means that, with the exception of
indexed funds, most institutional investors will retain favoured stocks and
discard the rest. The impact on the relative performance of the shares has
already been notable: at the start of the summer some 25 per cent of Rec
shares were held in the package.
Heightened competition for the hearts and minds of investors is only the
start. The regulator has made plain he has little faith in complex return on
capital calculations as a means of exerting control. Offer's preferred
tactic is to introduce competition into as many areas as possible. As a
foretaste, the Recs may be denied the automatic right to pass through higher
pool prices to customers, in the interests of a more competitive wholesale
market. Metering and the erosion of regional monopolies are firmly on the
agenda. And whatever the details of the 1994 review, the Recs will have to
live with a less generous pricing regime in the second half of the decade.
One implication is that real dividend growth will depend on companies'
ability to deliver efficiency gains and grow non-core businesses.
Judging the relative efficiency and management quality of the Recs on the
basis of two years' figures is not easy. Return on capital ranges from
perhaps 6 per cent at Seeboard to 10 per cent at East Midlands, but this is
a result of geography and the pricing formulae set at privatisation. A
better benchmark may be the companies' ability to meet customer service
standards, which will be central to the regulatory regime going forward.
Whatever method of assessment is chosen, the risk of backing a loser is
likely to increase.

FT  29 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: UK stock market
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After this week's 53 point fall in the Footsie, the risks of an interest
rate rise would appear to be at least partially discounted by UK equities.
It may be, though, that the market is still unduly optimistic about 1993
corporate earnings given the prospects for low inflation, a likely
continuation of high real interest rates, and no certainty of a devaluation
of the pound. Certainly the depressing experience of industrial companies in
1990 and 1991 - for which earliest independent forecasts of a 10 to 15 per
cent earnings rise compare with the reality of a 10 to 15 per cent collapse
 -suggest that there could be downgradings aplenty to come. As S G Warburg
points out, moreover, the composition of 1993 profits growth predicted by
its analysts for the 72 Footsie stocks in the Industrial Index is very
different from 1992. This year less than half the growth is expected to come
from underlying trading, ie volume increases and price gains, thanks to
substantial cost savings and acquisition benefits. Next year, however, the
anticipated earnings increase is 75 per cent reliant on a general economic
improvement. Investors need to be sure that this risk is priced in.

FT  29 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Japan bets the bank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There must be a sneaking admiration for any country which can announce
Pounds 40bn-odd of extra government spending seemingly at the drop of a hat.
Investors, however, must consider whether the package of measures announced
yesterday will cure Japan's ills. The stock market seems to think so - it
has risen 25 per cent in the last 10 days. But there are strong technical
reasons for the rise: short-covering and ministry of finance encouragement
not to sell among them. Unfortunately, although the measures will boost the
Japanese economy by around 2.5 per cent next year, the first effects will
not be felt in the economy for months. With the earnings outlook for many
Japanese companies still extremely poor, shares look expensive at these
higher levels.
That said, the proposals are heartening because they show that the
government finally accepts there is a problem. But there is a nagging worry
that the authorities are shooting at the wrong target. The real Japanese
basket case is the financial system, not the economy. True, economic growth
will boost bank profits, and support measures for the stock market will
raise the value of their share portfolios; lower interest rates will also
raise bank margins. But these measures are only of indirect help: the
central question of the banks' bad loans has still not been adequately
addressed.
These bad debts are vast - one estimate puts core non-performing loans
around Y10,000bn - some Pounds 40bn; doubtful loans could be 10 times that
amount. With a black hole of that size a government lifeboat will be needed,
so taxpayers and the banks will end up sharing the losses. Until the bank
rescue is ready, investors can be excused for remaining cautious.
Arm-twisting may only keep the stock market up until the half year ends on
September 30. It is to be hoped the lifeboat is ready by then.

FT  29 AUG 92 / Milosevic must adopt peace plans or resign, says Panic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SERBIAN president Mr Slobodan Milosevic will be forced to resign if he does
not implement the accords reached at the London conference, Mr Milan Panic,
prime minister of the rump Yugoslavia, said yesterday.
Mr Milosevic last night welcomed the peace plan and denied that he had
ambitions to create a greater Serbia. However, Mr Panic said in London
before returning to Belgrade: 'What counts is not the word but the deed.
This peace proposal is now the official peace plan for the federal republic
of Yugoslavia. I expect Mr Milosevic to comply, or else.'
The Yugoslav federal parliament meets on Tuesday to discuss the conference
accords, aimed at ending the war in Bosnia, and possibly Mr Milosevic's
future.
Increased pressure on the Serbian leader coincided with fresh warnings from
the United Nations and the European Community, joint organisers of the
conference, that the fighting in Bosnia would not end in the next few days,
despite the agreement.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, warned at the end of the
conference that 'what counts is what happens on the ground, not today, or
tomorrow, but in the next few weeks'.
Meanwhile, the Dutch defence ministry yesterday announced it had suspended
two junior Dutch army officers serving with the UN for refusing to work in
Sarajevo's Marshall Tito barracks, which was shelled on August 20.
In Bosnia, government officials said the accords could lead to an escalation
of the fighting. 'The conference was a catastrophe. It went back,' said Mr
Stjepan Kljuic, a member of the Bosnian presidency.
Other Bosnian officials said Serb forces could use a time lapse between the
agreements being reached at the conference and their implementation to
continue bombardments.
The besieged Bosnian capital of Sarajevo was again shelled by artillery and
mortars yesterday. Fifteen mortar bombs crashed on or near the presidency
building.
Elsewhere, Serb forces continued their blockade of the eastern town of
Gorazde, and the northern city of Bihac.
The accords cover the closure of detention camps, an end to 'ethnic
cleansing', and a ceasefire. Negotiations, due to begin in Geneva on
September 3, will begin implementing the accords.

FT  29 AUG 92 / Lloyd's council wins clear vote of confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEMBERS of Lloyd's of London have given a decisive vote of confidence in the
council, the insurance market's governing body, and support for wide-ranging
reforms.
Results of a ballot announced yesterday show that four out of five Names -
the individuals whose wealth provides the market's capital - back the
council's commitment to improve the market's management and regulation.
The vote will help Lloyd's as it seeks to persuade Names to remain members
after a period of controversy which has severely undermined its credibility.
The ballot was held following an extraordinary general meeting last month,
called by dissident loss-making Names. These Names, largely external members
who do not work in the market, have suffered disproportionately from its
recent heavy losses, which totalled Pounds 2.06bn in 1989, the last year for
which figures are available.
Mr David Coleridge, Lloyd's chairman, said: 'I'm not going to make a song
and dance about it but this is a resounding vote of confidence in the
council.'
Out of the market's 32,628 Names, 23,398 took part in the ballot, with
18,508 voting in favour of a resolution backing the council. Four other
motions tabled by opponents of the council were rejected, although by lesser
margins.
But Mr Richard Astor, a legal adviser to the dissident Names, said the group
was not disheartened by the result and vowed to continue his campaign for
more radical reform and a break with the present management.
Without the votes of some 6,000 working Names - who hold jobs with Lloyd's
agencies and brokers - the council would have lost at least one of the
motions, Mr Astor claimed. He said that his group would seek a further egm
next month.
However, the Association of Lloyd's Members, which represents over 9,000
Names, welcomed the vote which it described as 'the end of a chapter. The
majority of Names want the market's business to go on.'
Meanwhile, in a separate development Chatset, the independent company which
analyses Lloyd's business, says it expects the market to post losses of
Pounds 1.5bn in 1990 when results are reported next year. This compares with
its earlier forecast of Pounds 1.2bn losses.

FT  29 AUG 92 / BA and USAir seek closer ties: Airlines could fly under
common colours within three years of deal
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AIRWAYS and USAir, the ailing US carrier in which the UK airline
wants to invest Dollars 750m (Pounds 379m) for a minority stake, could be
flying under common colours within three to four years of the deal taking
place, according to documents filed in the US.
In New York yesterday, BA confirmed that, from a user's standpoint, the two
airlines could look almost identical within three or four years.
The formal investment agreement between BA and USAir, now filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, spells out the extent to which the two
airlines plan to integrate their operations if the transaction wins
regulatory approval.
Leading US carriers have seized on the document, arguing that BA will
effectively control USAir's business even if legal ownership is within US
rules. Under the proposed deal, BA would have an initial 21 per cent voting
stake in USAir and about 44 per cent of total equity.
Foreign interests are limited to 25 per cent of voting control of a US
airline, although total equity ownership may reach 49 per cent without
automatically being deemed 'foreign control'.
The document says 'harmonising the brand identities' of the two carriers
'shall be an immediate priority'. Initially, they plan to have three
regional brands - intercontinental, European and North American - with BA in
charge of the first two and USAir handling the North American brand in a
'consistent manner'. These could take a year to develop, but would be
implemented as quickly as possible.
Within three years of the regional brand introduction, a new 'global master
brand' is due to be introduced - with BA in charge of development. The
agreement makes clear that by 'branding', the two companies are talking
about all aspects of their public identities.
In some areas, the integration might be swifter still. The plan says
'immediate co-ordination and subsequent full integration of pricing and
inventory control (including yield/capacity management) is a priority'. It
says USAir 'agrees to undertake changes to the organisation of these
functions as recommended by (BA)'.
The three largest US airlines - United, Delta and American - and two leading
air cargo operators claim the agreement gives BA a whiphand over USAir's
business, because certain matters required 80 per cent of the board to be in
favour and BA would have four out of 16 directors.
According to the investment agreement, these areas include: 'any operating
or capital budget plan', other annual capital expenditures over Dollars 10m,
any investment exceeding Dollars 10m, the appointment or dismissal of any
senior USAir executive, the purchase or sale of route authorities and any
material marketing agreement or joint venture.
BA claims the opposition is anti-competitive. The US lobby argues that BA is
entering the US market by a backdoor route.

FT  29 AUG 92 / Please leave me alone, Fergie: Dominic Lawson wishes the
royals would stop interfering with him
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THIS 'royal tapes' business is the last straw,' said my taxi driver, and I
had to agree. The ever-encroaching invasion of privacy must cease. It is
time that the royal family stopped intruding on our private lives. We may be
only subjects but even under a monarchy we have some rights, above all the
right to be left alone to lead our private lives in peace and quiet, away
from the glare of royal publicity.
The monarch herself, of course, we cannot avoid. Every time we attach a
stamp to an envelope we are obliged to lick the back of the Queen's head, as
if we were a corgi seeking an approving royal pat. Falling asleep at the end
of the day's television on BBC1, one is obliged to wake up and stand to
attention as the national anthem is played at full blast by the BBC Symphony
Orchestra, whose members, I gather, call the tune 'royalties'.
Then there are the intrusive royal garden parties. We live near Buckingham
Palace, so perhaps I am unduly sensitive. But none of our other neighbours,
not even the inhabitants of Victoria's numerous bail hostels, cause as much
local disturbance and disruption.
Of course one can leave London to avoid the din around the Palace. We favour
the south of France, around St Tropez. But this year the Duchess of York and
her financial adviser got there first, and the place now resembles
Bedlam-by-the-sea.
I cannot understand why, when members of the royal family can stay in
countless castles, all with walls high enough to hide behind and thick
enough to soundproof the most amorous affairs, some of their number should
still choose to cavort in a way which we cannot help but see, in gruesome
colour, all over our servants' newspapers.
Worse still was the return of the errant duchess. Again, perhaps I have been
unlucky, but did she and her exuberant friends have to make such a din at
Foxtrot Oscar while we were trying to enjoy a quiet dinner next door at
Tante Claire?
I suppose the rot started in the 1960s, when the Queen - doubtless following
bad advice, rather than acting on her own sound instincts - agreed to make
the royal household into media stars with the BBC film The Family. Suddenly
these remote and austere figures intruded for the first time into our homes,
like uninvited house guests.
In recent years this publicity-seeking has developed in a distinctly
down-market direction. We had the Duchess of York's characteristically
bizarre television promotion, It's a Royal Knock-Out, not to mention the
interminably over-promoted Budgie the Helicopter books.
While the Prince of Wales's publications have been less intrusive, indeed
tastefully obscure, it came as a shock to turn on one's television to see
the heir to the throne cavorting about in the highlands and islands with the
popular TV personality Selina Scott. I would not question the prince's
choice of companion - I, too, consider Scott to be a woman of rare beauty
and intelligence - but could not the future king have left us in peace,
rather than forced us to watch the two of them at peak-time and grind our
teeth in envy at his good fortune? To encourage such resentment is to foment
revolution and the overthrow of the monarchy.
But, as the taxi driver said, the saga of the royal tapes is the final
straw. I have no idea whether the tape purporting to be of the Princess of
Wales talking to a male admirer is in fact a recording of the princess's
voice or not, and the official line from the palace is that they have no
idea either.
But let us suppose that the tape is genuine, as The Sun claims. Surely the
royal family with its enormous and untaxed wealth, can afford a private
telephone exchange. Surely they realise how easy it is to get a crossed line
on British Telecom's outmoded system. How many innocent members of the
general public must over the years have suffered the irritation of suddenly
hearing snatches of conversation between members of the royal family who
ought to know better.
No wonder a retired bank manager, exasperated at having his calls
interrupted, finally lost his temper, recorded his latest crossed royal
line, and handed it to The Sun.
Perhaps this incident will finally teach the royal family their lesson. If
they will only go back to their castles, fill their moats, pull up their
drawbridges and leave us alone, then we will once again love, cherish and
admire them.
God Save The Queen.

FT  29 AUG 92 / Private View: The eclipse of the British boffin - Science
has lost its appeal. David Attenborough is campaigning to restore its image
with children and politicians
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   IF IT IS true that British scientists are desperate
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
for money, status, everything - they could not have invented a better
advocate than Sir David Attenborough, the television naturalist.
Last week we learned that although the number of schoolchildren in England
and Wales doing pre-university A levels went up, the number choosing science
or mathematics fell yet again. Why?
A year ago, taking up his 12-month presidency of the British Association for
the Advancement of Science, Sir David looked at the opinion polls and
concluded that the public regards science as difficult, dull and dangerous.
Again, why?
A generation ago, the young bloods of Oxbridge looked contemptuously on
science students as boring people in duffle-coats. Is Britain paying now for
their contempt?
It was not just for his answers that I went to see David Attenborough this
week, but to find out if they are the right questions to ask.
I met him at the British Association's science festival in Southampton
University. 'Festival' is not the word I should have chosen to describe the
scene. The buildings were tatty; the place reeked of penny-pinching and
stale sweat. There was nothing to catch the eye or lift the spirit. If this
was the public face of British science, I thought, it does have problems.
Sir David, by contrast, was as buoyant and engaging as his television alter
ego. He wears his dozen medals and 17 honorary degrees lightly, looks much
too young for 66 and exudes the kind of animal health which can only come
from a lifetime of swinging from trees.
I asked him first about education.
'What is really mysterious is that all children, I'm absolutely convinced,
are interested in finding out about the world around them. That's simply
another name for science. The question is, why does the educational system
or parental system or whatever beat that out of them?'
There cannot be a primary school child in the country, I agreed, who is not
a militant saver of whales and protector of rainforests. So what happens to
them?
'Schools start off doing a great job,' he said. 'But when the children reach
13 or 14 and think about earning a living they see there aren't many
straightforward science jobs. Then there is the difficulty of science exams.
Other courses are a softer touch.'
It is easy to see in the so-called 'holistic' creed of the New Agers another
symptom of anti-science: here are people who condemn science because they
fear it, and fear it because they do not understand it. I asked Sir David if
he blamed a lack of scholastic discipline - were children just no longer
prepared to sit down and learn chemical formulae?
'But you could say the same about French irregular verbs,' he retorted.
In Attenborough's case childish curiosity - he was a collector of fossils -
developed into an enviable career (though he says he is not a real
scientist). He grew up in Leicester, where his father, a university don in
Anglo-Saxon, taught him that the way to learn was to find out for himself.
By coincidence, the British association also played a part. Its 1933
conference was held in Leicester and Attenborough, aged seven, fell under
the spell of the then president of the Association, the Nobel laureate Sir
Frederick Gowland Hopkins, the biochemist who pioneered research into
vitamins.
Sir David talked, predictably, about the lack of jobs, government
underfunding of the universities and the enormous cost of basic research - a
cost which few companies could justify to their shareholders. We discussed
the brain drain, Nobel prizewinners, national prosperity and the Japanese.
It was when I suggested that Britain's decline - in science, as in
engineering and manufacturing - was historically inevitable and we should
not make a fuss about it that he came up with what seemed to me the best
case of all.
'Science is an all-pervasive philosophy and body of knowledge which is
necessary if we are to understand what goes on in society,' he said.
'To be high-flown for a bit: we are all in a democratic society. We are all
asked to take decisions which really require some understanding of science
as well as coping with daily life in our our high-tech society.
'In my field - conservation and so on - we are asked to make decisions about
what our government should do about biodiversity, for example. Everyone gets
frightfully steamed up about what biodiversity means. If you're going to
urge ministers to do something, you ought to have some basic idea of what
you're on about.'
Energy generation was another subject the electorate could not afford to
remain ignorant about. 'Here's another enormous problem, the nature of the
dangers involved in nuclear power stations and how they compare with the
dangers of using fossil fuels.
'And on top of the whole damn thing, as far as I'm concerned, there is the
fact that an understanding of science illuminates your life. It makes it
richer. It is a kind of cultural appetite which is just as valid as an
appetite for opera.'
But if it is so exciting and illuminating why doesn't the Establishment like
it more? Why do they go to the opera?
'It's not mutually exclusive.'
But why isn't it chic to be scientifically literate?
'Ah, well, that's what we're complaining about. Why that is so, I don't
know. There is a certain time lag in civilisation, it seems to me. I think a
lot of the trouble comes from 50 years ago.
'Fifty years ago, when the war was on, science was the great thing that was
going to solve all the problems. And we poured huge sums of money into it.
In the newsreels and feature films there was always this man in the white
lab coat mixing with the men in gold-braided uniforms. He was the boffin.
And it was of the essence of what the boffin did that it was secret, and not
for the likes of you and me.
'And of course the government was right because in the war they did produce
the answers, most spectacularly with the Bomb.
'Then everyone said: 'Right, that's great] Now we've got all this scientific
endeavour, all our problems are over. We've got unlimited power from the
atom bomb, the discovery of antibiotics means all diseases are going to be
cleared up. The world is our oyster.'
'And what happened? The insecticides which were going to quadruple the
output of our fields proved to have poisons which lingered in the ecosystem.
Atomic power proved much more expensive and hazardous than we thought. We
still haven't found a cure for cancer.
'So everyone said: 'See, there you are, science is bloody hopeless. It makes
these great promises, fails to deliver and even when it does deliver the
handicaps are disastrous.'
'It's because scientific education has not kept up with these things that
people are left with the feeling that the magic tricks no longer work.'
Could our lack of scientific education be fatal to us as a species?
Sir David laughed cheerfully. 'Well, that's pushing it a bit. I think we
will muddle through. What I do think is that it would lead to a society
which is unaware of the basis on which it operates: and if you think that
society ought to be a democratic one then you're certainly heading for
trouble.'
CORRECTION: Last week's headline stated that Michael Dummett, Wykeham
professor of logic at Oxford, 'believes in' the Tarot. As the text made
clear, the professor is an expert on the game of Tarot, not a believer in
the occult.

FT  29 AUG 92 / The curious business of male exploitation: Antony Thorncroft
researches the beefcake niche
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS becoming unbearable. We have been reduced to basics, our bodies used
to sell everything from jeans to fragrances, or spread across the pages of
garish magazines, or forced to strip off on the West End stage so that the
audience can whistle and bray at us like over-heated lemmings. Exploitation
of the male has gone too far.
Not since the heroic world of classical Greece, apart from a blip at the
time of the Renaissance, has the masculine body been so exposed, so open to
view. Visit the cinema: advertisement after advertisement depicts a
succession of beautifully-muscled youths.
Escape to the theatre: there are the Chippendales, a score of equally
perfect men, paid well to show their all-but in public. Stay at home with a
magazine: it could well be For Women or Women on Top or another of the raft
of glossies that strip men bare. Even the Tate Gallery is planning an Images
of Masculinity show next year.
Why? Why has the male body replaced the female as an object of desire?
Explanations are as facile as the expression on the face of a Chippendale.
Fear of feminism, or perhaps a genuine distaste for projecting women as
sexual objects, has gripped the marketing world. Men are invariably
displayed in the media as wimps, and women as the superior breed.
Think of the Mercury commercial with the female executive, power-dressed to
her provocative pigtail, sorting out the telephone bill, or the car
advertisements which always feature women at the controls. Male nudity is
role reversal taken to its logical conclusion.
Or it could be the obsession with the perfect body - aerobics, health clubs,
all that Jacuzzi. A well-toned male, pectorals glistening, thighs firm,
hairless and hunky, can suddenly seem attractive, and thanks to the fitness
craze there are many more of them available. Men feel more beautiful. Then
there is the gay element. Plenty of rich homosexuals are in the market for
jeans, and for soft porn magazines.
Alternatively, perhaps it is because women have always wanted to gaze at
men's bodies but until now have not had the confidence or the cash to pursue
their requirements. That is the view of Nicki Pope, publicist for the
Chippendales. She sees the current exposure of the male body as fulfilment
of a secret want. But do women really get sexual excitement from gazing at
perfect men?
A good place to start researching this question is by sussing out the
Chippendales, the troupe of American beefcakes which is packing London's
Strand Theatre, and which has spawned a shoal of imitators. A visit suggests
something different. For a start, it is quite difficult for a man to
infiltrate the ritual. Somehow the management ensures that in an audience of
1,000 there might be just three men. Being made to feel an outsider, a
foreigner, is chastening.
The women were operating at full throttle. There was one group keeping up a
non-stop chorus of 'Off, off, off'. There was another going 'Ugga, ugga,
ugga' or so it sounded. There was the odd individual screaming 'Show us your
willy' - to no avail, for a Chippendale never goes all the way. There is
plenty of well-oiled bottom and pelvic thrusting. But a limp air pervades
the show.
Not that the girls mind. They are there for a good time, not for sex. They
are mainly gathered into the protective security of hen parties, enjoying
that important new social event, the girls' night out, when they can egg
each other on, let their hair down, get drunk, fall over - behave just like
men.
For all their exuberance, it is mainly bluster. When three girls are allowed
on stage to sit on chairs while a Chip strips before them, they turn to
stone. 'Rip it off,' shouts the audience.
But the trio looks sheepish, bemused, almost despairing. An evening at the
Chippendales allows women to assume a role, to enjoy a tease, to indulge in
the safest of safe sex.
Mind you, they make the show. The Chips are completely lacking in stage
presence. They take their glistening, oiled, hairless bodies extremely
seriously and do not join in the joke. They act as if the women share their
obsession with their bodies. They tease to order, strip for themselves.
If women go to the Chippendales for a laugh, they tend to have a more sombre
approach to the men in Women on Top, the most explicit of the new magazines
and one modelled very much on girlie equivalents. Pages of men, with their
knickers around their ankles, arouse more disdain than giggles. The deadness
in the faces and the roundness of bodies which suggest a life-style based
around the gym and the locker room, have little appeal. Women might buy a
copy out of curiosity but not one in my selective survey would subscribe.
The traditionally desirable male characteristics - sense of humour,
kindness, personality - keep their grip on women's affections, and these
cannot be conveyed on the screen, on the stage, or on paper.
The revival of interest in the male body is a salutary corrective, a
marketing development, but its niche in the market seems set to be small and
selective.

FT  29 AUG 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Saving the royals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL

<TEXT>
THE insouciance of the House of Windsor takes my breath away, leaves me
emerald with envy, for insouciance is the quality I rate above all others. I
am not talking about the distaff side of the family and their banal
cavortings, which should only be of interest to the bungaloid mentality. No,
I am talking about the males.
With all the hoo-ha of the past two weeks, you would have thought that the
Queen would have grounded the lot of them, confined them to Balmoral, locked
them in the snooker room and refused to let them out until they could
suggest three good reasons why she should let them out.
This she has not done, with the result that each morning they have been
filmed by the cameramen scuttling out of Balmoral and up to the slaughtering
fields, the moors and the streams, where - I shouldn't wonder - they
dynamite the salmon and call in the Royal Air Force to dive-bomb the grouse.
I am not saying that they do do, only that they might, though I expect they
are fairly sporting and only ask for Vulcans, which can be out-manoeuvred (I
have this on authority) by a lightning-witted grouse.
What the Queen needs to realise is that there are numerous folk like me who
are broadly in favour of monarchy, whatever its vicissitudes, but who are
capable of being nudged in the opposite direction (the guillotine,
republicanism) so long as members of her family continue to hunt, shoot and
kill: to associate themselves with what Tolstoy, speaking of hunting, called
'evil legitimised.'
So far this summer, Britain's newspapers, pandering to naff elements, have
lingered with delight on pool-side romps and sighing princesses - strictly
kid's stuff, fodder for the bungaloids.
Only The Observer, of the papers I read, has raised its sights to a gamier
issue: the legacy of feudalism and the scandal of land use and ownership
represented by what Ian Bell, on August 16, called 'the Lesser Tweedy
Aristocratic Prat in his natural habitat (the grouse moor), chirruping to
his fellows, preying on the defenceless and strolling about as though he
owned the place.' Usually he did own it; that was the trouble.
It is not just grouse murderers for whom I nurse contempt. I loathe the
whole business of hunting and killing. Many years ago, the FT's commodities
editor and his trusty side-kick used to lie in wait for me in a dive close
to the office where occasionally we repaired at the end of a strenuous day.
They would buy me a cocktail. Then they would mention whaling, of which they
greatly approved. Whales were a resource which floated around the oceans in
order to be harvested. They knew that whaling sickened me. But my boiling
point was low. They would drive me into emotionalism. It was very cleverly
done. So I never won the argument. I would start to weep and shout. A taxi
would have to be ordered; home I would be sent.
I am now older and wilier. I totally eschew cocktails. My head is always
clear. My boiling point has soared. And I am much better read, so that I am
starting to win arguments whenever my path tangles with that of the nerds
and twerps who play any sort of killing game.
The Killing Game is the title of the best, most venomous essay on hunting
you will ever need to read. It was written by Joy Williams and appears in
The Best American Essays 1991 (Ticknor &amp; Fields).
At the end of her essay, Williams says that 'hunters' self-serving arguments
and lies are becoming more preposterous as non-hunters awake from their
long, albeit troubled, sleep . . . Hunters are persecutors of nature who . .
. wield a disruptive power out of all proportion to their numbers . . .
Every year less than 7 per cent of the (US) population turn the skies into
shooting galleries and the woods and fields into abattoirs. It's time to
stop actively supporting and passively allowing hunting, and time to
stigmatise it. It's time to stop being conned and cowed by hunters . . .
time to stop thinking of wild animals as 'resources' and 'game,' and time to
start thinking of them as sentient beings that deserve our wonder and
respect . . . Hunters make wildlife dead, dead, dead . . . As for the
hunters, it's long past check-out time.'
I shall run off some copies and send them to Balmoral. A gesture like that
could help save the House of Windsor.
