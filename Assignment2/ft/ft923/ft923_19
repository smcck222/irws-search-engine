FT  22 AUG 92 / Ford to stop production for six days at Halewood plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD, the leading UK vehicle maker, is to stop production for six days in
September and early October at its Halewood car assembly plant in
Merseyside.
Its announcement came as Aston Martin, the specialist UK luxury sports
carmaker in which Ford holds a 75 per cent stake, revealed it was cutting
its workforce by about 16 per cent with the loss of 64 jobs.
Ford is being forced to reduce output in response to disappointing sales in
the UK and weakening demand from export markets.
The move follows Ford's announcement earlier this week that production would
be reduced at its car assembly plant in Dagenham, Essex, and at the Transit
van plant at Southampton. The company this week warned there was no sign of
any improvement in UK new car demand and said it saw 'no indication of any
real recovery before mid-1993'. With new car registrations so far in August
virtually unchanged from last year's depressed level, some carmakers are
being forced to cut production to reduce stock levels.
Halewood is already in the middle of a two-week period of single-shift
working in response to weak demand, but Ford yesterday said assembly would
be stopped completely for the week beginning September 21. In addition no
cars will be produced on Friday, October 2.
The latest measures at Halewood will cut output of about 5,500 Escort/Orion
cars and vans in addition to the reduction of 5,000 Fiestas at Dagenham and
1,245 Transit vans at Southampton next week. Aston Martin is to cut the
workforce at its Newport Pagnell plant from 388 to 324. Worldwide sales
totalled 121 last year compared with an average of 185 a year during the
previous 10 years.
It has now cut its workforce by 39 per cent during the recession.
Large vehicle fleet operators warned that new vehicle sales would continue
to decline and jobs would be at risk unless the government introduced
measures to stimulate demand.
The British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association said there was no
prospect of demand for new vehicles increasing this year or well into 1993
because of 'complete lack of confidence in the economy in the corporate
sector'.

FT  22 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets: Amsterdam pins hopes for recovery on
1993 - The dollar's weakness and poor company results have wiped out earlier
gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL SAYS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Amsterdam Stock Exchange appears to have given up hope of a recovery in
the second half of this year and is now pinning its hopes on 1993.
The bourse, which hit an all-time high in May and once seemed likely to
produce further gains during the rest of the year, has fallen sharply
recently, reflecting worries about the dollar, the gap between US and
European interest rates and the absence of a convincing recovery in the US
economy.
These problems have been compounded by Amsterdam's traditional sensitivity
to dollar weakness as well as by the gloomy first-half figures reported by
many Dutch companies. Some of these companies, particularly Hoogovens, the
steel group, and Hunter Douglas, the window-coverings maker, have lowered
their sights for the rest of the year, saying an improvement cannot be
expected until 1993.
Analysts say that the long-term perspective for Amsterdam remains good, with
prices expected to pick up again when the dollar rebounds and the economy
recovery in the US takes place. In the short term, however, the bourse is
expected to move sideways at best.
Mr Philip Menco, head of investment research at Theodoor Gilissen Bankiers,
does not rule out further declines before an improvement sets in. 'We could
see a small recovery at the end of the year, but the new hope now is the New
Year.'
Pierson, Heldring &amp; Pierson's analysts also say that the recovery will not
come before the end of 1992, but they project that the bourse could produce
a total 12-month return of 19 per cent by August 1993.
A key factor determining the pace of recovery is the dollar, which touched a
new post-World War Two low of Fl 1.62 yesterday. The Amsterdam Stock
Exchange, with its preponderance of companies with big international
operations, is more vulnerable than other European bourses to the dollar's
direction.
Mr Menco notes that the US generates 25 per cent of the turnover of Dutch
listed companies, after adjusting sales figures for the relative weight of
Dutch companies. A low dollar means lower profits when dollar-denominated
results are translated into guilders.
The current gloom - inspired in part by the Bundesbank's July 16
discount-rate rise and the subsequent fall in the dollar - is a far cry from
the heady days of May and June, when the bourse rallied on expectations of
an imminent recovery in the US economy. Cyclical shares, in particular,
surged, and these have now suffered the greatest falls.
In recent weeks, the CBS Tendency Index has given up all the ground it made
earlier this year. It started the year at 113.6, peaked at 131.4 on May 26,
but has since fallen back to close at 111.5 yesterday.
Defensive shares - food companies, publishers, banks and insurers - have so
far escaped major downward corrections. Heineken, the brewery group, has
even managed to buck the trend and rise by 4.4 per cent from the end of June
to stand at Fl 174.90.
The transport sector has fared badly, mainly because the dollar is far more
important to the revenue side of companies like KLM, Fokker and Nedlloyd
than to costs, which tend to be denominated in guilders. Although both
Fokker and Nedlloyd have hedged their dollar positions until the end of
1992, this has not prevented a slide in their share prices. Nedlloyd, which
barely escaped falling into the red in the first half, has plummeted by 36.7
per cent to Fl 36.90 since June 30, while Fokker has declined by 37.5 per
cent to Fl 19.50.
Fokker and Philips, the electronics group, have also been hit by factors
which go beyond currency concerns. Investors in Fokker were disappointed
when it became clear by late July that Deutsche Aerospace's plans to take a
51 per cent holding would not involve a public bid nor purchases on the open
market. Instead, the German company is to acquire its controlling share by
buying out part of the government's 32 per cent stake and by taking up a Fl
500m (Dollars 312m) issue of new shares.
As for Philips, its shares were shaken not only by a well-publicised plunge
in first-half results but also by doubts about the prospects of some of its
most promising consumer electronics products for the 1990s. The shares are
now trading at around Fl 23.60, some 40 per cent below their 1992 high of Fl
39.90.
Investor confidence has also been shaken in the bourse's newest arrival, the
consultancy engineers Fugro-McClelland. The company, whose partial flotation
at Fl 38 per share in April marked the only new listing in Amsterdam this
year, has seen its share price drop to less than Fl 23.50 since announcing
an unexpected decline in first-half results and reducing its full-year
forecast.
Fugro-McClelland's drop will do little to improve the climate for new
listings, which the bourse authorities are trying to promote to increase the
market's appeal and its liquidity.

FT  22 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Central bank action lifts
bourses briefly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BEAR rally in Tokyo, concerted, but ultimately ineffective central bank
support for the dollar and an early but short-lived rise on Wall Street gave
bourses scope for a technical rebound yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT digested the prospects of German recession and dipped to a new
1992 low, the DAX index touching 1,510.46 before it closed 6.96 higher at
1,520.02, 1.8 per cent lower on the week. Turnover fell from DM5.2bn to
DM3.9bn.
It picked up in the post-bourse, with leaders up by between 0.5 and 1.5 per
cent. Mr Andrew Thomson of Kleinwort Benson said that while share options
expired at the official close, options on the DAX future soldiered on into
the early afternoon and gave dealers the ability to respond to the support
for the dollar.
Carmakers - prime dollar stocks and depressed lately for that reason and
this week's slump in German registration figures - came back in the
afternoon. Volkswagen, which rose just DM1.50 to DM327 during the session,
stood at DM332 in London a few hours later.
Commerzbank said that Thursday's 6.7 per cent drop on its loans to Hafnia,
the Danish insurer, was exaggerated, but its stock recovered only DM2.50 to
DM223.
PARIS started off firmer, encouraged by US President George Bush's speech
overnight, but trading then quietened down until the afternoon when the
central bank intervention and the Dow's opening rally revived interest.
There was also some short-covering ahead of the close of the account on
Monday. The CAC-40 index ended up 20.00 higher at 1,744.18, down 0.5 per
cent on the week, in turnover of FFr1.5bn.
The rise in the index disguised underlying weakness in the market. Pechiney
International dropped FFr7.20 or 4.2 per cent to FFr163 after a slip in
first-half sales. Pechiney CIPs dropped FFr10.90 or 3.8 per cent to
FFr271.10.
Total dropped another FFr1.80 to FFr210.70 after Merrill Lynch downgraded
its rating on the stock earlier this week, while Euro Disney, also the
subject of negative broker comment, fell FFr2.10 to FFr73.50.
UAP fell to FFr362.50 on worries about its stake in Hafnia but closed steady
at FFr374.
MILAN was encouraged by Tokyo's gains but leading shares finished off their
highs. The Comit index rose 1.22 to 406.12, up 3.2 per cent on the week, in
turnover estimated at just L45bn after L59.8bn on Thursday.
Banca Commerciale Italiana shares held Thursday's advance in spite of
Mediobanca's denial of a press report that it was spearheading a plan on
behalf of a group of investors to buy out the state's majority stake in the
bank. The shares fell initially but then closed L26 higher at L2,525 in
volume of 3.2m shares.
Sip continued to fall on foreign selling, losing another L20 to L1,081 in
volume of 2.9m shares.
COPENHAGEN hit another new low, the CSE index slipping 1.49 to 288.48, 1.9
per cent down on a week which now excludes the suspended Hafnia. Another
insurer, Baltica, fell another DKr15 to DKr360 in a weak financial sector.
OSLO was overshadowed by the Uni Storebrand crisis, the insurer dropping
another NKr2.2 to NKr13.3 before Monday's board meeting which is expected to
arrange details of a rights issue to rescue the company. The all-share index
dipped 0.63 to 324.34 for a fall of 7.7 per cent on the week.
HELSINKI continued to focus on banking loan losses, the bank and finance
house index falling another 11.1 per cent, down 69 per cent from its 1992
high. The Hex index closed 24.0 down at 610.3, 35 per cent off its 1992 high
and 7 per cent lower on the week.
STOCKHOLM fell for the fifth consecutive session, as the Affarsvarlden
General index dropped 9.3 to 781.8, for a fall of 5.1 per cent on the week.
Turnover remained low at SKr382m.
Electrolux B shares fell SKr2 to SKr197 after the company said that
uncertainty regarding market trends had increased in recent months.
Nordbanken said that its shares will be delisted on August 27 now that
Venantius has more than 90 per cent of the equity. Venantius was set up by
the government to administer its holding in Nordbanken, which it was forced
to take over earlier this year in order to save the bank from collapse.
ZURICH saw rises in chemicals and banks as the SMI index put on 14.7 to
1,768.2, down 1.3 per cent on the week. Ciba-Geigy registered topped the
active list, rising SFr4 to SFr647 after a 12 per cent rise in first-half
profits. SBC bearers rose SFr7 to SFr238.
MADRID managed a rise on the day and on the week with gains in the general
index of 1.55 and 1.3 per cent respectively to 210.24. Heavy block trades
took turnover up to an estimated Pta14bn from around Pta4-5bn recently.

FT  22 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Currencies call the tune for equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONCERN over sterling unsettled UK equities again yesterday, restraining the
beneficial effects of another strong recovery in the Japanese equity market.
An early gain of 17 points on the FT-SE scale was cut back rapidly towards
the close as heavy central bank support for the dollar left the pound
slipping lower against the German currency.
The London stock market closed last night just before the final onslaught on
the US dollar, leaving equity traders to watch in nervous silence as the
latest currency rates marched across the trading screens.
The final reading put the Footsie at 2,365.7 for a gain on the day of 6.3.
Yesterday marked the close of the two-week equity trading account which has
seen the Index gain 15.6 points, or 0.7 per cent in volatile trading.
On the bullish side of the balance, the London market was relieved to see
the German Lombard rate left unchanged by the Bundesbank on Thursday. But
the outlook for UK interest rates has been challenged by the pound's
weakness in the ERM range, while stock market confidence has been dented as
poor corporate reports have revived dividend worries.
Share prices opened higher in London after a rise of 949.12, the third
successive daily advance, took the Nikkei Average above the important 16,000
benchmark again. Also helpful at first was the pound, which opened up
against the D-Mark.
Once again, trading volume increased yesterday as share prices struggled to
hold on to their early gains. The day's Seaq volume of 436.9m shares
compared with 425.9m in the previous session. However, Thursday's retail
business was worth only Pounds 822.7m, still on the low side for the UK
stock market. Although investors remained very cautious, there was demand
for utilities, and similar defensive stocks. Sterling's initial improvement
relaxed interest rates worries a little and store and consumer shares
rallied.
The market peaked early at 2,376.3, however, and became nervous when
sterling eased later in the session. Equities came off the top and the
dollar intervention steadied nerves only briefly before share prices
crumbled again.
The final half hour of business saw share prices slipping away in a nervous
stock market. Traders said that Monday's opening is likely to reflect the
fortunes of the pound in New York and the Far Eastern markets.
Retail turnover has remained well below profitable levels, and mostly below
the comparative daily totals for last year.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Week in the Markets: Cautious response to coffee rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON COFFEE traders, having repaired most of the damage done in their
market last week, yesterday remained far from bullish about the near-term
prospects for coffee prices.
As the December position closed at Dollars 752 a tonne, representing a rally
of Dollars 29 following last week's Dollars 40 setback, dealers noted that
the market remained extremely thin - average daily turnover was 2,772 lots
of 5 tonnes, compared with 5,581 in the corresponding week last year - and
suggested that more fundamental support was needed to lend strength to the
recovery.
Most thought the rise was a correction to a fall last week that had been
unduely influenced by the weakness of the New York coffee market. The market
for the mild arabica coffee variety that is traded in New York had become
heavily oversupplied and that had pushed prices down to 17-year lows. But
supplies of the coarser robusta type traded in London remained relatively
tight and dealers saw no reason why they should have followed last week's
fall in arabica prices.
New York coffee futures recovered from a fresh 17-year low of 51 cents a lb
reached on Monday and in late trading yesterday the December position was
quoted at 53.95 cents a lb, 0.55 cents up from the end of last week.
Brazilian and Colombian officials are to meet in Bogota on Monday to prepare
for the next round of talks on renegotiating the moribund International
Coffee Agreement. But Mr Celsius Lodder, director of the Brazilian
Department of Supply and Prices and one of the leaders of the Brazilian
delegation, was at pains this week to play down the significance of the
meeting. He said the countries, the two biggest coffee producers, frequently
met to exchange ideas prior to the London sessions. He added that they would
not be discussing a change in position at next week's meeting. 'We don't
think that a unilateral producers' accord would be appropriate,' he said.
Under the ICA producing and consuming countries co-operated in an export
quota system intended to ensure reasonable prices for growers. But the pact
collapsed in July 1989 when the two sides failed to reach agreement on
renegotiation proposals.
London cocoa prices began the week with an extension to last week's sharpish
fall, before recovering on trade buying in New York and deepening concern
about dry growing conditions in West Africa. But the more buoyant sentiment,
which lifted the December futures position to Pounds 657 a tonne on
Wednesday, quickly evaporated and by yesterday's close December cocoa was
quoted at Pounds 641 a tonne, Pounds 3 lower on the week.
At the London bullion market the gold price traded in a fairly narrow range
following last week's fall of Dollars 15.50 a troy ounce. After falling 20
cents yesterday on reports Middle Eastern selling the price closed at
Dollars 337.45 an ounce, up Dollars 2 on the week.
Platinum, which fell even more steeply last week - by Dollars 31 to Dollars
346.25 an ounce - continued the decline on Monday as market confidence was
hit by a further fall in Japan's Nikkei stock index. Japan is traditionally
platinum's chief buyer. But most of that day's Dollars 4.50 fall was
recovered on Tuesday, in response to a wave of Japanese buying, and a
Dollars 5.40 rise yesterday, encouraged by a rally in the Nikkei, left the
white metal Dollars 6 up on the week at Dollars 352.25 an ounce.
Trading at the London Metal Exchange remained in the doldrums and the only
substantial price movements were for copper and zinc, both of which were
firm.
The copper market reversed the downtrend of the past few weeks with cash
metal gaining Pounds 23.50 to close yesterday at Pounds 1,318.50 a tonne.
The rise started in New York on Monday night when short-covering was
prompted by concern that last week's 2.4 cents a lb fall had left the market
oversold. There were suggestions that the continuing rise was fueled by
locals (traders operating on their own account) who had been caught short by
the initial rally. After a pause for consolidation in mid-week the rise was
resumed, despite news that Polish copper workers had suspended their month
long strike.
Technical tightness appeared to be the chief factor behind the Dollars 27.50
rise in the cash zinc price to Dollars 1,364 a tonne, which defied a further
rise in LME warehouse stocks to a fresh record. The cash premium over the
three months price widened from Dollars 7 a tonne at the end of last week to
Dollars 29.25 at yesterday's close.

FT  22 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Late fall knocks generators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TWO main power generators fell in late trading as word reached the
market that Offer, the electricity industry watchdog, was turning up the
heat in its dispute with the companies over pool prices. Hints began to
circulate following a private lunch at SG Warburg attended by a top Offer
official and industry chiefs.
The row over pool prices has been rumbling since privatisation 18 months
ago. Last December, Offer found National Power and PowerGen had used their
dominant position in the market to push up prices. The companies were rapped
and the pool price system changed to halt the alleged abuses. However, this
summer has seen the number of complaints from industrial users rise again
prompting Offer's director general Prof Stephen Littlechild to write to the
power companies demanding an explanation last month.
Yesterday, the Offer official applied further pressure reportedly saying
that the explanations were not sufficient and the generators risked yet
another price inquiry if fuller disclosures were not forthcoming. Shares in
PowerGen which had been at 261p, up 6 1/2 , immediately fell back to close
at 253p, a net fall of 1 1/2 on the day. National Power ended at 232p, a
fall of 2, after being 4 ahead at one stage.
Tesco deal
An attempt to sell a block of 13.7m shares in Tesco achieved only partial
success, and a large chunk was left overhanging the market, sending the
shares into retreat. Securities house Hoare Govett, acting on behalf of a
large institution, was said to have brought the stock - around 0.7 per cent
of Tesco's issued share capital - to the market at 230p early in the
session.
However, suggestions that a big seller was around had been worrying the
share price for some days. The stock opened weaker, slipping from 234p to
230 1/2 p as the big share block showed itself in the market. Dealers
reported that less than half the shares had been taken up because of the
narrow discount to the market price. By the close, turnover in Tesco showed
only 6.6m traded, including one trade of 4.2m at the Hoare offer price.
Market sources indicated that the institution had withdrawn the rest of the
stock on offer. One analyst commented: 'Having a big, dissatisfied seller in
the market, waiting to sell, is bound to have a continuing unsettling effect
on the shares.' They closed off 4 at 230p.
Wellcome wanted
Among pharmaceuticals, shares in Wellcome shot forward as the publicity
shackles around the global share issue were removed and analysts who had
been tied into the sale of some 290m shares were allowed to express their
views. The stock opened firmly and held its gain all day to close 20 higher
at 822 with 6.1m traded.
Robert Fleming, the merchant bank heading the issue on behalf of governing
charity Wellcome Trust, announced yesterday that the 'green shoe' share
stabilisation operation had been lifted. Subsequently, US investment bank
Lehman Brothers boosted its stance to buy from neutral and said it had only
shaved its current year forecast by Pounds 5m to Pounds 505m despite the
impact on earnings of a weaker US dollar.
Hoare Govett reinforced its buy stance arguing that the shares were set to
outperform the sector now that the technical situation overhanging the stock
had been removed. Meanwhile, Mr Robin Gilbert of agency broker James Capel
said; 'Wellcome is the fastest growing health and household stocks in the UK
and we regard it as one of the most attractive drug stocks in the world.'
Yield attractions helped British Gas improve 7 1/2 to 244p with 13m shares
yesterday ahead of the privatised utility company's second-quarter figures,
due on Tuesday. At a time when dividends are being cut, Gas is seen as one
of the safest yield stocks in the market and particularly attractive to
income funds whose fingers have been burnt by the performance of stocks such
as BP. Forecasts range from a loss of Pounds 20m to a profit of Pounds 75m
but second-quarter figures are less significant than the winter numbers
because of the seasonal nature of Gas earnings.
Buyers of BP in the US were unable to match one large UK seller and the
shares fell 3 to 190p on turnover of 13m.
Water stocks finished a bright week with a flourish as the sector continued
to attract buyers on its defensive qualities and yield considerations. Among
the main movers were Severn Trent, ahead 13 at 419p, Southern 12 at 407p,
South West 14 to 423p and Thames 12 to 426p.
Similar qualities were being sought in the electricity utilities which,
together with the forthcoming unbundling of the electricity package, sent
shares forward. These included South West up 13 at 320p, Norweb 15 to 357p
and Manweb 13 to 350p.
Magazine publisher Reed International recovered from recent falls as SG
Warburg Securities published a comprehensive note reiterating its buy
recommendation on the stock. Warburg has cut its 1993 profit forecast by
Pounds 17m to Pounds 250m to reflect a slightly slower recovery than
anticipated and currency weakness in the US where Reed generates around 40
per cent of operating profits. However, the house argues; 'Reed is both
poised for early recovery and equally resilient if it arrives at glacial
speed.' Reed shares rose 12 to 460p.
Selling of Carlton Communications bonds was said to have affected attitudes
to the shares which slid 7 to 579p. The media group raised Pounds 64.25m
from a convertible bond issue a month ago to fund small acquisitions.
Agency broker James Capel was said to be negative on English China Clays and
the shares surrendered gains made earlier in the week on the back of a
squeeze, ending 14 down at 485p. Hartstone continued to recover, gaining 11
to 150p.
Vague talk, suggesting Tomkins was about to make a big acquisition caused
the shares to give up 4 to 430p. Thorn EMI's lighting division was said to
be in Tomkins' sights. Thorn shares rose 3 to 711p. Its security business
has been mooted to be wanted by Williams Holdings, which firmed 7 to 250p in
trade of 2.2m.
Insurance broker Willis Corroon fell 14 to 156p with County NatWest slashing
profit estimates by around Pounds 33m to Pounds 60m for this year and Pounds
61m for next. The house forecasts a halved dividend in 1993 and says the
shares are a sell down to 125p.
British Aerospace hardened 2 to 210p, with Henderson Crosthwaite the day's
main buyer. Mr Brian Newman at the agency broker believes the stock is
oversold and says the company has 'the highest sales to market
capitalisation in the FT-SE'. He expects new orders, both civil and military
to be announced soon.
Inchcape continued to benefit from an SG Warburg buy recommendation earlier
in the week and jumped 18 to 404p.
A stock overhang weakened Siebe and the shares gave up 7 to 606p.
A line of 250,000 BBA shares, reportedly on offer, weakened the stock 3 to
132p. There was a small agency cross carried out at 134 1/2 p. A squeeze
boosted TI Group and the shares firmed 7 to 269p.
Food group Booker retreated 8 to 378p following a Nomura downgrade.

FT  22 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCK index futures surrendered early gains as concern over sterling once
again dominated the market, writes Joel Kibazo.
The September contract on the FT-SE opened firmly at 2,385 on the back of
the overnight firmness in Tokyo, gently creeping forward reaching 2,395 just
before the mid-morning expiry of the FT-SE 100 option at 10.30am.
Concerns about sterling then gained the upper hand and September slipped
back, trading in a narrow range of 2,380 and 2,387 for the next few hours.
The additional weakening of sterling and the other fixed interest markets
sent September into further retreat. There was also sizeable selling,
particularly by independent traders, unwilling to go long at the end of the
account.
September eventually finished at 2,374, down 5 on its previous close and
around 8 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 12.
Turnover was a moderate 7,668.
The main feature in the traded options was the 10.30am expiry of the August
FT-SE 100 option. Turnover reached 22,572, with the FT-SE 100 trading 6,648
lots.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Money Markets: Futures fall sharply
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING futures prices fell sharply yesterday after the pound fell below
the DM2.80 level on the foreign exchanges.
Shortly before lunchtime, the September short sterling contract dipped 13
basis points from its opening level to 89.52, in expectation of dollar and
sterling falls during the day. At that level, dealers are probably pricing
in a rise in base rates of  1/2 a percentage point.
The contract, which is very sensitive these days to currency movements, was
stopped in its tracks as the Federal Reserve and European central banks
intervened in the foreign exchange markets to support the dollar, pushing
sterling up half a pfennig within several minutes.
But, for the fourth time running, the effect of the intervention appeared
limited and the contract failed to rally. The dollar fell through its
all-time low against the D-Mark, bringing sterling down with it and dealers
grew pessimistic about the prospects for a base rate rise. The September
contract closed at 89.45, down 20 basis points from its opening level. The
December contract closed down 24 basis points, at 89.42.
Period rates in the sterling cash market also firmed in the morning, as
dealers grew more concerned about sterling's plight. By lunchtime, three
month money, a key indicator of where the market thinks base rates are
moving, was offered at 10 7/16 per cent from a previous close of 10 5/16 per
cent.
After the dollar's fall, period rates firmed to levels that price in a 1/2 a
percentage point rise in UK base rates. Three month-money closed at 10 1/2
per cent on the offered side from a previous close of 10 5/16 per cent.
One-year money closed at 10 9/16 per cent on the offered side, its highest
level since base rates have been at 10 per cent.
The gloomy sentiment in the cash market was not helped by another large
shortage forecast, of Pounds 1.1bn, by the Bank of England. In the event,
the market took most of the day to make up the deficit.
In the morning, the Bank bought Pounds 71m of Band 1 Treasury bills and
Pounds 12m of Band 1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent, and Pounds 30m in a
repurchase agreement at 9 15/16 per cent. Later, the Bank bought Pounds 13m
of Band 1 Treasury bills, Pounds 714m of Band 1 bank bills and Pounds 56m of
Band 2 bank bills, all at 9 7/8 per cent. There was late assistance of
Pounds 390m.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar falls to all-time low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar fell through its all-time low against the D-Mark on the foreign
exchanges yesterday, despite concerted central bank intervention to support
the currency, writes James Blitz.
The US currency fell through its historic low against the D-Mark of DM1.4430
at around 1630 London time. Although foreign exchange trading was thin, the
currency fell fast after breaking support at that level. Within minutes it
had lost over a pfennig, but bottomed out at DM1.4345.
European currencies lost ground against the D-Mark in the dollar's wake.
Sterling closed at DM2.7970 against the D-Mark, setting another record low
since Britain joined the Exchange Rate Mechanism in October 1990. The
Italian lira was also weaker, closing at L762.2 from a previous close of
L760.
These are uncharted territories for the dollar/D-Mark exchange rate and
dealers are uncertain of what will happen to the dollar next week. Mr Neil
MacKinnon, chief economist at Yamaichi International in London, says that
the dollar could easily break support at DM1.40.
The dollar's fall came despite intervention earlier in the day from sixteen
central banks, led by the US Federal Reserve. They had intervened in a
generally thin market at around 1430 London time, buying the dollar when it
was at DM1,4480. Four more rounds of intervention followed.
Yesterday's operation appeared to be modest in size. Several dealers
suggested that central banks had spent between Pounds 500m and Pounds 1bn in
the market, although the Bank of Italy said that the intervention had been
'massive.' An economics analyst at a commercial bank in London also said
that his dealing room had seen intervention on a far greater scale than
normal.
An important requirement to turn the market is that dealers should be short
of the supported currency, so that when its exchange rate starts rising
there is a run to buy it. However, the market was well sated with dollars
yesterday, and one commercial bank reported some marked selling against the
intervention by corporate dealers.
The market has also shown a marked reluctance to buy high-yielding
currencies like sterling or the Italian lira on a Friday for fear that these
currencies could be devalued over the weekend.
With sterling now only a pfennig above its floor against the D-Mark in the
ERM, analysts expect the Bank of England to intervene to support the
currency early next week. However, the market is not necessarily short of
sterling and some dealers feel that intervention could be limited in effect.
The British Chancellor would then have no choice but to raise UK base rates.

Investors can choose to have interest paid monthly though this will be at a
lower rate than annual interest. The minimum transaction amount is Pounds
250. The account is advertised as instant access but withdrawals will be
subject to a penalty of seven days interest.
The minimum deposit is Pounds 5,000, compared with Pounds 2,500 in the Share
Account. There are three tiers. Interest rates start at 9.6 per cent gross
(annual) and 9.11 per cent (monthly) and the top rate is 10.2 per cent gross
on Pounds 25,000 or more (annual) and 9.66 per cent (monthly).

FT  22 AUG 92 / Markets (At A Glance): Barratt offers 8.5% mortgage
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Barratt, the building company, is offering 8.5 per cent mortgages fixed for
three years on its houses. It claims this is the cheapest rate for 14 years.
Several lenders are currently offering mortgages fixed for three years at
less than 10 per cent, but Barratt's offer undercuts almost all competition
by a clear percentage point. The deal applies to new Barratt homes at 200
developments nationwide, and older houses the company has taken in
part-exchange for purchases. Mortgages of up to Pounds 60,000 in the south
east, and Pounds 50,000 elsewhere, are covered by the deal, which is offered
to buyers who reserve a home between August 25 and September 30, and
exchange contracts by October 16. Three-year mortgage redundancy protection
insurance is available for loans of up to Pounds 100,000.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Markets (At A Glance): No-cost Pep from TR
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Touche Remnant is offering a personal equity plan investing in the TR
Smaller Companies Investment Trust, which is free of any charges to the
investor. There will not even be any charge for dealing or stamp duty.
However, Touche Remnant will receive an administration fee from TR Smaller
Companies. TR believes that this will be in the interests of shareholders
because any reduction in the trust's net asset value will be outweighed by a
reduction in the discount. The trust has not been particularly attractive
for Pep investors so far because it aims for capital growth rather than
income, but TR does not believe this will be an issue when there are no
direct charges to investors.
Meanwhile, smaller company shares in general continue to fall. The Hoare
Govett Smaller Companies Index (capital gains version) fell 0.2 per cent
from 1027.7 to 1026.05 in the seven days to August 20, while the County
Index fell 0.5 per cent to 815.69 over the same period.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Markets (At A Glance): Funds boost for life insurers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Life insurance sales figures for the second quarter of this year remained
healthy, although they bore testament to the UK's continuing recession,
according to industry-wide figures from the Association of British Insurers.
Life insurers still seem to be attracting fresh funds more successfully than
the building societies. Single premium pension sales, boosted by people
investing their redundancy cheques, continued to register strong growth,
rising 27 per cent to Pounds 1,450m. Meanwhile regular premium contracts,
which tend to require investors to have confidence in their long-term
employment prospects, did poorly, falling 10 per cent to Pounds 304m.

FT  22 AUG 92 / International Company News: Honda falls 26% as weak markets
take their toll

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SLUGGISH car sales pushed consolidated pre-tax profits at Honda Motor, the
Japanese car maker, down by 26 per cent to Y34.18bn (Dollars 270.24m) in the
first quarter of the financial year, which ended in June.
Sales, which includes motorcycles and other products, declined from
Y1,149.6bn to Y1,111.9bn, owing mainly to weak markets in the US and Japan.
Honda's performance in North America was particularly bad, with car sales
off by about 20 per cent to 203,000 units. The company said it had been hit
by tough competition from Ford, General Motors, and Toyota, all of which
gained market share at the expense of other Japanese makers. Honda also said
it was hurt by the economic troubles in California, where it has a high
concentration of sales.
In Japan, Honda's sales declined by 11 per cent to 168,000 units.
Total revenues from car sales fell by 5.3 per cent to Y897.1bn, while unit
sales were off by 10.9 per cent to 466,000 vehicles.
Unit sales of motorcycles rose by 6.4 per cent to 892,000 units, while
revenues grew by 6.4 per cent to Y149.9bn.
Net after-tax earnings declined from Y21.35bn to Y16.52bn.
In spite of the poor performance, Honda said yesterday it expected to meet
its net profits forecast for the full year of Y60bn, a 7.4 per cent decline
compared with last year.
SANYO Securities, a second tier Japanese securities house, yesterday said it
was considering asking its leading creditors for additional financing,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The move comes at a time when the slump in Japanese share prices and low
volumes on the Tokyo stock market are hurting revenues at the smaller
Japanese brokers.
Many Japanese brokers are expecting heavy losses for the interim term to
September. Sanyo said it had made a pre-tax loss of about Y9bn for the three
months to July, excluding depreciation costs.
Sanyo said it would ask Daiwa Bank, Bank of Tokyo and Nippon Credit Bank for
loans to boost its cash flow. The broker also said it was currently planning
a restructuring programme including the closure of its 12 domestic branches.

<TEXT>
BOMBARDIER, the Canadian aerospace and transit equipment group, says higher
sales of consumer products and a turnround in its consumer financing unit
brought a 25 per cent gain in second quarter net profit to CDollars 29.7m
(USDollars 25.1m), or 19 cents a share.
A year earlier Bombardier reported second quarter profit of CDollars 23.8m,
or 16 cents a share. Revenues were CDollars 974m in the latest quarter
against CDollars 692m a year earlier, mostly due to consolidation of De
Havilland Canada and UTDC, a transit equipment builder in Ontario.
In the first half ended July 31, profit was CDollars 62.4m, or 40 cents a
share, against CDollars 49.4m, or 34 cents, a year earlier, on revenues of
CDollars 1.9bn against CDollars 1.35bn.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A RETURN of confidence boosted Japanese shares yesterday, as investors
responded to the government's efforts to support the country's ailing
financial system and stock market.
The Nikkei average of 225 leading stocks jumped 6.2 per cent, closing 949.12
higher at 16,216.88. This was the first close above 16,000 for nearly a
month. The index, which plunged to a new six-year low on Tuesday, has
rallied more than 1,900 points during the past three trading days.
In addition to emergency support measures to help the beleaguered Japanese
banks, investors were encouraged by reports that the government is likely to
postpone the sale of a tranche of shares of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
scheduled for the current financial year.
The slide in NTT shares, triggered by concerns over the impact on the market
of the additional tranche, had dragged down the market during the past few
weeks.
NTT shares surged by 12.6 per cent yesterday, closing Y62,000 higher at
Y555,000 (Pounds 2,284). Buyers included foreign investors, whose ownership
of NTT was permitted at the beginning of this month. The government, which
still owns two thirds of NTT, postponed sales of 500,000 shares last year
because of sluggish market conditions.
Mr Mamoru Ozaki, deputy finance minister, said that although no decision had
been made, the ministry was discussing postponing share sales of NTT and of
JR East, a railway operation of the former state-owned Japan National
Railway.
The market now awaits next week's announcement of the government's fiscal
stimulus package, which will include a large-scale supplementary budget.
Ahead of the announcement, Mr Takeshi Nagano, president of the Nikkeiren,
the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations, called for emergency
economic measures.
Early next week, Mr Nagano will present proposals to Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the
prime minister, including a cut in the official discount rate, an additional
Y10,000bn in public investment spending and the establishment of a joint
fund to buy stocks to support the market.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Canary Wharf to share its bird's eye view
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON is once again to have its own panoramic viewing platform. But, unlike
the Eiffel Tower or Empire State Building, London's look-out point is miles
away from its most notable monuments.
One Canada Square, the steel-clad, 50-storey centrepiece of London
Docklands' Canary Wharf and the tallest building in the UK, is opening its
top floor to the public.
The decision to allow visitors has been taken to 'generate and maintain
interest in the Docklands', according to the administrators who were
appointed to the project in May.
At 800ft, the tower is 200ft higher than its nearest UK rival, the National
Westminster Tower in the City of London. On a clear day, the view from the
top can stretch for 30 miles.
Visitors will be charged Pounds 3 a person, but after additional security
and ticketing costs, this will do little to help the finances of the
project, which has debts estimated at Pounds 700m.
It will provide the first opportunity in nearly 20 years to visit the top of
the UK's tallest building. The 580ft Post Office tower (now the BT tower),
which held the record until the NatWest tower was built in 1980, has been
closed to the public since 1973, when a bomb exploded in the restaurant.
The Canary Wharf tower will be the tallest office building that can be
visited in Europe, since Frankfurt's 841ft 6in Messeturm is off limits to
visitors. However, an even loftier view is available from the the
iron-framed, 985ft 11in Eiffel Tower in Paris.
The tallest buildings in the US, the Sears Roebuck Building in Chicago and
the World Trade Center and Empire State Building in New York, also court
visitors. The world's tallest tower remains the 1,815ft CN Tower in Toronto,
while the UK's highest structure is the 1,265ft ITN mast in Lincolnshire.
The Canary Wharf tower will be open on Saturdays and Sundays, from 10am to
5pm, from September 12. On that weekend, the Docklands Light Railway will,
unusually, be open as it coincides with the European Oyster and Seafood
Fair, organised by the London Docklands Development Corporation.

FT  22 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: US markets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Before yesterday's intervention to support the dollar so spectacularly
failed, the US bond and equity markets were trying to digest Mr Bush's
keynote speech. The idea that taxpayers might be invited to 'tick the box to
reduce the deficit' was waved aside, and proposals to link tax cuts to
spending cuts were taken with an appropriately large pinch of salt. But
there was a sense that Mr Bush might be able to win voter support by pinning
Mr Clinton to a high tax, high spending platform.
Despite a slight fall in bond yields in response to the speech, the
political risks of the election have yet to filter through to the US
Treasury market. Equities are still less affected. As this year's election
in Britain showed, political factors can take a long time to feed through to
prices, and it may be well into September before opinion polls dominate
market movements. When the focus shifts, however, investors may begin to
suspect that the policies of either candidate could in practice mean higher
budget deficits.

FT  22 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Ratners
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Much of the horror of Ratners' delayed full-year figures had dripped into
the market already. The stark feature of the report is the scale of
management's mistakes which, as much as the recession, are responsible for
the company's ills. Mr Gerald Ratner's ill-timed remarks about his products
clearly had an impact on sales: turnover at the Ratners chain was down much
more sharply than at the group's other stores. A second strategic error was
the aggressive price-cutting promotion in the run up to Christmas, which
helped prop up turnover but eliminated profits. The notion of Mr Ratner as a
brilliant retailer laid low by financial problems clearly needs review.
That, however, is the past. For the future the banks seem to have decided
that the group has a chance of trading on a reasonably even keel, and that
anyway disposing of the assets under current conditions would be extremely
difficult. That idea is reinforced by the disclosure that the banks and the
company may allow holders of the Ratners convertible with a put option to
get their money this October, rather than triggering a default of the bonds
and provoking a more widespread re-financing.
Ratners will live to see another Christmas, although it may not be a
pleasant experience. The strategy of cost cutting and better sourcing may be
sensible but, with no encouragement from the economy, making any price
increases stick will be difficult. A loss still seems likely this year, and
while an operating profit is possible after that, delayed preference
dividends are mounting up at some Pounds 27m a year.
The idea of the shares as option money has not changed and, in any event,
the company has only a stay until next June. If the business then is worth
less than the accumulated debts, the banks may demand equity as the price of
further support.

<TEXT>
London equities have been transfixed over the past few days by the headlight
glare of grim economic tidings and sterling's increasingly fragile position
within the ERM. In generally thin turnover the FT-SE managed a 9-point gain
on the week, but there was nothing convincing about this performance. The
good news for investors is that shares at current levels are probably
discounting lowered expectations for GDP in the second half. Next month's
interim corporate reporting season will doubtless bring fresh shocks - not
least because it is dominated by housebuilders and contractors - but in key
sectors share prices have at last been falling faster than expectations for
earnings. No doubt this reflects diminishing faith in analysts' current
forecasts.
Ford's announcement that it is putting Dagenham on a three-day week from
September will hardly help confidence, not least when politicians are back
at work to exploit it. The main threat, however, continues to come from a
rise in interest rates if the government is eventually forced to step in to
defend the pound. With three-month money market rates over 10.45 per cent
last night the risks remain acute.
Shares will no doubt dip in despair if the worst finally happens -
reflecting the inevitable damage to consumer confidence - though more
sanguine investors will conclude that such a move would be relatively
short-lived and then reversed.

FT  22 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: D-Day for the dollar
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A cynical view of yesterday's disastrous intervention to support the US
currency is that it was orchestrated by the Federal Reserve to save the
newly endorsed Candidate Bush the embarrassment of an all-time dollar low
against the D-Mark. Whatever the rationale, the exercise backfired. Central
banks bought dollars in insufficient size at a time when the market was
already braced for such action. Little wonder that foreign exchange dealers
were immediately emboldened to test the real resolve of the authorities.
Supporting the dollar was always going to be an uphill struggle while the
market believes the interest rate differential between the US and Germany
could widen. But yesterday's action raises questions about the credibility
of internationally co-ordinated exchange rate policy.
The subsequent performance of US financial markets underlines that currency
weakness is not just a political embarrassment. Yesterday's sharp fall on
Wall Street reflected anxiety that further interest rate cuts are not on the
cards for the moment. Perhaps more seriously, higher bond yields will, if
sustained, make it more difficult for the US government to fund the deficit
and increase the cost of long-term funding for companies.
European central banks which joined yesterday's intervention - not least the
Bank of England - also had a legitimate interest in propping up the dollar
and softening the D-Mark to ease pressure within the ERM. Sterling's close
in London below DM2.80 for the first time since joining the mechanism leaves
it less than three pfennigs from the level at which intervention, or a rise
in interest rates, is mandatory. With a month still to go before the French
referendum on Maastricht, that leaves little room for further jitters.

reverse

Wall Street
THE PLUMMETING dollar sent US stock markets into sharp decline yesterday
after President Bush's speech at the Republican convention failed to give
equity sentiment much of a lift, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 50.79 at 3,254.10,
its lowest since April 9 and the biggest single-day decline of the year. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished down 3.39 at 414.87, the
Amex composite was 1.56 lower at 384.31 and the Nasdaq composite was down
4.15 at 563.71. Turnover on the New York SE was heavy at 204m shares.
The main influence on the markets was the dollar which, despite concerted
intervention by central banks worldwide, fell to its lowest point ever
against the Deutschmark at DM1.4310.
Although currency factors rarely effect the stock markets, the dollar
weakness means the Federal Reserve has almost no room to cut interest rates
again if it believes the economy needs more help. The falling dollar also
sent bond prices into reverse, which also upset equity investors.
Sentiment was not aided by reaction to Mr Bush's acceptance speech at the
Houston convention. Although it was a political success, economists did not
rate highly his proposals to boost the economy.
Among individual stocks, USX-Marathon fell Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 18 1/4 in
turnover of 2.9m shares on speculation that tight cash flows might force the
energy company to cut its high-yield dividend, due to be paid at Dollars
1.40 a share.
Goodrich dropped Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 40 1/2 in heavy trading on reports
that the sector analyst at top investment bank Goldman Sachs had reduced his
estimate for the company's earnings.
Presley dropped Dollars 1 to Dollars 2 7/8 on reports that a securities
class action lawsuit had been filed against the housebuilder relating to its
initial public offering last year.
On the Nasdaq market Autodesk bucked the trend with a gain of Dollars 3 1/8
to Dollars 45 1/8 on Thursday's late news that the company would sell its
two subsidiaries that make up the information systems division.
Hadco was another rare gainer, climbing Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 5 5/8 after
the company's board authorised the purchase of up to Dollars 4m of common
shares in the open market.
Canada
TORONTO stocks ended the week on a losing note, in continued moderate
trading.
The composite index fell 13.34 points, or 0.39%, to 3,390.32. On the week,
the index was up about 22 points. Losing issues edged winners by 258 to 240,
volume rose to 23.745m shares from 22.978m and trading value was CDollars
341.5m against CDollars 266.9m.
Mexico's stock market lost 4.0 to 1,435.0 by 10.30 am yesterday, its lowest
this year and 25 per cent off the 1992 high, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico
City. Investors are concerned about the slowdown in the economy, uncertainty
in the US elections and accordingly tentative prospects for the North
American Free Trade Agreement. High interest rates are also attracting money
from the equity market into the money markets.

CONFIDENCE spread among investors that share prices had hit the bottom and
the Nikkei average surged 6.2 per cent to recover the 16,000 level for the
first time since July 23, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei closed 949.12 better at 16,216.88, the day's high and 9.4 per
cent higher on the week. It opened at the day's low of 15,294.56 and posted
firm gains on short-covering and small-lot buying by investment trusts,
dealers and foreign investors.
Volume rose to 430m shares from 300m, above 400m for the first time since
May 14. Gainers overwhelmed losers by 1,014 to 35, with 26 unchanged, the
Topix index of all first section stocks gained 87.93, or 7.6 to 1,251.70
and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 3.49 to 1,042.20.
Analysts said that share prices could have hit the bottom for the time
being. 'The worst seems to be behind us for this phase,' said Mr Peter
Tasker, strategist at Kleinwort Benson.
Reports that the government had decided to postpone the sale of Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone shares also encouraged sentiment. A leading business
daily also reported that the ministry of finance was requesting the ministry
of transport to postpone the listing of JR East, one of the former railway
operations of Japan National Railway.
The ministry of finance later denied the reports, and the ministry of
transport restated its hopes of listing the JR East shares this autumn.
However, investors actively sought NTT, which advanced Y62,000 to Y555,000.
Bank shares were strong, with Nippon Credit Bank rising by its daily limit
of Y500 to Y5,000 and Mitsubishi Bank Y300 higher at Y2,200.
Real estate companies also rallied, with Mitsui Fudosan rising by its daily
limit of Y100 to Y975 and Mitsubishi Estate also advancing by its daily
limit of Y100 to Y914.
In Osaka, the OSE average surged by 1,080.27 to 17,504.63 in volume of 41.6m
shares.
Roundup
THE REST of the region offered a mixed response to events in Tokyo.
TAIWAN rose 3.6 per cent, the weighted index closing 133.16 higher at
3,866.22, but still 1.2 per cent lower on the week.
SINGAPORE put in its third consecutive rise, this time on selective
bargain-hunting, the Straits Times Industrial index ending 23.72 higher at
1,347.31.
HONG KONG registered a moderate recovery after a 2.5 per cent fall on
Thursday, utilities rising sharply as the Hang Seng index climbed 27.78 to
5,509.39, down 5.4 per cent on the week. Turnover fell from HKDollars 3.86bn
to HKDollars 2.62bn.
Hong Kong Telecom gained 20 cents to HKDollars 8.70 while Hong Kong &amp; China
Gas jumped 30 cents to HKDollars 13.10.
SEOUL fell for the second day on concerns about political instability
arising from the government's decision to award the nation's first private
mobile telephone operating licence to the Sunkyong Group, which has ties to
President Roh Tae Woo. The composite index fell 8.63 to 459.07, down 4.1 per
cent on the week.
AUSTRALIA closed stronger, taking its direction from the in Tokyo. The
All-Ordinaries index closed up 5.7 at 1,559.3, a rise of 0.7 per cent on the
week in turnover of ADollars 230m. BHP closed unchanged at ADollars 13.00.
NEW ZEALAND's NZSE-40 index fell 10.82 to 1,480.24, up 0.6 per cent on the
week, on continued weakness in blue chips. Turnover, boosted by a big block
sale in Salmond Smith Biolab, rose to NZDollars 48.5m from NZDollars 22.5m.
Salmond Smith fell 15 cents to NZDollars 2.60 after Transco Investments of
Singapore sold 9.3m shares or 35 per cent of the company at NZDollars 2.41 a

FT  22 AUG 92 / International Company News: Electrolux declines to SKr758m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ELECTROLUX of Sweden, one of the world's largest white goods manufacturers,
yesterday reported a decline in its first-half profit after financial items
to SKr758m (Dollars 143.76m).
This contrasts with a SKr917m profit for the same period of last year but
exceeds the forecast level.
The company explained that the 1991 profit figure for the first half
included SKr184m worth of capital gains from divestments and if adjust-ment
was made for that non-recurring item its profit for the first half of this
year actually rose by 3 per cent.
The company's profit after financial items for the second quarter of the
year was SKr505m, virtually unchanged from the figure for the April-June
period of 1991.
Sales rose by 1 per cent after adjustments for acquisitions and divestments
in the first half to SKr40.8bn while in the second quarter sales were down
slightly to SKr21.34bn from SKr21.52bn for the same period of last year.
Earnings per share after tax were SKr3.50 in the first half compared with
SKr6.70 for the same period of 1991 while the rate of return on equity after
full tax was 3 per cent compared with 6 per cent for the January-June period
of last year.
Commenting on the market position, Mr Leif Johanson, Electrolux chief
executive, said that uncertainties had increased in recent months over what
market trends might be for the second half of the year.
While demand in Europe had grown gradually weaker, mainly in the Nordic
region, the US recovery would 'probably continue to be slower and weaker
than anticipated'.
He emphasised that despite relatively low profitability and weak markets,
Electrolux would press on with the development of new environmentally
friendly consumer products as well as strengthen the com-pany's brand name
products globally.
The household appliance division enjoyed a sales increase to SKr22.97bn in
the first half of the year from SKr22.69bn with half the rise coming from a
sales increase by Lehel, the Hungarian white goods company.
In the Nordic region and Britain there was a drop in sales volume for white
goods while in North America volume sales increased.
There was a modest rise in sales of commercial appliances to SKr4.39bn in
the period from SKr4.37bn for the same period of 1991 but operating income
and profitability were 'considerably lower' than for the first six months of
last year.
Operating income for industrial products stayed unchanged while sales fell
to SKr7.29bn from SKr7.45bn in that sector due mainly to lower invoicing and
divestment of operations within its Granges business activities.
By contrast the company reported an improved operating profit in its outdoor
products range with a slight increase in its sales to SKr5.76bn in the first
six months from SKr5.58bn

FT  22 AUG 92 / International Company News: Public spotlight about to fall
on a rare player in global business - Profile of a woman who through her
career has developed a reputation for financial innovation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some time over the next year the World Bank will launch its first
D-Mark-denominated global bond. And the bank's new treasurer, who played a
key role in the development of the global bond programme, will enjoy a brief
moment in the public spotlight.
The attention accorded to Ms Jessica Einhorn will undoubtedly focus on the
fact that, as a woman, she is a rarity in the upper echelons of
international finance. Yet her experience, and a record of innovation in the
capital markets, rather than her gender has helped Ms Einhorn achieve her
current status of treasurer and vice-president of the World Bank.
The appointment of Ms Einhorn, 45, a veteran of the US Treasury and the
State Department, was announced six months ago. She had ample time to
prepare for the job of treasurer, working since 1981 for her predecessors Mr
Don Roth, the former Merrill Lynch executive, and Mr Eugene Rotberg, who
became something of an institution in the Euromarkets during 19 years in
charge of the bank's finances.
Mr Rotberg has high praise for Ms Einhorn: 'There are very few people in the
world who understand the intricacies of international finance and fewer
still who also have experience in public policy. She has considerable skills
in both fields.'
It was thus no surprise when Mr Lewis Preston, World Bank president, gave Ms
Einhorn the job of directing a staff of 250 people, raising about Dollars
17bn a year, managing Dollars 20bn of liquidity and looking after total
outstanding debts of Dollars 97bn. 'Jessica set up the World Bank's entire
currency swap programme in the early 1980s, and she was part of the team
that invented the global bond in 1989, and she used sophisticated hedging
techniques to restructure the bank's financial policies,' says Mr Rotberg,
adding: 'She knows everybody.'
Her mentors have included Mr Paul Volcker, former chairman of the Federal
Reserve, and Mr Jack Hennessy, former assistant secretary of the Treasury
and now chief executive of First Boston, the Wall Street investment house.
Mr Hennessy says he first hired Ms Einhorn 20 years ago when she came to
interview him at the Treasury. After working for Mr Hennessy and for Mr
Volcker at the Treasury, she went on to become special assistant to the
under-secretary of state for economic affairs, specialising in international
monetary affairs.
Between 1977 and March 1981, when she joined the World Bank treasury, Ms
Einhorn studied bank lending to developing countries at the Brookings
Institute, spent a year on the financial policy side of the World Bank and
15 months back at the State Department as a senior official in the
International Development Co-operation Agency.
It was, however, in the early 1980s that Ms Einhorn first placed her
imprimatur on the World Bank's finances. Although Mr Rotberg was the
treasurer, she led the team that restructured the bank's borrowing programme
to meet the demands of rapidly changing world financial markets.
Against the background of volatile, and historically high, world interest
rates, Ms Einhorn shepherded the bank through a series of changes in its
borrowing policy, including a move from fixed-rate to variable-rate
borrowing, greater use of the short-term debt markets, and the pioneering of
currency swaps. By shifting to variable-rate financing, the bank wanted to
avoid locking in high long-term rates on its debt and ensure its loans were
funded with matched liabilities as part of its increasingly flexible
borrowing programme.
At the same time, she helped the bank to expand its activities in short-term
debt markets - most notably through its discount notes, a form of commercial
paper with maturities of up to a year.
In 1982, Ms Einhorn helped engineer what is believed to be the world's first
currency swap, when the World Bank swapped dollars in return for Swiss
Francs with US computer giant IBM. The use of swaps developed rapidly,
allowing the bank to raise funds in currencies that did not match their core
liabilities, and providing access to new markets.
Not all of Ms Einhorn's new borrowing tools were a success. In 1984, for
example, the bank introduced the 'T-bill based floater'. This was
medium-term paper priced in relation to the yield on the US Treasury bill
rather than the usual Libor (London Interbank Offered Rate). However, it
never took off because investors mostly wanted Libor-indexed debt.
The most successful innovation during Ms Einhorn's tenure managing the
bank's borrowings was probably the global bond, introduced in 1989. It is a
large (more than Dollars 1bn) international debt security which the bank
places simultaneously in major financial centres around the world. Thanks to
special trading and multiple clearing arrangements, the bonds can be bought
or sold across all world markets at relatively narrow spreads.
Seven global dollar or yen bond issues have so far been launched, and this
year a D-Mark issue will be launched. The great advantage of global bonds
for the bank is that they widen the pool of available investors and allow
the bank to consolidate its underwritten borrowings into a small number of
large transactions.
Given her role in the birth of the product, it is fitting that the first
D-Mark global bond will be sold under Ms Einhorn's stewardship. Today,
however, she has less time for the pioneering work she enjoyed during the
1980s: 'When I was the young staff person my job was to help innovate, but
now my task is to make sure these innovations meet all the other standards
for our balance sheet.'

<TEXT>
SANDVIK, the Swedish spe-ciality steel and carbide group, reported a 13 per
cent drop in its first half profits to SKr903m (Dollars 171m), from
SKr1.03bn for the same period of 1991. In-voiced sales also fell 3 per cent
to SKr8.58bn from SKr8.82bn while the order intake dropped to SKr8.86bn from
SKr9.04bn.
The company said there was no sign of cyclical recovery in its product area
to benefit sales for the rest of the year so the profit for 1992 would be
lower than the SKr1.92bn last year.
Demand remained slack, said Sandvik, mainly because the global recession was
now hitting Germany and Japan while the upturn in the US was 'still
hesitant'. Latin America, it added, was showing a 'strong recovery' with a
40 per cent improvement in the company's invoiced sales to that area.
Sandvik reported an impressive 47 per cent growth in sales in its saws and
tools product division to SKr1.05bn from SKr721m. By contrast its cemented
carbide activities suffered a 6 per cent decline in sales to SKr4.37bn from
SKr4.68bn over the period and steel a 9 per cent fall to SKr2.60bn from
SKr2.87bn.
Return on investment over the past year was 11.5 per cent, down from 13.1
per cent for 1991 as a whole. Earnings per share after estimated full tax
during the past year dropped by 6 per cent to SKr25.10 from SKr31.20.

SUPERFOS, the Danish construction, chemicals and packaging group, said
advances by its packaging, road-building and chemical divisions resulted in

compared with DKr12m in the same period last year.
The group said its grain and feedstuff activities had done well in spite of
poor prices and forecasts that its whole year 1992 result would be much
better than 1991's DKr158m profit after tax and minorities. Superfos gave no
exact estimate of its expected result for the whole of the year, but its
first-half 1992 net profit after tax and minorities was DKr29m, compared
with DKr10m for the same period in 1991.

FT  22 AUG 92 / International Company News: German bank hits back at
downgrading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COMMERZBANK yesterday became the second large German financial institution
within a matter of weeks to hit out at DB Research, the research arm of
Deutsche Bank.
Mr Ulrich Ramm, Commerzbank's chief economist, denounced DB Research's
conclusion that its earnings would fall by DM5 per share this year and next
because of its exposure to Hafnia, the Danish insurance company which
suspended payments to its creditors on Wednesday.
The downgrading from DB Research, based on the assumption that Commerzbank's
exposure to Hafnia was in the region of DM300m (Dollars 202.7m), helped
precipitate a near 7 per cent fall in Commerzbank's share price on Thursday.
Earlier this month, DB Research downgraded its forecasts for Allianz, the
Munich insurance company which had just issued disappointing figures for
1991. The sell note prompted a sharp fall in the Allianz share price - and
an angry response from Allianz.
'In its lack of knowledge of the actual situation DB Research has come to
the extreme and premature assumption that the quota of losses on credit to
Hafnia will be high,' Mr Ramm said. 'This looks extremely unlikely from the
point of view of the creditor banks.'
While DB Research downgraded its 1991 estimates from DM25 to DM22 per share
and next year's from DM27 to DM25, Mr Ramm said Commerzbank's own analysts
had as yet no reason to revise their estimate of their parent bank's
earnings. Mr Ramm pointed out that operating profits climbed by 17.5 per
cent to DM975m in the first six months of the year and that the bank was
extremely positive about business developments in the current half.
The two downgradings have led to speculation that Deutsche Bank itself has
been trying to encourage selling of shares in rival financial institutions.
Deutsche Bank denied this yesterday, saying that DB Research was independent
and its investment recommendations were not approved by the bank's
management board, no matter how sensitive.
Despite Commerzbank's good interim figures, it has a balance sheet weaker
than those of its competitors, not helped by an exposure of some DM560m to
Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian property group.

FT  22 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Waterford Wedgwood seeks 500 job cuts by
end of year

WATERFORD Wedgwood, the luxury ceramics and crystal manufacturer, is to make
a quarter of the 1,900 workforce at its troubled Waterford plant in southern
Ireland redundant in what is likely to be a make-or-break effort to return
the division to profitability.
Mr Paddy Galvin, Waterford Crystal's chairman and chief executive, said the
company was seeking 500 voluntary redundancies by the end of the year, after
which a compulsory redundancy scheme would be implemented.
The company was also seeking across-the-board wage and piece-rate reductions
for those remaining, a pay freeze until February 1994 and an industrial
peace agreement for an initial period of five years.
Mr Jimmy Kelly, one of the union leaders at the plant, said yesterday that
the workforce was deeply dismayed by the decision and added that industrial
action 'could not be ruled out'. He said it could be several weeks before
all the options had been discussed and a decision taken.
However, Mr Galvin warned that strike action 'would create a most awful
situation for us . . . we would not come out the other end. We will not
survive a strike'. The crystal division of the company has not made a profit
since 1986 and in the intervening five years has lost some IPounds 66m
(Pounds 62.5m).
When rationalisation was attempted in 1990, a crippling 14-week strike
costing IPounds 10m ensued. Since then some 400 workers have left via
voluntary redundancy and short-time working was introduced in an effort to
further reduce overheads.
Currently, most of the skilled glass blowers and cutters are working only
about seven days a month. In the year to December 31 1991 losses were
trimmed to IPounds 1.2m, but sales have continued to decline on the
company's traditional product lines due to the ongoing recession.
The company has also said that it intends importing new lines of crystal to
market under the Waterford brand name in a further effort to reduce costs.
This measure has further upset the unions who fear that even with the coming
round of redundancies, the gradual move to overseas manufacture will
eventually result in the closure of the Waterford plant anyway.
Redundancy terms are currently based on the number of years service with the
company.
Waterford has spent approximately IPounds 10m on redundancy pay since the
1990 strike, and is likely to face a similar bill on the next round of
redundancies.

FT  22 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Kalon loses battle for control of Manders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KALON's hostile Pounds 86m bid for rival Manders (Holdings) has failed. The
paint maker lapsed its offers after it had only received acceptances in
respect of 7.82m Manders ordinary shares, or 21.2 per cent of its target, by
1pm yesterday when the bid closed.
Mr Roy Amos, Manders chairman, said that he was very pleased, 'especially
about the 500 jobs' which would have been lost had the bid succeeded.
He added that the '80 per cent support was a pat on the back for the
management from shareholders' and repeated that 'the bid didn't properly
value Manders, a firm, well-spread business'.
He compared his paint, ink and property group favourably with Kalon, 'which
has a lot of eggs in one big basket'.
For his part, Mr Mike Hennessy, Kalon group managing director, said he was
'puzzled about what judgments people make on group performance and
management records'. He suggested: 'Kalon's success has caused some
suspicion, and if we had had, say, only 20 per cent annual improvements, we
would be thought a fine company.'
He conceded that the climate was 'not good for hostile bids or mergers -
agreed bids are the only acceptable route'.
The beginning of the end of the bid came last weekend, he said, when British
Steel Pension Fund, which holds 22 per cent of Manders' equity, announced it
would be rejecting the offer. Other shareholders then abstained, feeling it
was a lost cause, he said.
Kalon's bid valued Manders shares at 232p, or 241p with the partial cash
alternative. Last night Manders shares eased 2p to 186p and Kalon's gained
1/2 p to 82 1/2 p.

FT  22 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Mystery group buys 10% of Simpsons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIMPSONS of Cornhill, owner of the famous City chop house, yesterday began
urgent moves to discover the identity of a mystery buyer who has acquired an
unpalatable 10 per cent stake in the group.
Directors of the Nottingham-based company, which owns two of the City's
favourite watering-holes - Simpsons and the Jamaica Inn - fear the stake may
be used by disgruntled shareholders to force through a resolution calling
for board changes at an extraordinary general meeting scheduled for next
Thursday.
The stake has been acquired by Mountjoy, an offshore company registered in
the Turk and Caicos Islands. Keen to identify who lies behind Mountjoy, the
company has begun a 212 enquiry to force Mountjoy to name the beneficiaries
of its 10.135 per cent shareholding.
If the stake is controlled by the group of dissident shareholders led by Mr
Robert Klapp, former chairman of Select Appointments, it could raise
pressure on the board to accept a shake-up in the control of the company.
The dissidents are already thought to hold more than 35 per cent of the
shares and a further 10 per cent stake would improve their chances of
electing two new directors including Mr Klapp.
Their stakes are thought to include a 20 per cent shareholding currently
owned by Mr David Rowland, the entrepreneur. Mr Klapp has agreed to buy his
shares and expects to complete the deal on Monday.
Mr Klapp's group claims the board is out of touch with the tough trading
conditions in London, where this year the restaurant business has been as
flat as a Simpsons beer mat.
It also maintains the board has embarked on a costly expansion plan which
has seen it acquire the upmarket Dell'Ugo restaurant in Soho and the Palio
Restaurant in west London.
The company's Pounds 2m flotation on the USM last August provided the funds
to buy Simpsons and the Jamaica Inn. The company, however, is healthier than
some of its clients, according to Mr John Glover, Simpsons business
development director.
'In the 20 weeks to December last year we had a turnover of Pounds 500,000,'
he said. 'We are doing well and we're always looking for investment
opportunities.'
Dismissing the chances of the dissident resolution being accepted, he added:
They 'have nothing to offer.'

FT  22 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Banks extend Ratners borrowing facilities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RATNERS GROUP has won a breathing space from its banks which have agreed to
extend the jewellery retailer's borrowing facilities until June next year.
In return the banks have imposed more stringent covenants and higher
interest rates. Mr James McAdam, executive chairman, said the new banking
terms were 'not unreasonable'.
The agreement with the banks will allow Ratners to meet the Pounds 58.5m
redemption of its convertible bonds in October, so long as the payment does
not breach the covenants or require new funds from the banks. The banks and
bondholders have been given security over some of the group's assets.
Ratners shares fell  1/2 p to 11 1/2 p yesterday.
The group has agreed a business plan with its banks which, if adhered to, is
expected to allow the company to repay the bonds and eventually return to
profitability. Mr Gary O'Brien, finance director, said 'it is critical that
we perform to the plan.'
The plan involves 180 store closures in the UK and 150 in the US, over the
next three years. Gross margins will be pushed up, and the chains will
pursue a more tightly focused marketing strategy. Cost savings, totalling
around Pounds 50m a year, are being made and working capital is being cut
sharply to release cash.
Ratners also announced much delayed results for the year to February 1, with
losses before tax of Pounds 122.3m (profits Pounds 112.1m) in line with
expectations. It said trading conditions worsened sharply in the second half
of last year, with sales substantially below expectations in the crucial
Christmas trading period. Sales have fallen again in the first half of the
current year.
Group sales rose marginally to Pounds 1.13bn (Pounds 1.11bn) because of the
inclusion for a full year of Kay, the US chain bought late in 1990. Apart
from Kay and Salisburys, the UK chain selling handbags and luggage where
sales rose 3 per cent on a comparable basis, all Ratners chains suffered
sales falls.
Sales in the Ratners chain itself fell 24 per cent in the year on a
comparable store basis, the decline worsening after the now infamous 'crap'
remark made by Mr Gerald Ratner, chief executive, about one of the group's
products in a speech in April last year.
Operating profits dropped from Pounds 134m to Pounds 1.4m. The fall was
largely accounted for by lower gross margins as prices were cut in an
attempt to regain sales, particularly in the pre-Christmas period. This was
estimated to cost Pounds 35.9m. At the same time operating costs rose
sharply, costing an extra Pounds 113m.
Exceptional costs amounted to Pounds 98m (Pounds 2m) as the group predicted
in May when it finalised its business plan. These costs cover stores
closures, asset and stock write-downs, bad debts and reorganisation. After
tax of Pounds 3.62m (Pounds 36.4m) and dividends, largely payments on the
group's preference shares which are now being rolled up, of Pounds 22.7m
(Pounds 44.4m), there was a retained loss of Pounds 149m (profit Pounds
24.5m).
After paying an interim dividend of 2.4p (same) there is no final dividend.
At the year end total debt was Pounds 480m (Pounds 362m) offset by cash of
Pounds 257m (172m). Shareholders funds were Pounds 303m (Pounds 398m).
Working capital was Pounds 296m (Pounds 360m).

FT  22 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Future based on a Maxmin maxim - Plans to
revive Laura Ashley's flagging fortunes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHATEVER ANYONE else might think, Jim Maxmin is quite clear that the Laura
Ashley group is not a retailer.
In spite of running 547 shops in 26 countries, the chief executive of the
fabrics and furnishings group believes that Laura Ashley is a brand, not a
retail concept.
Its salvation lies in marketing the unique allure of Laura Ashley, whether
by posting the name above its retail outlets or licensing it on an
ever-expanding range of products - stretching from bed linen to perfumes.
By doing so, Mr Maxmin believes Laura Ashley can revive its fortunes by
carving out a lucrative and defensible market niche. Rivals may be able to
match the company's products and run their operations more efficiently. But
the Laura Ashley lifestyle concept gives the company a distinctive and
intangible edge. 'If it costs money you can replicate it,' runs one of
Maxmin's maxims.
Similar tricks have already been learned and patchily applied by other
international 'retailers' such as Benetton, which has built up a vast
network of licensed stores throughout the world by concentrating on
promoting brand image and product. It makes its money by taking a margin on
supplying its products to its licensees.
But Mr Maxmin's sweeping strategic visions contrast sharply with the
nuts-and-bolts phrases about gearing and cost cutting that pour from the
mouths of the accountants who now run the UK's other struggling retail
chains.
The differences are most visible in the companies' annual reports. While
Next may have produced a basic stark black-and-white effort completely
devoid of colour, Laura Ashley's latest offering was wrapped in a lyrical
photograph of rolling English hills. 'Our mission is to establish an
enduring relationship with those who share a love of the special lifestyle
that is Laura Ashley. We will act so as to protect the integrity of that
relationship and to ensure its long term prosperity,' it ran.
Such lofty concepts are hardly likely to appeal to hard-bitten institutional
fund managers, who have seen the company collapse from peak profits of
Pounds 23.1m in 1988 to post-exceptional losses of Pounds 9.1m last year on
sales of Pounds 260.7m.
But many analysts, at least, have been won round to Maxmin's unconventional
way of thinking in the year that he has been in the job and believe that -
in the long term - Laura Ashley is indeed capable of generating very
attractive returns.
'I think they can improve their performance very considerably even without a
bounce in the economy,' says Paul Deacon, retail analyst at Goldman Sachs,
the US stockbrokers. 'The business has been run so badly that there are an
awful lot of internal changes they can make to lift the gross margin. Run
properly, it should be a very high value-added business. You do not have to
look out too far to see them achieving sales of Pounds 500m with profits
around Pounds 50m - although that may be stretching the imagination a little
at the moment.'
There are two distinct means by which Laura Ashley can achieve this
turnaround. The first is to do better what it already does. The second is to
expand where it does it.
Since joining Laura Ashley a year ago, Mr Maxmin has made much progress in
implementing his SFA programme aimed at Simplifying the company's structure,
Focusing on its strengths and Acting to improve its profitability.
Mr Maxmin argues that the company does not have the skills or the necessary
financial strength to be at the leading edge of manufacturing, distribution
technology or information systems and should therefore simplify its business
by sub-contracting these functions to outside experts.
In March, Laura Ashley agreed an innovative 10-year Pounds 150m deal with
Federal Express effectively handing over responsibility for its distribution
arrangements to the US logistics group. The degree of mutual trust is
startlingly high: a Federal Express director now regularly attends Laura
Ashley board meetings.
The Federal Express deal will lead to substantial cost savings. 'Ultimately
Fedex will be able to direct products straight from our supplier in Hong
Kong to our shops in Frankfurt or Vienna rather than going through the UK,'
Mr Maxmin says.
Laura Ashley clearly has much to aim for in improving its core UK
operations, which account for 38 per cent of sales, but it also has much to
gain from expanding abroad. 'Our major strategic priority will be to
diversify away from the UK and build up our profits base overseas. We want a
minimum of 120 shops in Europe within a four to five year time horizon. We
have 60 shops at the moment,' Mr Maxmin says.
Mr Alphons Schouten, who runs the company's mainland European businesses,
says that to be successful abroad most retailers have found it necessary to
position themselves further upmarket than in their own backyard.
The company's pricing policy, which varies by as much as 20 per cent across
its European markets, reflects the need to position itself differently in
each market. 'We do not want our retail price to reflect our cost price. It
should never be a mathematical exercise. You have to come at it from a
consumer's perspective. We cannot be out of sync with our competitors,' he
says.
Operating in Europe also requires great operational flexibility. The range
of the products varies depending on the characteristics of each national
marketplace. 'Our two big markets are Germany and France. Germany has
primarily been garments and France has been home furnishings,' he says.
In northern Europe most people have their bedrooms painted blue. In the
south it is pink. 'A German sleeps on a pillow 80cm by 80cm. A Dutchman
sleeps on a pillow 60cm by 40cm. A Belgian will have 60cm square. What
pillow cases should we stock in Maastricht?' asks Mr Schouten.
It takes much time - and considerable management skill - to adapt to
different markets and Laura Ashley is now placing the emphasis on gradual
learning rather than rapid growth. But Mr Maxmin argues that it is better to
build up a stronger, more profitable business over the long term than
attempt to move too quickly and destroy the brand.
'To be whimsical for a moment, we are dealing with part of England's
national heritage and I am not into raping or pillaging,' he says.

NORTHAMBER, the specialist computer and electronic transmission products

April 30 compared with Pounds 1.56m.
Although turnover was just ahead to Pounds 93.1m (Pounds 90.1m) there was an
operating loss of Pounds 2.28m (Pounds 1.07m). Mr David Phillips, the
chairman, said the loss was after taking the stock and debtor provisions
necessitated by the oversupplied and difficult market conditions.
He said the group had again ended the year debt-free, with Pounds 1.3m net
cash.
Losses per share worked through at 11.6p (7.6p) and 'with the pervading
uncertainty and in order to conserve cash' the single final dividend is cut
from 2.5p to 0.5p.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
VOLVO, the Swedish car manufacturer, is terminating its exclusive import
agreement with Lex Service in the Irish Republic following similar moves
towards direct distribution in the UK.
The company has decided to end its contract with Lex four years early after
launching a European marketing section in Brussels.
Plans for direct distribution in Ireland by the Swedish group follow trends
elsewhere in Europe set by manufacturers such as Nissan and Toyota in
acquiring control of import-distribution operations held by independent
franchises.
Volvo will take over Lex's existing outlets and its staff will be employed
by a new dealership subsidiary - Volvo Car Ireland.
The deal should be completed next month if approved by European Community
merger officials.
Irish sales, however, represent only a fraction of Volvo's market in the
British Isles.
Of the new cars sold in Ireland last year, 1,351 were Volvos - 2.15 per cent
of the market - compared with more than 47,000 units sold on the mainland.
Mr Mark Young, assistant company secretary at Lex, said the company now
hoped to import other makes of car and concentrate on private and commercial
leasing.
Yesterday's agreement will contribute to the Pounds 70m which Lex expects to
raise this year through the sale of operations such as its European
electronics components business.
Lex's share price closed up 7p at 212p.

FT  22 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Administrators in at Moran Holdings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Moran Holdings, the tea producer, freight forwarder and property
developer, were suspended at 133p last night as the group was put into
administration under the Insolvency Act. Mr Ian McIsaac and Mr Tony Houghton
of Touche Ross are to be appointed as administrators.
Moran Tea Company, a 74 per cent controlled subsidiary listed on the
Calcutta Stock Exchange, and the wholly-owned freight forwarding interests
in the UK are trading profitably and are excluded from the administration
which will cover the holding company. This has been made insolvent by the
property side.
The group's main property arm, which is developing the Piccadilly Village
development in Manchester, is 'solvent though in need of shareholder
support', according to Mr Colin Gordon-Smith, Moran chairman until three
weeks ago and now a non-executive.

Sir, Your coverage of such recent financial scandals as Maxwell, BCCI and
Blue Arrow has been laudable. However, I do feel your usual high standards
of investigation and analysis have slip-ped.
In your editions late this week I could discover no coverage relating to a
leading Texan financier, Mr John Bryan: no pictures, bar charts, nor even an
eight-page survey, 'Franchising the Royal Family'.
The FinanciaI Times must surely have an opinion: are his activities within
the Financial Services Act (1986) or not?

FT  22 AUG 92 / Letter: When house prices come home
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am delighted that Lex (August 18) has reflected that 90 per cent of
UK house owners are not burdened by 'negative equity' and that fear of
unemployment is the most influential factor for potential house buyers.
But I should point out that I, as an intending first-time buyer, am
uninterested in the prospects for house price rises. Instead, I am
interested in when prices are likely to stop falling. The difference may
seem academic in the world of economic forecasting. But in buying a house in
which to live (not to 'do up and sell'), as long as I do not pay more than
necessary, I do not care if house prices never rise again.
I don't think I am alone in this view. Inflation in house prices is as bad a
curse as any other kind of inflation.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr G GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, If the government is to tighten the law governing trade unions'
political funds - requiring a union to get written authority from each
member before using any portion of his contribution for political purposes -
perhaps it should simultaneously amend company law.
Individual shareholders cannot stop directors giving part of their profits
to a political party and, unlike union members, they cannot opt out.
A shareholder should have a right similar to a union member, namely to allow
only a portion of a company's profits to be given for political purposes. A
company's political contribution should be deducted, in proportion to the
shares held, only from the dividends of those shareholders who expressly
wish it. G Griffiths,

FT  22 AUG 92 / Letter: A misplaced furore over the methods of creative
accounting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JON PRENTICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The furore over Terry Smith's book is greatly overdone. His is not the
first on its subject: there was, for example, Ian Griffiths' Creative
Accounting in 1986. Much of the material can be found in monthly management
journals.
The accounting practices are not necessarily devious either. Why should
interest not be included, with the other costs of building an asset, in its
value on the balance sheet? If a factory, of little value to anyone else and
really only a passport to future earnings, appears on the balance sheet, why
can't a brand, which combines both virtues? And why draw attention to a
contingent liability like a claim for negligence or under warranty, when to
do so would lend credence to an otherwise fragile lawsuit?
There is, in any case, much unresolved confusion, even among specialists,
about balance sheets. Some regard them as accurate summations of all past
transactions; others, preferring relevance, as statements of current value.
The problem exists because we have a stock market which expects something
(smoothly increasing profits), and corporate legislation which prevents it.
Reports are required at arbitrary intervals (12 months) bearing little
relation to a company's natural trading cycle.
We should not, therefore, blame companies which use creative accounting to
transform an 'annual' series of fluctuating results (such as Dollars 4m
profit, Pounds 1m loss, Pounds 15m profit, Pounds 3m loss) into a reported
series of smoothly increasing profits (Pounds 1m, Pounds 2m, Pounds 4m,
Pounds 8m). The latter can reflect the true underlying value of a company.
Given this scope for legitimate manipulation (although new rules will soon
reduce it), what does matter is the use, without sufficient thought, of
growth in earnings-per-share for director bonuses. Having advised many
boards on performance and remuneration, I urge caution here. Research I did
in 1987 showed that earnings per share growth does not correlate strongly
with share performance.

You write that 'the Press Complaints Commission has attempted to set its

FT  22 AUG 92 / Letter: Reducing PSBR would spur private rented sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD MCMANUS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Prof Gavin McCrone probably over-estimates the need for tax concessions
to revitalise the private residential rented sector (August 17).
A comparison between net rental yields at around 6 per cent and gilt yields
at 9.5 per cent suggests investment in residential rental property is a poor
option. Yet long-term rental payments and property values are inflation
linked.
A London flat with a current open market value of Pounds 75,000 could be let
to produce a net rental yield of around Pounds 4,500 a year. With modest
inflation and if interest rates fall, the value of the flat increases. If
the rental income stream and the open market value of the flat increase by 3
per cent a year over 25 years, the net present value would be about Pounds
112,000, with a discount rate of only 6 per cent.
This compares favourably with a Pounds 108,000 net present value of Pounds
75,000 of gilts yielding 9.5 per cent over 25 years with the same discount
rate.
It is only if the government eliminates inflation that gilts are a far
better bet, and fully funding the PSBR 'crowds out' necessary institutional
investment in residential rental property. But reducing government borrowing
must be better than compensating tax concessions.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Major's deskful of difficulties: Problems are piling up in
the in-tray
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not so long ago it was a truism that government popularity rose in August.
The royal family replaced ministers of the crown as the favourite targets of
the tabloids.
The latest furore surrounding the Duchess of York confirms that some things
have not changed. But Mr John Major is learning the hard way that politics
and the foreign exchange markets are no longer respectful of the holiday
calendar.
When he returns from Spain tomorrow he will find that none of the problems
he left behind has gone away; and that several more have been added to a
crowded prime ministerial in-tray.
The Labour party, under the leadership of Mr John Smith, is promising to
emerge from its post-election shock to take full advantage of Mr Major's
discomfort.
In recent years August has become a month for international crises. In 1991
it was the abortive coup in the former Soviet Union; the year before, Iraq
invaded Kuwait. Now, it is the war in Bosnia and the threat of renewed
hostilities with Iraq.
The latest conflicts forced Mr Major to interrupt his break this week to
announce that RAF warplanes would be sent to protect Shia communities in
southern Iraq, and ground troops would escort UN aid convoys in Bosnia. Both
decisions raised as many dilemmas as they promised to solve.
At home, two years of economic recession have ensured that the voters are no
longer indifferent to the holiday plans of their political masters.
With house prices still crumbling and the dole queues lengthening, many
cannot afford to pay for the foreign holidays they took for granted in the
late 1980s boom years.
A renewed battering for sterling in the wake of the dollar's slide provided
an awkwark reminder that things may get worse before they get better.
So if Mr Major flicks through the past two weeks' newspapers, he will find
plenty of unwelcome headlines about the government's performance. Many have
been unfair. Unless one takes the view that politicians should never take
holidays, it is hard to substantiate claims that his government has lost its
sense of direction.
Criticisms of Britain's EC presidency after just seven weeks are premature.
Mr Major could hardly have been expected to persuade the French to bring
forward their referendum on Maastricht treaty or to have convinced the 12
that there was a neat and easy solution to the disintegration of the former
Yugoslavia.
But for a prime minister who only four months ago was celebrating a general
election victory, it has been an unusually difficult August. The storm
clouds over Bosnia and the Gulf have coincided with a darkening domestic
scene.
Announcements this week of the eighth consecutive quarterly fall in national
income, of another drop in retail sales, and of short-time working at Ford
motor plants, were only the latest in a series of gloomy economic
indicators.
The volume of public criticism from Tory MPs has been turned down but their
private unease has not dissipated. Critical motions on the agenda for the
Brighton party conference in October confirm the disquiet of constituency
activists.
Growing uncertainty over the outcome of the French referendum has bolstered
the confidence of the Tory Euro-sceptics. As the pound sinks to new lows
against the D-mark, they have linked the pain of the recession with the
prime minister's pro-European stance, including commitment to the exchange
rate mechanism.
The Euro-sceptics now hope that a 'no' vote in France on September 20 will
both wreck the treaties on European union and tear apart the ERM. The best
guess in Whitehall remains that the French are more likely to vote Yes. But
few will stake money on it.
Then there is the council tax. Many of the recent warnings that falling
house prices will result in unfairly high bills have owed more to political
mischief-making than to cool analysis. The average tax bill will be
determined by the level of council spending and the number of households
rather than by movements in property values.
But it is true that the burden of the tax will fall disproportionately on
the south-east: the area worst-hit by the recession and by a debt trap that
has left a million households with mortgages higher than the value of their
properties. So a widespread perception that the tax will be inherently
unfair could take hold.
The Treasury will be told to provide a substantial financial cushion to ease
in the new tax. But that in turn will make even harder the task of the
cabinet committee charged with overall control of public spending.
The new arrangements will inject a degree of political logic into the annual
share-out of resources. But when the committee meets for the first time next
month it will be unable to avoid harsh decisions on where the axe must fall.
Mr Major is aware that more must be done to give definition to his economic
strategy. Too many people, Tories among them, have been left with the
impression that his programme for the next five years consists of holding
the pound at DM2.95.
So a renewed effort to persuade people that the prize of permanently low
inflation is worth the pain can be expected. Ministers will seek to persuade
voters and their own supporters that price stability will provide the
backdrop for the tax cuts and higher-quality public services promised during
the election.
It will not be easy. Downing Street expects the pressure on sterling to
intensify as the French referendum approaches. Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, will do all he can to avoid an interest rate rise, but if the
opinion polls point to a 'no' vote in France that may be impossible.
One of the prime minister's first tasks will be to sift through the options
for an emergency package of measures to accelerate recovery if the unease in
the Tory party over the economy and Europe threatens to turn into rebellion.
Establishing a grip on the EC presidency will be impossible until France
makes up its mind. Uncertainty leaves the sceptics with the initiative.
Alongside that lies the risks of military involvement in the Balkans and the
Gulf. Mr Major's sombre demeanour after his reluctant decision to send
ground troops to Bosnia underlined concern that British troops may become
entangled in the bloody conflict.
Few expect the Yugoslav peace conference, which Mr Major will co-chair in
London next week, to halt the fighting. The public opinion which demanded
action could quickly change if British soldiers begin to join the list of
casualties.
It all adds up to a formidable array of political challenges. There are
those who detect silver linings in many of the clouds.
The economy is showing signs at least of stirring. The inflation rate is
tumbling. The French could yet vote 'yes', easing pressure on the ERM and
paving the way for a small cut in interest rates and the beginning of more
visible recovery. The Euro-sceptics could then be isolated.
And the prime minister is a much tougher and resourceful politician than he
is given credit for. But for now Mr Major is returning to an in-tray
overflowing with distinctly uncomfortable uncertainties.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Au revoir les cafes: The passing of a French institution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every day at 6am, Mrs Nicole Barradis drags open the doors of Le Ventadour,
the cafe that she owns off the bustling Boulevard de l'Opera in Paris. She
cleans the cafe, issues instructions to her staff, then sits on a stool
until 8pm selling cigarettes and stamps from the tabac kiosk.
'My routine has been the same for 15 years,' she says. 'In all that time
I've only ever had two weeks of holiday. I come to the cafe even when I'm
ill. I daren't think what would happen to it without me.'
Almost every street in Paris has its cafe au coin, ruled with a rod of iron
by a patronne such as Mrs Barradis, wearing a black cardigan, whatever the
weather, with gracious smiles for her regulars and frosty nods to strangers.
But France's cafes are dying. More than 5,000 disappear each year, according
to official figures. There were 510,000 cafes in France during their heyday
in 1910. By 1960 there were 200,000 and by 1990 just 70,000. The consensus
is that there will be only 50,000 to 60,000 cafes left by the year 2000.
Small cafes have borne the brunt of the decline. France's smart restaurants
are flourishing. Three weeks' advance booking is needed for those with three
Michelin stars. The legendary literary cafes in Paris are packed with
tourists. Aux Deux Magots on Boulevard Saint-Germain is so full of
foreigners hoping someone will come along to play Simone de Beauvoir to
their Jean-Paul Sartre that the locals flee to Cafe de Flore down the road.
Brasserie Lipp across the street is so busy that it can afford to turn away
tourists - too many and the locals might be offended.
Life is very different for the cafes aux coins, the neighbourhood bistros
and the cafes-tabacs with their tobacco kiosks at the end of the bar. They
are the gallic equivalent of Britain's pubs and the US neighbourhood bars.
They belong to the bygone era when workers went back to the same zinc-topped
bar night after night to knock back hearty vin du pays with Johnny Hallyday
records crooning from the jukebox.
Mr Pierre Discazeaux ran a cafe-tabac on Rue Saint-Anne in central Paris for
seven years. Three years ago he turned it into a tabac-presse, or newsagent.
The cigar-shaped tabac sign still hangs outside, but the cafe fixtures have
been taken away to make room for shelves of sweets, cigarettes, newspapers
and magazines. 'It's much better like this,' he says. 'I don't have to work
so hard and I make more money. The cafe was always a struggle. There was no
future in it.'
The demise of the cafe au coin reflects broader changes in the French way of
life. Many of the old cafes were in city centres, or close to factories on
the fringes. They have gone out of business as the locals have moved to the
suburbs and factories have closed or contracted.
Le Cochon a l'Oreille has been a bistro in the Les Halles area of Paris
since 1913. Its original customers were the workers from the nearby fruit
and vegetable market, who popped in for meals between shifts. After the
market closed in 1969 it struggled along, drumming up custom from the
remnants of the local wholesale trade. Eventually even the wholesalers
drifted away.
'Things were really tough for a while,' says Mr Andre Camboulas, who runs
the bistro, now filled with designers and stylists from the fashion
companies that have sprung up around Les Halles. 'The neighbourhood has
changed and we changed with it. Life hasn't been easy but we've survived.'
Others have been less fortunate. The biggest single blow to an old-fashioned
French cafe is the news that a fast-food outlet is opening in its area.
McDonald's, Burger Kings, sandwich bars and croissanteries now offer an
efficient alternative to the traditional snack at a local bistro.
One of the factors that persuaded Mr Discazeaux to close his cafe was the
growth of the deliver-to-the-door sushi bars along Rue Saint-Anne, now the
main Japanese eating area in Paris. Le Cochon a l'Oreille faces stiff
competition from the nearby branch of Lina's, a chain of de luxe sandwich
shops. An analysis by the French restaurateurs' association showed that a
typical cafe loses 30 per cent of its business if a McDonald's opens in its
area.
Sushi and Big Macs are only part of the problem. The traditional French cafe
is a victim of modernity. Almost all the changes in postwar lifestyles have
contributed to its decline. Television tempts people to spend more time at
home. Fax machines mean they need fewer stamps from the tabac. Microwave
ovens make it easier to whip up quick snacks rather than to nip into a
bistro. Espresso coffee makers mean office workers no longer need to go to a
zinc comptoir for their capuccino.
The cafe au coin is out of tune with the times. The customers are mainly
male blue-collar workers in their 50s or 60s. It is unusual to see anyone
under 30 in a traditional cafe-tabac unless they are with older workmates.
Young Parisians go to sombre bars in Pigalle and Bastille, where they play
chess and read poetry. Sheherazade, one of the hottest clubs in the city,
opened earlier this year with a neo-Surrealist arts event.
Mrs Christianne Taupin took over Cafe du Perron, a cafe-tabac on Rue des
Saints-Peres, four years ago. She manages to stay in business thanks to a
loyal band of regulars who work nearby, but there are few newcomers. 'I'd be
finished without my regulars,' she says. 'Young people just don't go to
cafes any more. I can't even get them to work here. The hours are too long
and the pay is too low. Cafes are closing all the time.'

FT  22 AUG 92 / Letter: Puncturing Thatcherite myths
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DEREK H BROOME
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Well done to Samuel Brittan ('The benefits of lower housing prices',
August 20) for puncturing the Thatcherite myths about home ownership.
The real value of an asset is the income it could earn, and few houses could
fetch 10 per cent gross annual rentals on current valuations. In a rational
market, older property would stand at a substantial discount to newer
property, since much of it is sub-standard on current building regulations
and should be redeveloped; overpricing of tarted-up hovels depresses the
market for new building. Site values, as he says, ought to bear a rational
relationship to the price of agricultural land - not a multiple of up to
1,500.
By these criteria, property prices still have a way to fall, to the benefit
of housing standards, the building industry, and new buyers and renters.
Samuel Brittan rightly urges special and selective assistance for those
conned by the lenders and others in the selling industry and now stranded
with substantial debts against equity. Derek H Broome,

FT  22 AUG 92 / Good buys, but a risky business: Japanese shares look cheap
by international standards, but history offers a warning to investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Japanese shares touched their latest six-year low in the middle of the
week, they appeared to offer some remarkable bargains. Even after the 13 per
cent rally in the Nikkei index in the past three days, you can still buy
blue-chip Japanese stocks at prices that have not been seen in years - ones
that look particularly cheap when you compare them with the levels of share
prices on Wall Street.
Companies such as Matsushita, the electronics giant; Nissan, the car
manufacturer; Hitachi, the electrical and electronics producer; and Fujitsu,
the computer company, are all selling at below the book value of their
assets. You can buy Toyota shares at only 11 times its last reported
earnings per share; on this basis, Ford and GM, both lossmaking in their
latest financial years, are more expensive. Fuji Photo is selling at 13 1/2
times earnings; Kodak at 13 3/4 .
When you buy a share, you are acquiring rights to a future stream of
corporate earnings. The rate at which those earnings rise is a critical
determinant of how successful the investment will prove.
If you can buy a Japanese company's current earnings stream at roughly the
same price as you can buy that of an American company, the better bet is the
one that is likely to grow faster. Now, given the developments of the past
40 years, which do you think is likely to raise its earnings faster, a
Japanese company or an American one?
Alas, western investors fell for a similar line of argument a year ago, with
the Nikkei index at 22,000. International fund managers piled into Japan;
Scottish fund managers, famous for their caution and long-term view, found
prices particularly attractive. This week, they found themselves sitting on
paper losses of nearly 40 per cent.
International fund managers are therefore holding back, unsure whether
current Tokyo share prices represent the buying opportunity of the decade,
or yet another false bottom. After all, the Nikkei is still swinging wildly;
some people say it could halve again. Unlike last autumn, investors now have
Japanese economic conditions to worry about: in the process of deflating
Japan's huge late-1980s bubble of property and share prices, the government
has squeezed the economy to a standstill.
Companies are suffering. The price/earnings ratios mentioned earlier are
historical ones, relating in some cases to fiscal years that ended in the
middle of 1991. Since then, Japanese earnings have fallen steadily. Toyota's
historical p/e ratio, based on the financial year that ended in June 1991,
is indeed 11; but the consensus estimate for the year that ended in June
1992, as calculated by the IBES survey of analysts' forecasts from around
the world is 19. The estimate for the year now under way is 18.
That may be too optimistic. Corporate earnings forecasts for the fiscal year
to March 1993 have began to seem too bullish, as the expected economic
recovery in the second half is now seen as unlikely to materialise. Consumer
demand, which was expected to help the economy rebound in the latter half of
this year, is declining rapidly, and economists are revising down their
economic growth forecasts.
On current forecasts, the market is a whole is selling at a price/earnings
ratio of 35. But, says Mr Craig Chudler, strategist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew
in Tokyo: 'A 10 per cent downward revision in earnings forecasts for the
year would bring up the p/e ratio to about 40 times, which is still
expensive internationally and historically.'
But price/earnings ratios do not tell the whole story. Japanese reporting
conventions arguably understate companies' profitability, so investors have
been used to buying their shares on far higher price/earnings ratios than
those of western companies, even before the 1980s Tokyo stock market surge.
The opportunity to buy some, at least, of Japan's blue-chip companies at
broadly comparable ratios to their US rivals is unusual.
Just as important, Japanese companies invested so much in capital equipment
in the late 1980s that they now have huge depreciation charges, which hold
down their profits. 'On a price/earnings ratio, only Fuji Photo looks really
cheap,' said one international fund manager this week. 'You have to look at
price/cash flow ratios to find the real bargains.'
Cash flow - profits with depreciation added back in - is a measure of
underlying trading performance. Nissan and Fujitsu, for example, are both
selling at less than four times cash flow, if you consolidate the figures
for all the companies in these groups. Calculations by Salomon Brothers, the
investment bank, illustrated in the main chart, show that a group of big
blue-chip Japanese companies, after years of selling at a higher price in
cash-flow terms than their American equivalents, finally became cheaper this
spring. Since then, the gap has probably widened.
Cash-flow arguments highlight the real uncertainty from an investor's point
of view: just what will the companies do with their cash? In the 1980s,
Japanese companies raised money at extraordinarily low interest rates, and
ploughed it into low-return investments, both at home and abroad. 'There was
a blow-out in discretionary expenditure in the late 1980s, and total lack of
interest in feeding any of it through to the bottom line,' says one
international money manager. A Tokyo analyst adds: 'Many of these activities
increased rather than decreased the break-even point.'
If Japanese companies continue the pattern of the past, investors should not
necessarily count on obtaining the benefits of all that cash flow; so its
apparent cheapness may prove illusory. Assessing the value of Japanese
stocks thus turns on the question of whether anything has happened to change
the way Japanese managers behave.
One thing has happened. The cheap money of the 1980s has vanished, and
Japan's cost of capital has risen sharply. Managers, chagrined by the low
returns on their splurge of capital expenditure, are assessing projects much
more rigorously. Companies, faced with repaying cheap money and replacing
with with much more expensive borrowings, are thinking much harder about
profitability.
Mr Richard Koo, an economist at Nomura Research Institute in Tokyo, wrote a
much-talked-about paper in the spring, focusing on Japanese companies'
chronic inattention to profitability, and arguing that it was now about to
change. This week he said: 'Quite a few Japanese companies are taking that
paper very seriously. The problem is they are stuck with existing product
lines.' Products suitable for a volume-oriented strategy are not those on
which a successful drive for greater profitability can be based. You will
not see the results of a change in strategy, he argues, until the next
product cycle.
In the meantime, however, Japanese companies have one option: they can turn
off the spending taps. That could produce a much more rapid bounce-back in
profits when the economy starts to recover than Tokyo analysts expect. But
investing on that basis is a bet on the timing of the Japanese economic
cycle, a risky business given the strains to which the economy has been
subjected. There are signs that the Japanese government is at last taking
the situation with the seriousness which the markets believe it deserves.
Much hangs on the government's economic package, scheduled for August 28. If
that is judged less than the occasion demands, this week's brief stock
market recovery could be speedily undone.
There is one additional factor for investors to consider. Even if everything
goes right for Japanese companies from here on, that does not mean share
prices will respond in the way they would in the west.
Western stock markets - particularly Anglo-Saxon ones - have had many
decades of judging share prices in terms of valuation: weighing up the
likely future income streams of companies, and calculating how cheap or dear
that makes their shares. They do not always get it right, and they are prone
to swings of mood that drastically affect the projections of future earnings
and the value placed today on a dollar of earnings tomorrow. But the
analytical framework is a shared one, and investors can be reasonably sure
that, if they identify bargains correctly, others will in time come to adopt
their views, driving the share prices up and rewarding early purchasers.
In Tokyo, things are different. 'There is no discipline of valuation in this
market,' says one British banker based there. Japanese investors have
traditionally held a large portion of their assets in a passive form,
determined as much by long-term corporate relationships as by investment
judgment. The portion left over for discretionary investment has been used
to place short-term bets on stocks which were already moving up - what is
known as the 'momentum' theory of investing. The momentum approach says that
you do not bet on a stock that is down.
During the bubble years, when shares were going up along with everything
else, industrial companies poured some of the cheap money they were raising
into the stock market.
That was fine when the market was going up, but now the market has halved.
What seemed like sure-fire investments are now hopeless money-losers.
Industrial companies - and retail investors - are deeply unhappy with their
share portfolios, and keen to get out if they can do so with any degree of
honour. Any rally is a signal for selling - so rallies do not last long.
In the very long run, of course, a bargain stock remains a bargain. But in
Tokyo, the mechanism that will drive it up from its low levels is imperfect.
So buying now in expectation of a rise as others come to share your view
about a stock's appeal is a dangerous business. As one New York-based
investor put it this week: 'I've covered all my short-sales in Tokyo - but I
haven't started buying yet.'

FT  22 AUG 92 / Ugly scrum in South Africa: A symbolic battle for political
power at the rugby ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strange as it may seem for the land that invented apartheid, racial hatred
seldom darkens a normal day in Johannesburg. But these are not normal times
in South Africa. A raw battle for political power is under way, and the
battlefield stretches from township street to rugby stadium.
Thousands of rugby-mad whites at Cape Town's Newlands stadium will today
have a chance to show whether they value the country's sense of interracial
goodwill which has for so long defied the logic of apartheid - but which is
under serious strain. They will be called upon to stand and observe a
minute's silence for the victims of South Africa's political violence -
almost all of them black. The occasion will be white South Africa's chance
to demonstrate a spirit of reconciliation. Such gestures have become rare in
recent months, whether from average citizens or from political leaders,
white and black. The prospects for peace and progress in South Africa will
partly depend on the rugby crowd's behaviour.
The omens of the past week are not favourable, however. Last Saturday, when
South Africa's rugby side met New Zealand's All Blacks, white fans defiled
the sporting atmosphere with a loud and emotional rendering of the South
African national anthem, a potent symbol of Afrikaner nationalism and for
blacks, the ultimate token of apartheid. One liberal spectator tried to
convey the ugly tone of the incident: 'People who didn't even know much
Afrikaans (the language in which die Stem is written), who had certainly
never sung it before, were singing so loud that the veins were standing out
on their foreheads.'
In the emotionally charged atmosphere of South Africa's first international
rugby match for eight years - a match made possible by the anti-apartheid
movement's decision to drop sport sanctions against Pretoria - some local
newspapers commented that the incident had amounted to an obscene gesture
directed at the new multi-racial South Africa.
'The very first chance we get to demonstrate new attitudes, to make some
gesture towards reconciliation, we succeed only in showing ugly
intransigence,' commented a shamed spectator in the weekly Financial Mail.
But the incident reflected more than racial intolerance. It demonstrated an
explosive anger among whites at their new and unaccustomed sense of
powerlessness in the face of black political power. After 350 years as the
dominant race, whites at the Ellis Park stadium found they had to accept
restrictions by blacks, in the form of the African National Congress (ANC),
which had banned the official display of national symbols, such as flags and
anthems, at the match.
Their response was defiance - they waved thousands of small flags, and twice
spontaneously sang the national anthem, die Stem. It was also played
officially, an act of defiance from a renegade rugby administrator.
The message from Ellis Park was clear - whites may have voted to abolish
apartheid in this year's referendum, but they did not vote for black rule.
Ellis Park became just one more battlefield in the contest for power in the
new South Africa - a chilling expression of ethnicity which both sides
ignore at their peril.
That contest, which has led to the breakdown of constitutional talks over
the issue of black majority rule versus multi-racial power sharing, sparked
a two-day general strike earlier this month and widespread labour
disruption. It has left 7,000 dead in black townships since 1990, and has
also taken a heavy toll on the country's morale.
Immigration lawyers from Australia have found it fruitful to visit
Johannesburg again, as white confidence plumbs new depths and professionals
plan their escape from a troubled multi-racial future. 'Planning to
emigrate?' asks the cheerful voice of the local radio announcer, ready with
advice on international removals companies.
Business, too, is fed up with political failure at the highest levels, and
is casting around for its own separate peace with the unions to permit
economic life to go on. Indeed, this month's general strike was nearly
averted by a deal between the employers' body, Saccola, and the largest
union federation, Cosatu. It involved agreement on a one-day work stoppage
and on issues such as training and job creation. The accord failed in the
end, but could be revived in future.
Businessmen acknowledge such a deal would be largely a stop-gap measure.
Business and the unions, on their own, cannot bring growth to an economy
more troubled than at any time in recent memory. Real per capita GDP is
expected to have shrunk by 9 per cent between 1990 and 1992, according to
the Old Mutual, one of the country's leading insurers. Nothing short of a
political deal can attract the investment needed for significant economic
expansion.
Such a deal - either involving agreement on a multi-racial interim
government to restore order or a more comprehensive constitutional
settlement yielding multi-party democracy - has so far proved elusive.
Yesterday's news of a meeting between government and ANC officials is at
best only a step to the resumption of talks.
Both Mr FW de Klerk, the president, and Mr Nelson Mandela, his ANC
counterpart, have repeatedly failed to rise above partisan political
concerns in the interest of a broader national agenda. Indeed, Mr de Klerk
seems to believe that strengthening his National Party serves the national
interest by ensuring a powerful opposition to black majority rule. He also
continues to prove unable or unwilling to take sufficiently strong action
against his security forces.
Both men should take note. Most blacks are fed up with the violence and
poverty which for black South Africans are the most salient facts of life
after apartheid. They are unlikely to support the open-ended campaign of
mass action favoured by ANC radicals. Whites, meanwhile, are at best
despondent, at worst angry. South Africa needs a deal soon to restore at
least a measure of stability.
The country's leaders may find that, if they miss this opportunity for
peace, another may not open up for some time.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Leading Article: UK still in recession
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SECOND quarter of 1992 was not, it turns out, when the UK's long
recession came to an end. With the 0.1 per cent decline in overall gross
domestic product, the recession, like an unwelcome guest, kept its foot in
the door. But it was no more than the oil and gas extraction foot that
stayed. The rest of the economy did grow by 0.1 per cent.
Nonetheless, output must now rise by more than 1 1/2 per cent between the
first and second halves of 1992 if GDP is not to shrink yet again this year.
The Treasury's forecasts of 1 per cent growth in GDP between 1991 and 1992
are, once again, for the waste paper basket.
Almost all sectors of the economy were either stagnant or shrank between the
first two quarters. The exception was manufacturing, which grew by 0.4 per
cent. But this growth will not endure without a sustained increase in final
demand.
The post-election bounce in demand has not been maintained. While the three
months to July saw retail sales 0.3 per cent higher than in the previous
three months, July itself registered a small decline. Worse, the latest
distributive trades survey from the Confederation of British Industry, taken
in late July and early August, was unremittingly gloomy. A third of
respondents said the volume of sales in July was higher than a year ago, but
48 per cent said it was lower.
Car sales have been particularly disappointing. The change of registration
prefix in August is supposed to stimulate the appetites of the car buyer. It
has not done so. Sales have merely matched last year's dismal levels. No
wonder Ford UK felt obliged to announce a three-day week.
Unsold vehicles
Carmakers must cut their stocks of unsold vehicles. Should that pattern
become more general, manufacturing output will turn down once more. Happily,
the figures on stocks released this week do not support the gloomiest view.
They show not involuntary accumulation, but a decline of Pounds 1,093m, at
1985 prices, in the value of the stocks held by manufacturers, wholesalers
and retailers during the second quarter. But stocks of finished goods with
manufacturers still rose by Pounds 149m.
Restocking is, in any case, not enough to create a strong recovery. That
depends on final demand. But the government has just tightened its system
for controlling future levels of public spending. Meanwhile, as the Bank of
England's Quarterly Bulletin notes, non-oil export volumes rose by only 0.8
per cent between the second half of 1991 and the first half of 1992. This is
particularly depressing in the midst of a deep recession, precisely when one
might expect exports to soar.
Private consumption is, in any case, much the most important component of
demand, accounting for almost two-thirds of the total. It is the failure of
consumers to spend that worries the government most.
Not long ago Mr Stephen Dorrell, the finance secretary, insisted that low
inflation was bound to generate the confidence to spend. He also noted that
since joining the ERM a family on average earnings with a Pounds 30,000
mortgage had seen real disposable income rise by 18.5 per cent, or Pounds 35
a week. So why are all those ungrateful families not going out to spend and
spend?
Silly time
The simplest answer is that low inflation cannot generate confidence in
people who have just bet on high inflation. Moreover, the Treasury seems
unable to grasp that especially in an economy with a liberalised capital
market a very high proportion of private spending is, in fact, investment.
This is not true just of housing. It is also true of cars, washing machines
or refrigerators. The timing of such purchase is alterable. Right now seems
a silly time to buy.
On the basis of current retail price inflation and short-term rates of
interest, the real rate of interest is 6 per cent. If the prime minister is
right about zero inflation, the long-term real rate of interest verges on 9
per cent. Why borrow to spend now, when one can save and buy still more
later? Low inflation does, indeed, breed confidence. But it is the
confidence to save; not the urge to spend.
Past experience gives a still more powerful reason to postpone consumption
and reduce debt. People borrowed five years or so ago because they believed
they were richer than they actually were and that they would get still
richer by buying houses and other real assets. Now they are far poorer than
they thought, itself a good reason to lower consumption. In addition, the
highest return investment available is to reduce their indebtedness.
What the government offers the consumer, a world of zero inflation, is no
reason to spend. For indebted consumers, for consumers who fear the loss of
a job, for consumers - almost 1m of them - with negative equity in their
houses, zero inflation is an excellent reason to save. The government's
promised elimination of inflation is not a solution to the recession; it is
becoming a contributory cause.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Guards sacked in BR dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOUSANDS of passengers at Manchester's Piccadilly station were delayed
yesterday after an unofficial dispute over rostering led to the sacking of
four guards.
Some InterCity trains between Manchester, London, Brighton and Bournemouth
were cancelled. Trains serving south Manchester, Cheshire and beyond were
also hit as the RMT rail union and British Rail tried to solve the dispute.
BR said it was running between 35 per cent and 50 per cent of services on
the lines affected, but advised passengers to make alternative travel plans
to avoid disruption.
The dispute started when guards alleged trainee drivers were doing their
jobs. BR said the four guards terminated their conditions of employment by
inciting other staff to stay off work. The RMT said BR had broken a code of
practice issued by Acas, the conciliation service, on disciplining staff
representatives.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Abbey to be luxury hotel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COOMBE Abbey, a Midlands landmark outside Coventry since the Cistercians
established a monastery there in 1150, is to be restored as a luxury hotel.
The Pounds 14.4m private and public-sector development will include a
country park and golf course.
Coventry City Council, the landowner, announced yesterday that it had
reached agreement with Lumley Castle, the Durham hotelier, Try Construction
and Allied Irish Banks on a financial package arranged by Price Waterhouse
Corporate Finance. Work on the project should start next month.
Coombe Abbey is a grade I listed building that has fallen into dilapidation.
The last significant works on the site were undertaken in the mid-19th
century. The city council, which faces cutbacks, does not have the resources
to maintain it.
The venture emphasises the growing readiness of Labour-controlled councils
to work with the private sector on economic development. The process has
been hastened by the government's constraints on council spending.
The city council contribution to the Coombe Abbey project is worth Pounds
4.6m. This comprises the land and grants arranged by the council, including
one of Pounds 977,000 from the European Community. The majority equity
holder will be Lumley Castle.
Mr Gordon Bear, who owns Lumley Castle and will run the hotel, has a
personal stake of Pounds 250,000 in the project. The main development will
be financed by borrowings of Pounds 8.5m from Allied Irish Banks. Try
Construction will have Pounds 1m of equity.
The first stage of the development will provide a visitor centre and other
public facilities for a country park. The second stage will transform the
buildings into a 49-bed hotel.
This is smaller than was first envisaged - earlier this year the hope was
for a Pounds 20m project, partly funded by China Construction International,
a Chinese government company. However, the Chinese interest evaporated.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Tories drop schools pledge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government has gone back on a commitment in its general election
manifesto to give popular state schools in England resources to expand -
provoking protests from church schools wanting to increase their intake.
In February Mr Kenneth Clarke, then education secretary, issued a
consultation paper on proposals to give extra funds to popular schools, with
about Pounds 20m allocated to the initiative for next year.
The Conservative manifesto included the commitment: 'Popular schools which
are over-subscribed will be given the resources to expand.'
It emerged yesterday, however, that no funds will be made available to
popular schools in local authorities with surplus places.
Since there are 1.5m surplus places across England, and it will take several
years to remove most of them, in effect the government is reneging on its
commitment.
The decision will anger many on the Conservative right who believe that
market forces - not reorganisations from above - should play a larger role
in determining school provision.
The Department of Education said yesterday that removing surplus places was
the government's 'main priority', and that Mr John Patten, the new education
secretary, gave a higher priority to that than to allowing existing schools
to expand.
At present the closure of 'surplus' schools is often a long and
controversial process, but the department said that legislation to be
introduced next year would 'accelerate' it by allowing the government to
introduce its own closure proposals.
It added: 'Popular schools will benefit, since they will gain the extra
pupils and resources currently going to the under-subscribed schools.'
Mr David Lankshear, schools officer for the Church of England Board of
Education, said schools would be 'angry' at the news. The Catholic Education
Council said it was 'disappointed'.
Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, said the move was typical of the
government's chopping and changing in education.
'Ministers have left some schools high and dry after foolishly promising
them extra cash,' she said.
'I shed no tears at the cutting of the Popular Schools Initiative, but fear
it is a sign of serious cuts to come with a secretary of state who will be
unable to fight his corner against the Treasury.'

FT  22 AUG 92 / BA warns strikes may force sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Airways yesterday warned it would close or sell its restructured
regional business if cabin crews in Manchester and Birmingham continued
industrial action over pay cuts.
Mr Robert Ayling, BA operations director, said: 'We can only keep this
business running on the basis agreed in March, otherwise we will have to
close the business or sell it to someone else.' He said no deadline had been
set.
Seven flights were cancelled following strikes at Manchester and Birmingham
airports this month. BA has threatened to suspend without pay crew members
taking further action. The union plans more one-day strikes and is balloting
members over industrial action short of strikes.
It is understood that earlier this year, BA had been on the point of signing
over European and domestic services out of Birmingham and Manchester, as
well as Highlands and Islands services, to a joint venture with Maersk Air,
the UK investment arm of the Danish independent carrier.
This was abandoned in March in favour of an in-house restructuring that
would preserve jobs but cut labour costs. The Maersk deal would have saved
an estimated Pounds 9m. The in-house restructuring is said to save Pounds
8.2m.
Several airlines have taken similar steps to cut costs. Lufthansa, the
German state carrier, is establishing a lower cost structure for domestic
services. It will operate as a separate carrier under the name Lufthansa
Express from October 25, and pay rates are intended to be lower than for
Lufthansa. Mr Ayling said BA would not copy Lufthansa's strategy.
Bassa, the section of the TGWU general union that represents the 500 cabin
crew involved in the dispute, said the threat confirmed the fears of crews
which had sought guarantees that the business would not be sold following
the recent cost-cutting restructuring. Any buyer would have a 'rough ride'
with 'angry' crews.
The union denies that it agreed to new contracts under which about 1,000
crew members face pay cuts of Pounds 2,000 on annual salaries of Pounds
14,000, with no pay rise next year unless inflation is above 4 per cent. The
union claims that its bargaining rights have also been reduced. BA insists
agreement was reached.
Last week BA made what it described as its final offer, worth about an extra
Pounds 1,000 per crew member. The offer was designed to bring an end to the
union's programme of one-day strikes and settle 221 legal actions by crew
claiming breach of contract.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Long Beach awaits bids for the Queen Mary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BIDS for the Queen Mary, the 81,237-ton former flagship of the Cunard
shipping line moored as a tourist attraction at Long Beach, California,
close on Monday.
The ship's owner, the City of Long Beach, put her up for sale after the Walt
Disney entertainment group decided not to renew its lease on the site near
Los Angeles. Disney is thought to have lost Dollars 5m a year since it
leased the vessel in 1988 as a floating hotel and museum.
Long Beach Harbour Commission, which is handling the sale, expects most
potential buyers to delay bids until close to Monday afternoon's deadline -
4.30pm Pacific Standard Time.
Officials expect up to 50 firm proposals. If they fail to find a buyer the
Queen Mary's last voyage could be to the scrap-yard.
The potential schemes include a Japanese plan to convert the vessel into an
office block and several casino projects, although this would require a
change in California gambling laws.
One of the most ambitious plans is to return the Queen Mary to Southampton,
her home port, from where she sailed on her last journey to Long Beach on
October 31 1967.
Long Beach has set stringent terms for the sale. Each bid must be
accompanied by a Dollars 100,000 (Pounds 51,600) deposit, with audited
financial statements, marketing strategies and a date for removal. The
successful purchaser, who will be named in mid-September, is also required
to make a Dollars 5m down-payment.
Conservation groups in Liverpool and Glasgow have dropped out of the
bidding. Merseyside Development Corporation said Liverpool could not raise
the Dollars 100,000 deposit. The Clyde Port Authority said the river where
she was built was too silted to make the project worthwhile.
The business-backed Queen Mary Project UK, based in Southampton, hopes to
refurbish the huge ship - eight times the size of HMS Belfast, moored on the
Thames in London - as a business park, hotel and casino.
Mr David Abraham, chairman of the project and leader of the Conservative
group on Southampton City Council, said: 'We've come across nothing yet to
say it's impossible to bring her back.'
Rotterdam-based Smitwis Towage has estimated that returning the vessel to
the UK would take about 200 days - as long as the ship was seaworthy. She is
too big for the Panama Canal, so would have to be towed round Cape Horn. In
her prime the vessel crossed the Atlantic in four days.
British maritime experts say the Southampton project would be costly and
unlikely to make money. Ms Janet Hales, secretary of the Maritime Trust,
said: 'The maintenance costs of such a huge vessel would be tremendous.
'If Disney cannot operate it successfully the chances of doing so in the UK
are very remote.'
Rados International, a US naval engineering company, has estimated total
repair costs at Dollars 27m, including Dollars 2m to replace watertight
bulkheads.
The costs, which persuaded Disney to terminate its lease, could force Long
Beach to scrap the ship if it fails to find a buyer with considerable
financial muscle. Shipping enthusiasts fear that the authorities may have to
break up the liner or tow her into the Pacific, where she could be sunk.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Labour seeks assurances on RAF operations in Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LABOUR party yesterday called on the government to clarify the terms
under which British warplanes will operate in southern Iraq. It warned that
it would not support attacks on ground positions without further United
Nations authorisation.
Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, wrote to Mr Douglas Hurd, the
foreign secretary, seeking clarification and confirming broad support for
the operation by the US, Britain and France to protect the Shia communities
from Iraqi bombing.
Mr Cunningham said, however, that Labour was disturbed by conflicting
reports from London and Washington on how the air exclusion zone would be
enforced.
He asked for assurances from Mr Hurd that the UN had been kept fully
informed of the plan and added that attacks on Iraqi ground forces within
the zone should not be permitted unless and until they were first considered
by the UN Security Council.
His letter coincided with a series of attacks on Labour's approach to
foreign policy by a number of MPs on the left of the party.
Ms Clare Short, newly restored to a position on the Labour front bench,
attacked the leadership's refusal to demand the recall of parliament to
discuss the crises in Bosnia and Iraq. Her comments came as an editorial in
Tribune newspaper, which represents opinion on the left, launched a bitter
attack on Mr Cunningham's inexperience in foreign affairs.
The Royal Air Force will not make use of RAF Bent-waters and RAF Woodbridge
in Suffolk when the US Air Force leaves the two bases next year.
The Ministry of Defence had been considering moving Harrier aircraft from
RAF Wittering, in Cambridgeshire, and Jaguar aircraft from RAF Coltishall,
in Norfolk, to the two bases when it resumes full control of the sites next
September. But the MoD said yesterday that an investment appraisal had shown
it would not be cost effect-ive.
The ministry believes it unlikely that a long-term defence requirement will
be found for the two Suffolk airfields.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Life's modest pleasures prove too dear: The retreat from the
indulgences of the late 1980s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHASTENED CITIZENS in an austere Britain spent significantly less on life's
pleasures last year. Beer, spirits, toys and games, and entertainment fell
foul of the recession. Instead people preferred to stay at home watching
television or listening to the radio.
The latest UK National Accounts published by the Central Statistical Office
show that last year Britons continued to retreat from the indulgence of the
late 1980s, spending less on all but one of the components that make up
consumer expenditure.
Total consumer spending - which accounts for about two thirds of the UK's
gross domestic product - fell by 2 per cent last year, the first fall since
1981.
Expenditure on household goods fell sharply, reflecting the depressed
housing market, with carpets and furnishings suffering the biggest drop.
Between 1990 and last year spending on household goods and services fell 3
per cent, the second consecutive annual fall. Spending was 6.5 per cent
lower than the peak reached in 1989, after which the housing market started
to tumble.
The year was bleak for sports, betting shops and theatres. It is hardly
surprising that several West End musicals closed prematurely last year with
spending on other recreational and entertainment services down 10 per cent.
Spending on betting and gaming fell by 5 per cent while newspaper and
magazines suffered a 4 per cent fall.
Spending on sports goods, toys, games and camping equipment fell by 4 per
cent, the first fall in this category for 10 years.
Cars fell out of favour as spending dropped by 19 per cent - a far bigger
drop than the 7 per cent registered between 1989 and 1990.
Household spending on food, which accounts for just over a tenth of all
consumer expenditure, was flat on the previous year although the pattern of
spending pointed to a somewhat healthier, if poorer, nation. Spending on
cakes and biscuits fell by 2 per cent while spending on vegetables rose by 5
per cent. Spending on potatoes rose by 2 per cent and spending on sugar
dropped 4 per cent. Fruit was less popular with expenditure falling by 3 per
cent.
People tended to make do with the previous season's fashions last year as
overall spending on clothing and footwear dropped by 2 per cent. Spending on
men's clothing dropped 7 per cent, the third successive fall.
Purchases of 'fripperies' were less popular than in 1990. Spending on
jewellery and clocks was down 7 per cent, and expenditure on hairdressing
and beauty care fell for the third successive year. Restaurants were even
emptier than in 1990 as spending fell by 4 per cent.
Spending on fuel and power, the one component of consumer spending to rise,
increased by 8 per cent on the previous year with big increases in outlay on
electricity and gas.
Revised figures from the Central Statistical Office show that gross domestic
product fell by 2.4 per cent last year rather than the provisional estimate
of a fall of 2.2 per cent. GDP figures for 1990 were also revised to an
increase of 0.6 per cent rather than the 1 per cent that was originally
reported.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Campaign against water sell-off dubbed 'hypocrisy'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONSERVATIVES and the Scottish National Party yesterday attacked
Labour's campaign against water privatisation in Scotland as 'hypocrisy'
after it emerged that Labour-controlled Scottish councils had invested
Pounds 25m in shares in the privatised English and Welsh water industry.
Mr Allan Stewart, a Scottish Office minister, said Labour's campaign had
been 'blown out of the water'. The SNP said the news was a 'disgraceful
example of Labour's double standards'.
It emerged yesterday that Labour-dominated Strathclyde regional council had
invested Pounds 15m of its pension funds in five privatised English water
companies. The Grampian, Lothian, Fife and Central regional councils had
also invested in the industry.
Mr Stewart accused Labour of the 'ultimate hypocrisy'. Labour 'condemned any
thought of using private capital in Scotland's water industry while, at the
same time, they help to finance private water companies in England. Labour
have a lot of explaining to do'.
The Labour-dominated Convention of Scottish Local Authorities said
investment managers had a duty to ensure the best possible return for
pension funds.
Mr Iain Lawson, for the SNP, said: 'The excuse that pension fund managers
cannot be influenced by moral considerations does not wash.'

FT  22 AUG 92 / Holiday industry on alert for cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH MUCH of Britain still on holiday, tour operators will next week start
announcing their 1993 programmes, giving an early indication of whether the
industry's price battles are set to continue.
Operators and travel agents will be looking at any reduction in the number
of holidays offered. Mr Roger Allard, managing director of Owners Abroad,
the UK's second-largest operator, estimated that the supply of 1992 holidays
exceeded demand by 1m in February and March. By the summer fierce price
competition and some trimming of capacity had reduced this to 500,000.
The industry will focus particularly on the brochures of Thomson, the market
leader, which announces its 1993 offerings on Tuesday.
Ms Rosemary Astles, Thomson's marketing director, said the company was
determined to restore its market share to a third. Oversupply of holidays
this year saw Thomson's share fall to 30 per cent, she said.
Owners Abroad announced at the start of this year's high season that it had
cut 100,000 holidays from its programme. Mr Allard said the company would
reduce capacity by a further 5 per cent next year.
Ms Astles said Thomson had no intention of doing the same. 'We will not be
contributing generously to the reduction of the oversupply because we didn't
start the oversupply,' she said. As to price, she said Thomson would not be
too concerned if other companies offered cut-price holidays 'as a gimmicky
come-on - as long as there are not too many available'.
Thomson's price policy would be 'made with our market-share objective in
mind'. In the past this has meant Thomson reacting to oversupply or cheap
offerings from rivals with a warning burst of price-cutting.
Mr George Marcall, sales director of Airtours, the third-largest operator,
said his company's 1993 prices were likely to be at the same level as this
year's. Mr Allard expected prices to rise by 2 per cent or 3 per cent. Both
forecasts imply a price cut in real terms.
The falling dollar has, however, reduced the cost of providing US holidays.
As aircraft fuel is priced in dollars, savings are also available to other
destinations. In addition, Mr Marcall said, the Mediterranean had had a
difficult summer and tour operators would be able to drive a hard bargain
with hoteliers.
Mr Peter Rothwell, marketing director of Lunn Poly, the biggest chain of
travel agents, said he expected some eye-catching promotional offers, such
as free holidays for children. 'But really, these will tend to be price
skirmishes rather than fully-fledged battles.'
Operators will try to capture that proportion of the market which tends to
book holidays early.
Factory workers who have to take their holidays during plant shutdowns are
among those booking early. This usually means strong early bookings from the
north, which has proved to be a more resilient market than the south during
the recession.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Enter the dragon into corporate sport: Team spirit and brand
awareness mix well on the water
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCREAMED commands and the dull thump of a drum disturbed the evening calm as
a low craft skimmed across Hartlepool Marina in Cleveland, looking like a
giant centipede doing the front-crawl.
Twenty paddles moved in unison behind Mr Dave Price at stroke. His teeth
were set in a snarl as muscular forearms shovelled water into the boat's
wake.
Enter Nuclear Electric's dragon boat, which is in the vanguard of one of
Britain's fastest-growing corporate sports.
In the five years since dragon boat racing was imported from Hong Kong, 60
clubs have been established across the UK. Last year about 380 teams took
part in competitions.
All teams competing in events organised by the British Dragon Boat
Association must have corporate sponsorship. The reward for the companies is
the opportunity to encourage team spirit while spreading brand awareness.
The sport's popularity has been confirmed by its inclusion in the annual
World Corporate Games, an international sporting event for company teams and
individuals that is being held in London for the first time next month.
Dragon boat racing originated in China, where an annual festival is held to
commemorate the death of a 4th century BC poet, Qu Yuan, who threw himself
into the Mi Low river after he was expelled from the royal court. Fishermen
are said to have raced their boats out in an unsuccessful attempt to save
him. The sport is so named because of the ornamental dragons' heads at the
prows of the boats.
Adopted as a competitive sport in Hong Kong during the mid-1970s, it spread
swiftly throughout the Pacific rim and is believed to be the biggest
corporate sport in Australia.
The two-day world championships in Hong Kong are televised live. 'Over there
it's akin to the FA Cup in England,' says Mr Price, who works in the
Hartlepool power station's planning department.
Chinese and Hong Kong boats are made of mahogany, but Mr Chris Hare, a boat
builder based in Hartlepool, made glass-fibre moulds of the boats which he
now constructs commercially.
Nuclear Electric adopted dragon boat racing three years ago when the company
was still a part of National Power before the privatisation of the
electricity industry.
A scratch team using a borrowed boat entered a race at Hartlepool Marina and
came third. 'We found we were good at it so went to the management and asked
if they would foot the Pounds 5,000 bill for a boat of our own,' says Mr
Price.
Mr Bill Shirra, administration manager at the power station, says: 'At the
time National Power was looking for ways, like any new company, to get its
name across to the public and the opportunity to have the company name and
logo on the side of the boat at events around the country seemed appealing.'
A year later the newly formed Nuclear Electric took over the sponsorship.
The state-owned electricity generator has specific requirements on
sponsorship decisions. To attain commercial viability it sees its main task
as gaining public acceptance of nuclear power.
'We're convinced we have the power source for the future,' says Mr Shirra.
'But we have to get this message across to the public.'
The dragon boat team is viewed as a cost-effective way of promoting the
company. 'We see them as ambassadors to the public for nuclear power,' says
Mr Shirra.
The creation of the team had also had an internal spin-off, he says, in
fostering team spirit among the workforce.
Mr John Collier, chairman and chief executive, says sponsorship is a way of
putting something back into communities that serve the industry.
'In addition, it is an opportunity to be involved with events which suit our
company profile and values,' he adds. Nuclear Electric, he says, is
attracted to events that concentrate on teamwork.
The Hartlepool team came third in the national championships last year and
has competed in Belgium, Hong Kong and Singapore.
Mr Price says: 'It is something that you can do at all levels. We have raced
against the best teams in the world, such as the Indonesian national team -
the world champions - and we've raced against the Brownies and Cubs.'
The Hartlepool team will be among nearly 8,000 competitors contesting 22
events in the World Corporate Games running from September 26 to October 4
at venues in and around London. The closing date for entries is August 29.
The games organisers can be contacted on 071 351 1992. Further details about
dragon boat racing from the British Dragon Boat Association, 071 930 2296.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Lloyds plans brand change for Access card
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYDS BANK, one of the original members of the Access credit card
consortium, plans a shake-up of the branding of its 2m Access credit cards.
This will effectively convert them into Lloyds Bank credit cards with the
MasterCard branding.
The move represents the latest step by Lloyds towards direct competition
between banks in the credit card market and away from consortium operations.
Lloyds has not finally decided what form the change in brand design will
take.
One option is for the MasterCard logo to be given equal prominence on the
credit cards with that of Access. A more radical solution would be to
transfer the Access logo from the front of the card to the back.
The move will be announced before the end of the year after which the
redesigned cards will be issued in stages.
The redesign will not directly affect Lloyds' Access customers, the working
of cardholders' monthly accounts, or the retail outlets in which the card
can be used.
In a separate move aimed at building closer links between credit card
customers and the banks, Lloyds redesigned its statements last month. They
now emphasise the Lloyds branding and give much less prominence to Access.
Lloyds does not, however, plan to withdraw from the Access consortium which
handles the marketing operations of the 8.8m cards carrying the Access
branding. Apart from the four banks which own the Access brand name -
National Westminster, Midland, Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds - Access
cards are issued by five smaller banks and building societies.
Two months ago the number of employees at the Southend, Essex operations of
Access Brand was trimmed from 17 to nine, but the Access banks say that no
changes in its marketing role are under consideration.
Another of the Access banks said yesterday: 'We are aware of what Lloyds is
planning to do, but as far as we are concerned, it is a decision for them
alone. We are still committed to the Access branding.'
Mrs Jane Jee, Access Brand general manager, said yesterday that she was not
aware that Lloyds had any plans to move away from the Access branding.
There was some puzzlement in the credit card industry yesterday over why
Lloyds was considering a retreat from the brand it helped launch 20 years
ago, since Access is regarded as a very strong name.
About 41 per cent of UK credit card holders carry cards branded with Access,
compared to 33 per cent for Barclaycard, the second largest brand.
Access is the UK affiliate of the MasterCard credit card system which also
has a third brand name, Eurocard, in Europe. All three brand names are
carried on UK Access cards, but some bankers feel that having three brand
names on one card is confusing for the customer and obscures the role of the
bank issuing the card.
A pilot scheme to print customers' photographs on cash cards as a security
measure appears to be successful, the Royal Bank of Scotland said yesterday.
The bank said 28,000 such cards - which cost each customer Pounds 2 - were
in circulation and there had not been a single case of misuse following
theft or loss, even when other cards stolen at the same time had been used
fraudulently.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A MAN set fire to his home the day before it was to be repossessed by
Citibank, Oxford Crown Court heard yesterday.
Mr Darren Kelly and his two brothers wanted to sell the house for Pounds
63,000 to clear their debts and had found a buyer, the court was told. But
it was claimed that Citibank refused to sanction the deal because it was
still owed another Pounds 3,000.
Judge Patrick Medd told Mr Kelly, of Littlemore, Oxford, who admitted arson:
'The position you were put in when Citibank refused to accept Pounds 63,000
I can understand. It must have been frustrating and infuriating to a
degree.' Mr Kelly was given a 12-month prison sentence suspended for two
years.
Citibank, which was not called to give evidence, said later: 'We feel we
should clarify that we have no record of any formal offer or interest from
potential purchasers in Mr Kerry's property.' It added: 'We believe we acted
responsibly and the customer was fully informed of our intended actions at
every stage.'

THE DAILY Mirror and Sun newspapers yesterday claimed that their publication

American friend, had greatly increased their sales.
The publication of the poolside photographs has been criticised by
Buckingham Palace and has refuelled the debate over privacy and the press.
The Daily Mirror said an extra 14 per cent, or 370,000 copies, were sold on
Thursday and more sales figures were coming in. Yesterday's print run, when
further photographs were published, included an extra 300,000 copies, it
said.
The Sun claimed its biggest sale for four years yesterday when it published
a front page photograph of the Duchess topless. An extra 300,000 copies had
been printed.
Yesterday the Duke and Duchess of York were at Balmoral with other members
of the royal family. Mr John Bryan was reported to have visited a leading
libel lawyer.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Office equipment supplier is placed in receivership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DECIMO International, the family-owned office equipment supplier trading
under the 'Decimo Vatman' brand name, has been placed in administrative
receivership, Michael Cassell writes.
KPMG Peat Marwick was yesterday appointed receiver of the company.
Decimo, founded in 1968, imported a range of goods under its own brand name
 -including facsimile machines, word processors and photocopiers from the
Far East - and grew rapidly in the 1970s and 1980s.
Early this year annual turnover was reported at Pounds 7.4m but the company
has been badly hit by the recession as employers have reduced office costs.
Decimo's problems were compounded by the increasing tendency of overseas
equipment manufacturers to end agency arrangements and sell direct to
customers.
Mr Tony Thompson, the joint receiver, said last night that a change in
policy by Far Eastern suppliers 'was the final straw'.
Decimo, based in Luton, recently employed about 60 people but staff is down
to 12.
Mr Thompson said: 'The recession is now affecting the most renowned
companies. Decimo have developed products which are noted for their
reliability, innovation and value-for-money.'
In view of the company's reputation, he was hopeful it could be sold as a
going concern.

Close aides to President Fernando Collor de Mello withdrew large sums just

Dollars 303,000 (Pounds 159,000) from two accounts on the last day banks
were open before the president's inauguration.
Mr Farias is at the heart of a corruption scandal that threatens to bring
down Mr Collor's government. Congressional investigators have heard
testimony apparantly linking Mr Collor to a multi-million dollar extortion
racket allegedly organised by Mr Farias.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US yesterday put pressure on China by publishing a list of Dollars 3.9bn
(Pounds 2bn) in imports that could face sanctions if bilateral negotiations
fail to reduce Beijing's import barriers.
The 'hit list' - the largest ever published by the US - is headed by
footwear and includes silk clothing, jewellery, ceramics, electronics,
bicycles, watches, tea, spices, foods, and leather goods.
Mr Michael Moskow, the deputy US trade representative, said an effort would
be made to avoid putting tariffs of up to 100 per cent on items which would
otherwise be scarce.
There is also likely to be an effort to avoid damaging Hong Kong interests
and to target state-run industries.
The list was published for public comment after a fifth round of talks in
Beijing this week failed to produce what the US sees as satisfactory
progress.
Chinese officials have hinted at retaliation.
The two sides will meet again in mid-September and the first week in
October, in the hope of achieving a settlement by October 10, the deadline
set under US trade law.
The US Commerce Department says its Dollars 12.7bn trade deficit with China
is still growing. Imports rose almost 42 per cent in the first six months of
this year, while exports increased only 18.4 per cent.
The US attributes the surplus to unfair trade barriers, such as China's
import substitution policy and high tariffs.
Among other demands, it is pressing China to publish its laws, regulations,
and judicial and administrative rulings pertaining to imports; to end import
bans and restrictions; to discontinue restrictions imposed through import
licensing; and to discontinue technical trade barriers, such as unreasonable
standards and testing requirements.
US officials present their demands as an attempt to prepare China for
membership of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

Resolution of these issues is a precondition for the resumption of talks on
a new constitution, suspended two months ago in the wake of a massacre at
the Boipatong squatter camp near Johannesburg.
Over the past week, political groups from the extreme right and left have
said they might be willing to participate in talks. The ultra-radical Pan
Africanist Congress (PAC) met government officials this week to discuss
participation, and a breakaway group of right-wing MPs said it will join the
talks to negotiate for a white homeland for the Afrikaner people.

KOREAN WELCOME: a huge South Korean advertising poster, a common sight in
Beijing, greets travellers on arrival in the Chinese capital's airport.
Agencies report from Seoul.
The two countries have long been doing business together, a relationship
expected to be cemented today with the official announcement of diplomatic
relations. The new ties will signal the end to four decades of cold war
hostility, a foreign ministry official said yesterday.
'All the paperwork is ready and the only thing left is the signing of the
accord on the 24th (of August),' KBS radio quoted a high ranking foreign
ministry official as saying.
For South Korea, long-sought diplomatic ties with North Korea's strongest
backer are a key step towards its dream of reunifying the peninsula. China's
trade links with South Korea expanded to exceed Dollars 5.8bn (Pounds
3.03bn) last year, with trade expected to top Dollars 10bn this year.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Japan money supply growth at record low

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S broad money supply (M2 plus certificates of deposit) grew at a
record low pace of 0.2 per cent in July compared with 0.9 per cent in June.
A Bank of Japan official attributed part of the slowdown to slower
commercial bank lending.
The central bank has until recently promoted broad money supply as the most
important indicator to follow when setting monetary policy. But it is
joining a growing list of central banks around the world that have been
flustered at the behaviour of monetary aggregates, and the Bank of Japan
says the measure is becoming less useful as a measure of economic activity.
The central bank said the fluctuations in broad money were not easily
explained by economic activity or changes in interest rates, also reflecting
fluctuations in asset prices, changing bank behaviour under interest rate
liberalisation, and the shift of funds between bank deposits and other
savings instruments.
Another indicator, broad liquidity - which includes deposits in the postal
savings system - grew by 3.5 per cent, also a record low compared with 3.9
per cent in June. The officials said broad liquidity has maintained a high
degree of credibility, but it was difficult to explain why. It said the
shift of funds out of the banking system did not indicate any credit crunch,
and that corporate activities have not generally been restricted by lack of
access to funding.
The bank nonetheless said it would pay close attention to the lending
attitudes of banks as well as to monetary aggregates because banks were
adopting a more prudent lending stance in the wake of rising non-performing
assets, the share price fall, and the pressure of meeting Bank of
International Settlement capital adequacy ratios.
The bank said for the time being it would follow a number of monetary
indicators and try to repond quickly to changes in the economic environment.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US yesterday warned that the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina could soon spread
to other parts of the former Yugoslavia, just hours before four people were
killed in Sarajevo in the heaviest bombardment of the city in a month.
In a veiled reference to the Serb-controlled province of Kosovo, Mr Lawrence
Eagleburger, the acting secretary of state, said: 'I think there's a real
chance that this conflict can spread.'
Mr Eagleburger, ambassador to Belgrade from 1977 to 1980, said he was
pessimistic about the outcome of next week's London conference on the former
Yugoslavia organised by the European Community and United Nations.
'I don't think this tragic situation is gong to end in any short period of
time, no matter what we do to try to bring it to an end,' he told the Voice
of America radio station.
Hopes for peace were further dimmed, last night, by a flare up in fighting
across Bosnia. The Belgrade-based Tanjug news agency reported fierce
fighting in several districts of Sarajevo. Fighting was also reported in
Posavina, the Serb-held enclave near Bosnia's river border with Croatia.
Meanwhile, in an apparent attempt to improve Serbia's image in the run-up to
the London Conference, Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of Bosnia's Serbs,
yesterday admitted Serb forces had carried out ethnic cleansing and vowed to
put an end to the policy which has driven hundreds of thousands of Moslem
Slavs from their homes.
At a press conference in Belgrade, the Serbian capital, Mr Karadzic
insisted: 'We must put a stop to ethnic cleansing and punish all persons
responsible.'
Serb forces, who claim to control 70 per cent of Bosnia, have driven out,
imprisoned or killed Moslems in an attempt to create purely Serb territory.
Mr Karadzic, however, dismissed reports of forced deportation as
'resettlement which took place at the request of the population wishing to
leave an area of high tension'.
This was despite reports by western journalists who this week accompanied
1,500 Moslems on a harrowing journey after being expelled from north-western
Bosnia by Serb militia.
Mr Karadzic also repeated a promise to hand over all Serb-controlled
detention camps to the Red Cross and to close all camps after an all-for-all
prisoner exchange.
Many Moslem refugees have told how Serb militia forced them to sign over
their property. But Mr Karadzic said: 'Forceful measures taken against
civilians are not part of our policies, although atrocities have taken place
on all sides. All property handed over under duress will have to be
returned. These documents are invalid.'
Mr Karadzic offered a seven-point peace programme, which included the
recognition of Bosnian frontiers and a ceasefire. This programme reflects
close co-ordination between Serb leaders from Bosnia and the unrecognised
Yugoslavia of Serbia and Montenegro.
The pledge to recognise Bosnia's borders could enable the reconstituted
Yugoslavia to meet one of the demands of the international community in
order to lift United Nations sanctions.
But recognition would have little meaning since Serb forces have already
achieved their territorial goals.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Russia gives away state giants to force reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Anatoly Chubais, Russia's privatisation minister, said yesterday that a
mass privatisation give-away scheme was the only way to force restructuring
on inefficient state enterprises.
He said vouchers entitling every Russian citizen to acquire Rbs10,000-worth
of shares in 6,000-7,000 medium and large enterprises would be distributed
between October and December. The enterprises would be privatised next year.
The unveiling of an unprecedented 'popular privatisation' programme
coincides with the government's continuing battle with enterprises and the
central bank governor over how much new credit they should receive.
On Monday, Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, head of the Russian central bank, plans
to seek IMF permission for fresh credits to enterprises. Such permission was
one of the conditions for the granting of a first loan of Dollars 1bn.
Mr Gerashchenko, who favours soft credit facilities in order to boost
industrial production, and who opposes rapid privatisation, is accusing the
government of trying to sell weakened enterprises off on the cheap.
The primary importance of the IMF agreement was to reassure foreign
creditors and open the door to a debt rescheduling agreement and fresh
bilateral credits. But a delegation headed by Mr Richard Erb, the Fund's
deputy-director, is likely to look for guarantees that measures will be put
in place to avoid a recurrence of new enterprise arrears and that additional
credits, if they are agreed, will not act as a green light for enterprises
to raise wages and prices.
Mr Chubais acknowledged there was a danger that the speed of the
privatisation plan could mean that Russians could find themselves holding
shares in enterprises which were unviable. 'It is not possible to seriously
count on enterprises to restructure on a massive scale . . . without a
change in the form of property,' he said. 'Of course there is a risk that
some enterprises will go under (after they are privatised) but this risk is
an incentive for enterprises to become more effective.'
'At a time when we are talking about the life or death of reforms . . . it
is only by smashing the industrial giants that we can talk about a radical
change in property ownership,' explained Ms Olga Tankova, a privatisation
official.
Once workers had vouchers to help them buy shares in the enterprise - they
are entitled to 25 per cent of their enterprise's stock free of charge plus
another 10 per cent at a discount - they would exert increasing pressure on
recalcitrant managers to privatise.
All state-owned enterprises are required, as a first step, to turn
themselves into a joint-stock companies by November. The latest to take this
decision was the Zil car plant in Moscow yesterday.
President Boris Yeltsin yesterday ruled out the possibility of a new coup or
of hunger in Russia even though he forecast unemployment and outbursts of
social discontent later this year.
Speaking at a news conference on the first anniversary of the Moscow coup's
collapse, he said 1993 would be 'easier for us all'. Although Russia had to
rely mainly on itself to conduct radical economic reforms, he claimed Italy
had been the most helpful of G7 nations, followed by Canada, Germany, the
US, France, the UK, with Japan in dismal last place. Canada yesterday
resumed grain shipments after it received some of the Dollars 55m it was
owed in arrears for earlier deliveries, while Italy is considering freezing
an existing line of credit for Russia.

UNITED Parcel Service, the world's largest parcel delivery company, and
Federal Express, the largest overnight package delivery operation, have
joined the chorus of US airlines opposing British Airways' proposed Dollars
750m (Pounds 393m) investment in USAir, the sixth largest US carrier.
UPS, a private company based in Atlanta, has put its name to a briefing
document outlining the case against the BA-USAir deal, 'An issue of national
policy, competition and fairness', circulated yesterday by a Washington DC
lobbying firm, Powell Tate.
The other three signatories to the document are American Airlines, United
Airlines and Delta Air Lines - the nation's three biggest airlines - which
have publicly opposed the deal.
According to Powell Tate, UPS was closely involved in the drafting of the
document. Part of the company's concern appears to centre on repercus sions
for the freight market.
'This is a direct assault on the US airline industry,' reads the document at
one stage. 'This is not a question of British Airways acquiring a 'toehold'
in the lucrative US market, but a potential stranglehold over access to 55m
USAir passengers and 200m freight tons per kilometre of air cargo a year.'
Under the proposed deal, BA would invest Dollars 750m in USAir, in return
for a potential 44 per cent equity stake and 21 per cent voting stake. The
document argues, however, that USAir would be under BA's control, since 'all
critical business decisions' would need the approval of 80 per cent of the
board, and the UK airline would hold four of the 16 seats.
The outcry from the US carriers is widely viewed as an effort to put
pressure on the Bush administration to win greater access for US airlines to
the UK and Europe, in return for approving the transaction. However, in
London, British Airways repeated its conviction that the deal 'falls
squarely within existing regulations and has no implications for the
bilateral agreement'.
Federal Express, of Memphis, yesterday added its support to the campaign.
Like UPS, it has been expanding air freight operations outside its domestic
market. It recently pulled out of the intra-European delivery business, but
still flies a sizable 'Expressfreighter' service across the Atlantic.
A top Transportation Department official said yesterday the US and the
Netherlands would soon sign an 'open skies' agreement, AP-DJ reports from
Washngton.
The agreement with the Netherlands - the first of its kind - might be
completed in weeks, said Mr Jeffrey Shane, assistant secretary for policy
and international affairs.
The agreement would give KLM Royal Dutch Airlines blanket authority to fly
to any US city it chooses. In return, US carriers would be able to serve any
city in the Netherlands.

REGIONAL trade deals are neither a rival nor an alternative to the
multilateral trading system, said Mr Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), yesterday. He dismissed as
'rhetoric' threats to pursue regionalism by countries frustrated by the
current deadlock in the Uruguay Round of Gatt trade talks.
His remarks, to a seminar in Rio de Janeiro on economic integration in the
Americas, come just over a week after completion of negotiations on a North
American Free Trade Area (Nafta) between the US, Canada and Mexico. The
Nafta deal has reinforced fears, especially in Asia, that the world may be
splitting into warring trading blocs with high trade barriers against
outsiders.
Mr Dunkel said multilateralism and regionalism could not only co-exist but
reinforce each other. The quest for freer trade in the Uruguay Round had
strengthened interest in speeding the process regionally. But some issues
could not be tackled effectively in a regional framework.
Gatt's founders saw global and regional approaches to trade as two sides of
the same coin, he said. Gatt lays down rules for creating free trade areas
and customs unions, designed to ensure above all that regional integration
should not be at the expense of third parties. Mr Dunkel said that, while
this might seem utopian, free trade areas could provide gains for members
and non-members alike.
The Nafta accord is expected to come under close scrutiny by other Gatt
members insisting it must be consistent with international fair trade rules.

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW political crisis is looming in Ireland, following the gagging of a
parliamentary inquiry by the Supreme Court yesterday.
The court ruled by a three-to-two majority that key cabinet decisions on
government financial support given to the beef industry in 1988 are entitled
to the protection of confidentiality under the constitution, and can
therefore not be subject to scrutiny.
The inquiry, known as the Beef Tribunal, was set up in June last year after
allegations of fraud, malpractice and political connivance in the beef
industry were made in parliament and broadcast in a TV documentary.
The most serious charge for the government is that Goodman International,
Europe's largest beef processor, exerted undue influence on government
ministers resulting in almost half the country's export credit insurance
being given to just two beef exporters, for sales to Iraq which Iraq later
defaulted on.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, was the industry minister at the
time responsible for the allocation of the insurance. Mr Des O'Malley, the
present minister, told the tribunal last month he believed Mr Reynolds had
made 'serious errors of judgment' in having allocated insurance cover for
the Iraqi exports, and the sourcing of some of the meat from outside Ireland
by Goodman to supply the contracts amounted to 'a fraud on the taxpayer'.
The tribunal was suspended after its chairman, Mr Justice Liam Hamilton,
began questioning Mr Ray Burke, another former minister, on cabinet
decisions in 1988 relating to the export insurance.
Mr Dick Spring, leader of the opposition Labour party and a key figure in
getting the tribunal established, said: 'This is going to lead to a very
serious political crisis.
'A fundamental task of the tribunal has been hampered and I believe it will
now be extremely difficult for it to carry out its mandate.'
Mr Reynolds last night welcomed the Supreme Court ruling and dismissed
opposition demands for an early recall of the parliament.
Ireland's two main clearing banks, Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland,
have raised their interest rates by half a point, bringing lending rates up
to 13.5 per cent for overdrafts and 15 per cent for loans over five years.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Bush sups sweet cup of opportunity: President stakes out
campaign ground with attack on Clinton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush was expected to deliver a fighting speech to the
Republican convention. He did not disappoint.
Very well written, mostly by Mr Ray Price, President Nixon's old wordsmith,
and delivered with more panache than Mr Bush usually musters, it lasted
about an hour - a little longer than Mr Bill Clinton's to his Democratic
convention last month - and was rapturously received by the assembled
delegates.
Its principal purpose, as it transpired, was more to stake out the ground
for the campaign proper than to lay out a detailed blueprint for a second
term. The president said the electorate was offered 'a sharp choice' between
two candidates with different agendas, directions and 'yes, the character of
the man you want to lead this nation'.
He frequently invoked his own war record ('I had barely begun to live when I
began to watch men die'), derisively referring to Mr Clinton as 'the head of
the Arkansas National Guard' and deliberately not mentioning that his
opponent had avoided military service. He contrasted his leadership in the
Gulf war with Mr Clinton's equivocal support for it: 'I bit the bullet, he
bit his nails.'
He painted Mr Clinton, whom he only began to mention regularly by name in
the coda to his speech, as the captive of 'the liberal McGovern wing of the
other party' and as 'Carter Two'.
He said his opponent was advocating 'Elvis economics and America will be
checking into Heartbreak Hotel.' Mr Clinton, he said, had faith 'in the
tattered blanket of bureaucracy' and would put a new tax on everything in
sight, including what he described as 'the government takeover' of health
care. Not only would he ration it, but 'he would deny you the right to use a
doctor'.
'He defines rich,' Mr Bush charged, 'as anyone who has a job and he wants to
separate you from your wallet.' Echoing a standard Republican theme, he
declared 'my opponent's passion for big government knows no bounds'.
Mr Bush conceded he had made 'a bad call' when he accepted a tax increase in
1990, but he insisted it was 'the Democrats' tax increase', not his own. But
if he had made 'a mistake', that was nothing compared to Mr Clinton who
'enjoys tax increases'.
His general assault on the Democrats running Congress was as unremitting as
it was against Mr Clinton. They were, he said, caught up in 'PACS, perks,
privilege, partnership and paralysis'. He demanded action to limit the
number of terms congressmen might serve. He said there might be 150 new
members of congress in January and 'I'll meet every one of them before they
are attacked by the PACS, run by their staffs and cornered by the camera
crews.'
The president's declared economic agenda for his second term was more sparse
than his indictment of the other side. He promised, if re-elected, to cut
taxes next year, but only if matching spending cuts were effected. He
unveiled a gimmicky plan to enable individuals to contribute to reducing the
national debt. But mostly he contented himself with recycling proposals
which, he claimed, Congress had deliberately frustrated. 'I offered them my
hand, they bit it.'
The speech began with a long recitation of the changes in the world that had
taken place on his watch, for which he claimed credit. If, Mr Bush said, he
had predicted all these developments, people would have said 'you must have
inhaled something' (Mr Clinton has conceded smoking, but not inhaling,
marijuana).
The president declared contempt for Mr Clinton for daring to suggest that
the US was now an object of 'ridicule' abroad. The US stood tall and there
were lots of challenges ahead. Invoking another Republican touchstone, he
said to great cheers 'I look forward to being the first president to visit a
free, democratic Cuba'.
On social issues, Mr Bush did not stray far from the conservative emphasis
on religion and traditional family values. The country must change, he
conceded, but must also go back to its roots. This meant respect for human
life, of 'the born and unborn', his only reference to abortion, which so
divides the Republican Party.
With all this, Mr Bush said he sensed 'Americans are uneasy today'. But, he
said, in Reaganesque terms 'I see not sunset but a sunrise.' There was 'an
unprecedented opportunity to pass the sweet cup of opportunity around our
American table.' Appealing to the national spirit and implicitly critical of
Mr Clinton, he went on, 'if the entire world is going our way, why should we
go back to their way?'
And yet there was one Democrat with whom Mr Bush was happy to claim
association. Harry Truman, Mr Bush asserted, had in 1948 promised 'a new
crusade', above all against Congress (which was Republican at the time). So
was he, against a different party political target.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Brussels' green activism goes on: Subsidiarity will not mean
repealing EC environment laws, says Van Miert
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission intends to continue pursuing an activist
environmental policy, and will resist any roll-back of its green powers by
the EC member states, according to Mr Karel Van Miert, the new environment
commissioner.
'Certainly, as far as I'm concerned, there can be no question of
backtracking, or of demolishing or diluting our policies,' Mr Van Miert
emphasised in an interview, his first on the environment since he took over
the portfolio last month from his controversial predecessor, Mr Carlo Ripa
di Meana.
Mr Van Miert implied that it would be foolish to blunt one of the few
policies for which Brussels is popular, in the middle of a backlash against
the Community and the Maastricht treaty.
'At the end of the day, no one can contest that (the environment) is one of
our most successful policies, and one of the best understood. We should
build on that confidence - this is a policy where you can clearly prove that
it is working for our citizens,' he argued.
Mr Ripa di Meana, who interpreted his job as a sort of Tribune of the
People, has had numerous bruising encounters with the UK and several other
EC governments. But in the wake of Danish voters' rejection of the
Maastricht treaty in June, the EC has been awash with rumour that great
swathes of Community environment policy would be repatriated to the member
states, to emphasise a new commitment to 'subsidiarity'.
This ill-defined doctrine says the EC should only intervene when decisions
are not practical at national or regional level. Mr Jacques Delors,
Commission president, has espoused it with particular enthusiasm, but last
month said his own earlier suggestions that certain EC environment powers
were a prime candidate for devolution had been misunderstood.
Mr Van Miert yesterday also swept aside reports that under the current UK
presidency of the EC there would be a repeal of some existing EC green laws.
'Repealing can only be done on the basis of a proposal from the Commission
and a decision by the Council of Ministers (of the 12), and modifying (EC
law) implies the same procedure,' he said. But he did concede that 'we are
prepared to discuss the merits of particular laws.'
Brussels last month dropped five legal cases against the UK for allegedly
failing to carry out proper environment impact assessment studies for road
and construction projects, including at Twyford Down in Hampshire. It is
still looking at two possible infractions - at the East London River
Crossing through Oxleas Wood and the British Petroleum refinery in Falkirk.
This decision followed the postponement of legal hearings against the UK on
inadequate bathing water purity, in a move designed to spare Britain
embarrassment at the start of its presidency. Taken together, they were
interpreted by most environmentalists as showing the Commission pulling in
its green horns.
But both Mr Van Miert and officials who had prepared the environmental
impact dossiers insisted yesterday that the UK was able to provide proof in
all but the two cases still open that it had complied with EC law.
Nevertheless, the commissioner said he would be proposing an 'updating' of
impact assessment legislation to avoid 'misunderstandings'.
Mr Van Miert also made clear he intends to pursue the controversial Brussels
plan for an energy tax.

Estonia was the first former Soviet republic to abandon the rouble currency
when it introduced its kroon in June with the help of a Dollars 40m IMF
stabilisation fund. Latvia is also getting ready to introduce its own
currency, the lat.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Low growth in GDP forecast for Spain

THE Bank of Spain yesterday forecast gross domestic product growth this year
of below 2 per cent, the country's lowest rate since 1984.
The central bank's report on the first six months confirmed independent
estimates of a deteriorating domestic economy marked by a sharp fall in
consumption and a widening public sector deficit.
The report said the construction sector was in 'a clear recession' -
official tenders for civil works had fallen by 47.9 per cent in the first
six months of the year - and that the public sector deficit had increased by
40.4 per cent over the first half of last year.
Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez reiterated yesterday that the government
would introduce a restrictive budget for 1993 and said the bank's report
justified the introduction of the fiscal package a month ago that raised
taxes and implemented spending cuts.
Spain's GDP growth fell from 3.8 to 2.4 per cent last year, a rate the
government had hoped to maintain this year.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Intervention fails to bolster dollar: Sterling dragged down;
Dollars at record low against DM; Wall Street falls 50 points

CONCERTED intervention by the world's central banks to buy the dollar
yesterday failed to stop the currency falling to an all-time low against the
D-Mark.
The dollar's slide upset bond and share prices on Wall Street. After a
hectic day's trading the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 50.79 at
3,254.10, its lowest point since early April and its biggest one-day fall
this year.
The decline in the US currency also helped to push down sterling against the
D-Mark in the European exchange rate mechanism. The pound was trading in New
York last night within two pfennigs of its permitted ERM floor before
rallying near the close.
Although the US Federal Reserve, acting with 15 other central banks
including the Bundesbank and the Bank of England, intervened to buy dollars
for D-Marks, the US currency fell through DM1.4430, its all-time low set in
February 1991.
In New York, the dollar closed at DM1.429, almost 3 pfennigs below its high
of the day, while against the pound, it finished at Dollars 1.955.
By continuing to sell the dollar in spite of the intervention, investors
pushed up the D-Mark's exchange rate against European currencies. As a
result, the pound remained weak, but picked up from its lows in New York to
end at DM2.801. Earlier, sterling closed in London at DM2.7975, down a
pfennig on the day. If the pound falls to its ERM floor of DM2.7780 next
week, either the Bank of England will be forced to intervene and buy
sterling or the government will support the pound by raising UK base rates.
This will show dealers that they can get a better return for their sterling
investment than they would by buying D-Marks.
Talks on actions that may be needed are likely this weekend. Mr John Major,
the prime minister, is due back tomorrow from holiday and Mr Norman Lamont,
the chancellor, is due back at the Treasury on Monday.
Dealers in the sterling money markets seemed convinced a rise in UK base
rates was imminent. Three-month money in the sterling cash market was
offered at 10 1/2 per cent, half a percentage point above UK base rates.
Short sterling futures fell by over 20 basis points and were clearly pricing
in a rise of  1/2 a percentage point in base rates. In yesterday's
intervention, the central banks spent D-Marks worth an estimated Dollars
1bn, buying dollars at around DM1.4480 in a generally thin market.
Dealers are now uncertain at what level the Federal Reserve will intervene
to hold the currency. Operators at one of the biggest foreign exchange
trading banks in London said the dollar was still under a lot of pressure
last night. Technical analysts say they are in uncharted territory because
the dollar has never been at these low levels.
The selling of dollars pushed the D-Mark's rate up against other European
currencies. The lira fell to 762.2, close to its floor against the D-Mark of
765.0. The Bank of Italy may have to raise interest rates again if it is to
stop the currency hitting its floor.

FT  22 AUG 92 / UN team urges moretroops for Somalia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A CONFIDENTIAL United Nations report has recommended that at least a further
1,000 armed UN guards be sent urgently to protect aid efforts in Somalia,
with or without the consent of the warring factions.
The controversial recommendation, soon to be put to the Security Council, is
made by a UN team which recently visited Somalia. It is likely to antagonise
most of Somalia's feuding warlords, who have threatened to fire on UN troops
who enter the country without their agreement.
The unpublished report says more armed UN guards are necessary to help
relief efforts reach an estimated 1.5m people facing starvation in a country
where banditry and looting is widespread. An agreement was clinched last
week, after months of obstruction by one Somali military faction, to allow
500 UN guards to protect relief operations, but they are confined to
Mogadishu.
The report recommends that every effort should be made to reach agreement
with the warring factions for the deployment of more UN security personnel.
But it adds: 'In the event that no agreement is reached the UN should be
prepared to do so without the consent of the parties.'
The report goes on: 'The essential point is that the international community
cannot stand idly and witness the unnecessary loss of human lives in
Somalia.'
The UN report says at least 500 troops should be dispatched to both
north-east and south-west Somalia to protect humanitarian relief operations
and safeguard ports, airports and road convoys.
It says the troops should be armed with light weapons, armour-breaking
weapons, teargas and rubber bullets and have armoured personnel carriers.
The report suggests the two battalions should be based in Bossaso, in the
far north-east, and Mandera, a Kenyan town on the Somali border.
The report, which was presented to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the
secretary-general, on Wednesday, also recommends the deployment of further
military observers in the north-east, south-west and southern regions of
Somalia. Fifty military observers are already in Mogadishu.
Other recommendations include:
The creation, under UN auspices, of a disarming force which would carry out
a 'food for arms' exchange programme.
The division of the country into four operational zones.
Delivering 39,000 tonnes of food relief each month.
The provision of assistance in re-establishing a police force.
A non-food aid programme, covering health, water, sanitation, agriculture
and livestock.
Meanwhile, US and Kenyan officials scrambled to limit the damage after a
bruising diplomatic row about the massive US airlift of food to Somalia.
US Ambassador Smith Hempstone and the US general in charge of the airlift
were summoned for a hurried meeting with President Daniel arap Moi after the
Kenyan government protested that the US had flouted Kenyan sovereignty and
had not sought proper clearance to send armed troops on to Kenyan soil.
Mr Ndolo Ayah, the Kenyan foreign minister, said President Moi had now
authorised the first flight of the airlift to Wajir, northern Kenya, and the
US and Kenya had established a committee to co-ordinate all details of the
relief effort.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Bush begins 'new crusade' as Clinton's poll lead is cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN and MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HOUSTON, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush left Houston yesterday emboldened by a fighting and
partisan acceptance speech to the Republican convention and encouraged by
polls that show him narrowing the gap with Mr Bill Clinton, his Democratic
rival.
As the president travelled to Mississippi and Missouri to press home what he
called 'a new crusade' for American values and renewal at home and overseas,
an opinion poll released last night showed the two candidates running almost
neck-and-neck.
A CBS News-New York Times survey taken on Thursday night as Mr Bush made his
speech showed Mr Clinton would win 48 per cent of the vote, against 46 per
cent for the president.
Three polls taken ahead of Mr Bush's address showed Mr Clinton's lead cut to
the 9 to 12 percentage point range.
With his big advantage in the polls apparently diminishing, the Democratic
candidate began another bus tour through Ohio, Michigan and New York to
emphasise his message that what the country needs is 'jobs, jobs, jobs', as
Senator Al Gore, his running mate, put it.
The war of words between the two campaigns threatened to grow even beyond
the savage rhetoric and derision Mr Bush had directed at Mr Clinton and the
Democrats in Congress.
Mr Ron Brown, the Democratic party chairman, conceded that Mr Bush's speech
had been 'well rehearsed and well written', but said it was also 'cynical,
petty and totally dishonest'. The president 'makes no connection between a
campaign speech and the task of governing', he said.
Apart from a qualified commitment to cut taxes next year if matching
spending cuts are found, and half an apology for accepting higher taxes in
1990, Mr Bush offered no new economic policy initiatives.
Mr Clinton rejected Mr Bush's plan for across-the-board tax cuts as 'fool's
gold' in the face of a Dollars 400bn (Pounds 210bn) budget deficit. 'It is
read my lips time again,' he said, 'but this time you can read the record.'
The one new idea - that taxpayers should be allowed to earmark up to 10 per
cent of their taxes for debt reduction - was widely dismissed by economists
as a gimmick. 'It would have absolutely no impact on anything,' said Mr
David Wyss, chief economist at DRI/McGraw Hill, the economic consultancy.
Since Congress controlled the level of spending, the earmarking of taxes for
particular purposes would not affect the level of either spending or the
budget deficit, he said.
Mr William Brown, chief economist at J P Morgan, the New York bank, said
neither Mr Bush nor Mr Clinton had made concrete proposals for tackling
immediate economic problems.
Mr Bush's main purpose on Thursday was to attack his opponent as a man
'whose passion for big government knows no bounds', who 'enjoys tax
increases' and who dares to say the US 'is a nation in decline'.
The address certainly served to energise convention delegates whose doubts
that Mr Bush could win re-election had been freely expressed all week.
Initial reaction from the wider audience also began to suggest the president
was getting the 'bounce' in the polls normally derived from a convention and
which so benefited Mr Clinton last month.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Ratners to shut stores and cut overheads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RATNERS Group, the UK jewellery retailer which pioneered 9 carat gold
earrings for 99p a pair, has decided to reverse its marketing strategy in an
attempt to return to profitability.
Mr Gerald Ratner, chief executive, who once boasted that his earrings cost
less than a prawn sandwich from Marks and Spencer, yesterday said: 'We
cannot carry on being a sales-led organisation.' The emphasis would now be
on profits.
The group will close 180 of its 880 shops in the UK and 150 of its 1,000
shops in the US over the next three years. Staff costs and other overheads
will also be cut.
Ratners blamed the effect of the recession on consumer spending for a
pre-tax loss of Pounds 122.3m in its last financial year, to February 1,
compared with a profit of Pounds 112.1m in the previous year.
The losses included Pounds 98m of exceptional costs relating largely to
rationalisation of the business.
Ratners also announced an agreement with its bankers to continue existing
loans until the end of June next year.
Mr James McAdam, who joined the group as executive chairman in January, said
the performance of the 250 shops in the Ratners chain had been particularly
poor after a remark by Mr Ratner in April last year incurred 'adverse
publicity'. Mr Ratner told a conference at the Institute of Directors that
one of the group's products was 'total crap'.
Although Mr Ratner had expressed similar opinions previously in more
discreet surroundings, his speech was widely reported and alienated
customers. Sales in the Ratners chain fell 24 per cent in 1991 on a
comparable store basis.
Mr McAdam said there had been an over-dependence on low prices and
promotional activity. The group's acquisition-led growth had also resulted
in 'self-destructive competition' between the company's shops.
The Ratners stores will bear the brunt of the UK closures, with 112 shops to
be shut. The other UK jewellery chains, H Samuel and Ernest Jones, will
focus on middle and upper sections of the market.
Mr McAdam said sales had fallen again in the first half of the current year,
but added that the group was 'not banking on any sales recovery' in its
attempts to turn the losses around. Mr Ratner said: 'We are succeeding on
the margin front and the overhead front. The sales downturn is being
mitigated by those factors.'

FT  21 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets: European paper shares reflect the
damage - A sector which is suffering from the recession and overcapacity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European paper and pulp companies are suffering badly from the global
economic recession and overcapacity in the industry. The damage is likely to
worsen and it could take two years for profitability to improve.
The structural problem is that paper manufacturing is capital-intensive with
high fixed costs. When demand strengthens, prices move up quickly because of
the difficulties of bringing on new capacity. But when demand is weak,
capacity reduction is almost impossible and prices fall equally quickly.
Paper and pulp shares have been highly volatile as investors, uncertain
about the economic cycle, attempt to call the end of recession. Sentiment
has fluctuated. For example, shares in MoDo, the Swedish group, increased
from a level of SKr185 at the beginning of the year to SKr273 by June. Since
then they have fallen back to SKr190.
Mr Denis Christie, European paper and packaging analyst at James Capel,
warns: 'There is a lot of hope-value in some paper shares and it is not
necessarily justified.'
Some sectors are suffering more than others. The pulp industry is in
difficulties with most plants operating at below 90 per cent capacity.
Although a strike in British Colombia cut about 20 per cent of northern
bleached softwood kraft capacity recently, the long-term outlook is poor,
according to Mr Christie.
Pulp capacity growth is likely to exceed demand growth by almost two times
and pulp prices this year will remain below those of last year, warns Mr
Christie.
Furthermore, in the long term, low-cost South American manufacturers are
bringing on new capacity which will prevent Nordic producers repeating the
profits peak of 1989.
Nordic groups are also likely to suffer in the newsprint sector. Demand for
newsprint has fallen, as newspapers have cut pagination following the fall
in advertising revenue.
At the same time, two newsprint plants in Germany and one in Switzerland
with a combined capacity of 650,000 tonnes are due to come on stream by
1994. These will be sited near cities and will use recycled paper, offering
a significant cost advantage over those using virgin fibre, such as the
Scandinavians.
Those sectors less affected by recession and overcapacity include coated
papers and packaging. Mr Christie believes that when demand picks up prices
are also likely to improve quite quickly.
'In these conditions it is difficult to pick any stocks,' adds Mr Christie.
'There is a lot of pain still to endure.'
He argues, however, that those willing to wait for capital gains could find
it profitable to invest near the bottom of the cycle. Some Continental
stocks are tightly held, and when sentiment improves it can be difficult to
buy them. He recommends avoiding those integrated with significant pulp
capacity.
KNP, the Dutch group, is short on pulp and therefore able to benefit from
low prices. In addition, the group is strong in lightweight coated paper,
which is likely to be one of the first areas to recover. It also has a joint
venture with Buhrmann-Tetterode in corrugated board, which is in short
supply.
Mr Christie describes it as the highest quality paper company in Europe. He
points out that it will have little problem covering its dividend and has a
6 per cent yield, making it a reasonable investment while waiting for the
paper sector to improve.
In the short term, profits of all paper groups are likely to be under
pressure. The question for investors will be the speed and timing of
recovery.

FT  21 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Hafnia fall-out spreads across
Continent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE fall-out from the Hafnia debacle in Denmark spread from the troubled
Nordic bourses to other continental equity markets yesterday, writes Our
Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT lost its early gains after Deutsche Bank Research downgraded its
forecasts for Commerzbank in view of the latter's loan exposure to Hafnia,
the Danish insurance group which suspended payments on Wednesday.
DBR dropped its 1992 Commerzbank EPS by DM3 to DM22, and 1993's by DM2 to
DM25. Commerzbank shares dropped DM15.80 to DM220.50. Other analysts said
that it was unlikely that Commerzbank would lose all of the DM300m implied
by these calculations but remembered that its recent performance includes
exposure to the embattled Canadian property developer, O &amp; Y.
The DAX index came back from an intraday high of 1,536.05 to 1,513.06, down
1.66 on the day. Dealers were looking for a good day with M3 in line with
expectations and bond futures looking good, but they said that the bears
seized on the bad news to extend their short positions.
Sectors which suffered most yesterday were construction, regarded as still
highly priced, and engineering and steels which stayed weak on their
association with Mannesmann which dropped another DM7.20 to DM227, bring its
fall this week to DM45.50.
PARIS sank further into its depression as a broker downgrade in the oil
sector and worries about the forthcoming referendum on Maastricht took the
CAC-40 index down by 10.03 to 1,724.18. Turnover was larger than usual at
FFr1.8bn.
Dealers said the excessive falls in share prices following negative comments
from brokers this week showed how nervous the market was.
Total dropped FFr12.70 or 5.6 per cent to FFr212.50 in relatively heavy
volume of 1.1m shares after Merrill Lynch downgraded it buy from neutral
ahead of first-half results due in late September. A spokesman for the oil
company said that the bourse had overreacted to the broker's analysis. In
the same sector, Elf dropped FFr10.10 to FFr312.80 ahead of its interims,
due on Monday.
Elsewhere, UAP fell FFr11.90 or 3.1 per cent to FFr374 on worries about the
consequences of its 6 per cent stake in Hafnia.
Among smaller stocks, Valeo slipped FFr34 to FFr715 as Paribas adopted a
more cautious stance on the automotive sector.
MILAN was temporarily shaken out of its August torpor by a newspaper report
which revived an old rumour that a group of investors, led by Mediobanca,
was interested in buying Iri's 57 per cent stake in Banca Commerciale
Italiana (BCI). The Comit index rose 3.72 to 404.90 in turnover estimated at
L50-55bn.
Brokers found the price-tag of between L3.5 and L4 trillion - around L6,000
a share - mooted in the report as too high, considering BCI's fundamentals.
They also pointed out that if Iri sold its 57 per cent stake in the bank to
another party, this would trigger the new Opa law designed to protect the
interests of minority shareholders.
BCI shares gained 6.8 per cent or L159 to L2,499 volume of just over 4m
shares. Mediobanca was also strong, rising L276 to L11,475.
The state telephone company Sip was the most heavily traded stock on the
screen, falling L28 to L1,101 in volume of 4.6m shares. Dealers said renewed
rumours of a rights issue weighed on the stock.
ZURICH turned lower after a sudden drop in the dollar, some banks falling as
the SMI index fell 22.2, or 1.3 per cent to 1,753.5. SBC fell SFr5 to SFr231
and Swiss Volksbank by SFr30 to SFr760.
STOCKHOLM saw a rise in Sweden's key marginal lending rate, aimed at
stemming the outflow of capital from the country, and the Affarsvarlden
General index fell 6.3 to 791.1. Ericsson B eased SKr1 to SKr113 in spite of
a better-than-expected first-half profit of SKr59m.
Newspaper reports estimated the size of S-E-Banken loans to Hafnia at
between SKr450m and SKr1.4bn and the bank's stock fell to a new 12-month low
of SKr17.50, down SKr1.
OSLO dropped another 3.5 per cent, the all-share index closing 11.66 lower
at 327.97 with Den norske Bank A down DKr1.2 to a new low of DKr2.0 and Uni
Storebrand by DKr0.4 to DKr15.5.
HELSINKI's bank and finance index fell 5.8 per cent as Moody's put two
Finnish banks, KOP and Okobank, under review for a possible ratings
downgrade. The Hex index closed 14.4, or 2.4 per cent lower at 634.3.
Pohjola, the insurer, saw its B free shares fall FM5.1, or 17.5 per cent to
FM24 following Wednesday's Hafnia announcement. The insurer has a 10 per
cent stake in the Swedish insurer Skandia, of which Hafnia holds some 15 per
cent.
AMSTERDAM ended lower in quiet trading, as the CBS Tendency index fell 0.6
to 111.3.
VIENNA ended firmer, boosted by the expiry of August options contracts. The
18-share ATX index gained 13.52 to 745.7 and the bourse index rose 2.24 to
356.29.

FT  21 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei recovers 4.2% on
short-covering move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE prices rose sharply on short-covering as speculators detected a shift
in market sentiment. The Nikkei average advanced 4.2 per cent, regaining the
15,000 level for the first time in eight trading days, writes Emiko Terazono
in Tokyo.
The Nikkei ended 617.02 ahead at 15,267.76, after opening at the day's low
of 14,677.64 and registering a high in the afternoon of 15,546.47.
Volume rose to 300m shares from 226m, reaching 300m for the first time since
July 10. Advances led declines by 950 to 66, with 80 issues unchanged, while
the Topix index of all first section stocks strengthened 46.65 to 1,163.77.
In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index gained just 0.87 to 967.17.
Analysts were cautiously optimistic. 'There seems to have been a shift in
market psychology,' said Mr Alan Livsey at Kleinwort Benson. Investors were
also encouraged by comments from Mr Yasushi Mieno, the Bank of Japan
governor, indicating full support for the Finance Ministry's emergency
package for the banking system.
However, individual investors remained on the sidelines, and only limited
buying from institutions was noted. Leading gainers were companies faced
with mounting debt and declining cash flow. Nippon Housing Loan continued to
head the actives list and rose by its daily limit of Y50 to Y241. Daikyo,
the troubled condominium developer, jumped Y90 to Y640. 'It does not say too
much for the market when we see garbage floating to the top,' said one
analyst.
However, blue chips were also strong, led by Sony, which surged Y340 to
Y3,880, and Pioneer Electronic, up Y170 at Y2,830. Pessimism ahead of the
two companies' quarterly earnings, announced late on Wednesday, had prompted
selling. In the event, the figures reported by the companies were better
than expected and scotched earlier rumours of downward revisions for the
whole year.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone firmed Y15,000 to Y493,000 on short-covering.
Green Cross, the pharmaceutical group, appreciated Y100 to Y880 on hopes for
its new Aids drug.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 696.20 to 16,424.36 in volume of 19.7m
shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, put on Y300 to Y9,950.
Roundup
TOKYO'S rebound failed to encourage the Pacific Rim.
AUSTRALIA lost ground and brokers said there was an ADollars 35m sell
portfolio overhanging the market. The All Ordinaries index declined 8.0 to
1,553.6 in turnover of ADollars 263.2m.
Trading was also dominated by BHP's offer to buy a 32 per cent stake in
Foster's Brewing at the equivalent of ADollars 2.39 a share. Foster's
climbed 7 cents to ADollars 1.80 in volume of ADollars 10.3m shares, but BHP
receded 16 cents to ADollars 13 with 3.4m shares traded.
ANZ slipped 9 cents to ADollars 3.12 on fears about asset writedowns and the
effects of the Bombay broking scandal.
HONG KONG fell on heavy selling by overseas institutions but closed off the
day's lows on late bargain-hunting. The Hang Seng index closed 138.83, or
2.47 per cent, down at 5,481.61, but above the day's worst level of
5,377.14. Turnover rose to HKDollars 3.86bn from HKDollars 2.02bn.
One of the most active stocks was Hutchison Whampoa which fell 20 cents to
HKDollars 15.10.
SEOUL fell on rumours that ruling party members had objected to parts of a
proposed government bail-out for the stock market. The composite index lost
11.39 to 467.70.
There was also a negative reaction to the government's decision to award the
nation's second mobile telephone licence to the Sunkyong Group, a company
with close ties to President Roh Tae-woo.
MANILA's decline reflected profit-taking after last week's rally on an
infusion of new money from foreign funds. The composite index fell 26.77 to
1,490.57.
TAIWAN ended mixed after bargain hunting, with the weighted index 0.87
easier at a 19-month low of 3,733.06. Turnover rose to TDollars 22.4bn from
TDollars 17.84bn. The construction sector fell a further 2.1 per cent.
SINGAPORE saw the Straits Times Industrial index close 11.48 higher at
1,323.59 after a volatile session. Volume came to 53.39m shares, after
69.56m.
KUALA LUMPUR rallied further after its recent sell-off, but closed off the
day's highs on profit-taking and renewed selling. The KLSE composite index
added 4.20 at 564.21.
NEW ZEALAND drifted off in the afternoon, led by further weakness in
Fletcher Challenge (FCL). The NZSE-40 index shed 7.11 to 1,491.06. FCL fell
another 8 cents to NZDollars 2.50 after reporting a maiden loss and a
NZDollars 3.5bn asset sale programme on Wednesday.

FT  21 AUG 92 / Money Markets: Futures rally
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORT-DATED sterling fut-ures rallied yesterday morning after the Bundesbank
refrained from changing the emergency Lombard rate at its council meeting,
and the figure for Germany's July M3 money supply came in at 8.6 per cent.
But, as has happened several times this week, the mood of futures dealers
did an about-turn in the afternoon. Futures contracts dipped to their
opening levels as the dollar fell at the start of foreign exchange trading
in the US and sterling declined with it.
The September short sterling contract jumped 6 basis points from its opening
level of 89.66 after the Bundesbank signalled no change in rates at its
fortnightly meeting.
One commercial bank dealer also interpreted the M3 money supply figure as
positive. He noted that the figure was 0.1 per cent lower than the previous
month's monetary growth. This was particularly good, he said, since the
effects of the recent 0.75 of a percentage point rise in the discount rate
have not yet worked through the German banking system.
In the afternoon, futures prices fell as the pound sank to DM2.8075, its
lowest point since Britain joined the ERM. The September contract finished
one basis point down at 89.64, and the December contract was off 4 basis
points at 89.64. Some dealers felt that these were probably the bottom
levels for the front-month contracts unless a rise in UK base rates looks
imminent.
Trade in the sterling cash market was thin. As often happens on a Thursday,
dealers took most of the day to take out the shortage forecast by the Bank
of England. This is because traders like to offer large numbers of bills to
the Bank of England on a Friday when they can push the overnight rate down
as far as possible for the weekend.
In the morning, the Bank forecast a shortage of Pounds 1.05bn. In early
operations, the Bank bought Pounds 31m of Band 1 Treasury bills and Pounds
20m of Band 1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent. The forecast was later revised
to Pounds 1bn and the bank purchased Pounds 36m in Band 1 bank bills, and
Pounds 91m in a repurchase agreement at 9 15/16 per cent. The Bank then
bought Pounds 14m in Band 1 Treasury bills, Pounds 694m in Band 1 Bank
bills, Pounds 2m in Band 2 Treasury bills and Pounds 1m in Band 2 bank
bills. There was late assistance of Pounds 120m.

FT  21 AUG 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Pressure on dollar and sterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEALERS IN the City of London said the dollar and sterling were on the verge
of a crisis yesterday, as the D-Mark pushed both currencies towards
important new lows, writes James Blitz.
The dollar almost touched its all-time low of DM1.4430 in late US trading,
as dealers wondered when the Federal Reserve might intervene to support the
currency. The Fed may have waited to see what effect President Bush's speech
at the Republican convention would have on the currency markets. But there
is not much room for the Fed to manoeuvre in: the dollar risks going into a
free-fall if it breaches the historic low.
Dollar/D-Mark trading was not affected by economic indicators yesterday. The
slight dip in July's M3 monetary growth in Germany, from an annualised 8.7
per cent to 8.6 per cent, was interpreted as positive by some analysts,
since it does not yet reflect the recent 0.75 of a percentage point rise in
the Bundesbank's discount rate. But the figure is clearly outside the Bank's
target range of 3.5 to 5.5 per cent of annual M3 growth, keeping a firm
bottom to the Lombard rate.
Instead, the US currency fell victim to a creeping sentiment in favour of
the D-Mark that was felt across the major crosses. The dollar ended at
DM1.4485 in Europe and sterling at DM2.8075, the latter's lowest finish
since Britain joined the ERM in October 1990. Both were about 1/2 pfennig
below Wednesday's close. The lira weakened to L761.0 per D-Mark from L759.6.
In New York the dollar finished at DM1.4475.
If central banks were refraining from intervention yesterday, it was because
they have to wait for the dollar to fall to a point at which the operation
will work. Trading in both the dollar and sterling remained thin yesterday
and the markets are still not short of either currency - both key
requirements if the market is to turn.
However, Mr Avinash Persaud, a currency economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in
London, said sterling 'could be in the throes of a crisis that is more
fundamental than the dollar's'. In his view, the pound's problem is that it
is being buffeted by external factors, namely the weakness of the dollar and
of the UK economy. He believes it is increasingly difficult for the UK
government to support the currency at these levels.
The pound's intrinsic weakness was underlined when it crossed 75 percentage
points of divergence against its central Ecu rate. When the ERM was formed
in 1979, there was a presumption that when a currency crossed this point its
central bank should support it either through intervention or raising
interest rates. The rule has not been adhered to since 1985, but dealers see
it as a turning point for a currency.

FT  21 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Polish copper strike suspended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLISH COPPER workers yesterday agreed to suspend a month-long strike at the
KGHM Polska Miedz combine without obtaining the pay increases they had
demanded, reports Reuter from Warsaw.
Mr Jerzy Pietraszek, a company official, estimated that the strike had
caused the loss of 25,000 tonnes of electrolytic copper from the planned
yearly production of 320,000 tonnes and cost the company Dollars 70m.
KGMH is Poland's only copper producer and exports about 70 per cent of its
output.
The strikers were offered one-off payments equivalent to between Dollars 100
to Dollars 130 a head. They had demanded wage rises of up to 30 per cent but
Mr Pietraszek said any award would be much lower.
The strike, which started on July 20, prompted six trade unions to call for
nation-wide action in support of the KGHM workers. They also demanded an end
to Poland's economic reforms. Seven collieries were hit by strike action and
railway workers caused the cancellation of about a quarter of all passenger
train services in Silesia, southern Poland.
Prime minister Hanna Suchocka said yesterday that the government was not
prepared to meet the unions' demands, adding: 'The government is going to be
firm. It cannot run around the country at every request of the unions'.
China's copper demand in 1992 will rise to a record 810,000 tonnes from
650,000 tonnes last year because of a boom in the construction sector,
Nissho Iwai Corporation, a big Japanese trade house estimates.
The country's copper output is likely to be 590,000 tonnes in 1992, up from
570,000 in 1991, Nissho Iwai believes.
'To cover the supply shortage, China will have to buy nearly 210,000 tonnes
of copper throughout this year in the spot market and through bilateral
deals,' a Nissho Iwai official said yesterday. It had contracted to buy
170,000 tonnes of copper as of the end of August, he added.

COFFEE prices continued the uptrend of the past few days but dealers said
trading remained thin. The November futures position finally broke through
resistance at Dollars 750 a tonne to closed at Dollars 757 a tonne, up
Dollars 17 on the day and Dollars 34 on the week so far. Dealers were
cautious about the prospects for the rise being sustained, however,
suggesting that further gains would bring out the sellers. COCOA prices
reversed the recent rise, ending at the bottom of the day's range in London.
December futures closed at Pounds 636 a tonne, down Pounds 18. Dealers said
the recent buoyant mood seemed to be evaporating in London, and the New York
market provided little support. 'It's a bit disappointing,' said one trader.
'We had a gap to fill between Dollars 642 and Dollars 648 in near December
and now we've closed below that, which could mean more losses in the near
term.' At the London Metal Exchange NICKEL prices staged a late surge.
Dealers were not getting too excited, however, arguing that the market was
unlikely to build on the day's Dollars 54 rise to Dollars 7,340.50 a tonne
for three months metal unless today's LME report showed a reversal of the
recent strong uptrend in nickel stocks.

FT  21 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Broker lifts world sugar output
estimate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CZARNIKOW, THE London sugar broker, has raised sharply its forecast for
world production in the current season.
World output is now put at 115.93m tonnes, 2.81m tonnes above the estimate
published in May, and well ahead of projected consumption at 111.79m tonnes.
However, consumption is the former Soviet Union is reckoned to be down 1.95m
tonnes from last season's level.
The initial estimates for 1992-93 show the sugar market much more closely
balanced, with production at 115.59m tonnes and consumption at 114.55m
tonnes.
This season Czarnikow estimates that just over 3.5m tonnes will have been
added to world stocks, bringing the total addition over the last two seasons
to nearly 6m tonnes. However, in 1992-93 it expects stocks to rise by just
440,000 tonnes.
More than 2m tonnes of the 1991-92 production increase is accounted for by
just two countries - India and China. 'It remains a significant element in
the world supply outlook that an important volume of this extra sugar has
remained with the producers in these countries, even though some exports
have been concluded.'
Indian production is estimated at 14.57m tonnes, raw value, for 1991-92.
This will lift the country's stocks to 4.75m tonnes by the end of next
month. Chinese output is put at 8.6m tonnes - above domestic consumption at
8.25m tonnes.
Czarnikow says the 1992-93 season 'is already emerging as one of sharp
contrasts'. It expects output gains in the subsidised markets of the US,
Mexico and the European Community, plus improvements in Thailand and
Australia, to offset losses through drought in South Africa and a probable
downward reaction in both China and India.

FT  21 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazil's iron ore giant spreads
its wings - Companhia Vale do Rio Doce's diversification programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL HINCHBERGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE world of iron ore Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, the state-controlled
Brazilian mining giant, stands head and shoulders above the rest. It
produced over half of Brazil's domestic output of 150m tonnes last year and
handles about a quarter of international demand for the commodity.
Its Carajas deposit, in the Amazon state of Para, alone yields 35m tonnes of
ore a year. If the market could absorb it, the annual figure could probably
be pushed up to 50m tonnes without much trouble. The company's iron ore
deposits are so rich that one company official's boast that, 'we've got
enough for 400 years', is probably not too much of an exaggeration.
But over the last two decades, behind its huge iron facade, the company has
been implementing a strategy of diversification - first into other minerals,
now farther afield into transport and the pulp and paper industry. It is
also steering toward vertical integration into metal production, both at
home and, tentatively, abroad.
Planning such strategic decisions will be eased by a recently signed
administrative contract with its majority shareholder, the state, which
allows CVRD to operate more like a private company.
Celebrating the 50th anniversary of its founding this year, the company is
beginning a third stage of company development, according to Mr Juarez
Fontana dos Santos, director of development for Paulo Abib Engenharia, a
mining consulting firm. Until 1970, it concentrated almost exclusively on
iron ore extraction. Then, with the founding of a prospecting subsidiary,
Docegeo, the company expanded into other minerals. Now it is primed to move
into complementary activities and direct overseas investment.
Expansion seems almost inevitable. The 16-company group has sales of Dollars
4.5bn a year. 'I would say that, today, the biggest problem is where to
invest all that money,' says Mr Fontana.
Since the late 1970s, manganese, bauxite, limestone, and - notably in recent
years - gold have become important products for CVRD. Last year, it produced
28 per cent of the country's 1.97m-tonne manganese output, and it owns 46
per cent of Mineracao Rio do Norte, the country's largest producer of
bauxite (aluminium ore). Executives are predicting that gold output this
year will approach 12 tonnes, putting it among the leading Brazilian
producers.
Encouraged on by privatisation of the state-dominated steel sector,
horizontal expansion is now paralleled by vertical integration. In a
sell-off last October, CVRD bought a 15 per cent stake in Usiminas, a flat
rolled steel producer, which has the country's second largest mill; in July
it took 15 per cent of Companhia Siderurgica Tubarao, one of the world's
leading producers of slab steel.
While privatisation purists might question the purchase of public companies
by their state-controlled sisters, CVRD had clear strategic goals -
guaranteeing a market for its iron ore and manganese, as well as a slice of
profits from the value added by milling.
In March the company bought 35 per cent of Seas, a manganese alloy producer
in Dunkirk, France. The deal included a contract to supply nearly 200,000
tonnes of manganese a year, about two-thirds of Seas consumption.
An earlier step in a vertical direction, the Alunorte project, which tripped
up seven years ago, may get back into its stride this year. It involved
CVRD's Aluvale subsidiary, the majority partner, and a consortium of 31
Japanese companies called NAAC. The 1.1m-tonne capacity alumina (aluminium
oxide) plant was primarily to supply Albras, an aluminium ingot producer and
another CVRD-NAAC joint venture. Construction was halted when the Japanese
partners balked at further investment. Resumption plans have been approved
by NAAC and now await a final decision from CVRD, which may first try to
entice an additional partner into the fold, thus ceding majority control.
The search for an extra partner characterises another strategic shift by the
company. Once jealous of control, it now favours minority stakes in joint
ventures, reflecting an international trend in mining towards sharing risks.
By the end of the year, it is expected to conclude negotiations on a joint
venture to exploit the 1.2m-tonne copper deposit at Salobo, in the Carajas
region. The partnership is likely to include one foreign company and a
private Brazilian mining company. CVRD's new-found minority-share philosophy
is so prevalent that the company has refused to even undertake the basic
engineering project for Salobo by itself, even though this customarily
accounts for what would be an affordable 1 per cent of total investment.
Given the security of massive existing mineral reserves, especially of iron
ore, CVRD has been free to branch out into other areas, like transport. An
early step was the 'marriage' of shipments abroad, administering the
rational combination of its dense iron ore with bulky soyabeans, for
example. Now it wants to attract agricultural exporters in the
central-western region to use the company railway leading to its port
terminal in Vitoria, north of Rio de Janeiro. Soon CVRD will inaugurate its
first foreign port terminal, in Los Angeles, California. Last year,
transport accounted for 13 per cent of gross sales, Dollars 606.6m.
Pulp and paper production is another non-mining priority, with two major
joint ventures on the drawing board. In 1991, such activities accounted for
4 per cent of gross sales, Dollars 178.8m.
In the mining sector, gold is getting most of the attention ' as well as 80
per cent of the Dollars 20.7m exploration budget of Docegeo, CVRD's
prospecting subsidiary. The effort appears to be paying off, as last year's
gold output of 7.1m tonnes is expected to grow to nearly 12m this year, but
Mr Fontana warns that those figures could fall drastically in coming years
if new deposits are not turned up. According to the consultant, gold is one
mineral of which CVRD does not boast ample long term deposits.

<TEXT>
FINAL APPROVAL for the world's biggest aluminium smelter, a Dollars 2bn,
466,000-tonnes-a-year plant proposed for Richards Bay, South Africa, has
been delayed for three months.
Shareholders in Alusaf, South Africa's only primary aluminium producer,
which hopes to build the smelter in Natal, are taking longer than expected
to make up their minds whether to commit themselves to the huge investment.
Also Alusaf has still to win environmental approval for the smelter, which
faces strong opposition from some Richards Bay residents.
Mr Theodor Tschopp, chairman of Alusuisse, one of Alusaf's shareholders,
said that pressure to get the project started had 'cooled down' and that
'the whole issue is still open'.
Some analysts suggest that Alusaf might opt instead to expand its existing
smelter from 170,000 tonnes to about 220,000 tonnes.
However, Mr Rob Barbour, Alusaf's managing director, said yesterday he
remained 'quietly confident' that the project would be given the go-ahead at
the end of this year. Then it would take three years to bring the smelter,
to be built using technology supplied by Pechiney of France, into
production.
Mr Barbour said he had been too optimistic when he thought that Alusaf's
shareholders - which also include Gencor (General Union Mining Corporation)
and the Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa - would have made
their decisions by this month, particularly in the light of present
political turmoil in South Africa and the aluminium market's severe
problems.
He said that Alusaf did not wish to finance the smelter with a high
proportion of debt, 50 per cent was the absolute maximum, so shareholders
would have to put up perhaps Dollars 1bn of new equity.
Analysts suggest that Alusuisse, which has reduced already its 22 per cent
shareholding in Alusaf to 15 per cent, will not want to put any more money
into Alusaf. However, Mr Tschopp said no decision had yet been made and he
pointed out that the project might 'give us access to the cheapest
aluminium'.
Mr Barbour said Alusaf was not banking on Alusuisse putting in more money
and funding could go ahead without the European group.
The project sprang from Alusaf's ability to win a favourable 25-year
electricity supply contract from Eskom, the South African utility, under
which the tariff will be linked to the world aluminium price. This is not
new in the industry but what probably is unique is that the contract sets no
floor or ceiling prices. Eskom may also take a 25 per cent shareholding in
the venture.
Mr Fred Roux, managing director of Gencor's minerals division, said the
smelter delay was partly because Eskom had still to decide whether to take
up its equity option. 'It would make funding easier it Eskom comes in,' he
pointed out. Gencor and IDC both had access to funds for the project,
however, and 'I am confident we will have the go-ahead by November 1. That's
three months later than expected, said Mr Roux.
The environmental issue had also caused some delay. Alusaf's Mr Barbour said
it was true that 'strong concern' had been expressed that the lowest-cost
site near the harbour was too close to a residential area. However, Alusaf
was looking at a back-up (but higher-cost) site which would satisfy all
objections. A draft environmental impact study would be ready in mid-October
for final comment by the public, he said.
Comalco of Australia is to decide before the end of this year whether to
expand annual capacity at its Boyne Island aluminium smelter in Queensland
from 230,000 to 460,000 tonnes at an estimated cost of ADollars 880m. If it
decides to go ahead, a consortium in which Comalco will have between 20 and
25 per cent will buy the nearby Gladstone power station from the Queensland
state government for ADollars 750m. Analysts suggest that, if these
arrangements are completed, expansion of Comalco's 79 per cent-owned Tiwai
Point aluminium smelter in New Zealand will be less likely and questions
will be raised about the future of the Bell Bay smelter in Tasmania.
Cracking anodes have delayed start-up of the Deschambault aluminium smelter
in Quebec owned by Amax, the US natural resources group, for about 60 days.
Amax insists, however. that all pots at the 215,000 tonnes-a-year smelter
will have been started by the end of September and that output will still be
about 100,000 tonnes this year.

<TEXT>
INDIA HAS signed a memorandum of understanding with Malaysia covering the
purchase of 300,000 tonnes of palm oil over the next two years. Last year it
imported 160,000 tonnes, down from 1m tonnes five years ago.
Malaysia fears a further fall this year with Indonesia emerging as a
potential palm oil exporter and India trying to narrow the gap between
production and consumption of edible oils.
Good monsoon rains over the past fortnight brightened groundnut crop
prospects in the western state of Gujarat, where output is estimated at 1.7m
tonnes, more than treble last year's 500,000 tonnes.
Dr Lim Keng Yaik, Malaysian minister of primary industries, who has been in
India to promote palm oil exports, said India should barter its expensive
edible oils for cheaper palm oil to boost exports and meet the edible oil
needs of its poorer consumers.
Malaysia's interest in India, despite falling exports, stems from the
vastness of its market and the low level of edible oil consumption - 7 kg
per head a year, half that in Malaysia.

hormones in US
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US General Accounting Office has recommended that the government order
an end to the sale of food products from animals treated with recombinant
bovine growth hormones (rBGH) until it can be determined that they pose no
risk to human health.
The GAO - the investigative arm of congress - said the risk to people was
not directly from the hormones but stemmed from the growing number of cases
of mastitis in cows treated with them.
'Increased incidence of mastitis in cows treated with rBGH could possibly
lead to the increased use of antibiotics which, in turn, might raise the
level of antibiotics found in milk and beef,' the GAO said. 'We cannot
conclude at present that the nation's milk supply has not already been
contaminated by antibiotics beyond acceptable levels. Yet there has been no
effort by either the drug sponsors or the Food and Drug Administration to
determine whether there may be higher antibiotic levels in milk associated
with rBGH treatment and whether they would be acceptable.'
Dairy farmer groups have long urged the FDA to stop the marketing of rBGH
milk products. Mr Curt Rohland, president of the National Family Farm
Coalition, said the report confirmed what many farmers have found: that
treating cows with a synthetic hormone put the animals under more stress,
made them more vulnerable to infection and increased the use of antibiotics.

THE Group of Thirty has appointed Sir Dennis Weatherstone, chairman of JP

financial products. Mr Weatherstone is a founding member of the group, a
Washington-based think-tank chaired by Mr Paul Volcker.
'The economic benefits of cost reduction and risk transfer that derivatives
generate need to be weighed against their actual and potential costs,'
according to the Group of Thirty.
The study group has three aims: to contribute to a broader understanding of
the nature of derivatives; to develop a guide to principles of management
practice for market participants; and to provide input to discussions among
supervisors and regulators.
A number of regulatory and supervisory authorities, including the Basle
Committee, are currently reviewing the level of risk created by derivatives
business. Mr Gerald Corrigan, president of the New York Federal Reserve, and
Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, general manager of the Bank for International
Settlements, are among senior figures to have expressed concern over the

FT  21 AUG 92 / Government Bonds: German bonds recover from early setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN government bond prices fell following the release of disappointing
German money supply figures for July, but the market later picked up as the
Bundesbank Council decided to leave interest rates unchanged at its meeting.
The eagerly-awaited figures showed that M3 money supply grew by 8.6 per cent
in July, down from 8.7 per cent in June. The bund market had hoped for a
more marked slowdown in money supply growth.
Dealers reported good demand for long-dated bunds later in the day, with
some outright buying and lengthening trades leading to a further inversion
of the yield curve. The Liffe bund futures contract broke through the 87.88
support level to close at around 87.92.
The bund market ended up about a quarter of a point, with the French-German
10-year bond spread widening from 104 basis points to 109 basis points.
French government bonds ended flat or slightly lower as Wednesday's opinion
poll results on the Maastricht Treaty cast some gloom over the market.
Recent polls have shown a deterioration in the 'yes' vote while a
substantial proportion of voters remain undecided.
The French Treasury held its monthly auction yesterday, selling FFr5.05bn of
two-year notes and FFr6.6bn of five-year notes.
CANADIAN government bonds rallied strongly after progress on constitutional
reform prompted a wave of buying interest.
By the end of European trading, Canadian bonds were  1/2 point up on
Wednesday's close in Canada, having come off earlier highs in volatile
trading. A stronger Canadian dollar encouraged foreign investors, who led
the rally, according to dealers.
The agreement in principle between the provinces, including Quebec, and the
government on the formation of a representative Canadian senate sparked
hopes that constitutional reform is at last under way.
The 8 1/2 per cent Government of Canada bonds due 2002 were quoted at
109.15, to yield 7.16 per cent, at the end of European trading, up from
108.64 at the previous close. The spread between Canadian bonds and US
Treasuries tightened by 11 basis points to 69 basis points.
US TREASURY prices were little changed at both ends of the market yesterday
as dealers and investors traded cautiously before President Bush's
acceptance speech at the Republican convention.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/32 at 99
7/32 , yielding 7.309 per cent. The two-year note was unchanged at 100 7/16
, to carry a yield of 3.996 per cent.
For the past week the market has been unsettled by rumours that the
President would unveil tax cuts in his acceptance speech. Bond investors
fear tax cuts because, if they are not accompanied by big spending cuts,
they widen the budget deficit, and possibly revive inflationary pressures.
JAPANESE government bonds closed lower as a rebound in the Tokyo stock
market prompted a wave of profit-taking.
The yield on the benchmark No 129 opened at 4.705 per cent and reached 4.66
per cent on hopes of a cut in interest rates. However, investors took
profits and the No 129 closed with a yield of 4.73 per cent in Tokyo, moving
to 4.74 per cent in London trading.
The Nikkei stock index ended 617.02 points higher at 15,267.76, closing
above the psychologically important 15,000 level for the first time in eight
sessions.
The bond market has rallied strongly in recent weeks as the drop in stock
prices raised hopes of a further easing in monetary policy. UK government
bonds ended an active trading session only slightly firmer as sterling
weakness limited the market's gains. The 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07
edged up from 115 19/32 at the opening to 115 by late afternoon to yield
9.35 per cent while short-dated gilts ended little changed.
Volumes in the futures market were relatively high with about 35,000
contracts traded. The Liffe gilt futures contract slipped from 97.24 to
97.20 by late afternoon.

FT  21 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Moody's lowers ratings on two
Japanese banks
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MOODY's Investor Service, the US credit rating agency, yesterday lowered the
long-term ratings of the Industrial Bank of Japan and Norinchukin Bank, two
of Japan's leading banks.
Japanese banks face mounting non-performing property related loans due to
the sharp fall in the country's real estate market. While the banks have low
direct exposure to the domestic real estate sector, they are experiencing
severe problems because of loans to non-bank financial institutions which
lent heavily to property related developments in the late 1980s.
IBJ, the largest long-term credit bank, saw its long-term debt lowered from
Aa2 to Aa3. Moody's said the downgrade was based on the bank's real
estate-related asset quality trends, as well as long-term profitability. The
agency expressed concern over the effect of IBJ's weak internal controls on
the credit quality of the bank.
Increasing competitive pressures due to financial deregulation are also
expected to erode IBJ's profitability.
Moody's also lowered its long-term debt ratings of Norinchukin, the central
banking institution for agricultural co-operatives, from Aa1 to Aa3. Moody's
said the downgrade reflected the bank's vulnerability to asset quality
deterioration, and the weakening condition of the smaller financial
institutions related to the agricultural co-operative system.

FT  21 AUG 92 / International Bonds: Canadian new issue activity stalls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG rally in the Canadian government bond market yesterday sparked
expectations of supply in the Euro-Canadian sector. However, poor swap
conditions and a lack of borrowers requiring Canadian dollar funding have
temporarily stalled new issue activity.
Canadian dollar Eurobond spreads widened as government bond yields fell
faster than Eurobond yields, while swap spreads remained tight.
'The market has almost rallied too far (for Eurobond issuance),' said one
syndicate official. The Canadian sector of the Eurobond market has
traditionally had a substantial retail investor base, viewing the market as
a high-yielding alternative to US dollars. With coupons for 10-year Canadian
Eurobonds likely to be in the region of 7 1/2 per cent to 7 3/4 per cent,
the market is no longer an obvious buy for European retail investors, who
must now be persuaded that the currency is set to appreciate, dealers said.
The steep yield curve means that shorter-dated deals will offer even lower
yields.
Meanwhile, Credit Foncier de France added a further Dollars 50m to its
Dollars 150m issue of floating-rate notes launched on Wednesday, on a
quieter day for the recently hectic floating-rate sector, as the market
absorbed Wednesday's Dollars 500m offering by BankAmerica.
The Royal Bank of Scotland has increased its Dollars 200m issue of
preference share capital, launched on August 3, to Dollars 400m, making it
the largest overseas bank issue in the US preference share market.
'This issue reinforces the strength of our capital base in a very
cost-effective way,' said Mr Kenneth Thompson, group finance director of the
Royal Bank. The shares, which pay a dividend of 9 1/2 per cent, qualify as
tier 1 capital under international bank capital guidelines which come into
force next year.
Guinness has set up a Dollars 1bn programme, which provides for the issuance
of listed Eurobonds as well as medium-term notes. The multi-currency
programme, arranged by Morgan Stanley International, includes a D-Mark
option.
The company, which will use the programme to refinance short-term debt,
expects to start issuing paper under the programme in the latter part of
September.

FT  21 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Treasurers digest details of
privatisation debt sale - Maggie Urry examines the auction's structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE structure dreamed up by Baring Brothers for the UK government's sale of
privatised companies' debts had corporate treasurers of the businesses
concerned scratching their heads yesterday.
Although they knew the debt sale was coming, they only learnt the
intricacies of the sale in letters sent to them yesterday. Given also a
natural reluctance to show their hands in advance of a bidding process, many
retreated behind statements about the need for further consultation and the
complexity of the tax issues involved.
A period for consultation, between now and the end of September, has been
built into the sale timetable. Details of the mechanics of the sale will be
announced by the end of September with the auction taking place soon
afterwards.
The auction aims to sell Pounds 1bn of the Pounds 3.7bn debt, with
maturities after 1997 and paying interest rates between 11 1/2 per cent and
13 per cent, owed by BT and 12 electricity companies to the government.
The debt will be sold in whole tranches - there are 29 in all with the
largest being a Pounds 350m loan to National Power - so the total of Pounds
1bn is approximate. Within that constraint, though, the highest bidders will
be included in the Pounds 1bn and the loans of the rest will continue to
run.
Because there are different terms on the debt of BT and the electricity
companies, the debt is being divided into two pools. BT, which has Pounds
1.7bn of the debt in question, will be in one pool able to bid for the debt
itself but also competing against outsiders who can bid as well. In the
other pool are the electricity companies with a total of Pounds 2.1bn of
debt.
There is no fixed allocation of purchases between the two pools - the
government could sell the whole Pounds 1bn to BT or to the electricity
companies - so the bidders in each pool are in effect bidding against the
other pool, as well as against rivals in the same pool.
Mr Douglas Brown, head of capital markets at Barings, said that the
structure of the deal 'will create price tension within and between the
bidders'. This should, he believed, maximise proceeds for the taxpayer.
A further complication is that the tranches carry different interest rates
and maturities, and the covenants on the loans vary between borrowers. There
are also tax angles to consider. Thus absolute prices for the debt cannot be
compared.
To resolve this Barings will set a benchmark price for each tranche of debt
on a tax adjusted basis. Bidders will then put in prices expressed at a
premium to the benchmark price. Bids will be accepted in terms of descending
order of the percentage premium offered.
While the government is trying to whip up excitement for the buy-back, in
order to achieve the best price, the companies are keen to appear relaxed.
Most have strong balance sheets, some with net cash.
So there is no great pressure to refinance their debts at lower rates,
especially as they will have to pay a premium to buy the debt back. This
premium will not be tax deductible while the interest payments are.
'Everyone will work out a price where the effect will be neutral, and no-one
will bid above that,' one analyst said.
However, there is another, non-economic, incentive for the companies to bid.
In BT's case it is bidding against third parties - and BT is one of the few
UK corporates with AAA rated debt - while the electricity companies know
that if they do not buy their debt back the government will be free to sell
it next year.
Buying the debt back will give them control of their borrowings again. As
the covenants on the government loans are in general more restrictive than
is usual on bank debt or bonds, the buy-back would make it easier for the
companies to deal with other lenders.
With so many factors to consider, the companies and their advisers, as well
as potential third party bidders for the BT debt, have much to think about
over the next few weeks. One conclusion that can be reached at this stage is
that the process will be fascinating.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL BANK of Canada, the country's sixth largest bank, reported a loss
of CDollars 118m (USDollars 100m) or CDollars 1 a share for the third
quarter, after more than CDollars 200m of additional loan loss provisions.
The bank has a total exposure of CDollars 473m to Olympia &amp; York
Developments and related companies, and also a relatively large exposure to
non-performing property loans in Canada and the north-eastern US.
The extra provisions mean that NBC has written down about two-thirds of its
loans to Canary Wharf and to the Reichmann brothers, analysts said.
'NBC is a regional bank and their O&amp;Y exposure was excessive,' said Mr
Stephen Martin, bank analyst with Canadian Bond Rating Service in Montreal.
'They have now recognised these risks and tightened up their credit
standards.'
In the third quarter of fiscal 1991, NBC earned CDollars 39m, or 25 cents a
share. It said it expected to return to profitability in the fourth quarter
this year, and in fiscal 1993, when the extra provisions would be in the
past.
Total third-quarter provisions were CDollars 358m against CDollars 90m a
year earlier. Total assets at July 31 was CDollars 41.5bn, up CDollars
1.7bn.
The bank is reducing its quarterly common share dividend from 20 cents to 10
cents.
NBC's nine-months' loss was CDollars 37.9m, or 52 cents a share, compared
with profit of CDollars 144.7m, or 94 cents a share, a year earlier,
including the extra provisions in the third quarter of fiscal 1992.

TIME WARNER, the entertainment and publishing giant, and Viacom
International, a cable and broadcast television group, yesterday said they
had settled an anti-trust lawsuit linked to the 1989 merger between Time and
Warner.
Viacom, which had sought Dollars 2.4bn in damages from Time, said it would
receive material financial benefits from the settlement, in addition to
strategic advantages. Time Warner, which has not admitted any liability to
Viacom's claims, will pay Viacom an undisclosed cash sum.
Other terms of the settlement include wider distribution of Viacom's
Showtime and Movie channels on Time Warner's cable system, joint marketing
campaigns by Showtime and Time Warner's HBO and increased advertising
purchases by Time Warner companies on Viacom's MTV networks over the next
five years.
In addition, Time Warner will buy Viacom's Milwaukee cable system.
In the original suit, Viacom had alleged that Time Warner had used its power
as the second largest US operator of cable television networks to promote
its own pay-TV film services at the expense of Viacom's services. Viacom
charged that the uncompetitive acts, dating to at least 1980, would worsen
after the merger between Time and Warner.

<TEXT>
DE BEERS, the South African company that controls the world diamond market,
and the Namibian government are holding talks which could lead to the
government taking an equity stake in De Beers's Namibian subsidiary,
Consolidated Diamond Mines (CDM).
Such an arrangement would probably parallel arrangements in Botswana where
the government holds a stake in the company Debswana.
A joint statement from De Beers and the Namibian government said the talks
would concern their relationship and the future of the country's diamond
industry. Mining, and the diamond industry in particular, is an important
part of the Namibian economy.
The talks come after a week in which De Beers incurred the wrath of
investors by revising downwards prospects for the second half of the year.
It is not clear what the Namibian government will offer in return for an
equity stake, assuming it is not donated. In Botswana, new shares were
issued in exchange for De Beers gaining control of a diamond stockpile, but
Namibia has no equivalent stockpile.

JENNINGS Group, Australia's largest homebuilder, yesterday said it had
reached agreement with its banks and its biggest shareholder on a debt for
equity swap to strengthen its balance sheet.
The group said the deal would eliminate a ADollars 195m (USDollars 141.3m)
deficit on shareholder funds which developed as a result of its exposure to
falling asset values in the Australian property market.
Jennings said Fletcher Challenge, the New Zealand construction, forestry and
energy group which owns 48 per cent of the company's stock, had agreed to
convert ADollars 152m of debt to ordinary shares.
Fletcher Challenge would hold 43 per cent of the reconstructed company.
Jennings' banks would take a 39 per cent stake in return for the conversion
of ADollars 58m of secured debt into ordinary shares and the capitalisation
of about ADollars 5m in interest into equity.
Jennings shares closed unchanged at 15 cents on the Australian Stock
Exchange, compared with an all-time low of 10 cents last month.
The company said its core Australian housing business was performing 'very
satisfactorily'. The group said sales over the seven months to July were up
by 8 per cent to ADollars 306m.

Foster's stake offer

SHARES in Broken Hill Proprietary (BHP) fell 16 cents to ADollars 13
(USDollars 9) on the Australian Stock Exchange yesterday as the market
reacted to the group's offer to pay more than ADollars 1.5bn (USDollars
1.15bn) for a 32 per cent stake in Foster's Brewing Group.
Analysts said the decline reflected concern that BHP may have to hold the
shares for several years before being able to sell without making a loss.
Foster's shares closed 7 cents higher at ADollars 1.80, suggesting BHP may
have succeeded in removing the uncertainty which has surrounded the group
for two years.
However, Foster's shares could come under pressure because of speculation
that the group will announce a ADollars 1bn rights issue to cover forecast
write-downs in the value of non-brewing assets.
Foster's is expected to reveal substantial write-downs next month when it
announces results for the year to the end of June. Most of the write-downs
are expected to relate to revisions to the loan book of the group's Elders
Finance subsidiary.
Analysts said it was unlikely another bidder would emerge to top BHP's
ADollars 2.39 offer for the shares, which are controlled by the receiver to
International Brewing Holdings (IBH), a private company chaired by Mr John
Elliott. Several international brewers are believed to have considered
taking a stake in Foster's, including Guinness, Anheuser Busch, Heineken and
Miller. But none have indicated an intention to bid.
Foster's is the world's fourth largest brewer. It owns the Carlton and
United brewery in Australia, Courage in the UK and a half share in Molson
Breweries in Canada.
BHP is offering ADollars 1.5bn in cash, plus the cancellation of 27 per cent
of its preference share holding in IBH, equivalent to ADollars 220m. The
deal includes two sets of share options which would increase BHP's Foster's
stake to nearly 50 per cent. BHP has said it acted only to protect its
investment in IBH, which was secured against Foster's shares. BHP said it
plans to sell the shares when the market price reaches ADollars 2.39,
allowing the group to break even on the investment.

TELECOM Corporation of New Zealand suffered a 18 per cent fall in profit to
NZDollars 73.3m (USDollars 39.5m) for the first quarter to June 30, against
NZDollars 89.9m last time, but said it was on track for an increase for the
full year.
The profit fall came in spite of more than halved tax payments to NZDollars
178.6m against NZDollars 89.9m. Pre-tax profit was down 30 per cent to
NZDollars 91.9m on revenue 6 per cent lower at NZDollars 597m.
Telecom said its earnings were achieved in a highly competitive environment
which did not exist in the comparable period last year.
As expected, redundancy costs soared from NZDollars 13.2m to NZDollars 36m
while staff costs were down 5.1 per cent as numbers fell by 1,861 to 12,882.
National calls revenue fell 13.9 per cent with volumes 4.1 per cent lower
and international revenue 2.5 per cent down. But there was a 33.3 per cent
growth in the cellular market.
Revenue from directories rose 9 per cent, and from other services by 123 per
cent to NZDollars 25.8m.
Baring Brothers, Burrows, in its full report on National Australia Bank's
takeover offer bid for Bank of New Zealand, has valued BNZ at between
NZDollars 1.37bn and NZDollars 1.56bn. This compares with the NZDollars
1.48bn being offered.
In its report, accompanying a recommendation by independent directors to all
shareholders that they accept the offer, the Sydney firm said its valuation,
on a discounted cash flow basis, valued the bank in a range of between 74
cents and 84 cents a share. The NAB offer is 80 cents.
The recommendation comes amid growing restlessness among some minority
shareholders over the terms of the deal. A number have claimed that they are
being disadvantaged.
Writing on behalf of independent directors, Mr Sid Pasley, chairman, said
that in their view the offer of 80 cents is fair to minority shareholders.
Directors are accepting the offer in respect of their own shares.

PROCTER &amp; Gamble, one of the largest US consumer products companies,
yesterday announced the sale of a large portion of its pulp and timber
business to Weyerhaeuser, the Tacoma-based timber group, for Dollars 600m.
P&amp;G added that it was still reviewing proposals from potential acquirers for
the rest of its pulp and timber business. The group announced in March that
it planned to divest the pulp interests.
The move - a step away from the traditional strategy of internal vertical
integration - was designed to make the group 'more globally focused on core
consumer businesses'.
About half the pulp and timber division's output is sold to P&amp;G for its
products.
The assets which Weyerhaeuser is buying comprise pulp mills in Grande
Prairie, Alberta and Oglethorpe, Georgia; three saw mills, also in Alberta
and Georgia; and about 175,000 acres of timberland in Georgia. Yesterday,
P&amp;G said it expected to work with Weyerhaeuser as a supplier of pulp from
the mills that it was selling. The buyer is also expected to offer continued
jobs to all employees at the Georgia and Alberta facilities.
However, Standard &amp; Poor's, one of the large US rating agencies, decided to
downgrade Weyerhaeuser's senior debt as a result of the deal, to A from
A-plus.
It stressed that it saw a beneficial relationship between the two companies
but added that the increase in the buyer's debt levels, as a result of the
purchase, 'occurs at a time when pulp, paper and real estate markets are
very soft'.
'As a result, cash flow protection measures, which are already low for the
rating, will weaken even further,' suggested S&amp;P.
The remaining timber assets for which P&amp;G hopes to find buyers include a
pulp mill and 665,000 acres of timberland in northern Florida, and a cotton
linter's pulp plant and the cellulose and specialties division headquarters'
site in Memphis.

THE Norwegian government is studying 'options' to help Uni Storebrand, the
insurance company, out of its financial difficulties.
However Mr Sigbjoern Johnsen, finance minister, yesterday ruled out the
government becoming a 'major owner' of Uni Storebrand, but he did not rule
out 'indirect' intervention should Uni need it. Uni Storebrand's shares
closed yesterday at a new low of NKr15.50.
State intervention in Uni Storebrand is being considered because the
authorities believe a NKr1.5bn (Dollars 263.1m) to NKr2bn capital expansion
planned for the autumn will fail due to uncertainty surrounding the company
since it acquired a 28.3 per cent stake in Skandia last year. Uni Storebrand
joined forces with Hafnia in an unsuccessful bid to take over the Swedish
group.
Meanwhile, turbulence continued to affect Scandinavian financial markets in
the wake of Wednesday's decision by Hafnia to suspend debt payments and
restructure its operations.
In Norway, the Oslo share index fell 3.5 per cent over investors' fears that
the Norwegian government could be forced to increase its interests in
Norwegian financial institutions.
Den norske Bank A-shares dropped 38.5 per cent to a record low NKr2 as free
shares fell 50 per cent to NKr3. Analysts said that DnB's half-year results
presented on Wednesday were far worse than the market had expected.
In Copenhagen the Danish KFX index of the country's 20 leading shares fell
1.08 to 79.28, which is the first time it has closed below 80. The index has
fallen by 20 per cent in the past 10 weeks. The share values of Denmark's
largest insurance group Baltica Holdings, in which Hafnia holds a 34.5 per
cent stake, fell 6 points yesterday in Copenhagen to 395.
In Stockholm, Skandia shares fell SKr2 to SKr69.

AXA, one of the leading French insurers, plans to expand its presence in
Spain by forming a joint venture with Banco de Bilbao Viscaya (BBV), the
Spanish bank which has substantial interests in the insurance sector.
The two groups are negotiating to merge their Spanish insurance subsidiaries
 -Axa's Seguros and BBV's Aurora Polar - into a new company in which each
would have a 50 per cent stake. The new group would be the fifth biggest
Spanish insurer with annual premiums of about FFr3.22bn (Dollars 649m).
The bulk of the new company's business would be in the motor insurance
sector, which would provide 49 per cent of its premiums. It would receive 22
per cent of its premiums from life insurance and the remainder from general
(non-motor) policies.
The companies said they expected the joint venture to 'optimise the
efficiency of both existing companies'.
For Axa, the second largest insurer in France, the Spanish initiative forms
part of its international expansion strategy. Last year it made a move into
the US by investing Dollars 1bn in Equitable Life Assurance, a leading US
insurer.

<TEXT>
NAVISTAR International, the largest US truck manufacturer, slumped to an
after-tax loss of Dollars 115m in the three months to end-July.
The deficit compares with a Dollars 31m loss in the same period a year
earlier, and brings Navistar's total losses for the first nine months of its
financial year to Dollars 182m, compared with a Dollars 98m loss last time.
Sales in the third quarter were up from Dollars 861m to Dollars 920m, and in
the nine-month period, from Dollars 2.64bn to Dollars 2.74bn.
The company reported signs of improvement in the market for heavy trucks,
but added that the market for school buses remained weak. Its shares rose
Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 2 on the news. Navistar said the third quarter loss
from continuing operations was a more modest Dollars 50m - of which Dollars
24m represented a charge for the previously announced recall of school bus
chassis.
Discontinued operations comprised a Dollars 65m charge covering the
settlement of litigation between the company and the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation, the federal agency which underpins pension benefits.
Navistar said its retail deliveries of school bus chassis and medium/heavy
trucks was numbered 17,600 in the third quarter, a 5 per cent improvement on
the previous year.
However, this was still below the 7 per cent increase seen by the industry
generally.

FT  21 AUG 92 / International Company News: O&amp;Y beats a gruelling path to
Toronto court door - Bernard Simon examines the immediate prospects of
restructuring the Canadian property developer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After five gruelling months of negotiations and court appearances, a note of
frustration is creeping into efforts to revive Olympia &amp; York, the ailing
multi-national property developer.
O&amp;Y, whose Canadian and UK assets have been under court protection since
May, is required to file a restructuring plan for most of its CDollars
13.5bn (USDollars 11.27bn) debt with an Ontario judge this morning. Its 25
buildings in the US remain outside court protection.
In a preview of the plan, Mr Gerald Greenwald, O&amp;Y president, and Mr Steve
Miller, chief negotiator, disclosed yesterday that creditors are being
offered up to 80 per cent of O&amp;Y's equity, including voting control.
Maturity dates on most project loans as well as a Dollars 2.5bn jumbo loan
would be extended.
O&amp;Y's owners, the Reichmann family, are also willing to contribute their
directly held 20 per cent stake in O&amp;Y's US operations to the restructured
company, as well as a number of family-owned buildings in Canada.
Mr Greenwald, Mr Miller and their colleagues have held about 40 meetings
with various groups of creditors in the past month. They put a brave face
yesterday on the progress so far, saying that agreement in principle is
close with lenders to five of O&amp;Y's 11 major Canadian projects.
Mr Miller said: 'The progress and the movement have been good in all cases.'
The creditors however, paint a more sombre picture. 'No one is even close
(to an agreement),' says one institutional lender.
Noting that O&amp;Y has so far made 'a series of piecemeal offers to various
creditors', a senior Toronto bankruptcy lawyer concludes: 'There must be
some serious problems.'
To no one's great surprise, the restructuring is proving more complex than
expected. Layers of secrecy which once surrounded the Reichmann family
empire have been peeled away to reveal a highly centralised management
structure, but a financial structure which was just the opposite.
Mr Greenwald said yesterday that negotiations are taking place with 27
separate groups of creditors. Each O&amp;Y building is a separate entity with
its own financing arrangements.
Some are in a healthy financial condition, providing more than adequate
security for their creditors. Others have rising vacancy rates, ebbing cash
flow and falling market values, with the added complication of various
layers of creditors, each fighting to protect its own interests.
Much of the past few months has been spent trying to reconcile competing
interests. Creditors have had to be slotted into one or more of six creditor
committees. Much time has been spent apportioning overheads and
restructuring costs among O&amp;Y's various projects.
Asset sales have slowed to a snail's pace. The latest report from Price
Waterhouse, which acts as a conduit for information between O&amp;Y and its
creditors, notes that, besides the disposal of a Gulfstream jet, O&amp;Y has in
the past month raised a paltry CDollars 3.7m from Canadian government bonds
and a vendor take-back mortgage. A deal to dispose of its interest in a
12-storey office project in Budapest has fallen through. The sale of Home
Oil of Calgary, which was said to be imminent even before O&amp;Y sought court
protection, has yet to be concluded.
Despite these hitches, few are willing to predict where O&amp;Y is heading after
today's court appearance. Some lenders are talking darkly of bankruptcy and
liquidation, or of reviving efforts to 'carve out' individual buildings from
the protection of the courts.
Although the US operations are not in bankruptcy protection, bondholders of
55 Water Street, a mammoth New York office building, are considering
proposals to replace O&amp;Y as manager and to bring in a new investor with the
resources to pay for asbestos removal and other improvements.
Creditors are also increasingly edgy about the spiralling costs of the
restructuring effort. The Canadian operations paid CDollars 3.5m in July to
investment bankers, lawyers and accountants, and expect to fork out another
CDollars 4.8m this month.
Price Waterhouse estimates that the costs of creditor committees are running
at another CDollars 2m a month. Sensing these concerns, Mr Miller said the
company plans to cut general and administrative expenses by 70 per cent.
O&amp;Y is still banking that its reputation as a first-rate manager of
buildings will discourage creditors from pulling the plug, especially during
an un-remitting slump in the North American commercial property market. A
lawyer for one bank says he senses that the lenders are 'more malleable'
than they were a month ago.
The scales could be tipped by the fate of the Canary Wharf development in
London. Mr Paul Reichmann is negotiating to regain a foothold in the
Docklands project through an investor group which includes US financiers Mr
Laurence Tisch, Mr Sanford Weil and Mr Lewis Ranieri. Investors would
contribute Pounds 350m (Dollars 678.65m) and O&amp;Y would continue to manage
the project.
Some participants in the restructuring predict that O&amp;Y's chances of keeping
its creditors at bay in the US and Canada will improve significantly if the
Canary Wharf lenders and administrators throw their support behind the
Reichmann-led Docklands bid.
Conversely, rejection of the Canary Wharf bid could weaken the confidence of
lenders in North America that the rest of the Reichmann empire is worth
preserving.

SHARES in Bristol-Myers Squibb, one of the world's largest pharmaceuticals
companies, tumbled yesterday on speculation that the company expected its
third-quarter earnings to be at the low end of expectations.
However, the company later denied it had provided any estimates for the
third or fourth quarter. Bristol-Myers also said it had not changed its
outlook since June when it warned its annual earnings would fall below
expectations.
At close of trade the stock was down Dollars 2 to Dollars 66 7/8 .
Wall Street has been revising its expectations for Bristol-Myers since June.
The company then warned of disappointing single-digit second-quarter
earnings and sales growth. Yesterday's stock price erosion was less dramatic
than the Dollars 7 1/4 shed then.
Before yesterday, most analysts had expected the company to earn between
Dollars 1.15 and Dollars 1.29 a share in the third quarter, against Dollars
1.08 a year earlier.
Although they expect full-year earnings per share to advance about 7 per
cent this year from Dollars 3.94 in 1991, the rate of growth is considerably
below Bristol-Myers' usual pattern of reporting about 15 per cent earnings
growth.
It also calls into question the company's ability to be a serious rival to
Merck, the biggest US drugs company, which generally posts earnings
improvements in the 15 to 20 per cent range.
Earlier in the year, Bristol-Myers blamed inventory reduction by wholesalers
for its disappointing results. According to analysts, the company has also
been hit by higher levels of discounting by managed health care groups,
which are increasingly insisting on lower prices for drugs.
In addition, sales growth has been held back by higher inventories of
anti-cancer and cardiovascular drugs.
Concern about Bristol-Myers performance had little impact on other drug
stocks.

<TEXT>
ASCII, the aggressively expanding Japanese publishing and computer software
company, said yesterday it was in talks with its banks in an effort to raise
new funding to repay Y10.7bn in convertible bonds which mature next March.
Trading of Ascii shares on the over-the-counter market was temporarily
suspended yesterday following reports that Ascii was encountering difficulty
in its search for a capital injection or fresh funding from its banks.
Ascii's debts have grown rapidly as the company has expanded into new
ventures, including film production and multi-media. The traditional
business of Ascii, founded by three university students in 1977, was
publishing, software and integrated circuit design. Ascii is Japan's largest
independent software company.
Ascii's net debt stood at Y24.12bn (Dollars 190m) at the end of March,
compared with Y19.74bn a year earlier. The economic slowdown also forced
Ascii's rapid growth to a halt last year, when revenues grew by just 1 per
cent to Y34.5bn.
Pre-tax profits, however, grew by 20 per cent to Y1.52bn, following an
effort by the company to cut costs.
The company said yesterday that modest growth in the first quarter of the
current fiscal year continued but a spokesman said it would have a problem
repaying Y10.7bn in convertible bonds.
The Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the economic daily, reported yesterday that
Ascii's banks, which include the Industrial Bank of Japan, the Fuji Bank,
Sakura Bank and Mitsubishi Bank, want Ascii to shed some of its investments
in other companies before they will agree to a new funding package. They
also want the company to take more drastic steps to cut costs.
Ascii said it could not comment on the substance of the negotiations, which
began last year, until they were completed.
A year ago a boardroom dispute led to the resignation of two of Ascii's
founders, leaving the more aggressive Mr Kasuhiko Nishi, 36, as president.

<TEXT>
SHARES in Broken Hill Proprietary (BHP) fell 16 cents to ADollars 13
(USDollars 9) on the Australian Stock Exchange yesterday as the market
reacted to the group's offer to pay more than ADollars 1.5bn (USDollars
1.15bn) for a 32 per cent stake in Foster's Brewing Group.
Analysts said the decline reflected concern that BHP may have to hold the
shares for several years before being able to sell without making a loss.
Foster's shares closed 7 cents higher at ADollars 1.80, suggesting BHP may
have succeeded in removing the uncertainty which has surrounded the group
for two years.
However, Foster's shares could come under pressure because of speculation
that the group will announce a ADollars 1bn rights issue to cover forecast
write-downs in the value of non-brewing assets.
Foster's is expected to reveal substantial write-downs next month when it
announces results for the year to the end of June. Most of the write-downs
are expected to relate to revisions to the loan book of the group's Elders
Finance subsidiary.

THE Equitable Life Assurance Society of New York, the large but troubled
life insurer in which France's Axa group now owns a 49 per cent stake, said
yesterday that it had secured a new Dollars 550m credit facility.
The back-up loan facility is being provided by a 13-strong international
syndicate of banks, led by Chase Manhattan, and will last for 364 days. The
Equitable said that it replaced a Dollars 1.16bn facility, which was never
used and intended primarily to support commercial paper sales. 'We have no
plans to borrow against the new line,' Mr Richard Jenrette, Equitable's
chairman, said.
There were reports this month that The Equitable had been unable to arrange
a Dollars 600m credit line, and was cutting the amount sought and maturity
desired.
In order to bolster its capital, The Equitable converted from mutual status
to a conventional shareholder-owned company. Axa invested Dollars 1bn for
its 49 per cent stake, but when The Equitable tried to raise additional
money through the general flotation of its shares, it was obliged to cut the
offering price from Dollars 11-Dollars 14 to Dollars 9.

HONGKONG and Shanghai Hotels, the Kadoorie family's hotels and property
company, yesterday unveiled a 27 per cent rise in earnings to HKDollars 159m
(USDollars 20.56m) from HKDollars 125m for the six months to June 30.
The rise in interim profit was struck on a 9 per cent growth in turnover to
HKDollars 989m from HKDollars 906m. Earnings per share were up 15 per cent
to 15 cents from 13 cents. Directors declared a dividend of 6 cents a share,
the same as last time.
Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels is the owner of the Peninsula and the Kowloon
Hotels in Hong Kong. It has residential and office property interests in the
colony and it also owns the Peak Tram.
Outside Hong Kong it owns the Peninsula in New York and is a part owner of
the Peninsula in Manila, the Peninsula Beverly Hills, and the Palace Hotel
in Beijing.
Mr Hanmer Webb-Peploe, managing director, said that during the first half
tourist arrivals in Hong Kong were up 19 per cent on the Gulf war-induced
depressed levels of a year ago.
Occupancy of its two Hong Kong hotels was up from 72 per cent to 78 per cent
while levels in the company's other hotels around the world also showed an
improvement, he said.
Mr Webb-Peploe said the upward trend in occupancy and rents was expected to
continue for the rest of this year.
Hongkong and Shanghai's US hotels were finally getting the 'recognition they
deserve,' the current wave of reform in China boded well for its Beijing
interest and, in the Philippines, with the election out of the way, there
was greater optimism, he said.

ERICSSON, the Swedish telecommunications group, made a SKr422m (Dollars
79.2m) pre-tax profit for the second quarter of the year. This compares with
a SKr363m loss made in the first quarter, caused mainly by cuts in
telecommunications investments in Spain and Mexico.
Over the first half of the year the company achieved a SKr59m pre-tax profit
which compares with the SKr1.775bn profit it made for the same period of
1991.
The company announced a 24 per cent increase in its order bookings for the
first six months to SKr26.77bn from SKr21.55bn although there was a 10 per
cent drop in net sales to SKr20.311bn from SKr22.463bn.
Loss per share after tax and full conversion was SKr1.34 compared with
income per share of SKr5.26 for the first six months of last year.
Ericsson said that its 1992 profit forecast remained unchanged with a weak
profit for the year as a whole.
The company has reduced costs by 8 per cent this year as a result of a
savings programme which has cut 6,000 people from its 70,000-strong
workforce.

Over the first half of the year the company achieved a SKr59m pre-tax profit
which compares with the SKr1.775bn profit it made for the same period of

The company announced a 24 per cent increase in its order bookings for the
first six months to SKr26.770bn from SKr21.550bn although there was a 10 per
cent drop in net sales to SKr20.311bn from SKr22.463bn.
Loss per share after tax and full conversion was SKr1.34 compared with
income per share of SKr5.26 for the first six months of last year. The
company said that the positive growth in higher order bookings would make a
full impact on its net sales next year. Ericsson added that its 1992 profit
forecast remained unchanged with a weak profit for the year as a whole.
Mr Lars Ramqvist, Ericsson's president, said the company was 'well on the
way' to a substantial revival and the latest results vindicated his decision
to keep up research and development programmes in spite of falling demand
last year.
Although the second-quarter figures showed a financial improvement, he
pointed out there had not been any 'direct recovery in the business
climate'. However, Mr Ramqvist was able to point to the third successive
quarter improvement in order bookings, mainly for telecommunications
systems.
Mr Ramqvist said that the rising order bookings were a direct result of the
company's 'consistent technological development efforts', especially in
digital systems and pocket telephones. This year Ericsson expected to
improve its mobile phone sales by 50 per cent.
He added he was 'particularly satisfied with the breakthrough in Japan'
although net sales in that market will not be recorded until 1994.
The company has been able to reduce its costs by 8 per cent this year as a
result of its savings programme begun in 1991 which involved a cut in its
70,000-strong workforce of 6,000 people.

slow sharply

<TEXT>
PROFIT and sales growth at VIAG, the energy-based German conglomerate,
slowed sharply in the first six months of this year. Net profits rose 2 per
cent to DM193m (Dollars 130.40m) on sales up only 3.4 per cent at DM12.1bn.
The rise in turnover was due in part to the effects of acquisitions, the
company said in an interim report published yesterday.
The company was cautious about the prospects for the rest of the year and
said that the full year's profits should increase provided weaknesses in
domestic markets did not worsen and international markets showed clear signs
of recovery.
VIAG's sluggish progress underlines the delicate condition of most German
companies although it is not as dramatic as the 89 per cent profits slump
reported earlier this week by the Mannesmann engineering group,
The group, which in June suggested a further increase in the dividend was
possible this year, made no mention of pay-out prospects yesterday. The
dividend for 1991, when profits rose 20 per cent, was raised 50 pfennigs to
DM9 - the eighth consecutive increase.
With more than half its earnings coming from energy generation and
distribution, the group is protected to some extent from the slump in
foreign and export markets which have hit pure manufacturing companies so
hard this year. However, it is understood to be experiencing difficulties in
aluminium, which accounts for 23 per cent of sales.
Net profits at Flachglas, the Gelsenkirchen glass maker controlled by
Britain's Pilkington group, fell by almost a third in the year to the end of
March.
Earnings of DM66 compared with DM97m last time on sales up 3.3 per cent at
DM2bn, the company said yesterday.
Flachglas reduced its workforce by 1,000 people to 11,000.

FT  21 AUG 92 / International Company News: Bankers stalk Efim as asset
disposals loom - Haig Simonian explains the problems confronting the state
group's break-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Merchant bankers are busily studying Efim, the Italian state holding company
put into voluntary liquidation last month, to see what might be marketable.
The prognosis for the complex group, with activities ranging from aerospace,
defence equipment, railway rolling stock, glass and aluminium to health
spas, is not encouraging.
Yet the success of disposals could be crucial to relations between the
treasury and Efim's angry foreign bank creditors, which have lent about
L3,500bn (Dollars 3.15bn) of the group's L8,500bn total debt.
The government plans to give creditors up to L4,000bn of five-year bonds to
cover the gap between the value of their loans and what can be realised
through sales. While the treasury has fallen out with foreign banks over the
low coupons on the bonds, all agreed the negotiations would be influenced by
how much can be raised.
Even preliminary estimates are still lacking, pending a valuation of Efim
commissioned by the government from Mediobanca and S G Warburg last month.
However, foreign bankers accept that their talks with the treasury could
become much easier once figures are available.
Efim's most attractive operations are the SIV glass business, Breda
Costruzioni Ferroviarie on the railway side, and its Agusta helicopters
division. Not all are profitable, and they share problems such as
overmanning. However, bankers agree the three are the most immediately
marketable parts of its portfolio.
Agusta, which co-operates with Westland of the UK, received a welcome lift
last month with a big Canadian order for its jointly produced EH101
helicopter. Bankers say the company has good products and technology, but
suffers from debts of about L2,000bn, which, with overmanning and too many
plants, mean it loses money heavily.
Some think Agusta could be an ideal partner for a foreign aerospace group
wanting to break into the Italian market. However, the helicopter business
is in severe difficulties. Moreover, Agusta's famous name and 7,000
employees means its fate may be swayed by political rather than market
factors. Using arguments of 'national interest', domestic political
considerations may dictate Agusta's incorporation into Alenia, the quoted
aerospace and electronics arm of Iri's Finmeccanica group.
A similar fate probably awaits Breda Costruzioni Ferroviarie (BCF), Efim's
Tuscany-based railway equipment subsidiary. The group has been successful in
winning US orders for its urban mass transit systems and makes rolling stock
for the Channel tunnel.
However, it is no stranger to uncertainty. It has been a key in the
long-running tug-of-war within the public sector on rationalising Italy's
railway equipment business, currently split between Efim and Finmeccanica's
Ansaldo Trasporti subsidiary.
A merger between the two has traditionally been blocked by political
barriers, as the two companies are controlled by different parties. That
impasse led BCF into talks with the Italian subsidiary of the multinational
ABB group. However, negotiations broke down, and BCF returned to seeking
closer links with Ansaldo even before Efim's collapse.
Some bankers question whether a merger is the only solution. Fiat, which has
substantial railway activities, is tipped as an interested party, as are
industrial multinationals such as ABB and Siemens. However, the chances of a
purchase by any of the three are slim. While bankers agree that a number of
Italian private sector industrial companies will snap up some Efim assets,
few expect any really large takeovers. Only parts of Efim's empire are
attractive, while the liquidity problems of many private sector groups will
make them reluctant to embark on large acquisitions.
The position of the non-Italian concerns is less clear. However, most
bankers stress that domestic rationalisation by transferring companies such
as Agusta, BCF or even Efim's OTO Melara defence equipment business to other
public sector companies should only be the precursor to wider joint ventures
on a European basis.
Foreign buyers are seen as the most obvious candidates for SIV, Efim's
glass-making arm. SIV has a substantial share of the European market for the
automotive sector, making it superficially an obvious sale candidate. But
the company is losing money, leading to differing views among bankers on its
marketability.
'Just compare it with Pilkington,' said one banker. 'Although highly
respected, it still isn't doing particularly well. So what chance is there
for SIV, which needs to be rationalised and whose biggest client, Fiat, is
losing market share?'
Dealing with Finanziaria Ernesto Breda, the quoted holding company which
operates OTO Melara, Efim's missile and defence equipment arm, could also be
tricky. Defence equipment groups around the world are in difficulty owing to
government spending cuts and lower procurement needs. Incorporation within
Finmeccanica's Alenia subsidiary may be inevitable for want of anything
better.
Meanwhile, closure could be the only option for Alumix, Efim's aluminium
division. Bankers lament Italy's decision ever to create an aluminium
industry, given its lack of raw materials and heavy energy dependence.
However, the solution for Alumix, based largely in Sardinia, may have to be
as politically influenced as its birth. Ministers will be wary of closing a
big employer such as Alumix in view of the depressed Sardinian economy. The
island has experienced many cases of spectacular, but misjudged, public
sector investments having to fold. So although it lost L420bn last year -
equivalent to about a third of sales - Alumix's inevitable liquidation may
be spread over a number of years.

FT  21 AUG 92 / International Company News: Axa plans to expand in Spain
with BBV joint venture

AXA, one of the leading French insurers, plans to expand its presence in
Spain by forming a joint venture with Banco de Bilbao Viscaya (BBV), the
Spanish bank which has substantial interests in the insurance sector.
The two groups are negotiating to merge their Spanish insurance subsidiaries
 -Axa's Seguros and BBV's Aurora Polar - into a new company in which each
would have a 50 per cent stake. The new group would be the fifth biggest
Spanish insurer with annual premiums of about FFr3.22bn (Dollars 649m).
The bulk of the new company's business would be in the motor insurance
sector, which would provide 49 per cent of its premiums. It would receive 22
per cent of its premiums from life insurance and the remainder from general
(non-motor) policies.
The companies said they expected the joint venture to 'optimise the
efficiency of both existing companies'.
For Axa, the second largest insurer in France and the biggest private sector
insurance group, the Spanish initiative forms part of its overall
international expansion strategy. Last year it made a move into the US by
investing Dollars 1bn in Equitable Life Assurance, a leading US insurer.
Earlier this summer it struck a FFr165m deal with Sime Darby of Malaysia as
a precursor to strengthening its presence in the Asian region where it hopes
to expand in South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan.
The talks with BBV reflect the general trend for French insurers to expand
beyond their domestic base within the general restructuring of the European
insurance industry. Assurances Generales de France has expanded into Germany
by investing in Aachener &amp; Muunchener Beteilungs. Union des Assurances de
Paris hopes to follow suit by taking a stake in Colonia, another German
insurer.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TURNOVER IN stock index futures improved from the recent poor levels in a
volatile session which saw an early rise evaporate on worries over the
weakness of sterling, writes Joel Kibazo.
The first trade in the September contract on the FT-SE was struck at 2,375,
four points below Wednesday's close, and the contract went further into
retreat with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew reported to be the early seller. However,
September soon gained upward momentum, fuelled by strong buying from Salomon
Bros, and was trading at 2,399 by 9.30am, pulling the underlying cash market
up.
After a brief period of sideways trading, September was again in demand,
boosted by favourable UK money supply figures and, later, relief at the
unchanged Lombard discount rate. But the gain was surrendered in the
afternoon as dealers focused on the weakness of sterling. September closed
at 2,379, around 8 points above its fair value premium to cash of about 12.
Turnover, at 10,539 lots, was an improvement on recent levels.
Volume in traded options remained dull, reaching only 27,153 contracts. The
FT-SE 100 option traded 7,148. Hillsdown was the busiest stock option on
2,664 contracts.

FT  21 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Sterling weakness turns shares lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CURRENCY fears took a hand in the UK stock market yesterday, and early gains
in shares were reversed later when sterling slipped lower against the D-Mark
on the foreign exchange markets, challenging its low in the European
exchange rate mechanism.
The FT-SE Index was only 4.1 off at the close of share trading, but this
contrasted with an earlier rise of 13 points when London was responding
favourably to the Bundesbank's decision to leave its Lombard rate unchanged.
The slide in the pound implied a new threat of higher interest rates in the
UK, and the stock market saw increased selling pressure towards the close of
trading. The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,359.4, with traders
sounding nervous about this morning's opening in the London markets.
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the UK investment bank, last night reduced its
year-end forecast for the FT-SE Index from 2,750 to 2,600, following
downgrades to both its GDP and corporate earnings predictions. The 2,750
estimate is postponed until the end of next year.
The investment bank's decision coincided with a simi-larly bearish review of
the economy from Professor Doug McWilliams, economic adviser to the
Confederation of British Industry, who warned yesterday that economic
recovery will be delayed until 1994.
The stock market's currency concern was also fuelled by weakness in the US
dollar ahead of an important speech from President Bush and by rumours,
denied by the German Finance Ministry, that a meeting of the Group of Seven
ministers was planned.
The stock market opened cautiously, unwilling to extend the modest recovery
of the previous session in spite of the rally of 4.2 per cent by the Nikkei
Average, which was offset by Wall Street's fall of 22 Dow points overnight.
However, the blue chip stocks, inclined to drift easier while awaiting the
outcome of the Bundesbank policy meeting, were quickly pulled upwards from
an initial dip of six Footsie points by a firm opening in stock index
futures. The Footsie was soon ahead by 13 points at 2,376.5.
Trading volume was light at this stage and optimism restrained by the latest
German money supply data, which appeared to set a gloomy backcloth for the
Bundesbank meeting. The July money supply statistics for the UK had little
effect, however.
Although below its best levels, the London market held up at midsession and
drew the expected benefit from the Bundesbank's favourable decision on
German interest rates. The setback in share prices did not appear until the
pound turned down, but the response from stock index futures was swift, and
the underlying blue chips followed suit.
Seaq trading volume increased to 425.9m shares, the highest daily total this
week, as market traders nervously lightened their dealing books. The 393.7m
shares traded across the Seaq network on Wednesday reflected retail, or
customer, business in equities worth only Pounds 778m, still very poor in
terms of profitability to the London securities industry.

FT  21 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome support to end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PHARMACEUTICALS group Wellcome advanced sharply as traders sensed that the
'green shoe' operation to support the price of the group's global share
issue was about to be ended.
Late last night, Robert Fleming, the merchant bank heading the global share
issue, said the support operation, which allowed it to buy back up to 40.5m
shares in order to stabilise the 800p issue price, would terminate at the
close of yesterday's trading session in New York, assuming no sudden
collapse in the US market overnight.
The winding-up of the issue will mean that Wellcome Trust, the governing
charity, will have reduced its stake to 40 per cent and sold around 290m
shares to raise Pounds 2.32bn minus expenses. The money is expected to be
reinvested in equities. Wellcome shares closed a net 10 higher at 802p after
high turnover of 9.4m.
Fleming could have operated the 'green shoe' until next Wednesday but said
it had not bought any Wellcome shares since August 12, since when the share
price had held up well in a completely free market.
Mr Ian Hannam, who has been co-ordinating the issue, said that ending the
support process would give a chance to analysts, gagged by Stock Exchange
rules, to publish research on the company. There have been fears that
Wellcome's forecast of full-year profits of Pounds 500m to Pounds 510m might
be affected by a weaker dollar, but the company has been reassuring
analysts.
Securities house Hoare Govett and agency broker James Capel, both linked to
the flotation, were believed yesterday to be preparing positive research.
Hillsdown drops
Food manufacturer Hillsdown Holdings fell victim to a rash of negative
rumours in the wake of a series of recent downgrades in the run-up to its
interim results, due early next month.
The timing and manner of the fall in the share price suggested to some
dealers a bear raid on the stock. Nomura became the latest to downgrade the
group yesterday, chopping Pounds 17m from its full-year estimate to Pounds
193m. The move is the latest in a revision of the whole food manufacturing
sector by analysts across the market.
Hillsdown shares came under pressure early yesterday, following activity in
the option market. This appeared to be the signal for the rumour mill to
grind into action, with questions hinted about Hillsdown's profitability and
talk that the company may issue a deeply negative trading statement.
Both suggestions were dismissed by analysts, but the damage to the shares
was already done. They closed 13 down at 94p after busy turnover of 6.4m.
Insurance broker Willis Corroon fell 8 in pre-market trading and finished a
net 16 off at 170p on heavy turnover of 7.3m shares after the company posted
lower than expected half-year profits of Pounds 54m.
A range of analysts' profits forecasts predicted between Pounds 60m and
Pounds 66m, against Pounds 69.4m last time. The company said profits for
1992 would not match those for 1991 because of world insurance and financial
market factors, together with the cost of the firm's long-term investments.
CE Heath declined 9 to 251p in sympathy.
An upgrade for Boots lifted the shares 9 to 452p. After meeting the company,
Nomura added Pounds 10m to this year's forecast, to Pounds 420m, and raised
1993's figure Pounds 15m to Pounds 470m.
John Menzies escaped a hangover from the Monopolies and Mergers Commission
inquiry into newspaper suppliers, recovering 11 to 331p. SG Warburg was said
to be positive. But nervousness ahead of next week's figures kept WH Smith
under pressure to end 8 lower at 383p.
Brewer and hotelier Vaux was knocked by a sell note and downgrade from Smith
New Court, shedding 6 to 168p. There were also reported downgrades in Bass,
off a penny at 520p, by BZW and Hoare Govett.
Exceptionally large turnover in Racal Electronics followed a big sale by a
leading UK institution. Dealers said 11m shares were crossed at 63p, with an
eventual 26m dealt, making it the most heavily traded stock of the day. The
shares edged forward a halfpenny to 64p.
British Gas was a penny firmer at 236 1/2 p after announcing that a
partnership with Tractebel, of Belgium, had been selected to develop, own
and operate a Pounds 175m central plant to serve a Thai petrochemical
complex.
In spite of a 21 per cent rise in first-half profits, environmental services
group Rentokil ended a penny easier at 147p. The company, which has expanded
through more than 100 small to medium-sized acquisitions into hygiene,
building and office services, has increased profits at around 20 per cent a
year for the last 10 years. Analysts expect that growth rate to continue
through this year, with full-year profits of around Pounds 114m.
Two large lines of stock, one of which turned into a badly executed sale,
was said to have unhinged Ladbroke. The shares receded 8 to 141p with
turnover a hefty 5.3m.
In transports, NFC was in demand and moved ahead 7 to 242p, but
profit-taking was seen in BAA, 5 down at 666p.
British Aerospace advanced 9 to 213p in early trading on talk that the
company was about to announce the long-awaited order from Saudi Arabia for
the Tornado military aircraft. The stock was also said to have been helped
by a reported buy recommendation from broker Strauss Turnbull. But sellers
appeared at the higher levels, leaving the shares 4 up at 208p.
T &amp; N eased 3 to 137p after James Capel crossed a block of shares at 137 1/2
p.
Inchcape shrugged off recent weakness and rallied 9 to 386p after broker SG
Warburg recommended the stock, saying: 'Recent falls have been overdone and
now is the time to buy for the long term.'
A squeeze in English China Clays helped the shares buck the trend in a dull
building and construction sector. The stock added 7 at 499p in thin trading.
Hartstone was wanted and bounced 4 to 129p.
Financial worries continued to overhang Trafalgar House, which finished 3
1/2 lower at 48 1/2 p. Profit-taking in Lonrho brought a reaction of 3 to
78p after Wednesday's gain.

FT  21 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Short-lived bank rally leaves
Dow depressed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US STOCK markets remained depressed yesterday after an early rally in bank
stocks fizzled out, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.17 at 3,304.89. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index managed to post a slight gain of 0.08 at 418.26,
while the Nasdaq composite was 0.25 firmer at 567.86. New York SE turnover
totalled a modest 183m shares.
Wednesday's late decline was caused by a flurry of selling in the banking
sector, where a variety of rumours, all of them unconfirmed, had depressed
sentiment. When trading opened yesterday, analysts expected banks to recover
the lost ground.
Although bank issues posted early gains, they did not wipe out all the
damage inflicted the afternoon before. The failure of the sector to stage a
more substantial recovery kept the general market subdued.
Citicorp, the biggest loser on Wednesday, rose early on, fell back, but then
rallied again to end Dollars  5/8 better at Dollars 17 3/8 . Chemical, which
moved in similar fashion, was up Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 33 1/2 ,
BankAmerica firmed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 43 5/8 , and JP Morgan put on
Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 60 1/8 . The best performer was Chase Manhattan,
which rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 23 7/8 , but the gain was still
insufficient to cancel out the previous day's loss.
Bristol Myers Squibb fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 66 7/8 in turnover of 3.6m
shares after broker Smith Barney cut its rating from 'hold' to
'underperform' and reduced its third-quarter earnings forecast from Dollars
1.17 a share to Dollars 1.13.
Willis Corroon dropped Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 16 5/8 in heavy trading
after the insurance broker reported pre-tax profits of Dollars 54.1m for the
first half of 1992, down 22 per cent from a year ago.
RJR Nabisco shed a further Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 8 1/2 after a second
analyst in two days, Robinson Humphrey, lowered its rating on the stock
because of pressure on tobacco margins.
Fisher-Price lost Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 22 5/8 after PaineWebber, the
securities house, revised its rating on the toy company's shares from
'attractive' to 'neutral', based on the price of the stock.
On the Nasdaq market, In Focus Systems climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 9
1/4 on news of a joint venture which the company will form with Motorola (up
Dollars 1 at Dollars 84 7/8 on the NYSE). Under the terms of the venture,
Motorola will buy a 20 per cent stake in In Focus at Dollars 10 a share.
Canada
TORONTO finished firmer after quiet trading. The TSE 300 index gained 18.1
at 3,403.7 and rises led falls by 303 to 229 on volume of 23m shares.
Banking stocks again were solidly higher on the positive report from Goldman
Sachs, with the financial services index up 1.67 per cent.
Republic Waste Industries, off CDollars  3/4 at CDollars 8 7/8 , said a
California court has issued an adverse verdict in connection with a lawsuit
involving Republic and GI Industries. Republic said a hearing will be held
soon to determine damages, but it planned to appeal against any damage
award.

FT  21 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Changes planned at Embassy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Embassy Property, the USM-quoted property developer, housebuilder and
construction group, is proposing a share placing, a rights issue and a
restructuring of group borrowings.
The placing is of 56m new ordinary shares at 5p to raise Pounds 2.5m net
which will result in a change of control of the company. The 3-for-4 rights
issue of 5.73m shares at 5p will raise some Pounds 280,000.
The directors are of the opinion that the proposals will place Embassy in a
position to take new opportunities which will arise in the commercial
property market over the next two to three years.

FT  21 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Bellwinch cuts losses to Pounds 98,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bellwinch, the Wembley-based builder which finalised its reconstruction in
January, reduced pre-tax losses to Pounds 98,000 in the year to June 30.
The company said the five-month delay meant that interest costs of Pounds
595,000 (Pounds 2.68m) depressed the final result, which compared with a
Pounds 15m deficit last time. A tax credit of Pounds 113,000 resulted in a
net profit of Pounds 15,000 this time.
The exceptional item of Pounds 14,000 (Pounds 11.8m) reflects the over-run
on the reconstruction costs.

330,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Kode International more than doubled profits in the 26 weeks to June 26 and
has restored some of the previous cut in the dividend payment.
The electronics and computer services group raised the pre-tax figure from
Pounds 126,000 to Pounds 330,000 on sales up 29 per cent at Pounds 9.64m.
The interim dividend is been raised by 0.5p to 1.5p on earnings of 2.7p
(0.6p). In 1991, when profits were hit by redundancy and compensation costs,
the overall dividend was reduced by 3.5p to 4p.
There is no payment due on the shares created by the rights offer in July to
finance the acquisition of DCM Services. The directors said yesterday that
the two companies should be integrated by the year end.

FT  21 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Reduced deficit at JW Spear
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JW Spear, the Enfield-based toys and games manufacturer, reported sharply
reduced losses in its seasonally unfavourable first half.
Losses before tax were Pounds 315,000 for the six months to June 30, down
from Pounds 638,000 at the same stage of 1991. The group, famed for its
Scrabble game, achieved profits of Pounds 2.53m pre-tax in the full 1991
year.
The outcome reflected lower interest payable of Pounds 5,000 (Pounds
125,000). Turnover was marginally lower at Pounds 8.28m as France proved a
'lacklustre' market following the impact of video games, said Mr Francis
Spear, chairman.
Losses per share were cut to 5.78p (8.19p) and the interim dividend goes up
to 2.5p (2p).

<TEXT>
T Clarke, the south London-based electrical services group, suffered a 44
per cent contraction in profits for the six months to June 30.
Directors blamed the fall - from Pounds 1.2m to Pounds 672,207 pre-tax  - on
reduced interest receivable and increased bad debt provisions of Pounds
120,776 (Pounds 16,582).
Turnover dipped to Pounds 30.1m (Pounds 33m) and is expected to fall
slightly in the second half. Earnings per share emerged at 3.404p, down from
6.135p, but the interim dividend is maintained at 1.26p.

Pre-tax profits of Lec Refrigeration, a maker of refrigeration equipment and
associated products, fell by 54 per cent to Pounds 320,00 for the six months
to June 30.
The deepening recession hit sales which fell to Pounds 19.3m (Pounds 24.2m).
However, actions previously taken to contain production costs ensured that
the company stayed in profit.
Earnings per share were cut to 3.54p (7.75p) but the interim dividend is
held at 4p.
The new 'turbo' larder refrigerators introduced in June had been well
received, directors said, and they hoped to increase market share in the
second half. However, they expected no overall improvement until there was a
recovery in the housing market.

Applied Holographics, the USM-quoted maker of hot stamping foils and
embossed holograms, cut pre-tax losses by Pounds 1m to Pounds 1.62m for the
year to March 31. Turnover fell from Pounds 5.19m to Pounds 4.89m.
Mr David Mahony, chairman, said that a significant contributor to last
time's loss was the US subsidiary, Applied Holographics Corp, which was a
cash drain on the company. That company was now jointly-owned with CFC
International, a Chicago-based foil and coating company, and has been
renamed CFC Applied Holographics. It was now trading at break-even, Mr
Mahony said.
The foil company, Transfer All Purpose Foils, continued to maintain market
share in depressed conditions both in the UK and continental Europe, he
said.
Losses per share were 9.1p (17.3p restated).

WYEVALE Garden Centres yesterday reported a 40 per cent increase in pre-tax
profits, from Pounds 2.2m to Pounds 3.09m, in the six months to June 30.
Turnover of this USM-quoted group, helped by the integration of the
Cramphorn garden centres, increased by Pounds 8.68m to Pounds 20.3m.
Like-for-like sales from the Wyevale centres, taking out the effect of the
Cramphorn acquisition, showed a 3.1 per cent improvement. Net operating
margins increased from 16.9 per cent to 17.5 per cent.
Mr Christopher Powell, chairman, said the anticipated post-election upturn
had failed to materialise in a sustained manner, and trading conditions
remained extremely tough.
As a result of the Cramphorn acquisition, current levels of debt were higher
than previously experienced. However, the group remained in a strong
financial position, with gearing of 40 per cent at the period end, he added.
Basic earnings per share were unchanged at 7.3p. Fully diluted earnings
increased slightly from 6.8p to 7p. The interim dividend is maintained at
2.48p.

FT  21 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Forced to prove the efficacy of its formula
 -After a period of rapid growth Medeva's strategy is under the spotlight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAS THE music stopped for Medeva, one of the newest and most intriguing
additions to the exclusive club of world pharmaceutical companies?
As recently as last March, with its share price riding near 300p and a
runaway stock market rating, Medeva had its eyes firmly fixed on joining the
FT-SE 100 by the middle of the decade, less than six years after it was
founded.
Five months later, a significant brake has been applied to the Medeva
merry-go-round. At one point last week, Medeva's share price had halved to
150p - though it has subsequently bounced to 175p - and its market
capitalisation had fallen to just over Pounds 330m.
Acquisitions backed by the issue of shares have been put on the back burner
and the company is being forced to prove, earlier than expected, that it can
generate the organic growth it has promised.
Medeva's management, led by Mr Bernard Taylor, former chief executive of
Glaxo, and Mr Ian Gowrie-Smith, a successful Australian financial engineer,
has consistently followed a neat and compelling game plan.
In their first two years they began buying companies and mature drug
portfolios from large groups such as Wellcome, with the chunkiest
acquisitions financed by the issue of highly-rated shares. Because the
assets Medeva acquired were on much lower ratings, each acquisition
automatically enhanced earnings, even before the benefits of any operational
synergies.
At the same time, Medeva has been looking for companies that would push it
into international markets. And finally, it has started its own development
effort by acquiring drugs that other companies have taken close to the
registration stage.
While this plan has not changed, the market has clearly had second thoughts.
US disenchantment with the health care sector is partly to blame, as the
fall in the number of shares held in American Depositary Receipt form
suggests. And a self-fulfilling downward spin may have developed; investors
who were looking for heady acquisition-driven growth may have sold as it
became increasingly unlikely that Medeva would issue paper as its shares
fell.
More seriously, however, sceptics say Medeva may be an echo of some racy
1980s companies that ground to a halt when they were no longer able to
maintain their high ratings.
The spotlight is therefore firmly fixed on Medeva's interim results in
September when investors will get a better picture of organic growth from
the 10 acquisitions to date.
Mr Taylor accepts that the share price fall has temporarily ruled out the
issue of paper and that this will limit the pace and size of acquisitions.
But it will only slow, rather than halt, the transition to a viable
medium-sized pharmaceutical company within the next three to four years, the
chief executive says.
To reach that critical mass - sales of about Pounds 500m, compared with
Pounds 82m last year - Mr Taylor says Medeva probably needs to add two or
three more product areas to its vaccines, pain management and respiratory
products businesses.
It also needs to expand internationally, particularly in the US, which is
likely to be its largest market as it has decided not to try to break into
Japan, Germany, France and Italy. The likely route will be to buy small
companies with sales forces. It will also need to buy more development
products that are in the late stage of clinical development, like the
hepatitis B technology bought in March.
But with new share issues temporarily ruled out and the company
uncomfortable about higher gearing after it bought International Medical
Systems of the US largely for debt in June, cash from operations becomes
Medeva's main source of acquisition finance.
'There is a prolongation of risk,' says Mr Taylor. But it does not mean
Medeva has run into the buffers.
Investors, he says, have focused too much on the group's acquisitions and
not enough on its organic growth potential and the quality of its
pharmaceutical management. 'What we have to do is show that we are building
a pharmaceutical company through acquisitions; we are not acquiring
companies that happen to be pharmaceutical companies,' he says. 'Perhaps it
is not recognised that the majority of our directors are the salt of the
pharmaceutical earth.'
One obvious blot on the Medeva copybook is its involvement in unbranded
generic drugs, a fiercely competitive business which still accounts for a
large, though decreasing percentage of sales.
But analysts are also wary about the quality of earnings from unbranded
generics, a part of Medeva Mr Taylor does want to remain in long-term.
Not that forecasts of pre-tax profits have changed very much between the
peak of Medeva's share price in March and the recent low; pre-tax profits
forecasts range at about Pounds 36m for the year to December, more than
double that of 1991 because of the effect of acquisitions.
'But there is a debate about what sort of rating you should give to a stock
like this,' says one sector analyst. Medeva's purchase of a range of smaller
and older drugs which are not followed as closely as blockbusters such as
Zantac, means investors have to take much more about its markets on trust
from the company.
'It's getting harder to extrapolate how much security of earnings you have
got in there,' the broker says.
September's interims may hold some of the answers. And a sharp share price
recovery would re-open the market for new issues. But until Medeva has
attained a greater critical mass, investors must be prepared to be subjected
to a bumpy ride.

FT  21 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Prolific likely to part with its troubled
Danish parent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROLIFIC INSURANCE, the UK life insurance and unit trust company, has had an
uneasy home since it was acquired in 1989 by Hafnia, the troubled Danish
insurer.
Hafnia paid Pounds 90m - widely felt at the time to be overspending - for
what had been part of Provincial and Prolific, a company for which the
economist John Maynard Keynes had worked as a fund manag-er.
The price, however, at 50 times historic earnings, was in retrospect too
much for a company which has seen its funds under management shrink since
then.
It is currently managing about Pounds 900m, about Pounds 350m of which are
the assets of its largely unit-linked policy holders.
The bulk of its other funds are stand-alone unit trusts sold under the aegis
of its Prolific Unit Trust and Prolific International companies.
Hafnia is believed to be in talks to find a buyer for its stand-alone
insurance company but that it was unlikely to achieve a price along the
lines it paid three years ago.
Yesterday Prolific went to pains to point out that it was structurally
insulated from the difficulties facing its parent. 'Prolific's operations
are structured so that the investments are all held by trustees or
custodians and the assets are therefore totally protected,' it said in a
statement.
'Prolific's regulators in the UK, Imro, have been kept informed of the
Danish developments and are happy with the position as it relates to the UK
companies.'
According to returns filed with the Department of Trade and Industry for the
year ended December 31 1991, Prolific had a regulatory solvency margin of
roughly 8 per cent, twice the minimum set by the DTI.
With a required minimum margin of Pounds 6.6m, Prolific had assets valued at
Pounds 13.3m.
Analysts said that Hafnia would not have been able to gain access to
Prolific's excess capital without conducting a time-consuming revaluation
and that it was unlikely to have done so since the returns were filed.
The returns also show that inter-company loans made by Prolific were
actually reduced in 1991, from Pounds 1.2m to Pounds 500,000. The DTI
returns do not specify whether the loans were to Hafnia or to any other
entity.
Hafnia said that the unit trusts had never held the shares of Hafnia or of
any of its main shareholders.
Ironically, analysts point out, a Hafnia fire sale of the company may well
improve Prolific's fortunes.
Although it ranks at best 40th among UK insurers in size, it still has an
attractive franchise.
Its unit trusts are sold largely through independent financial advisers and
are offered through some of the largest chains. Without its troubled parent
Prolific's prospects might well improve.
'Its been very frustrating for us because the investment performance has
been very good but the headlines have been dominated by the troubles of our
Danish parent,' said one Prolific fund manager.
According to the latest figures from Micropal, the unit trust performance
measurement service, 10 out of Prolific's 13 unit trusts rank in the top
half of the performance league and seven of these rank in the top 25 per
cent.

FT  21 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Expamet rises 22% to Pounds 2.45m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Expamet International rose 48 per cent yesterday from a nadir of
29p to 43p on news of a 22 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds
2.01m to Pounds 2.45m in the first half of 1992 and a halving of the interim
dividend to 2.09p. As recently as June 12 the shares had stood at 152p.
They had tumbled as inflated profits - overstated by Pounds 1m disguising a
fall into losses - were discovered in early April in Brema-Air, the Dutch
ducting subsidiary described by Mr John Roberts, group chairman since July
22, as 'a contracting company with no chiefs'.
'With a weak balance sheet, we couldn't manage it out,' he said, and so, in
June, Brema-Air was sold.
The company took an Pounds 9.2m extraordinary charge (Pounds 445,000) of
which Pounds 8.6m was for the Dutch sale.
A Pounds 4.8m write-off for goodwill in the profit and loss account resulted
in a Pounds 3.8m, or 20 per cent, fall in shareholders' funds to Pounds
15.2m.
With borrowings at Pounds 23m, gearing therefore rose from 45 to 150 per
cent. Mr Roberts said the dividend cut was 'to conserve cash'. His target is
to reduce borrowings to Pounds 12m by the year-end and gearing to below 40
per cent as soon as possible.
Turnover of the security components, hydraulic engineering and metal
building products group, was down at Pounds 70.9m (Pounds 76.2m). Operating
profits dipped to Pounds 4.16m (Pounds 4.77m). However a 36 per cent
reduction in interest charges to Pounds 1.44m (Pounds 2.25m) and lower
exceptional charges for redundancies of Pounds 270,000 (Pounds 510,000)
produced the pre-tax surplus.
Earnings, now covering the halved dividend, grew to 2.8p (2.75p).
COMMENT
The share price rise suggests the pessimists behind its recent freefall have
been silenced by these better-than-expected results. However, reducing
borrowings from Pounds 23m to Pounds 12m will be difficult. Some Pounds
2m-Pounds 3m could come from retained profits and lower working capital but
the balance will have to come from non-core disposals in a buyers' market.
Getting gearing down below 40 per cent in 1993 depends more on general
economic factors - a small rise in trading volumes can quickly boost profits
in a group with high operational gearing. Expamet looks healthier with its
new chairman and the Dutch problems swiftly resolved. New products in its
sound businesses are likely to have a positive impact soon. Forecast
full-year pre-tax profits of about Pounds 5.5m give earnings of 6.3p per
share and an undemanding prospective p/e of 6.8. The shares look good value
now. They will prove better value if the borrowings hurdle can be cleared.

Independent Newspapers, the Irish publishing group headed by Mr Tony
O'Reilly, announced a 35 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from IPounds
5.2m to IPounds 7m (Pounds 6.6m) for the half year to June 30.
Turnover rose by 4 per cent to IPounds 77.4m (IPounds 74.5m).
Mr O'Reilly said the result reflected improved margins in the Irish
publishing operations which had come from circulation increases, advertising
market share improvements, and introduction of new technology.
He said the group had also recently acquired a 2 per cent stake in the
Mirror Group.
Earnings per share rose by 29 per cent to 16.2p (12.6p) and an interim
dividend of 5.5p (5p) is declared.

FT  21 AUG 92 / UK Company News: European growth lifts Rentokil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN expansion helped Rentokil, the environmental and property group,
report a 21 per cent growth in pre-tax profits for the six months to June
30.
The rise - from Pounds 42.3m to Pounds 51.1m - was further boosted by a
strong performance from environmental services, including pest control,
healthcare and tropical plant maintenance.
Mr Clive Thompson, chief executive, said that with about 55 per cent of
profits generated outside the UK the group would continue to meet its
promise of annual earnings growth of 20 per cent.
'We are not limited by a single market such as a large supermarket chain in
the UK. We have the opportunity to grow . . . in every significant market in
the world.'
Overall sales increased to Pounds 210.4m (Pounds 191.8m). Environmental
services generated Pounds 181.9m (Pounds 163.5m) with property services
accounting for Pounds 28.5m (Pounds 28.2m).
The biggest growth occurred in Europe with sales of Pounds 61.8m (Pounds
51.9m) and pre-tax profits of Pounds 14.3m (Pounds 11m).
Mr Thompson said: 'We started from a lower base and were helped by some
strategic acquisitions. The recession has not affected the Continent as
badly as the UK.'
In spite of the economic downturn in the UK the group reported sales of
Pounds 86.4m (Pounds 80.5m) and increased pre-tax profits of Pounds 22.2m
(Pounds 19m).
Asia Pacific and Africa saw sales rise to Pounds 41.4m (Pounds 37.3m) and
pre-tax profits increase to Pounds 9.62m (Pounds 8.93m).
North America was the only market to report a fall in sales with turnover
down from Pounds 22.1m to Pounds 20.9m, mainly because of the weakness of
the dollar. Pre-tax profits were little changed at Pounds 3.3m.
Mr Thompson said net cash of Pounds 39.8m enabled the group to consider more
acquisitions throughout the world. 'The recession has meant that there are
more companies to select from when looking at acquisitions'.
Interest income increased to Pounds 1.77m (Pounds 197,000).
Earnings and dividends per share were 3.351p (2.785p) and 0.64p (0.532p)
respectively, after adjusting for a share split in May.

FT  21 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Alfred McAlpine falls Pounds 71,000 into
red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEPRESSED house prices and recession in the construction industry almost
wiped out operating profits at Alfred McAlpine, which fell from Pounds 4.7m
to Pounds 879,000 in the six months to April 30.
But a reduced interest charge of Pounds 950,000 (Pounds 4.01m), helped by
the proceeds of last year's Pounds 39m rights issue, contained the pre-tax
loss to Pounds 71,000, compared with a profit of Pounds 700,000 last time.
Turnover slipped to Pounds 250m (Pounds 254.8m).
Construction recorded an operating loss of Pounds 300,000 (Pounds 4.2m
profit) although turnover fell only slightly to Pounds 164.4m (Pounds
175.9m). There were redundancy costs of Pounds 500,000.
Housebuilding improved to an operating profit of Pounds 1.4m (nil) and 469
units (393) were sold. But average prices fell 5 per cent to Pounds 83,000.
The company has 3,500 plots with planning consent, with an average purchase
cost of Pounds 22,000, and margins are improving as more expensive sites
acquired in the late 1980s are developed.
McAlpine is buying the 40 per cent minority stake it does not already own in
the housebuilding division from the founding Grove family. The group will
pay a mixture of cash, shares and loan notes for the stake, which is valued
at about Pounds 18m at yesterday's closing price. There is also an earnout
consideration based on average profits in the three-and-a-half years to
October 1995.
Minerals made operating profits of Pounds 800,000 (Pounds 1.6m) while the US
division reported unchanged profits of Pounds 500,000.
Earnings fell to 0.2p (2.8p). The interim dividend is cut to 3p (4.5p).
There was a retained loss of Pounds 1.29m (Pounds 380,000).
COMMENT
Shareholders who applauded the 1990 appointment of Mr Graeme Odgers to
energise McAlpine may be having second thoughts. Yesterday's was the second
dividend cut he has implemented. Assuming the final payment is similarly
scaled back, this year's total of 6.5p compares with 16.1p before his
appointment. Meanwhile, those who subscribed for rights last year at 225p
have already lost more than half their money. Undoubtedly, recession takes
much of the blame. But it is difficult to see any short-term release from
the pain. With construction looking grim until 1994 at least, housing is
crucial to McAlpine's recovery prospects. There is scope for more margin
improvements as costly land is replaced, and the company's plans to increase
volumes 10 per cent each year may be successful. But what McAlpine and many
others really need is rising new house prices, and that has already been
ruled out until 1993. Profit forecasts for this year have been scaled back
to Pounds 6m, putting the shares on an unappealing 14 times.

FT  21 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Wellcome share issue expanded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROBERT FLEMING, the merchant bank which organised the global sale of shares
in Wellcome, the drugs group, on behalf of the Wellcome Trust, last night
decided to exercise part of its 'green shoe' option, effectively increasing
the size of the issue.
An extra 18m shares are expected to be sold by the Trust, a medical charity,
taking the total sold to 288m. The extra shares, being sold at the 800p
issue price, will raise another Pounds 144m for the Trust before expenses.
The extra shares sold will cut the Trust's remaining stake in the company to
40 per cent. Before the sale in July it held 73.5 per cent.
At the same time Fleming is stopping stabilisation of the Wellcome share
price. In the sale, Fleming over-alloted 40.5m shares, 15 per cent of the
shares sold. It could then buy shares up to this level, in order to create a
stable share price in the after-market, without reducing the sale size.
Fleming could then use the 'green shoe' option of buying extra shares from
the Trust to satisfy any remaining over-allotment.
For some time after the sale was concluded in late July Fleming supported
the price at 800p. But falls in the stock market put pressure on the share
price, and on August 10 and 11 Fleming was forced to buy back substantial
amounts of shares.
On August 12 it cut its stabilisation bid to 780p and to 777p on August 13.
However, other buyers then appeared for Wellcome shares, and since then the
share price has risen without Fleming buying shares in its capacity as
stabilisation manager.
Yesterday the Wellcome share price rose 10p to 802p.

FT  21 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Vivat 26% higher at Pounds 1.18m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VIVAT HOLDINGS, the Lee Cooper jeans and casual wear manufacturer which has
bounced in and out of the red in the last three years, yesterday reported
pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.18m for the six months to June 30.
That compared with a profit of Pounds 934,000 for the comparable period 12
months earlier and with a Pounds 678,000 loss for the full 1991 year.
The 26 per cent profits improvement was struck on turnover down 29 per cent
to Pounds 35.6m. However, discontinued operations accounted for Pounds 7.4m
of the sales decline.
Mr Christopher Burnett, chairman, said he expected the group to report a
positive result in the second half.
'I sincerely hope my shareholders do not have any other nasty shocks,' he
said.
Nonetheless, he remained cautious and the interim dividend is again passed.
However, he 'very much hoped' that the company would be able to recommend a
final - the company's last payment was a 0.5p final for the 1990 year.
Mr Burnett said the advance in interim profits had been achieved by
withdrawing from the loss-making operation in Germany and lower interest
charges.
He added that the group had reduced overheads by some Pounds 1.2m this year,
helping margins to rise by 2 to 3 points.
On-going businesses had actually suffered from the extent of recession,
particularly in France, Vivat's largest market.
Mr Burnett said the French clothing market alone had declined by 13 per cent
in June compared to the previous year.
Sales in continuing operations declined by 17 per cent, while similar
operating profits fell from Pounds 3.2m to Pounds 2.4m. The discontinued
operations incurred losses of Pounds 752,000 in the first half of 1991.
Profits were buoyed by a Pounds 275,000 reduction in interest charges to
Pounds 1.2m. Gearing, which had been 73 per cent at the December year-end,
fell to 63 per cent.
No provisions were expected to be made in the current year. However, Vivat
was still seeking to resolve the guarantees surrounding properties sold in
1988 to Chelsea Man, which has since gone into receivership. Mr Burnett said
the group's Pounds 4m provision last year was expected to cover any costs
arising from properties.
Earnings per share rose from 1.4p to 1.6p.

FT  21 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Ferromet accounts qualified
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 1991 accounts of Ferromet Group, the USM-quoted metals trader, have been
heavily qualified by Touche Ross, the group's auditor.
The company's shares have been languishing at  1/2 p since July 17.
In its report TR said: 'We are unable to form an opinion as to whether the
financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the affairs
of the company and the group at December 31 1991 . . . and whether the
financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985.'
The qualification hinged on uncertainty over Ferromet Resources Inc, the
group's principal operating subsidiary in the US which was placed into
Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings on March 17.
This followed Ferromet Resources Inc's sale at the end of 1991 of Ferromet
Resources (UK) and Ferromet Alloys, its two UK subsidiaries, to Ferromet
Group, a transaction which, in view of the Chapter 11 proceedings, may be
reversed. TR stated that it could 'express no opinion as to whether the
going concern basis (of the group) is appropriate in these circumstances'.
Following the problems at Ferromet Resources Inc, the group's profit and
loss account for 1991 showed retained losses of Pounds 12.2m (profit Pounds
642,000) and its consolidated balance sheet showed negative shareholders'
funds of Pounds 6.39m, a turnround of Pounds 12.8m.
However, Mr David Hillel, finance director, pointed to the pro forma
consolidated balance sheet in the accounts for the 'comparatively clean'
rump of the group - Portsmouth Metals, the Bermuda-based metals trader, and
Clogau (Nevada), a gold mine. Net assets here were Pounds 1.8m.
Mr Roger Wain, who moved up from non-executive to executive chairman on
August 10, said he was still seeking a partner to invest cash and/or
businesses into the rump. Portsmouth had been profitable in the first half
of 1992, and he was looking for a joint venture partner for Clogau.
To sever ties between this rump and the Chapter 11 companies, provisions of
Pounds 4.68m were taken. Mr Wain said that creditors' claims on the Chapter
11 companies could not be demanded of the parent group.
Mr Larry Whyte, the chief executive, who brought Ferromet Resources Inc into
the group and attempted a management buy-out in March 1991, is now to leave
the group. He and the board have agreed that the group's claims on him and
his on the group will be dropped, subject to shareholders' approval.

<TEXT>
Waste Management International, the UK-quoted group, is to buy a majority
stake in Sweden's state-owned hazardous waste company for SKr340m (Pounds
34m).
The UK-based provider of waste and environmental services is acquiring 90.1
per cent of Svensk Avfallskonvertering (Sakab), which treats about 33,000
tons of hazardous waste per year.
Mr Joe Holsten, WMI's vice-president of acquisitions, said: 'This is part of
our strategy of increasing our ability of collecting and delivering
hazardous waste. We are looking at further European acquisitions.'
Waste Management International is part of Waste Management. The
Chicago-based parent group sold 20 per cent of the UK company in a Pounds
405m global share offering in April.
It said it would use the proceeds to exploit opportunities arising from
tightening environmental regulations.
In 1991 Sakab reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.35m on sales of Pounds
14.1m. It also has undeveloped permits for solvent distillation, solvent
separation and pre-treatment of waste oils.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S Reichmann family is willing to give up voting control of Olympia &amp;
York Developments as part of a restructuring plan for the ailing Canadian
real estate developer.
Outlining proposals made to 27 different groups of creditors, senior O&amp;Y
officials also disclosed yesterday that the Reichmanns have offered to
contribute their directly held 20 per cent stake in O&amp;Y's US operations to
the restructured parent company, as well as a number of Canadian properties
owned by the family.
Further details of the offers to creditors will be submitted to an Ontario
court today, although in some cases only general principles will be
disclosed.
Mr Gerald Greenwald, O&amp;Y's president, and Mr Steve Miller, the company's
chief financial adviser, said that O&amp;Y is 'very close' to reaching
agreements in principle with lenders to five of the company's 11 major
projects in Canada.
They said that substantial progress had been made with another four groups.
Creditors have generally been less optimistic about the course of the
negotiations.
Mr Paul Reichmann has organised a group willing to invest Pounds 350m
(Dollars 668.5m) in the Canary Wharf project in London's Docklands.
Mr Greenwald said that discussions were continuing with the project's
administrators, lenders and the investor group.
Negotiations are also continuing with lenders to US operations, which are
not included in the court protection orders sought by O&amp;Y in Canada and the
UK last May.
Mr Greenwald said that completion of the US negotiations was likely to take
'several more months'.
The latest restructuring proposal envisages no new credit lines. Under the
plan, all creditors, other than those with loans to specific projects and
joint ventures, would participate in O&amp;Y's equity.
Initially, 49 per cent of the company's equity would be distributed.
This could rise to 80 per cent under a proposal that unsecured creditors
exchange their claims for bonds convertible into additional common shares
after five years.

FT  21 AUG 92 / Credit insurer sees no upturn yet: Trade Indemnity is still
not optimistic about a short-term UK recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADE INDEMNITY, the leading trade credit insurer which closely mirrors the
strength of the UK economy in its performance, offered businesses little
hope for short-term recovery as it announced interim results yesterday.
Mr Victor Jacob, managing director, said: 'Regrettably we cannot at this
stage be optimistic. There will be an upturn at the earliest in spring 1993,
and when it comes it will be slow and it will be tentative.'
Trade Indemnity unveiled net claims down 14 per cent to Pounds 27.7m in the
six months to June 30 and passed its dividend, in better-than-expected
results.
Provisions were Pounds 8.2m compared with Pounds 37.7m on the same period
last year, while estimated underwriting losses for continuing operations
were sharply downward, from Pounds 31.7m for the 1990 underwriting year to
Pounds 9.4m for 1991.
The results, which were unexpectedly brought forward by several weeks as
part of a new management strategy, had little effect on the share price,
which has fallen sharply during the year. It closed down 1p at 21p on the
day.
Mr Jacob said he believed the company's own performance would improve
regardless of the extent of wider economic recovery. 'We would hope that
1992 will be rather better than 1991. We would be disappointed if we didn't
see a major turnaround.'
The change reflected the company's action to toughen underwriting procedures
and raise premiums, as well as its clients adopting tighter credit control
procedures, conducting less business or no longer taking out insurance.
Mr Jacob said the number of claims for which Trade Indemnity had made
provisions had fallen to 8,100 in the first six months of the year at an
average of Pounds 6,300 each. This compared with 9,400 at Pounds 8,250 each
for the same period last year. Gross premium income rose 2.3 per cent to
Pounds 69.7m, and gross claims were down by 11 per cent to Pounds 72.2m.
The company also announced that Mr Tony Brend, chief executive of Commercial
Union, is to join the board, and will take over as non-executive chairman on
the retirement of Mr Peter Dugdale next year.
Mr Jacob said competition for business had intensified, particularly from
Dutch and Belgian insurers, but Trade Indemnity still held more than
four-fifths of UK trade credit insurance.

FT  21 AUG 92 / Willis Corroon profits fall 22%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER

<TEXT>
RECESSION, further reductions in insurance rates in the US and lower
interest rates have combined to depress profitability at Willis Corroon, the
UK's largest insurance broker, which yesterday announced a 22 per cent fall
in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 54.1m.
Although earnings per share fell to 8.3p compared with 10.9p last year,
Willis announced a maintained dividend at 6.6p per share. The shares fell
16p to close at 170p.
Mr Roger Elliott, executive chairman, said conditions in the US, which
generates about 40 per cent of the group's revenue, were the 'worst for many
years'.
He said reductions in premium rates on policies renewed by Willis in the US
averaged 14 per cent. He said the group had been surprised by a sharp fall
in the volume of its business. Recession was leading Willis's clients to
reduce their demand for insurance.
Brokerage and fee revenue in the first half of 1992 grew 5 per cent to
Pounds 319.6m, compared with Pounds 312.7m a year ago.
However, the rise reflects the contribution of affiliates and subsidiaries
acquired in the past 12 months. Willis said it had invested Pounds 32m in
acquiring a network of brokers in Canada and western Europe.
On an underlying basis revenue was unchanged. Expenses rose to Pounds 281.4m
from Pounds 256.5m and by 3 per cent on an underlying basis.
Mr Elliott said that as well as additional costs of new operations, expenses
were incurred in making redundancy payments. When completed Willis's job
reduction programme would yield 'substantial full-year savings'.
The group has stepped up investment in its head office operations.
Underwriting claims at the group's insurance subsidiaries fell to Pounds
11.5m from Pounds 22.4m.
Interest payable rose to Pounds 2.6m from Pounds 2.3m. Share of profit of
associated undertakings was up to Pounds 3.9m from Pounds 3m.
The figures indicate that Willis, like its major international competitors,
Sedgwick of the UK, and Alexander &amp; Alexander and Marsh McLennan of the US
is struggling to increase revenues. On Tuesday Sedgwick announced a fall in
pre-tax profits to Pounds 51.7m compared with Pounds 65.3m at the half-way
stage last year.

FT  21 AUG 92 / OTC sales prove addictive: Why US and European drug
companies are switching products from prescription to over-the-counter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NON-prescription over-the-counter (OTC) medicines are proving addictive for
drugs companies. By switching a drug from prescription to OTC status, sales
can be multiplied by more than five.
Take Gyne-Lotrimin, a virtually unknown prescription anti-fungal medicine
for vaginal infections marketed by Schering-Plough.
After receiving an OTC licence from the US Food and Drug Administration, the
US group launched a Dollars 30m (Pounds 15.7m) publicity campaign involving
20 women's magazines and coast-to-coast television advertising. Sales
increased from Dollars 22m in 1990 to Dollars 115m in 1991.
Monistat 7, another anti-fungal product launched by Johnson &amp; Johnson after
Gyne-Lotrimin, has done even better.
Analysts believe the two OTC medicines could eventually enjoy combined sales
of Dollars 1bn a year.
Given the success of these drugs, which had had only limited success as
prescription products, groups with so-called 'blockbuster' prescription
drugs, are now planning similar switches. SmithKline Beecham, which this
week announced a partnership in the US OTC market with Marion Merrell Dow,
has asked the FDA for Tagamet, its best-selling drug with sales of more than
Dollars 1bn, to have OTC status.
A stampede of more than 50 applications for prescription drugs to become OTC
products is likely in the US over the next three to five years, according to
the US Nonprescription Drug Manufacturers Association.
The accelerating pace of OTC applications is being driven by the large
number of successful prescription products whose patents are expiring during
the next five years.
Typically, when a medicine loses patent protection, competition from
unpatented generic drugs knock sales by as much as 50 per cent in two years.
But by selling the product over the counter, a group can extend the revenue
stream of its top-selling former prescription medicines.
At the same time, regulatory authorities are proving increasingly eager to
licence prescription products for OTC use, says Mr John Walden, senior
vice-president of the Nonprescription Drug Manufacturers Association.
The main reason is cost. In the US, a prescription product will set back
patients, on average, Dollars 24. They also spend about Dollars 40 for a
prescription visit to the doctor, explains Mr Walden. In contrast, OTC
medicines cost on average Dollars 4. The combination of more sympathetic
regulatory environment and the desire of pharmaceuticals groups to exploit
the market means American OTC sales could increase from Dollars 11.6bn this
year to as much as Dollars 28bn by 2010, according to Kline &amp; Co, a
New-Jersey market research group.
Meanwhile, the highly fragmented European OTC sector is set to grow by about
15 per cent over the next three years, according to Mr James Dudley, of JMD,
the High Wycombe-based consultants.
He estimates it is currently worth about Dollars 6.8bn a year. European
governments are proving increasingly anxious to contain their healthcare
expenditure. They are encouraging the switch from prescription products -
which are reimbursed by the state - to OTC products which are paid for by
the patient, Mr Dudley says.
Pharmaceuticals groups, which previously were busy moving out of the market
because OTC medicines had lower margins than prescription products and also
required significant advertising spending, are now positioning themselves to
exploit this fast-growing sector.
SmithKline Beecham's OTC partnership with Marion Merrell Dow announced this
week is only the latest of a series of alliances.
Fast-moving consumer goods companies are teaming up with prescription
medicine groups. The consumer groups know that all but one of the top 15 OTC
medicines launched in the US since 1975 have been former prescription
products. The pharmaceuticals companies know most of them do not have the
mass-marketing expertise to exploit their medicines fully.
Procter &amp; Gamble, the US's leading OTC company, formed a marketing alliance
in 1987 with the pharmaceuticals group Syntex. Johnson &amp; Johnson, the second
largest OTC group, formed an agreement in 1989 with another pharmaceuticals
group Merck to develop and develop OTC products.
Restructuring is also occurring in Europe. In 1991, Switzerland's Hoffman-La
Roche paid Sara Lee, the US group, Dollars 821m for Nicholas, its European
OTC subsidiary.
Meanwhile, Wellcome, the UK drugs group, has publicly said it is seeking a
partner for its OTC products, probably in Europe. The company has just
received an OTC licence in Germany, the world's third largest market, to
sell Zovirax, its best-selling herpes drug.
One factor that could hold back the switch from prescription to OTC is the
issue of safety. While the FDA is keen to encourage the shift, it is also
anxious not to license potentially dangerous drugs.
Marion Merrell Dow was planning to ask the FDA this year for an OTC licence
for Seldane, its best-selling anti-histamine. But its application received a
setback last month when the FDA said there had been at least four deaths and
at least 70 cases of serious cardiovascular problems associated with
Seldane.
If pharmaceuticals groups can convince regulatory authorities that their
drugs are safe in the public's hands, they could be set to exploit a
lucrative market.

FT  21 AUG 92 / McAlpine shares fall after cut in payout
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Alfred McAlpine fell 22p to 101p yesterday after the construction
and housebuilding company cut its interim dividend by a third and said
forecasts made earlier this year were now 'too optimistic'.
Mr Graeme Odgers, chief executive, said the construction market was
'severely depressed' and house prices continued to fall. As a result,
profits for the year will be lower than last year's Pounds 9.3m.
For the six months to April 30 McAlpine announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds
71,000 from a Pounds 700,000 profit, but said the traditionally-stronger
second half would be better. 'While I am deeply unhappy about the current
levels of profitability, I believe we are doing the right things,' Mr Odgers
said.
Costs are being controlled and staff numbers have fallen almost 15 per cent
since Mr Odgers, former managing director of British Telecom, started trying
to revitalise the previously family-run company in 1990.
Turnover fell to Pounds 250m from Pounds 254.8m, mainly due to lower
construction sales.
The company's workload has fallen 22 per cent and margins are dropping.
Redundancies, which are continuing, cost Pounds 500,000.
Housebuilding improved but still made pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.3m. More
houses were sold due to heavier marketing but average selling prices fell 5
per cent to Pounds 83,000. Margins are improving as expensive sites acquired
at the peak of the property market in the late 1980s are developed and sold.
The company saw little chance of a recovery in UK housing until next year.
McAlpine also announced it was buying the 40 per cent stake it does not
already own in the housebuilding division from the founding Grove family.
McAlpine will pay a mixture of cash, shares and loan notes for the stake,
valued at about Pounds 18m at yesterday's closing price. There is also a
deferred consideration based on average profits in the three and a half
years to October 1995.
Profits for the minerals division fell more than a half due to falling
aggregate prices. In the US, competition and reduced margins affected
construction.
Earnings per share fell to 0.2p from 2.8p. The interim dividend is cut to 3p
from 4.5p. Mr Odgers said the cut reflected the company's thinking for the
full year.

FT  21 AUG 92 / US group buys gas interests from Chevron to boost UK role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENRON EUROPE, a subsidiary of one of the largest gas companies in the US,
signalled its intention yesterday of becoming a significant player in the UK
gas market by purchasing substantial North Sea gas interests from Chevron
UK, the oil company.
The deal will allow Enron to market large quantities of gas to power
generators and big industrial users in north-east England, where it is
leading a consortium to build one of the largest power stations in the UK.
It already had plans to market surplus gas from this project.
Enron, a subsidiary of Enron Corporation, acquired Chevron's 25 per cent
share in the so-called J-Block, in the central North Sea, comprising the
Joanne and Judy fields. This will give it about 190bn cubic feet of gas and
12.5m barrels of natural gas liquids. The deal also provides for Enron to
purchase Chevron's 25 per cent interest in North Sea block 30/7b. The
purchase price was not disclosed.
'We view this as our first big step into the gas marketing and natural gas
liquids arena in the UK,' said Mr Raymond Kaskel, Enron's president and
chief operating officer.
Enron is building a 1,725 megawatt gas-fired power station at Imperial
Chemical Industries' Wilton site in Teesside, north-east England. The Pounds
800m plant is due to come into operation in April 1993.
Gas for the plant will be transported to Teesside from the Amoco-operated
Everest and Lomond fields in the North Sea via the new 255-mile Central Area
Transmission System (CATS) pipeline.
The interests acquired yesterday will be tied into the CATS pipeline and be
a big boost to Enron's marketing ambitions when the two fields, operated by
Phillips Petroleum, come on-stream, probably at the end of 1995.
According to an agreement with the Office of Fair Trading, British Gas, the
privatised former monopoly supplier, pledged to surrender 50 per cent of its
share of the industrial gas market to independent marketers by 1995. The
threshold above which consumers can buy gas from independents was also
recently lowered from 25,000 therms a year to 2,500 therms.
However, those agreements are being reviewed as part of a comprehensive
study of the UK gas market by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Mr Kaskel said Enron was keen to acquire other sources of gas but would
initially concentrate on marketing only to the biggest gas consumers. He
said Enron would later consider building its own pipelines and marketing to
smaller industrial and commercial consumers. 'We will use big consumers as
the base on which to expand our marketing activities,' Mr Kaskel said.

FT  21 AUG 92 / German economist warns of recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY is in danger of sliding into recession, one of the country's leading
economists said yesterday.
Professor Herbert Hax, chairman of the group of independent government
advisers known as the 'five wise men', said growth forecasts for 1992 could
not be met.
Mr Otto Lambsdorff, leader of the Free Democrats, the minority party in the
governing coalition, also warned that recession would be unavoidable if
financial, monetary and pay policies were not better integrated.
He said he did not believe this week's government forecasts of average 3 per
cent pan-German growth annually for the next five years. The assumptions on
which they were based were too optimistic, he added.
According to Prof Hax, the effects of the weakness of the dollar on exports
and of over-generous wage settlements on company profits had compounded
difficulties caused by the feebleness of the US recovery and the lack of
improvement in the UK.
Recession was not far away, he said in an interview to be published in
Handelsblatt, a business newspaper, this morning.
The warnings, which followed a steady and accelerating flow of gloomy
economic and corporate indicators, suggest a distinct change of mood. In
spite of mounting indications that Germany could not remain insulated
indefinitely from economic conditions elsewhere, establishment figures have
carefully avoided referring to recession.
The country's economic condition has consistently been described as a
'lull'. Senior officials at the Bundesbank said only last week that
recession was not a threat. Mr Lambsdorff's intervention, amounting to an
attack on the credibility of the economic ministry, came in the form of an
appeal for all efforts and investment to be directed towards rebuilding the
east.
If the west lost its economic strength, the east would suffer, he said. Wage
increases had to be held below productivity gains in the west. Pay deals
promising easterners parity by 1994 had to be be revised, and the Bundesbank
had to stick to its restrictive monetary policy. The economics ministry's
relatively up-beat medium-term forecasts were based on assumptions that wage
rises would slow, the international economy would recover, eastern European
markets would stabilise, the Gatt trade round would be concluded
successfully and state spending would be controlled.
On that basis, average annual growth between 1992 and 1996 would be 2.5 per
cent in the west and 9 per cent in the east.

FT  21 AUG 92 / French fighters to help US and Britain police Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE announced yesterday it would contribute about 10 fighter aircraft to
help police the air exclusion zone over southern Iraq which British and US
officials say will be proclaimed in the next few days.
As western officials worked out details of the 'no fly zone', the Baghdad
regime declared it would resist the plan 'with all means'.
Mr Pierre Joxe, the French defence minister, said his country was ready to
send to the Gulf about 10 Mirage 2000 fighters, the same type of aircraft
that participated in the Gulf war.
France already has eight Mirage fighters based in Turkey to enforce an air
exclusion zone in northern Iraq to protect Kurds from attack by Iraqi
forces.
Britain agreed on Tuesday to send six Tornado aircraft to the Gulf to help
enforce a security zone in the south to stop Iraqi aircraft from attacking
Shia Moslems in the region.
The US already has more than 200 combat, reconnaissance and control aircraft
in the Gulf area and the Pentagon says there are no plans to send extra
aircraft.
Britain and the US have denied there is any rift between the allies about
the 'no fly zone'.
General Brent Scowcroft, President Bush's national security adviser, said
the principle of the zone, designed to prevent Baghdad's forces striking the
Shia population south of the 32nd parallel, had been fully agreed.
Only the details - 'such as who does what, when' - remained to be sorted
out, Gen Scowcroft said.
US defence officials said the chances of a military confrontation would
depend partly on how tough a 'no fly zone' was imposed in southern Iraq.
'Is it going to be really stringent: 'you fly one inch in and we're going to
nail you' - or . . . 'we won't attack you unless you attack the Shia'?' one
official said.
US officials said the three allied governments agreed that their planned
action was fully covered by UN resolution 688 and that there was no
requirement to return to the Security Council for an additional mandate.
Gen Scowcroft claimed there was increasing evidence that President Saddam
Hussein was pursuing genocidal policies in southern Iraq.
Iraq's defiant response to the western allies' plan came after a meeting of
military and political leaders presided over by President Saddam.
The Baghdad statement said the Iraqi people and leadership would not allow
the 'design' against Iraq to come to pass. They would resist it 'with all
means'.

FT  21 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Sterling
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's German money supply figures show that monetary growth is
slowing, but only at a snail's pace. At the margin, that may lessen the risk
of a further rise in German interest rates. Further signs this week of
weakening demand in some sectors of the real economy may also give small
comfort to Germany's beleaguered ERM partners. But it is clear that the
monetary trend is much too strong for the Bundesbank's taste.
Certainly the market is in no mood to respond to any crumbs of comfort from
Frankfurt, and sterling finished the day at its lowest level against the
D-Mark since the pound entered the ERM. At present, though, the real fear in
traders' minds is the French referendum on Maastricht. Opinion polls which
increasingly show that a French 'no' vote is a real possibility increases
the strain on weak ERM members; if the monetary union project finally
unravels, the markets may lose faith altogether in current ERM parities. If
the French say 'non', and mortgage rates rise, Mr Lamont can look forward to
a lively reception at the Conservative conference.

FT  21 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Trade Indemnity
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The early release of interim results by Trade Indemnity set pulses racing.
In fact, the figures could have been worse. Aggressive rate increases and
tighter underwriting standards have reduced current year underwriting
provisions. Losses from discontinued business are also down, which implies
effective capping of exposure to commercial mortgage indemnity business.
However, TI remains hostage to the economic cycle. As the Bank of England
noted this week, insolvencies may continue to rise even in the early stages
of recovery. And premium income is only marginally up on last year. Some
companies have obviously opted to self-insure rather than swallow higher
rates.

FT  21 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Willis Corroon
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors cannot complain that there was no advance warning this week to don
tin hats ahead of Willis' interim results. In the event the company appears
to have suffered just as much as Sedgwick from the weak US market in the
second quarter, and the shares duly responded with another 9 per cent fall.
This is surely the correct response. Willis needs to make roughly Pounds 85m
pre-tax next year to cover a maintained dividend, a figure which looks well
beyond its reach on present trends. To be fair, the increase in operating
expenses should continue to fall over the next 18 months, while the
combination of restructuring and new projects may reap as yet undreamt-of
benefits. Without any help from the markets, though, the best that can be
hoped for at this stage is a less savage dividend cut next year than
Sedgwick's threatened halved payout in 1992.

FT  21 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Rentokil
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The performance of Rentokil's shares yesterday underlines that the market is
now taking its 20 per cent earnings growth for granted. To be fair, the
interim figures offer no reason to do otherwise. The results were achieved
in spite of an adverse move in exchange rates which took Pounds 2m off the
bottom line on translation. The company continues to squeeze margins higher
and is generating cash at an almost embarrassing rate, perhaps Pounds 45m
over the full year.
Yet the shares are trading on a prospective price earnings premium of 60 per
cent relative to the market. On this measure, the market has already
capitalised another three to five years' earnings growth at the same
demanding pace. This leaves little to chance. On a yield of 1.5 per cent,
the dividend is barely an attraction. Without yield support the stock would
look vulnerable if growth prospects are ever called into question.
Common sense suggests that Rentokil can only squeeze margins so far, and
that ultimately it will have to rely on increased turnover if expectations
are to be met. If a candidate for a large acquisition can be found, Rentokil
might be tempted to use the high multiple for a paper bid. Alternatively,
cash flow is strong enough to support a substantial debt-funded acquisition.
But that prospect looks unlikely: Rentokil prefers to fund small
acquisitions from cash. The question for investors is whether it can
reconcile this prudent approach with the growth targets.

FT  21 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Clearing the debts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Having sold off most of the family silver, the government is finally getting
down to the teaspoons. That is one way - and not necessarily an uncharitable
one - of looking at yesterday's detailed proposals to sell off Pounds 1bn of
UK privatised company debt. The move will not have taken the markets by
surprise since it has been clear for some time that no other means were at
hand to achieve the Pounds 8bn target for privatisation proceeds published
in last November's autumn statement. Whether the operation is better from
the taxpayer's standpoint than another Pounds 1bn gilt auction, though, is
another matter. No one should be fooled that, while technically reducing the
PSBR, this is anything other than a clever wheeze to fund the UK budget
deficit.
The structure of the offer to some extent mirrors techniques used in the
last BT share sale, with different types of investor competing against each
other for available stock. In this case, BT will compete against the market
in one pool, electricity companies against themselves in a second pool. In
the same way that there was an inducement for the retail investor in the BT
secondary share sale, the Treasury's baseline bid price for repurchase will
be adjusted for tax. In the case of the electricity companies, this provides
an incentive to bid now rather than wait until next year when it will not be
available.
A lively auction is certainly on the cards. Given the popularity of UK fixed
interest, there may yet be scope for one of the City's under-employed but
enterprising financiers to repackage the lot and provide a tempting spread
over gilts. On the other hand, the companies themselves will doubtless
welcome an opportunity to refinance with less demanding covenants and gain
new control over the shape of their balance sheets. They may even believe
government promises about inflation and wish to switch to shorter-term
funding.

FT  21 AUG 92 / Observer: Evacuee from Downing St
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Anguish and red-faces in Whitehall at the prospect of John Major returning
home from his Spanish holiday on Sunday to find that he has joined the
swollen ranks of London's homeless.
His flat above the shop at 10 Downing Street is uninhabitable because of
large-scale building works to strengthen its defences against terrorist
attacks. Windows are being ripped out and walls reinforced in the wake of
last year's IRA mortar attack.
Major had planned to stay in his constituency home in Huntingdon while the
work was completed. But that was before the convening of the Yugoslav peace
conference in London next week. Becoming a commuter from Huntingdon or
Chequers would prevent him from working with the officials preparing for the
conference.
Contractors are now working frantically but officials admit that there may
not be time to put back the chintzy furniture and bomb-proof floral
curtains.
One suggestion is that Major will have to borrow the spare room in Douglas
Hurd's London house at Carlton House Terrace.
Of course, there are one or two nice hotels in the area but the Treasury
would be reluctant to foot the bill. So Observer will happily pass on to No
10 any offers of a few nights' cheap and cheerful B&amp;B. Brixton might be a
favourite.

FT  21 AUG 92 / Letter: Clinton's borrowing plans are defensible
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof RUDIGER DORNBUSCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Stephen Roach's criticism of prospective Clinton deficits
('Clintonomics: a clear sense of deja vu', August 18) does not look at the
alternatives and, hence, misses the point. President Bush is on the verge of
catering to the nation's tax phobia by offering further tax cuts without any
constructive proposal to work the supply side. For Mr Bush, supply side
economics has become tantamount to capital gains tax cuts and, for his
rightwing supporters, deficits are the best weapon for strangling big
government.
Governor Clinton puts social peace and productive potential at the centre of
his national strategy. These are investments and, by the precepts of
classical public finance, borrowing to invest is perfectly sensible. It
would surely make little sense to wind up with an economy that had its
accounts balanced but also had more illiteracy, yet poorer skills, more
unemployment and more riots such as those in Los Angeles.
Mr Bush repeatedly tells Americans that they deserve tax cuts and that he
will balance the budget - if only he has a co-operative Congress. After a
decade of growing deficits under the Reagan-Bush banner, that is like saying
give me flying pigs and I will have an air show.
Mr Bush has less claim to credibility on this count than any politician on
the globe - certainly far less than Governor Clinton, who understands that
the chance for budget balancing was missed in 1988, at full employment, and
must be seized at the next best opportunity. Unlike Republicans, he does not
believe that taxes will kill America, but that joblessness, illiteracy and
disillusion will do so.
With deficits to come for many years, whoever is in the White House, the
issue is not the deficit but what it will buy. Republicans say deficits are
an investment in cutting the size of government: big deficits create and
maintain pressure to cut spending, and make for lower taxes now and less
government later. In other words, have your cake and eat it.
Democrats recognise that someone has been eating America's cake. Unless
there is a change of course, America will become unrecognisable. Rudiger

FT  21 AUG 92 / Letter: Slipping out of a negative equity trap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms ANDREA DIPPLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The Bank of England estimates that 1m households are trapped in homes
worth less than the loans upon them ('Mortgage debt traps 1m households',
August 17). It adds that only 100,000 of these households are in this
position through mortgage arrears or further loans secured on their
properties. Thus, about 90 per cent of households pose no immediate credit
risk.
When will building societies realise that an option is to allow non-arrears
households to move and take their 'negative equity' with them, to be paid
off over the period of the new mortgage? The building societies would expose
themselves to no added risk as 'negative equity' is, in effect, an unsecured
loan. This, with increasing volume in the housing market, would boost the
economy without artificially distorting the market.
I am in such a non-arrears 'negative equity' trap. I work 75 miles from home
but my salary has doubled since I took out my mortgage. The societies should
help good customers, not only those in arrears.

FT  21 AUG 92 / Letter: Feather bed candidates and culture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Professor RONALD DORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, There was a splendid contradiction on your Leader page on August 19.
Your Leader records how Japan's economic managers have (albeit you think
unjustifiably) been able to watch the stock market fall to 35 per cent of
its one-time value with equanimity and only now resort to marginal fiddles
to help banks adjust.
Below that, in Personal View, Sir Alan Walters and George Guise explain how
South Africa's industrial financing system - extensive share cross-holdings,
with takeovers virtually impossible - is the source of that economy's
inefficiencies. South Africa's corporations will never pull their socks up
until the stock market assumes central importance and becomes a market for
corporate control, not just for income-flow rights.
Where have they been during the short-termism debate of the past five years?
The South African system is almost a replica of Japan's. It is precisely the
peripheral importance of the stock market to the real economy that explains
the equanimity of Japan's economic managers. Freed from the fear of
takeovers, industrial managers can concentrate on the long term; they can
keep, not lay off, their human capital when share prices are tumbling, while
continuing to invest. That is why 'recession' in Japan means growth below 3
per cent.
Can it be that Anglo-Saxons need the spectre of takeover artists to make
them efficient? Give Anglo-Saxons a feather bed and they immediately lie on
it? But give one to a Japanese and he works harder so as to look forward in
better conscience to bedtime? I hardly think Walters and Guise would be the
ones to resort to such a leopards-and-spots cultural argument.

FT  21 AUG 92 / Letter: Adequate money advice service is crucial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Lord EZRA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I support the views of your Leader (August 19) on money advice.
I was chairman of the money advice funding working party set up on the
recommendation of Sir Gordon Borrie as director general of the Office of
Fair Trading. The working party represented the finance industry and
consumer organisations.
It unanimously recommended in January 1990 that there was an urgent need to
strengthen money advice services and that the contribution from the private
sector should be Pounds 9m spread over three years. It also proposed that a
money advice trust be set up.
You correctly indicate that little has been contributed towards meeting that
target, regarded as minimum. I have the impression, from meetings with
certain financial institutions, that an important reason for their
reluctance to contribute to a central fund is that they consider they
already do a great deal to advise customers who may get into debt with them.
But I fear that this is missing the point. The majority of those with
serious personal debt problems owe money to a number of organisations. These
might include not only building societies but also gas and electricity
suppliers plus the local authority. In cases of multiple debt it is
essential that there be an ind-ependent money advice service.
If voluntary arrangements for funding it cannot be made then something akin
a mandatory system should be envisaged. So long as a serious private debt
problem persists it is a social imperative that there should be an adequate
money advice service.
I believe the government should immediately take the initiative with the
finan-cial institutions and others to work out a plan of action.

FT  21 AUG 92 / Heaven can wait, but Yugoslavia cannot: Edward Mortimer
observes attempts to mediate and prevent conflict in the republics of
Croatia and Macedonia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We all know that the European Community exists, but only privileged mortals
have actually seen it. This week I became one of them. On the war-scarred
mountain roads of Croatia, Europe appeared to me in tangible form. It took
the shape of two white vehicles, a Fiat and an off-road Mercedes. One was
driven by a Frenchman, the other by a Spaniard, and both flew the dark blue
flag with 12 gold stars.
I not only saw the cars, I rode in them. They transported me to the
mysterious 'Serb Republic of Krajina'. I visited its capital, Knin, where I
met its president, Mr Goran Hadzic.
Europe is powerful, but not omnipotent. The ex-Yugoslav world is a Homeric
one, in which rival deities maintain an uneasy coexistence. In principle,
the dark blue flag can circulate at will throughout the land. In practice
there are roadblocks and checkpoints to be negotiated. To get to Mr Hadzic's
mountain kingdom, starting from the Dalmatian port of Split, you must first
pass a Croatian army checkpoint, then a UN one, then one operated by the
Serb militia.
Among these various deities, the UN enjoys a Zeus-like primacy: the light
blue flag takes precedence over the dark blue. This was manifested in the
fact that the longest hold-up occurred at the UN checkpoint. Mr Thierry de
Beauce, charge de mission at the Elysee and personal envoy of Lord
Carrington, sweated under the harsh Balkan sun while Kenyan soldiers of
Unprofor (the UN Protection Force) discussed among themselves, in Swahili,
what to do about the fact that they had received no order to let him
through.
Mr de Beauce, a French novelist, is vice-chairman of the Carrington peace
conference, with special responsibility for problems of national minorities.
While the conference has been notoriously unsuccessful in stopping the war,
it has busied itself trying to work out political solutions to the
underlying conflicts: those that have already caused fighting, and those
that might do so in the future. This week's mission, on which I was invited
as an observer, dealt with one conflict in each category.
The status of the Krajina Serbs was the main issue at stake in the war in
Croatia last year. The results were all too visible along our route through
the 'pink zone' - an area not included in the UN Protected Area but, for the
moment, under de facto Serb control. There is scarcely a civilian inhabitant
to be seen; only deserted villages of destroyed houses.
Mr de Beauce's task was to persuade Mr Hadzic to embark on negotiations with
the Croatian government. The Krajina or 'frontierland' was part of Croatia
until last year. As far as the EC is concerned, it still is. This is why Mr
Hadzic's people come within Mr de Beauce's terms of reference. Needless to
say, that is also the view of the Croatian government.
But that is not how Mr Hadzic and his associates see the matter. They
maintain that their self-proclaimed republic is now independent, and much
entitled to international recognition as Croatia itself. If it forms part of
any larger entity in the future, it should certainly not be Croatia but a
federation of Serb states, presumably including Serbia proper, Montenegro,
and the equally self-proclaimed 'Serb Republic' in neighbouring Bosnia.
The outcome of the war in Bosnia is indeed crucial to Krajina's future. That
war has enabled the Serbs to establish a 30 km-wide corridor across northern
Bosnia, linking Krajina to Belgrade and thus enabling it to receive
supplies. This has given new confidence to Mr Hadzic and the people around
him, encouraging them to reject out of hand any suggestion that they might
revert to any kind of special status within Croatia.
Mr Hadzic admits that had Croatia offered before the war the concessions it
is offering now the Serbs would have been delighted. But he adds that if he
agreed now to negotiate on a special status within Croatia, 'I should be
signing my own death warrant'.
Since it is equally clear that Croatia will not accept Krajina's
independence, the only hope seems to be that talks might begin on certain
concrete points so as to re-establish a minimum of trust and communication
between the two sides. Mr Hadzic suggested that Croatia should start by
allowing 20,000 Serb refugees to return to their homes in western Slavonia,
in central Croatia.
The fact that he thought they would be willing to do so, while the area
remains under Croatian government control, was the only encouraging sign I
could glean from the visit. Since there are many more Croat refugees who
wish to return to areas now under Serb control, there might be the makings
of a deal here, if the UN could guarantee the security of the returnees on
both sides. But even that would be difficult to negotiate, with feeling
already rising in Croatia against the UN force, whose presence is seen by
many as helping to legitimise and perpetuate Serb control of the protected
areas.
The EC's chances of putting Croatia together again cannot be rated high. But
perhaps at least it can help prevent Macedonia from falling apart. That was
the other object of Mr de Beauce's trip, which took us to the lakeside
resort of Ohrid, in the south-west of the Macedonian republic. There we were
entertained by the president, Mr Kiro Gligorov, despite the fact that the EC
has still not recognised his republic, even though advised by its own
arbitration commission that Macedonia fulfils all the criteria for
recognition.
There is still that awkward problem of its name. The EC, in deference to
Greece, has offered to recognise the republic under any name that does not
include the word 'Macedonia'. But the republic's inhabitants, whatever their
ethnic and linguistic connections with Bulgarians and other Slavs, are used
to being Macedonians and would not recognise themselves under any other
name.
Or rather, that is true of the majority of the republic's inhabitants. A
large minority, probably about 25 per cent, are not Slavs but Albanians and
consider themselves the victims of various kinds of discrimination and
repression by the Macedonian majority.
The Albanians are, however, about to join a coalition government with Mr
Gligorov's party, and both sides seem aware of the importance of solving
their differences peacefully.
The risk that they might end up in a similar position to Serbs and Croats is
real, especially if fighting breaks out between Serbs and Albanians in
neighbouring Kosovo. Yet both also clearly valued Mr de Beauce's presence,
knowing that without third-party involvement they would find it hard to
communicate. 'We shall always need your help,' he was told by Mr Halili,
leader of the main Albanian party.
'Europe', it seems, is still in demand in the Balkans, whether west
Europeans want it or not.

FT  21 AUG 92 / Leading Article: No free lunch
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE post-communist governments of eastern Europe, the road to economic
reform is proving so long and bumpy that some of them are now looking for
short cuts that do not exist. The latest leader to succumb to the temptation
is President Boris Yeltsin, who promised on Wednesday to provide every man,
woman and child in Russia with a 'ticket to a free economy' in the form of
vouchers to purchase Rbs10,000 worth of privatised state property this
autumn. It certainly sounds alluring: a scheme which promises, almost at a
stroke, to rationalise rotten state industry, shift great swathes of it to
the private sector, encourage share ownership and create a liquid capital
market. Unfortunately, however understandable the motivation, the plan is an
illusion.
Mr Yeltsin's wheeze is not new. Similar schemes are already being
implemented or contemplated in several other east European countries -
notably the disintegrating federation of Czechoslovakia, where more than
8.5m people are participating in a plan to transfer nearly Dollars 10bn
worth of state assets to private shareholders.
The Czechoslovak policy illustrates the limitations and risks of mass
privatisation. It was launched essentially for political reasons: to create
a speedy mechanism for the transfer of state property to private hands and
to give ordinary citizens a stake in economic reform.
Rather than the desired equity-owning democracy, however, the scheme seems
likely to produce confusion. Most of those who have bought vouchers
entitling them to shares have entrusted them to private investment funds
promising inflated returns. These barely regulated funds are neither ready
nor willing to inject the management expertise so badly needed by state
enterprises; in consequence many of the old industrial bosses remain in
control. And if the promised returns fail to materialise, the result could
be a crisis of financial and economic confidence.
Russia's programme has defects of its own. For one thing, the timetable is
impossibly tight. For another, since much of the equity is to be reserved
for employees of the enterprises concerned, it does not look any more likely
to produce competent management than the Czech scheme.
The lesson is that large-scale privatisation of state industry is no miracle
cure for the old command economies. It is unwieldy to implement, politically
divisive and cannot fulfil all the conflicting objectives which governments
expect - spreading wealth among the citizens, injecting new skills into the
economy and creating tradeable financial assets.
This may not matter all that much in the long run. The real future for
eastern Europe lies in encouraging new private enterprises, not in extending
the life of the old state sector. The worry is that in the shorter term,
mass privatisation schemes that promise something for nothing may give
capitalism a bad name.

FT  21 AUG 92 / Not always a class act: Exam pressures facing schools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The tribulations of Mrs Helen Williams, forced to resign as high mistress of
St Paul's Girls' School, London, have been reported largely in terms of
personalities and the power of school governors.
It is familiar saga: new head, following a charismatic and forceful
predecessor, falls foul of staff and governors and is out within three
years. Many independent schools can tell tales of heads despatched in
similar circumstances. Before long, state schools will join them, as their
governors gain ever greater powers to hire and fire.
Behind the events at St Paul's lie two more novel and significant issues.
First, are Britain's leading independent schools now no more than exam
factories servicing a narrow parental demand for 'results'? And second, in
their determination to give parents 'results', have the public schools
stopped experimenting and thus ceased to influence the national debate about
curriculum reform and the content of education?
Parents footing the bill for school fees certainly see themselves as paying
for high exam grades. A 1989 Mori survey of parents with children in the
independent sector found 'exam results of school' to be the second most
frequently mentioned factor in choice of school, the first being 'good
discipline'.
The typical Mori parent would have little to complain of at St Paul's.
Ranked 11th across the country in this March's FT-500 survey of last year's
independent school A-level results, nearly three-quarters of all its A-level
entries were graded A or B, with virtually all its sixth-form leavers
proceeding to higher education and more than a third going to Oxford or
Cambridge. If London's upper-middle class wants better value for its Pounds
5,000 a year, it would be hard pushed to find it.
Exam results nonetheless played an important part in the rumpus at St
Paul's. Mrs Williams wanted her pupils to take only five or six GCSEs, with
girls following broader and more original study programmes leading directly
into A-level work. Her scheme was resisted by parents, worried that their
offspring would no longer have a dozen GCSE grade As to wave before Oxbridge
admissions tutors before taking their A-levels.
The conflict was ironic since, as Ms Kate Flint, senior tutor of Oxford's
Mansfield College and a former pupil at the school, wrote to the press
earlier this week, in the 1970s girls at St Paul's were restricted to six
O-levels at 16, avoiding subjects to be pursued at A-level and 'instead
following a stimulating variety of internally organised courses'. Several
other schools with top-notch academic records used to follow a similar
policy, but have also largely abandoned it in response to evident or
anticipated parental disquiet.
Parents are misguided if they think that a string of GCSEs is necessary for
a pupil from the likes of St Paul's to impress Oxbridge. Ask most admissions
tutors and they will tell you that the capacity to garner a mass of GCSEs is
taken for granted. They are more concerned about reasoning ability and
academic breadth and curiosity. Says Dr Michael Hart, senior tutor of Exeter
College, Oxford: 'If a student has half a dozen As at GCSE, he or she has
demonstrated enough. Far more impressive than the number of GCSEs is the
breadth of subjects being studied at A-level.'
The lack of breadth in the post-16 A-level curriculum is a matter of acute
concern across the education spectrum. While most of their continental
counterparts keep going with maths, a science and a foreign language,
England's brightest sixth formers need not - and a large proportion do not -
study any of them. Even the Head Master's Conference has spoken in favour of
reforming the traditional three-subject A-level course - to which the
government remains resolutely wedded - into a broader, more balanced
curriculum.
But when it comes to leading the way, the independent sector is hardly to be
seen. The widely respected international baccalaureate (IB) already offers a
six-subject post-16 curriculum, obliging students to study English, maths, a
foreign language, a science and at least one other humanities subject. Yet
only a handful of independent schools take the IB, and those few (such as
Sevenoaks School in Kent) have a strong international bias to their pupil
intake.
Why don't more follow? Mr James Sabben-Clare, headmaster of Winchester
College, says he looked 'long and hard' at the IB, but was dissatisfied with
the detailed curriculum for maths and science. One prominent headmaster was
more blunt: 'Frankly, my parents wouldn't swallow it: they've never heard of
the IB, and don't think it's what gets their little Johnnies into Balliol.'
The independent sector led the way in the development of English education.
England's state grammar schools were carbon copies of the great public
schools in their curriculum and teaching. As late as the 1960s, innovative
projects owed much to independent-sector leadership.
If the likes of St Paul's are now terrified to experiment for fear of
parental backlash, only government quangos will be left to try out new ideas
for teaching our children. And the government, we know, has a patchy record
when it comes to reforming the education system.

FT  21 AUG 92 / Technology: Hands up for chiral - What oranges and lemons
are telling chemists about new drugs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What makes lemons smell different from oranges and caroway taste different
from spearmint? What gave thalidomide its tragic side-effects?
The answer is asymmetry. Most natural molecules can exist in two
mirror-image forms, like left and right hands, which may have very different
effects on the body.
Now chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturers are learning to do something
that nature has always done: make pure right-handed or left-handed molecules
 -called chiral isomers, after the Greek word for hand.
Chiral manufacturing is one of the fastest growing fields of industrial
chemistry. Pharmaceutical and agrochemical companies are switching from
traditional synthesis, which gives 50:50 mixtures of mirror-image molecules,
and making instead the pure isomer that works best as a drug or pesticide.
Almost all biological processes are chiral. A living cell normally responds
to only one isomer, just as a glove is designed to fit on either the left or
the right hand. Producers of flavours and fragrances have long known that
the distinction between mirror images is critical: for example R-limonene
smells of orange and its mirror image, S-limonene, smells of lemon.
Yet most of today's best-selling drugs are made and sold as a mixture of two
isomers. Often one is active and the other neutral. Occasionally the
unwanted isomer can cause harmful side-effects. The most tragic case was
thalidomide: one isomer was a tranquilliser and - as scientists discovered
too late - the other produced birth defects.
Chemists have distinguished between chiral isomers since the last century
but techniques are only now becoming available to apply the knowledge on a
large scale.
Pharmaceutical regulators, notably the US Food and Drug Administration, are
encouraging the industry to develop new drugs as single isomers, and some
companies are preparing to relaunch established drugs as one isomer. For
instance Boots of the UK is to make pure left-handed S-ibuprofen, the active
form of the painkiller ibuprofen which is now produced as a mixture with
inactive R-ibuprofen.
Sometimes two isomers of one molecule may produce different therapeutic
benefits. A good example is verapamil, a 'calcium-channel blocker' marketed
by Knoll, pharmaceutical subsidiary of the German chemical group BASF. The
drug's activity, which makes it a useful treatment for high blood pressure
and angina, is caused predominantly by the left-handed isomer L-verapamil.
Verapamil also has a powerful effect on reducing the drug resistance which
often develops in cancer patients during chemotherapy. The calcium-channel
blocking activity, which has until now limited the use of verapamil in
chemotherapy, is much lower in the right-handed isomer. Pure R-verapamil is
a promising compound for treating various types of tumour and is currently
undergoing clinical trials.
Switching to a single isomer can rejuvenate the commercial life of an old
drug, says Andy Richards, commercial director of Chiros, a Cambridge company
specialising in chiral chemistry. He estimates that 50 to 80 drugs -
approaching the end of their patent protection - are good potential targets
for a switch. The cost of developing a single isomer from a mixture ranges
from Dollars 2m to Dollars 15m, while the payback in additional sales is
projected to be Dollars 20m to Dollars 200m a year.
Pharmaceuticals are the most valuable application of chirality. Pure isomers
of synthetic chiral compounds represent about 5 per cent of drugs on the
market and 40 per cent of drugs in development. Sales of the 'chiral
intermediates' required to manufacture them are worth more than Dollars 500m
a year now, according to industry estimates, and could grow five-fold over
the next decade.
Agrochemicals are the second-largest user of chiral chemicals. Other
important applications are in flavours and fragrances and in electronics
(liquid crystal displays depend on the ability of chiral compounds to twist
polarised light).
The agrochemical industry faces environmental pressure to switch from
mixtures to single active isomers. This immediately halves the amount of
pesticide that farmers need to spray on their fields.
ICI of the UK has led the production of pure chiral agrochemicals. Its
subsidiary ICI Fine Chemicals is making 1,200 tonnes a year of
S-chloropropanoic acid (S-CPA), an intermediate which can be used to produce
pure isomers of several important herbicides. Some goes to ICI Agrochemicals
but most is sold to competitors.
The key to the process is an enzyme which ICI produces from genetically
engineered bacteria. When the enzyme is applied to a mixture of CPA isomers,
it specifically converts right-handed R-CPA, to lactic acid. That leaves
behind the S-CPA which is needed for herbicide production.
Natural enzymes are a favourite tool of chiral synthesis because they
distinguish between mirror images, whereas conventional chemical synthesis
produces both in equal amounts. For example, ICI Fine Chemicals has
identified 20 to 30 enzymes that could be used to reduce ketones to chiral
alcohols - an important step in pharmaceutical synthesis.
Several start-up companies specialise in chiral chemistry, making
intermediates and working with pharmaceutical groups to develop new
compounds. They include Chiros and Oxford Asymmetry in the UK and Sepracor
and Celgene in the US.
Oxford Asymmetry focuses on chemical methods of chiral synthesis, rather
than the enzymatic or biological techniques favoured by most others. Steve
Davis, research director, has developed an ingenious series of small
molecules (which he calls chiral auxiliaries) for use in building up chiral
compounds 'like a piece of molecular scaffolding.'
Sepracor, based in Massachusetts, is systematically developing single isomer
versions of drugs currently sold as mixtures. It has filed patent
applications for more than 40, including Glaxo's recently introduced Zofran
(anti-emetic) and Serevent (anti-asthma), and was recently awarded its first
important US patent - for the left-handed version of Eli Lilly's best
selling anti-depressant Prozac. That could leave Sepracor in a strong
commercial position after Lilly's original Prozac patent runs out in 2001.

FT  21 AUG 92 / Technology: Mobile phones go global
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A global mobile communications system using 66 satellites to provide voice,
paging, facsimile and data services for people on the move has this week
moved a important step closer to take-off.
The popularity of mobile phones has spurred a number of new networks
covering increasingly broad geographic areas, such as the GSM programme in
Europe. Now low-orbit satellite systems promise to expand the horizons even
further.
The Federal Communications Commission of the US has awarded Motorola
Satellite Communications an experimental licence to construct and launch
five satellites to demonstrate the feasibility of its proposed global
personal communications network, called Iridium.
Now that the World Administrative Radio Conference has allocated spectrum
for such satellite mobile services, Motorola hopes that it will be able to
convince national telecommunications groups to invest in its technology
which will cost Dollars 3.4bn (Pounds 1.8bn) for the space infrastructure
alone.
The US group has also recently redesigned the system so that it will be
operational with just 66 satellites orbiting the Earth, rather than 77
satellites as initially envisioned. The reduction will be achieved by using
more powerful satellites which concentrate communications capacity on areas
where demand is most required. Each of the 66 satellites moving in low
orbits will cast 48, rather than 37, beams on to the surface of the Earth.
This will reduce the possibility of interference while allowing reallocation
of channels in response to patterns of consumer demand for voice or paging
services.
The experimental satellites are set to be launched in 1996 and Motorola
expects to be able to commercialise the service by 1998. Handsets are likely
to be priced initially at between Dollars 2,000 to Dollars 3,000.
For users of existing terrestrial mobile networks, Motorola has designed a
dual handset that would scan for the subscriber's terrestrial system and go
to Iridium only if a signal were not available from the land-based system.
Other companies competing with Iridium include Hughes Aircraft, Loral and
TRW.

FT  21 AUG 92 / People: Baglin to retire early from Abbey National
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Richard Baglin, one of Abbey National's three managing directors, has
decided to break the Abbey habit at the relatively tender age of 49. His
departure removes one of the obvious contenders for John Bayliss's job of
running Abbey's core retail banking business.
When Cambridge-educated Baglin joined Abbey in 1964, he was one of the very
first graduates to be hired by the building society industry. He became a
general manager in 1981 and has most recently been in charge of new business
which included the group's loss-making estate agency business and its
European operations.
However, Abbey National stressed that his retirement - he leaves at the end
of the year - was in no way linked to problems in the areas he was
responsible for, such as Fico France, the group's French mortgage lender. He
will remain with the group as a director of Abbey National's French and
Italian subsidiaries.
Baglin, who started a three-week holiday yesterday, was unavailable for
comment. But it is understood that he wants to do something different while
he is still young enough.
Until now Abbey's top team, under chief executive Peter Birch, has been more
stable than those of most big financial institutions. However, John Bayliss,
managing director of retail operations, is expected to retire in the next
year or two and a replacement has not been named for Baglin.
One possibility is that Charles Villers, the former chairman of County
NatWest and Abbey's current managing director of corporate development, may
assume some of Baglin's tasks. However, the key appointment Abbey will have
to make is finding a replacement for Bayliss. John Fry, 55, the group
service director and another Abbey veteran, is one possibility, but Abbey
could choose to leap a generation or look outside.

FT  21 AUG 92 / Management: For Sir, a potato and a mineral water - Alan
Friedman eats his way round Manhattan, where the in crowd is picking at its
food
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The lavish lunch is less a part of doing business in New York these days
than it used to be. Chalk it up to recession, to the new austerity of the
1990s, or to the need executives have for belt-tightening of the
paunch-avoidance variety.
This is not to say the era of business lunching is over. One merely needs to
calibrate one's selection of restaurant and menu according to status and
strategy.
Many New Yorkers, starting with Wall Streeters, consider lunch an irritating
interruption in their day. Hence, the uncivilised habit of having sandwiches
or salads sent in, and scarfing them down in five bites with a can of Diet
Coke.
Deal makers in Manhattan are far more likely to favour a power breakfast, so
don't be surprised if you are offered muesli, orange juice and watery coffee
at 8 o'clock.
At breakfast or lunch, it is perfectly acceptable, even desirable, to plunge
right into the subject of your meeting. Remember: Americans are invariably
more direct than their European counterparts and most have few qualms about
spitting out their life histories in the first thirty seconds of a meeting.
They also eat too fast, refrain from the filthy habit of smoking, and prefer
mineral water to wine at midday.
Different rules apply as one moves up the socio-economic ladder. The
mid-level investment banker or industrial executive is still happy to tuck
into decent nosh at a mid-town eatery. A chic, but not overly ostentatious,
restaurant is The China Grill, a spacious venue furnished in Early Yuppie at
53rd Street and Sixth Avenue.
If you want more ambience and really good northern Italian cuisine, try
Paper Moon (58th Street between Madison and Park) or Sfuzzi (65th Street,
just east of Broadway). Both are discreet places where you need not worry
about being overheard - and they offer excellent focaccia, seafood and dry
white Pinot Grigot.
If, on the other hand, you want a statesman-like meeting place for a big
deal or a little chat, the least known and most pleasant new venue in town
is the roof bar and restaurant of The Peninsula (corner of Fifth Avenue and
55th Street).
At the top of the power pile, and rather too fashionable for most
businessmen except media and publishing types, are The Four Seasons and Le
Cirque. These are the places to take a New Yorker if you wish to impress,
but reservations should be made well in advance and the bill will make
serious inroads into your expense account.
As important as the venue, however, is the need to show your New York
contact that you are wise to the health-conscious ways of contemporary
American capitalism. Do not be shocked, therefore, if your luncheon
companion sticks to a glass of Perrier and some grilled vegetables, followed
by black coffee. Some British colleagues seemed taken aback recently when
they sat in the Grill Room of The Four Seasons and watched their guest order
and consume a glass of water and a single, lonely baked potato.
One alternative, although available only by invitation from your host, is to
sample some truly awful food along with masses of prestige in New York's
version of St James's. If your contact proposes lunch at the Metropolitan
Club, the University Club, or, better still, the Century, you must accept
with pleasure and prepare for a meal that will make dining at the Reform
Club seem like an epicurean treat.
Finally, if you are with a good, old friend, and just want to combine
business with fun, pop down to the venerable Oyster Bar in Grand Central
Station for no-nonsense nosh. And, if you find yourself in the downtown area
of the World Trade Center or Wall Street, there are three great, but little
known, eateries in the SoHo and Greenwich Village districts.
Garibaldi (corner of Mercer Street and Washington Place) is one of the best
downtown Italian restaurants to have opened recently. Mezzogiorno (corner of
Sullivan and Spring Streets) is also unpretentious and consistently good,
although no credit cards here. Nor is plastic accepted at Felix (corner of
West Broadway and Grand Street), a French-owned and managed bistro, newly
opened in the heart of SoHo.
So, armed with this briefing, head for New York, don't forget to make an
obligatory remark about the dreadful state of the property market, speak
unabashedly about business well before the coffee comes, and, above all,
when ordering, just remember to keep it light.

FT  21 AUG 92 / Management: Whizz kids slow down - The City is confused by
Hanson's new strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hanson, Britain's best known conglomerate, is undergoing one of its biggest
changes since Lords Hanson and White started out in business in 1963.
According to its new generation of management, Hanson is no longer a trader
in assets, but an industrial group dedicated to building and managing its
core businesses.
The very concept of a core business used to be anathema to Hanson, as any of
its parts could be up for sale at any time. The management believed that to
label a business as 'core' sent out the wrong message, implying that Hanson
would not sell it.
Lords Hanson and White would consider buying a cigarette business one year,
a gold mine the next, and then think about adding an electricity generator.
The 'last of the swashbuckling whizz kids' (as Lord White once described the
two of them) executed their policy with breathtaking speed.
The 'swashbuckling' aspect of the group started to look outdated last year
when Hanson decided to take a 2.8 per cent stake in Imperial Chemical
Industries. ICI turned the tables on Hanson, attacking its management to
great effect.
Earlier this year David Clarke and Bob Raos were appointed chief executive
and chief operating officer respectively of Hanson Industries, the group's
North American arm, and Mr Derek Bonham was appointed chief executive of the
PLC based in London.
The new team want to continue to build on Hanson's traditional skills at
buying and selling assets. The difference is that they no longer want to be
defined by those skills. In the nineties they believe Hanson's central role
should be managing and expanding core businesses - natural resources such as
coal and timber and tobacco.
As Mr Bonham put it: 'There are a number of businesses, such as Cavenham
Forests (in the US), where increasingly you want to be number two or three
in the industry as opposed to number six or seven.'
Acquisitions, therefore, will have to fit into the core businesses or be so
big that they can stand alone as a separate core business. A lot of the
smaller businesses which cannot be built into the new framework, valued at
around Pounds 700m, are likely to be sold.
Hanson's strategy has confused some analysts. They have pointed to
conflicting statements coming out of the company. While Clarke talks of the
sale of portfolio companies, Martin Taylor, vice chairman, denies that there
are any plans for immediate disposals; Bonham talks about degearing the
balance sheet as Lord White talks about creating a new property business.
Mr Mike Smith, conglomerates analysts at Robert Fleming Securities, says:
'The signals from Hanson are very confusing; the City wants to know what the
new management is looking to do and whether the old management is in full
agreement.'
Lord Hanson angrily denies suggestions of disagreements, and says the issue
is about emphasis. He accepts the Clarke/Bonham thesis on core businesses
but suggests it is nothing new. 'We are not breakers of businesses. We have
got to emphasise our tremendously capable managers who are building those
businesses.'
He confirms that some of Hanson's smaller businesses will go at the right
time. But this should not, he adds, be interpreted as meaning that all of
them will be sold.
At the very least this is a significant repositioning of the group's
strategy. Lord Hanson may have known all along that Hanson would develop
into an industrial materials company but it is new to most commentators
following his company.
As Jeremy Marshall, a former senior Hanson operations executive and now head
of the bank note printer De La Rue, once put it: 'Hanson was best known not
for the organic growth of companies but for buying groups and selling them
on.'
Could it be that the new management believes Hanson has to evolve into an
industrial materials company because there are no longer any opportunities
to do mega deals?
Supporters of Hanson's new management say there is a more compelling reason
for the new strategy. The ratio of Hanson's share price to the market
average fell by almost 10 per cent last year when the group was under fire
from ICI. Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank which took the lead in
London in attacking Hanson on behalf of ICI, recently published a buy note
in the US, arguing that the new strategy would improve the shares' rating.
As the group's strategy changed so has the role of the centre at Hanson. Mr
Bonham says: 'The responsibility of the centre is to motivate the
management. We have spent a lot of time devising appropriate programmes for
key managers and making sure we get the right people into the right slots.'
Lord Hanson is equally forthright. 'We are an industrial mangement company;
we have a portfolio of industrial companies and sometimes it's necessary to
dispose of part of the portfolio.'
The problem for Hanson is the City does not quite believe it. It senses that
the new management is intent on changing the strategy but it is unsure of
how far Lord Hanson supports the changes.
Lord Hanson believes it is just a question of time. As more of the decisions
go out in the name of the new management there will be less opportunity to
talk of splits and disagreements. The group's strategy will be executed by
the new management which will have soon consumed 'more and more' of Lord
White and Hanson's jobs. 'You never know when I've retired because I will be
gone and nobody will notice it', says Hanson. 'People in the building will
laugh. But the fact of the matter is that will happen.'

FT  21 AUG 92 / The Property Market: Winners in the leasing game -
Commercial tenancy agreements differ widely between countries within Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS MCINTOSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Are certain clauses in the English commercial occupational lease
'iniquitous', as Samuel Brittan described them (Economic Viewpoint, July
30)? In the Single European Market which comes into effect at the end of
1992, there will be many anomalies between European countries, especially as
far as commercial office leases are concerned.
For both occupiers and investors, these anomalies need to be understood. But
of greater significance is the question of who benefits from these
differences: the tenant or the owner?
Lease terms vary across Europe enormously. The standard lease in Belgium,
for instance, is a nine-year lease with both the tenant and the building
owner having the option to terminate the lease every three years. In each
year the lease rent can be increased by a factor linked to the consumer
price index. This means that an increase can happen at a time when open
market rents for new lettings are actually falling.
In France a similar arrangement exists, although the rent is indexed upwards
according to the cost of construction index rather than the consumer price
index.
Germany and the Netherlands have a similar arrangement except that the
leases are normally for five or 10 years; once again there is the provision
for indexation.
In Italy a standard lease is for six years, also with indexation, but to
only 75 per cent of a government inflation index. In Spain leases are for
three or five years, also with indexation.
The UK has the most unusual lease structure in Europe. The 25-year lease is
not only the longest lease term commonly granted, but there are normally no
indexation provisions. Instead, every five years, the lease is revalued
upwards to the current 'open market value' of the building concerned.
The advantage for the occupier is that rent is only reviewed upwards, if the
market value increases. However the tenant may have the benefit of an
unrealistically low rent if, during the five-year period, the rental value
increases.
The measurement of office floor space as 'occupied' by tenant varies
enormously across Europe, depending on whether it includes the lift area,
toilets, stairway and other elements of the building which cannot be
strictly occupied by the tenant.
It is this measurement of floor space which is normally used to calculate a
quoted rent per square metre or per square foot. Therefore, a simple
comparison of quoted office rents across Europe can be very misleading.
To obtain a true international rental comparison, it is necessary to make an
adjustment to quoted rental figures. For instance, the implication is that
an annual rental level in Belgium quoted as BFr8,000 to BFr9,000 a square
metre (about Dollars 25 a square foot) should in effect be BFr13,000 a
square metre per year (Dollars 40 a square foot), using the method of
calculation in the UK.
A further issue which complicates the picture relates to sharing the risk
between the occupier and owner for the management and maintenance of the
building. The UK is again in an unusual position in that the occupying
lessee is normally responsible not only for paying rent for a 'net area',
but also for all the cost of management and maintenance of the building,
plus insurance. This covers both the inside and outside of the buildings,
including structural items.
In many other parts of Europe, the tenant is not responsible for the cost of
repairs to the external walls and maintenance or the structure of the
building. Other costs, including agents' fees, service charges, taxes and
legal costs also vary substantially.
From the occupational point of view, the quoted rent, therefore, is a first
guide only to the likely cost of occupation. It is far more important for
the lessee to take into consideration the total costs and legal obligations,
perhaps over the first three or five years of the lease.
With all these various lease terms quoted across Europe, it is important to
ask who benefits from which system.
The system of occupational leasehold tenure used in the UK of a 25-year
lease was created by the institutional dominance of the property market. As
the pension funds and life insurance companies became more involved in the
market, particularly during the 1970s, they were able increasingly to
dictate the terms for an 'institutional lease'.
The irony is that, in the last 20 years, the property market in the UK has
been more volatile than that in other parts of Europe, such as France and
Germany.
The institution-dominated market has encouraged a greater level of
short-term bank lending, based on the premise that the developer would be
able to sell his development on to an institutional investor on the
completion of the development. The availability of short-term debt finance
has exacerbated the overdevelopment of office buildings at periods of
property boom. The higher levels of inflation in the UK have also encouraged
this type of loan, with asset values often rising ahead of building costs,
reducing the real cost of the loan or mortgage finance over time.
It could also be argued that this has encouraged poor quality office
buildings, where the specification has been dictated by developers with
short-term interests and by institutions not fully conversant with the needs
of occupiers.
At times of property slump, tenants have been in a powerful position to
influence events. But such timing has often coincided with a period in the
market when very little investment in the office stock is taking place.
Hence, tenants have had to make do with poorly specified buildings, although
they have been able to negotiate very favourable levels of rent in some
cases.
In other parts of Europe, especially France and Germany, the extremes of
boom and slump noticed in the UK have not taken place. Banks have been
reluctant to forward funds for office development unless all or part of a
building development has been pre-let or the covenant of the company raising
the debt is very substantial.
In general, the occupational leasehold tenure system in different countries
simply shifts the investment risk of providing office buildings,
particularly in the short to medium term, in favour of the tenant or the
investor.
The system in the UK appears to put a large element of risk on the tenant,
yet the systems in Belgium and France appear to put more risk on the
building owner, sometimes inhibiting large-scale development. But - at a
time when several British developers are in financial trouble - it is
perhaps questionable whether the tenant does take on an unfair burden of
risk.

FT  21 AUG 92 / Running out of steam in Baglan Bay: Local reaction to fears
about the future of BP's plastics plant in south Wales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Petroleum's Baglan Bay plant is on the Swansea side of Port Talbot
in south Wales, linked to the town and its surrounding industrial estates by
a chain of roundabouts.
An untidy-looking complex built in the 1960s, the steam from its cooling
towers floats out over the sands of Aberavon beach, a few hundred yards
away.
At the far end of the beach lies British Steel's Port Talbot works, which
has lost two thirds of its workforce since the early 1980s. Workers at BP
are worried that their numbers might be cut just as drastically.
There are about 900 staff left at the plant after 130 job losses last year -
making BP Port Talbot's second-largest employer after British Steel. Large
numbers of contractors are also employed at the site, varying from 500 to
more than 1,000 at any one time.
Staff and regular contractors at Baglan Bay are drawn from a wide area -
from Bridgend further east, to Llanelli in the west. Specialised contractors
can come from as far afield as the north-east of England and Germany.
The impact of cuts or closure would be felt most strongly in Port Talbot
itself, but the knock-on effects would spread as far as the employees are
scattered, sending ripples through the whole Swansea Bay area.
The centre of Port Talbot shows little in the way of affluence. The high
street is sprinkled with 'To Let' signs and boarded-up shops. The businesses
doing best seem to be discount stores selling cheap clothing and household
goods.
British Steel has shed almost 8,000 jobs at Port Talbot since it launched a
restructuring and investment programme at the works in 1980. About 4,000
staff are left.
It is only recently that unemployment in Port Talbot has fallen to near the
national average, after a decade of being well above it. Closure of all or
part of the BP plant would be a big setback to the process of rebuilding the
local economy.
Unemployment in the Port Talbot and Neath area was 9.3 per cent last month,
slightly lower than Swansea with 9.9 per cent. There are pockets of much
higher unemployment in the valleys north of the town.
Announcements of new jobs are something to be celebrated. The biggest story
in the local paper one evening this week was the recruitment of 40 sewing
machinists by Morris Cohen, an established local supplier of lingerie to
Marks and Spencer. Advertisements in the Jobcentre tend to be for care jobs,
cleaners and sales representatives.
The Swansea Bay Partnership, a collaboration between local authorities, the
Welsh Development Agency and private businesses in the region, has been
encouraging companies to move to the area.
In the mid-1980s Port Talbot succeeded in attracting businesses to
industrial parks around the town, including several Japanese companies and
others involved in high-technology and biotechnology.
Port Talbot has good transport links, with the M4 running by the town, an
InterCity rail line and the deep-water port at Swansea. Recently, however,
its attractions have been outshone by developments further east at Cardiff
Docks and Newport.
Job creation has slowed during the past two or three years as the recession
has made companies postpone decisions on whether to take up sites around the
town, and the new Japanese factories producing televisions and video
recorders have been hit by low consumer spending.
Public feeling in Port Talbot after the redundancies last year was that the
BP plant was economically viable and that the company was committed to the
area. BP has recently been developing a higher profile in the community,
particularly on environmental issues. It has supplied a plastic recycling
skip for the town and become involved with badger protection groups in
Baglan village.
But changes in world markets for BP products, and in the company's
priorities, could mean local confidence is misplaced. BP's workforce is
becoming uneasy.
'There is a lot of conjecture,' says Mr Jeff Morgan, TGWU general workers'
union branch secretary at Baglan Bay. Morale has been particularly low since
an article in European Chemical News quoting Mr Bryan Sanderson, head of BP
Chemicals, describing Baglan Bay as 'marginal'.
Mr Morgan says communication between management and workers is not as good
since the union lost its negotiating rights earlier this year.
He sees the most likely rationalisation as the closure of all production
facilities except that for styrenes - one of the types of plastics produced
at Baglan Bay - and the power plant. This produces electricity from steam
given off as a by-product of plastics production and sells it to the
national grid. That scenario would involve the loss of three quarters of
Baglan Bay jobs.
'It would be very, very tragic, not only for the direct workforce, but also
for the area where we employ local labour,' Mr Morgan says.
Mr Noel Crowley, deputy leader of Port Talbot Borough Council, agrees. 'The
effect on the town would be devastating,' he says. 'The effect that would
have on all the local businesses throughout the community that supply them;
it would be absolutely awful.'

FT  21 AUG 92 / Expansion policy fails to pay off / A look at turmoil in
European insurance markets as cross-border takeover activity slows down

<TEXT>
The decision by Hafnia, Denmark's second-largest insurance company, to seek
protection from its creditors, highlights the problems faced by the European
insurance industry.
Hafnia's failure to transform itself into a pan-Scandinavian financial group
capable of competing in the newly liberalised European insurance market
coincides with a deterioration in trading conditions and a sharp slowdown in
cross-border merger and acquisition activity by leading insurers.
Although few companies face problems quite as acute as those of Hafnia,
European insurers confront straitened circumstances. Over the past two years
they have incurred rising underwriting losses. Returns on capital gains -
derived from the appreciation of property and other assets - have also
declined. The going could get even tougher as companies adapt to the liberal
regulatory framework enacted by the European Commission earlier this year
and the more competitive environment it will help foster.
The example of Hafnia is instructive. Mr Per Villum Hansen, Hafnia's former
chairman, was an exponent of the idea that big is beautiful. He believed the
company was simply too small to compete in a liberalised Europe.
Although big in the tiny Danish market, Hafnia would be vulnerable to
takeover from much larger competitors from France and Germany. So Mr Hansen
turned to Baltica, Denmark's biggest insurer, to try to form a large
financial conglomerate. 'He wanted to refashion corporate Denmark,' said one
observer.
With the Baltica management unresponsive, Mr Hansen paid DKr3.8bn (Pounds
350m) for a 34 per cent stake in Baltica in an effort to force co-operation.
Last year he switched his attention to Skandia, joining forces with UNI
Storebrand, the largest Norwegian insurer, to buy a combined 42 per cent
stake of Scandinavia's largest insurance company. But the deals left Hafnia
overextended. Total investment in Baltica and Skandia was equal to nearly
twice the value of its own capital base.
Worse still Hafnia was exposed to the worsening conditions of the
Scandinavian insurance markets, with insurance investments representing
about a third of its total equity holdings. As the share price of Skandia
and Baltica drifted downwards Hafnia was left with substantial investment
losses, which have depleted its assets. On Wednesday, the company said its
liabilities exceeded assets by DKr100m.
Nowhere in Europe has an expansionist strategy come so visibly unstuck. For
other insurers, Hafnia is a warning of the dangers of overambition. However,
few of the mergers, acquisitions and alliances agreed in the run-up
liberalisation of the market are proving successful, industry observers
suggest. Acquisitions in the growing Spanish and Italian markets have proved
particularly troublesome. The experience of Guardian Royal Exchange, the
fifth-biggest UK company, which lost more than Pounds 70m in Italy after
buying two small southern Italian insurance companies, is not unique.
Mr Claude Tagger, director of international development for Assurances
Generales de France, the French company, says: 'We saw lots of victory
communiques in the late 1980s. Someone had bought a pearl in Spain or Italy.
But many of these decisions were wrong. The acquired companies were in bad
shape and their new owners lacked the capital to do anything about it.'
Mr Alan Badanes, an American banker who is managing director of Chase
Manhattan European insurance group, says: 'The big successful acquisition
has been the exception rather than the rule. Few if any are going well.' He
likens the pre-1992 takeover enthusiasm in European insurance to that in the
City of London before Big Bang's deregulation of share trading, when foreign
banks competed to buy securities houses.
Many of the deals were conceived in the bull markets of the late 1980s and
the prices paid sometimes bore little relation to either earnings or assets
of the target companies. Mr Simon Rudolph, an industry observer at Morgan
Stanley, the investment bank, says AXA, UAP and Allianz overpaid when they
bought Equity &amp; Law, the UK life company, Toro of Italy and Vie/Rhin et
Moselle of France respectively. Mr Rudolph says '1992 fever' meant that
insurers rushed to establish footholds in the growth markets regardless of
cost.
Investors' fears about the wisdom of the recent overseas expansion of
Allianz, the German group which is the largest insurer on the continent,
help explain a recent 10 per cent fall in the group's share price. Allianz
reported a worse than expected underwriting loss of DM1.78bn for 1991 last
month, partly because of poor performance by overseas underwriting
subsidiaries. During the 1980s the company spent some DM10bn making
acquisitions abroad. Deutsche Versicherungs, the former state monopoly of
eastern Germany acquired by Allianz in 1990, is not expected to make a
profit until the late 1990s.
Sharply higher underwriting losses are also undermining enthusiasm for
expansion elsewhere in Europe . The losses have been most acute in the UK,
because of the sharp slowdown in the housing market and the severity of the
recession. Domestic mortgage indemnity claims - in which insurers cover
lenders against losses on the sales of repossessed properties - and
recession-related claims for theft and arson have increased.
However, insurers in other European markets have also had to contend with
heavier claims. French and German insurers, for example, have seen an
epidemic of car theft, with thousands of stolen vehicles ending up in
eastern Europe. Mr Rudolph cites evidence that 40 per cent of cars on sale
in Poland had been stolen from eastern Europe. Last year the numbers of cars
stolen in France rose by 21.5 per cent to 311,000.
Losses on commercial property insurance, where competition has depressed
premium rates in recent years, have also been high. In France and Germany
insurers have been paying Pounds 1.40 in claims and expenses for every
Pounds 1 received in premiums.
The decline in the values of assets such as property and shares has weakened
balance sheets and depressed income from capital gains. In France, capital
gains from real-estate appreciation have been an important source of
profits.
But operating conditions for many companies could deteriorate further as a
result of the EC's programme of liberalisation. German, and possibly Swiss,
insurers are particularly vulnerable because their insurance markets are
more highly regulated and protected than elsewhere. For example, minimum
price rules - which must now be scrapped - have guaranteed healthy profits
for German motor insurers. German industry leaders expect competition in
home and motor business to reduce traditionally wide margins and
profitability.
Mr Henning Schulte-Noelle, chairman of Allianz, said in a recent interview
that he is expecting 'short-term' slippage in profits from domestic
operations after Germany implements the European directives.
There are, however, signs that German banks and insurers are overcoming
their traditional reluctance to compete with each other. Deutsche Bank's
foray into the life insurance market with its purchase of 30 per cent of
Gerling, the largest privately owned insurance company in Germany, serves
notice that competition could heat up.
Already there are signs that European companies are adapting to the
deflationary climate of the 1990s by adjusting their strategies to conserve
capital.
French companies, the most aggressive expansionists in the run-up to 1992,
are hinting that they will slow the pace of their acquisitions. Union des
Assurances de Paris, Europe's second-biggest insurer in which the French
government has a majority stake, increased its European premium income from
markets outside France threefold between 1986 and 1990.
But Mr Jean Peyrelevade, chairman, said at the company's annual general
meeting this year. 'We will take a very long pause in our external growth.
We have to organise and manage our operations and eliminate losses.'
French companies are also starting to favour the development of long-term
alliances, rather than outright acquisitions.
Assurances Generales de France, which has also been aggressive in acquiring
European business, doubled its non-French income between 1986 and 1990. It
recently won a long legal battle to have voting rights recognised on its 25
per cent stake in one of Germany's top insurers, Aachener &amp; Munchener (AMB).
The group says it is now committed to building a long-term relationship with
its partner.
Mr Tagger, the AGF director for international development, advocates the
need for economies of scale and increased market share, the same view which
informed some of the acquisitions that are now running into difficulties. He
says AGF aims to have a stake of 5 to 10 per cent in all the markets in
which it competes, but says this can only be achieved through alliances and
possible mergers with groups of a similar size.
Acquisition is 'simply not on the cards. You can't double your size by
buying your competitor,' says Mr Tagger, adding that AGF would not have
bought AMB even if it had been able to do so. 'We have to find new ways.
Alliances are necessary,' he concludes.
Other observers believe that insurers may reappraise strategies in a more
fundamental fashion as companies increasingly make profitability a bigger
priority than increase in market share.
In the US many multi-line insurers (which sell the full range of life and
non-life policies) have abandoned efforts to have a sizeable share in every
insurance product and every state, preferring instead to develop strengths
in a restricted number of markets where they have special experience and
expertise.
Mr Badanes of Chase says the pattern could be repeated in Europe. Although
the market for reinsurance and large-scale commercial risks - the policies
bought by multinational companies - will remain genuinely international, Mr
Badanes expects the markets for smaller commercial and personal insurances,
such as motor and home insurance, to continue to develop along national
lines.
He predicts that many of the larger groups could begin to break up in the
1990s. 'The unravelling is just beginning. The big groups won't breathe the
word divestiture. but they'll quickly respond to any unsolicited offer for
one of their subsidiaries.'

FT  21 AUG 92 / Leading Article: German money
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PARADOX of European monetary policy is that few, apart from the Germans,
believe in the wisdom of targeting broad money. But all believe in the
importance of fixed exchange rates. So willy nilly, everyone in Europe is a
monetarist: when D-Mark broad money misbehaves, everyone must pay the price.
Nowhere is this paradox more striking than in the UK. Many proponents of ERM
membership were critical of domestic monetarism. Now they must live with the
targeting of D-Mark M3, instead. The question is whether many will come to
condemn the Bundesbank's present targetry, as they do the targeting of
sterling M3 in the early 1980s.
The Bundesbank argues that its attachment to D-Mark M3 reflects the solid
empirical relationship between monetary expansion and inflation some three
years later. Growth of D-Mark M3 at a provisional annual rate of 8.6 per
cent between the fourth quarter of 1991 and July remains well above the
official target of 3 1/2 to 5 1/2 per cent, which is based on what the
Bundesbank thinks will give medium term inflation of 2 per cent. The growth
rate of D-Mark M3 is slipping back, but too slowly.
The Bundesbank is not simple-minded. It is well aware that broad money can
be distorted by distress borrowing during an economic slowdown, by changes
in wealth holdings in response to the structure of interest rates and by
increased foreign demand for D-Marks. But it judges these various special
factors to account for no more than one percentage point of monetary growth.
The principal motor of M3 expansion is credit expansion, most of it medium
and long term. In the last six months, complains the Bundesbank, the annual
rate of credit expansion to the private sector was 11 per cent. Nor does it
accept that profit-seeking banks are simply seducing foolish clients into
excessive borrowing, which would make high interest rates the cause of the
excessive lending.
The question is whether anything can be done to curb credit growth, apart
from high interest rates. The answer is yes. The Bundesbank complains of the
effect of subsidies to lending in eastern Germany, arguing that such
subsidies not merely increase the demand for credit, but reduce its
sensitivity to interest rates. The culprit is the German government. It
should recognise that its mistaken policies are now sacrificing German
growth, not merely that of the rest of Europe.
Unhappily, a change of heart in Bonn does not seem at all imminent. For the
moment, high German interest rates remain certain. It is hardly surprising,
therefore, that the dollar is close to an all time low and sterling, at DM
2.8081, is only three pfennigs from its absolute floor within the ERM. The
American authorities can, if they, wish, ignore the exchange rate slide. The
British cannot. Bundesbank monetarism rules, in London as in Frankfurt.

FT  21 AUG 92 / Arts: Santa Fe Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOW 35 years old, the Santa Fe Opera long ago established traditions for its
short summer seasons: a strong company of young and youngish American
singers, a repertory including at least one brave new work each year - and
plastic raincoats to shield those in the uncovered part of the theatre from
the desert storms of New Mexico.
This year the new piece was Hans-Jurgen von Bose's The Sorrows of Young
Werther, which makes a fitting choice for a festival that has already given
five Henze operas their American premieres. Born in 1953, von Bose belongs
to the generation of German young Romantics who have looked more to Henze
than to Stockhausen as a model, and The Sorrows of Young Werther is very
much a German young Romantic piece.
Von Bose wrote it when he was just past 30 - it had its first performance at
Schwetzingen in 1986 - and it evinces a young man's ready identification
with the subject of Goethe's novel.
Just as Werther is so preoccupied with his feelings that he excludes events
from his mind (finally to the point of suicide, the ultimate exclusion of
events), so von Bose seems concerned above all with his responses to the
book, which becomes, in his words, 'a strange, remote idyll, something
partly nostalgic, partly threatening and always very fragile, on the verge
of vanishing, and with a touch of dreamlike escapism'.
The opera is an idealised landscape of the mind, a German romantic landscape
featuring Holderlin and Lenz along with Goethe in the libretto, Schubert,
Schumann and Mahler further back than Henze in the chain of musical
antecedents, and treasuring of youthful sentiment and feeling for nature.
More specifically, von Bose's identification is with the hero, who is
on-stage almost throughout the two acts, nearly always as the focus of
attention. The opera begins from him, from his voice unaccompanied, then
gradually joined by a 'madrigal quintet' of unseen singers who echo his
thoughts and feelings, and by a solo oboe as the piece starts to lift off.
It is with him, too, that the music feels.
When his suddenly-beloved Lotte tells him she's engaged, high woodwinds and
brass yelp and scowl in agony; when she gives him leave to visit her the
next day, the pit wells up with jubilant bell sounds. The language is one of
emotional endorsement, of coursing sympathy.
It follows that the piece needs a Werther who will compel belief and never
let the precious fabric tear. In Kurt Ollman, Santa Fe has just the man: a
baritone of radiant candour and ease, using his natural talents with all a
lieder artist's care to weld word and tone into the singleness of lyrical
declamation.
Nobody else has much of an opportunity: Werther is not interested in other
people except as analogues of himself, and von Bose goes further than Goethe
in diminishing the lesser characters. Albert, Lotte's fiance and later
husband, becomes a bogeyman who pops up to curtail any dalliance with
Werther. Even Lotte herself is just a vivacious tease: all we can see and
hear is Werther's image of her, though projected with agility and brightness
here by Charlotte Hellekant.
The characters who come more fully alive are those in whom Werther discerns
some shape of himself: the mad Heinrich (a high tenor part, made into
graceful flight by Jeffrey Reynolds), and Peasant who kills for love (Mark
Thomsen, a necessarily stouter tenor, but still light and fresh, in the
nature of the work).
George Manahan was the conductor, Francesca Zambello the director, and Bruno
Schwngal the designer. A blue wall, right across the stage, provided a near,
wide space in which Werther and his imaginings could wander, while a central
pair of doors opened out occasionally on other scenes: the music room of
Lotte, Albert and domestic contentment, or emblematic exteriors of summer
trees and winter snow. The work's fluidity - its succession to two dozen
scenes in little more that an hour and half was well matched. So too its
self-sustaining energy.
The season's other new productions were a broad, unsurprising Don Giovanni,
lit only by some of the singers (Stanfords Olsen unashamedly big in
Ottavio's arias, Ann Panagulais a nicely precise and fresh, lively Zerlina),
and a rather more alarming version of the The Beggar's Opera.
Paul Steinberg's set for The Beggar's Opera confines the action within a
long, narrowing space between two high, windowless walls of brick, luridly
painted in cream and crimson. It has the atmosphere of an underground
station, or a public lavatory: an appropriate place in which the black
creatures of Christopher Alden's production can gather and gloat.
These people, dressed in a hybrid of 18th century and modern costume
recalling some of Richard Jones's productions, take nothing seriously. At
almost every moment, there is the risk that the whole thing could run away
into mocking laughter.
This is deeply untrustworthy theatre, though lucky in Timothy Nolen's
Peachum as its presiding genius. He smiles or snarls at anyone's effort to
interpose a moral value, and yet his good humour, like James Michael
McGuire's rude heroic health as Macheath, gives the sign of a benevolence
somewhere down there in the murk.
Sante Fe's less disturbing comedies were two revivals, Der Rosenkavalier and
Die Fledermaus, both conducted by the company's director, John Crosby. Die
Fledermaus was provincial, but Der Rosenkavalier had the glamour of an
outstanding Oktavian from Susanne Mentzer. She does not have much the look
of a lad, but, with a vocal accuracy that seals richness to brilliance, she
projects a musical character of sunny confidence. It is also clear that
words and meaning are as important to her as glorious melody.
Ashley Putnam makes a sweet Marschallin, restrained to sweetness by the care
she needs to control her vibrato. Eric Halfvarson is Ochs to a tee, every
phrase, every gesture smartly tuned, a dog for opportunism and the ability
to bounce back. Otherwise this company's reputation for Richard Strauss
needs polishing.

FT  21 AUG 92 / Arts: The visual scene - Edinburgh International Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARY ROSE BEAUMONT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN the past, there have been complaints that the visual arts at the
Edinburgh Festival have not sufficiently reflected the state of Scottish art
past or present. This situation is handsomely redeemed this year with
exhibitions of Allan Ramsay at the National Portrait Gallery, James Pryde at
the Gallery of Modern Art, Will Maclean at the Talbot Rice Gallery,
University of Edinburgh, while the Scottish Gallery is celebrating 150 years
of purveying exclusively Scottish art.
Will Maclean is a Highlander whose art is informed by his heritage. His
acute consciousness of the tragic history of his people was passed on to him
by his father, who came from a fishing-crofting family.
Maclean's symbolic and mythological imagery, drawn principally from the sea,
offers levels of metaphor beyond the visible. The panels and boxes that he
makes, a mixture of carved wood, bone and found objects, often take the form
of reliquaries, shrines to a vanished age, or altars for the worship of a
pagan cult lost in the mists of time.
Maclean archaeologises and reinvents the past, his own in Memories of a
Northern Childhood, 1977, consisting of a panel to which are attached found
objects connected with seafaring, a piece of slate carved with a fishing
vessel inset like a votive offering into a kind of tabernacle.
Equally unspecific, yet at the same time a more general requiem for a
disappearing culture, is Abigail's Apron, 1980, a surrogate portrait of his
aunt, represented only by her carved wooden apron and the mysterious objects
protruding from the pocket.
The elegiac Skye Fishermen In Memoriam, 1989, is a lament for those lost at
sea, the discarded piece of sacking, the fishing net and an old industrial
glove inducing a sense of the fragility of life.
The most recent piece The Emigrant Ship, 1992, is central to Maclean's
lifelong concern with the Clearances. The title is a homage to the painting
of the same name by Sir William McTaggart, who was also a Highlander.
Maclean's painting was inspired by the skeleton of a ship scratched on an
old school wall in Mull and the inscriptions on the windows of the church
where the victims tried to shelter. The space and symbolic imagery of
Maclean's piece works at both conscious and unconscious levels; it is at
once a threnody for the tragic misfortunes of the past and a warning for the
future.
The darkling paintings of James Pryde (1866-1941) are exhibited in all their
theatrical splendour at the Gallery of Modern Art in a fitting tribute to
one of Scotland's more neglected sons. The central room is hung with the
huge romantic paintings commissioned by Annie, Lady Cowdray, for the Library
at Dunecht House in Aberdeenshire. The walls have been repainted a deep
turquoise for the occasion, the original colour at Dunecht, and the
paintings are brilliantly lit, bringing out the inherent drama of the
canvases.
Pryde had a predilection for ruins, which was given full rein in the Cowdray
paintings A Blue Ruin, A Red Ruin and Cowdray Ruins. Building on a legendary
visit by Queen Elizabeth I to Cowdray, there is also Queen Elizabeth's
Bedroom, which, not surprisingly, is in ruins.
They are haunting and nostalgic images, certainly the flower of his
achievement.
Pryde was born and brought up in Edinburgh, and the memory of the towering
vistas of the Old Town architecture stayed with him all his life, the
figures in his paintings becoming progressively smaller while the
architectural features grew ever more elongated and mannered, until they
become the stuff of nightmares.
The final series, on which he was still working at his death, was inspired
by the vast bed at Holyrood House in which Mary, Queen of Scots, was
supposed to have slept. For him it encompasses birth and death, especially
death.
Pryde's best-known early achievements were the posters he made in
collaboration with William Nicholson, collectively known as the Beggarstaff
Brothers, but the partnership was short-lived.
Pryde went on to indulge his fascination with low-life portraits of
notorious criminals and, more important for his future bent, theatrical
portraits. His passion for the theatre culminated in his stage sets for the
1930 production of Othello, starring Paul Robeson and Peggy Ashcroft. It was
his swan song, and the last 10 years of his life were barren.
Nothing to do with Scotland, but tenuously connected to Britain's presidency
of the EC and supported by the European Arts Festival, the Royal Scottish
Academy is hosting an exhibition of Joan Miro's sculpture a year ahead of
his centenary, lent in its entirety by the Fondation Maeght, France.
However, no spurious reason is required: the exhibition is pure joy.
Miro only came to sculpture in a big way during the last 20 years of his
life, although he had modelled and cast a few in the 1940s. One senses that
the 72 sculptures here exhibited are more in the nature of jeux d'esprit, a
relaxation of the intensity of his work a painter. There is no relaxation in
the inventiveness of the forms and the mischievous pleasure he takes in
juxtaposing incongruous features.
As ever, his recurrent motifs are women and birds, together or separately.
The bird, symbol of freedom, takes many forms - as long as it is on top, you
know it is a bird, whether it be a shoe tree or a tuning fork. Women too can
take any form, from a high chair, representing maternity, to an upturned
stool, suggesting passivity, while the materials encompass any amount of
found objects, from a turtle shell to a kettle.
Miro delighted in using anything that came to hand, hoarding odds and ends
until he found a use for them, even appropriating the casting tools he was
working with. The imaginative transformation of banal objects is comparable
to Picasso's assemblages, such as his She-Goat, 1950, whose belly is cast
from a wicker basket.
Miro casts a straw basket for a woman's head, and a one-armed plastic doll
for her nose. The sculptures are vivid reminders of Calder's circus figures
of the 1920s, when both he and Miro were newly arrived in Paris.
Miro's relationship with contemporary British sculpture is apparent.
Balancing Act, 1970, presupposes Barry Flanagan's leaping hares, and the
shinily-painted red legs of Young Girl Escaping 1968, have a jauntiness
similar to Allen Jones's tangoing figures. They may be an old man's
playthings, but the old man was in full inventive flight.

DURING last weekend, the little Welsh town of Brecon was a curious melting
pot. If you had a 'stroller' ticket, you could linger in the sunshine and
showers of the roped-off riverside meadow bandstand or munch a vegeburger at
the Museum car park stage, enjoying groups from Rod Mason's Hot Five to the
cool mainstream of guitarist Howard Alden's Quintet. Beyond these exclusion
zones, however, it was you, Krukke (the Dutch marching band) and the mob.
But if the streets were swaying to the rhythm of ''Ere we go]', the
Guildhall, Market Hall and Christ College echoed to more urbane and
sometimes illuminating sounds. Some 12,000 seats were sold for the weekend's
'sit down' concerts alone and the programming was glorious.
On Friday, a mainstream dream ticket featured trumpeter Clark Terry,
saxophonist Lew Tabackin and guitarist Kenny Burrell, while down the road,
Brazilian percussionist Nana Vasconcelos invoked the spirit of equatorial
Brazil. On Saturday, pianist Dick Hyman played and talked authoritatively
through the jazz repertory and later, feisty Courtney Pine gave an account
of the state of the art in the UK. On Sunday afternoon, the blues and boogie
of septuagenarian pianist Jay McShann gave way to the 'cubop' of Irakere.
Pianists Michel Petrucciani and Bheki Mseleku, back to back, set the
swinging in motion on Friday. In his trio, the tiny Frenchman delivers for
EMI's Blue Note label what its roster of 25 years ago did. Thick,
distinctive melodies are carried at a lick, Petrucciani occasionally
dropping a gear and motoring off in another direction. His version of the
Charlie Parker standard 'Billie's Bounce' cascaded so brightly off the
keyboard, it hardly mattered that the overall sound quality was what you
would expect from in-flight entertainment headphones.
In another European Arts Festival sponsored-performance, Chicago-born
tenorist Johnny Griffin, who is based in France, filled the same space with
his regular rhythm section. Griffin is a prickly character who plays with a
'get outta the way' urgency - even the ballads on this night had a hectoring
tone. In the Fifties, he spent some time with Monk, and his own recent
originals have a similar strongly rhythmic quirk. The band, whose members
look like characters from a Godard noir movie, has in Charles Bellonzi a
drummer with time, presence and a way with brushes not often heard.
The 22-year-old trumpet player Roy Hargrove has a crispness and attacking
style which could run with Griffin's. Instead, he has worked recently with
that other sax athlete Sonny Rollins. He brought his own loose-limbed
quintet to Brecon and along with altoist Antonio Hart kept the dynamics
changing by the simple technique of walking into the wings every five
minutes. The soaring and flaring originals, as well as 'Milestones',
thrilled in places, but their energy would have been dissipated completely
without the sharply focused back-beat of drummer Gregory Hutchinson.
Brecon usually scores highly by programming the irresistible (the tenor and
sweet cornet of Scott Hamilton and Warren Vache, for example) with the
unmissable. This year's coup was two exhilarating shows from the formidable
trio of super-guitarist Pat Metheny, melodious bassist Dave Holland and the
taut drumming of Roy Haynes. Metheny's cheesy grin, tousled hair and
down-home image belie the consummate technician and composer who lurks
inside. He said recently that the way he is playing now stems from the pain
suffered in finishing a long-standing love affair. If his performance on
Sunday resulted from that trauma, his loss is our gain.
Alternating between a beaten up semi-acoustic, whose bridge is held in place
by a toothbrush, and a futuristic synclavier guitar synth, Metheny ranged
effortlessly between tear-jerking and bucolic originals ('Farmer's Trust')
and Ornette Coleman's controlled hysteria ('Lawyers'). His improvisational
technique is to hook you on a pretty melody and invent endlessly and
mellifluously close to it. He takes on the whole gamut of guitar styles
seamlessly too, from the metal posturing of 'Questions and Answers' to the
studied melancholy of 'Lonely Woman'.
Holland is entirely sympathetic in accompaniment, developing and extending
the leader's themes rather than merely suspending ideas as a solo bass will
often do. But Metheny dominates the ensemble entirely and the contrasting
harmonics of samples on the synclavier to the truthful nylon strings of the
acoustic was compelling.
Well done Brecon.

Complaints that the BBC is going downmarket with its classical music policy
in order to compete with Classic FM, the new commercial radio network, look
a bit odd in the light of tonight's broadcasting. At 7.00 in Proms 1992
Radio 3 begins a live relay from the Albert Hall of a concert which includes
Handel and Beethoven concertos, and in the second half music by Schnittke
and Mozart. At 10.00, again live from the Albert Hall on Radio 3, the BBC
offers one of its late Proms. Then at 10.20, in Proms On One, BBC television
shows a recording from last Sunday's Prom with violinist Dmitry Sitkovetsky
and cellist Mischa Maisky playing the Brahms Double Concerto.
We shall be fortunate indeed on the day that commercial broadcasters
organise three concerts like that.
Radio 4 also offers a live programme: Call To Account (8.05) in which Sir
John Quinton, chairman of Barclays, Peter Ellwood, chief executive of TSB,
Kevin Newman, chief executive of First Direct, and Tony FitzSimons, chief
executive of Bristol and West, respond to questions and complaints about
high street banking from an audience in the Victoria Rooms, Bristol.

FT  21 AUG 92 / Arts: The Tempest - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Path Theatre Company's Tempest at the Cochrane Theatre brings together
able-bodied, physically disabled and mentally handicapped actors. The result
is a difficult show, yet one which fulfils three criteria for fine theatre:
it is morally challenging, informative, and better than staying in with
Mozart. For all this, it is best seen as a piece of cultural therapy, an
opportunity for actors and audience to meet on equal terms.
Any and every effort to bring this kind of theatre to the public should be
encouraged and applauded. Granted, standards of professional theatre cannot
apply here. The whole production underlines the frailty of the human engine,
and reminds us that perceived handicaps often turn out to lie in
environment, or in others' attitudes.
Just as theatre heightens the senses, so actors who cannot speak, walk, see
or hear bring a special perspective to the part. The casting of The Tempest
here is inspired in this regard. There is point and poignancy in seeing a
blind Ferdinand led by Miranda, a signing Stephano eloquently explaining how
he will supplant some of Trinculo's teeth, and a Down's Syndrome Ariel,
delegating his work through two other bodies which sing and speak for him.
The other felicities of the show are its music, a sly pastiche of Steeley
Dan, Django Reinhardt and Mardi Gras jazz, and its dance. However, the
actors were often left stranded by the direction and production.
In effect, The Tempest for all its sprites and other-worldliness was a
difficult choice. Perhaps a less formal approach would better serve the
actors. The excellent Kaleidoscope Theatre Company (Love Lies Bleeding,
1991) has led the way, using mime, gesture, music and costume to produce
fresh, exciting work with a community of disabled actors. Such work is
possible, and it should be encouraged.
At the Jeanette Cochrane Theatre, Southampton Row, London WC1, (071) 242
7040, until 22 August

FT  21 AUG 92 / People: Williams prepares to get his fingers inky
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
David Williams, who arrived at Fleet Street-based printing ink specialists
Usher-Walker 15 months ago, has been made chief executive in a boardroom
reshuffle designed to prepare the company for growth. Peter Walker,
previously chairman and managing director, remains executive chairman.
Williams, who says he had no experience of inks 'beyond the little bit I
used at school' when he joined from acquisitive mini-conglomerate Mosaic
Investments, explains that Usher-Walker has been 'basically very much a
family-run company', despite its stock market listing.
He came in with the title of corporate development director, and there was
no chief executive. The board of nine members was far too unwieldy,
according to Williams, and a priority was to institute 'proper reporting
systems'.
Hence Gerry Burdall, 55, technical director since 1983, steps down from the
main board, and becomes purchasing director. Ron Loynton, 50, remains
director in charge of sales, but also steps down from the board.
Williams explains that Walker 'has his finger on the pulse on the ink side'.
That leaves Williams to concentrate on acquisitions - possibly in the
speciality chemicals field. He also thinks that, while Britain is
acknowledged as a world leader in inks manufacture, Usher-Walker has paid
too little attention to the export side.

An inventive, if somewhat bizarre, product from Primacare Marketing of
Bolton falls into the category of technology 'worth trying' rather than
watching.
The Cozydry electric 'body drier' is a unit that can be installed in the
corner of a shower stall. It consists of a floor to ceiling strip with
several blowers, rather like hair or hand driers. After showering, the user
simply turns on the drier and basks in streams of warm air.
'Forget wet towels. Forget the effort of rubbing. Forget the twisting and
stretching to reach those awkward places,' the inventors say. 'The Cozydry
sensation is like standing naked in a gentle breeze on a summer's day.' Not
for everyone, perhaps, the Cozydry may none the less prove a valuable
appliance for the disabled or elderly. Primacare Marketing: UK, 0204 386316.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Until recently the only accurate means of diagnosing Alzheimer's disease, a
form of dementia affecting between 5 and 10 per cent of the population over
the age of 65, was by post-mortem examination.
Now scientists at SIBIA, a biopharmaceutical company founded by the Salk
Institute for Biological Studies in California, have developed a test which
allows diagnoses to be made in patients with symptoms or before symptoms
appear, Jennie Lynch writes.
The test uses a highly-specific antibody which recognises a human protein,
soluble APP, found in the fluid of the spinal cord. The antibody is at least
20 times more sensitive than any previously made to detect soluble APP. In
Alzheimer's patients levels of this protein are reduced and, according to a
study in today's Lancet, the diminishing levels of protein correlate with
increasing severity of the disease. SIBIA: US, 619 452 5892.

FT  21 AUG 92 / July money supply rise eases fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RISE in the money supply last month has reduced fears that the economy may
be sliding into further decline, though it provides little sign of an
upturn.
M0, which mostly comprises notes and coins in circulation, increased by 2.4
per cent in the 12 months to the end of July, after a year-on-year rise of
1.3 per cent in June and 2.5 per cent in May.
M4, a broader measure which also takes in bank and building society
deposits, rose 5.7 per cent in the year to the end of last month, following
a year-on-year rise of 5.3 per cent in June and of 5.2 per cent in the
previous month.
The changes in the seasonally adjusted figures fit in with the picture of a
flat economy. M0 rose by 1.2 per cent between June and July, while M4
increased by 0.8 per cent.
Last month total M4 lending rose by Pounds 2.8bn, in line with expectations.
The increase may have been partly due to extra mortgage borrowing, triggered
by the stamp duty holiday which ended this week.
Figures from the British Bankers' Association on behalf of the nine biggest
UK commercial banks fit this interpretation. These groups lent a seasonally
adjusted Pounds 900m in July, with much of the total accounted for by
mortgage borrowing.
Not allowing for seasonal fluctuations, lending for house purchases by the
banks rose by Pounds 805m, out of a total increase in net lending to people
and companies of Pounds 565m.
In the industrial sector many companies made repayments, adding up to Pounds
379m for property companies, Pounds 341m for securities dealers, Pounds 118m
for construction groups and Pounds 115m for the hotels and catering sector.
However, lending to manufacturers rose by Pounds 541m.
Mr Simon Briscoe, an economist at Greenwell Montagu, a London finance group,
said: 'The figures show the economy is failing to pick up, but at least it
is not falling back.'
The British Bankers' Association said much of the upward trend in lending
was due to extra borrowing on mortgages. It said it 'remained to be seen'
whether the extra activity would continue after the end of the stamp duty
holiday last Wednesday.
Among the banks, deposits from the UK private sector fell by Pounds 1.07bn.
After adjustment for seasonal factors, the underlying movement showed a rise
of Pounds 2.6bn, with most of this rise accounted for by companies.

FT  21 AUG 92 / Small businesses criticise quality scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY SMALL businesses fear the quality assurance scheme BS 5750 will raise
their costs without improving the quality of products or services, according
to research by the Open University.
Just over half of small businesses have no intention of seeking
certification under the scheme, while a further 19 per cent are undecided
about what to do, according to the survey of more than 1,500 companies.
The standard was introduced in 1979 and more than 10,000 companies have been
certified. Quality standards are tailormade for each company and assessed by
independent experts. The British Standards Institution, which oversees the
scheme, said certification was increasingly being demanded by organisations
before they awarded contracts.
The researchers say a number of small businesses fear they will be forced
out of business because they cannot afford the costs associated with
certification.
'Whilst the majority of those making comments regard BS 5750 as an
additional and pointless bureaucratic burden, many were critical of its
relevance to small firms and wanted to see simplified applications of the
standard,' the study says.
Comments from those surveyed included: 'We are besieged by red tape and
interference and if we comply with all the extra paperwork imposed on us we
will be left with no time to transact any business . . . Regrettably the
cost of the consultants et cetera is too prohibitive - something like one
third of our annual profit.'
The institution said the standard was neither bureaucratic nor expensive -
certification can cost as little as Pounds 1,000.

FT  21 AUG 92 / Manufacturers boost spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANUFACTURERS increased investment in plant, machinery and buildings by 3
per cent in the second quarter of this year compared with the first three
months, the Central Statistical Office said yesterday.
If confirmed, this would be the first quarterly rise since the first quarter
of 1990, before the start of the recession, and underline the modest
increase in confidence reported by many businesses earlier this year.
Although the numbers hint at the possibility of an economic upturn later
this year, the City was sceptical, arguing that these particular CSO figures
are erratic and subject to revision.
The CSO seasonally-adjusted figures show investment totalled Pounds 2.48bn
at 1985 prices in the first quarter, after Pounds 2.4bn in the first
quarter. The figures for the second quarter remain 3 per cent down on the
corresponding period last year.
Separately, the CSO said manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers cut stocks
of raw materials, finished goods and components by Pounds 1.09bn in the
second quarter, after a cut of Pounds 385m in the previous quarter.
The data indicate that many businesses accelerated the rate at which they
reduced stocks during the first half, possibly because of a deterioration in
optimism about the economy.
However, interpretation is made difficult by the notorious inaccuracy of
stock figures. The CSO said the greatest amount of stock cuts involved
wholesalers, which reduced the value of these items by Pounds 492m after a
cut of Pounds 105m in the first three months.
Retailers' stocks fell by Pounds 415m, after an increase of Pounds 416m in
the first quarter, while manufacturers reduced stocks by Pounds 186m, after
a fall of Pounds 696m previously.

FT  21 AUG 92 / Delay in recovery to 1994 forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN faces four more quarters of negative growth with a recovery delayed
until 1994, Professor Doug McWilliams, economic adviser to the Confederation
of British Industry, said yesterday.
The prediction by one of the UK's leading economists - speaking for himself
and not on behalf of the CBI - is far gloomier than most published City
forecasts. It underlines growing fears about a long period of economic
inertia.
Prof McWilliams, who has a high reputation at the Treasury, predicts that
the economy will contract by 1 per cent this year, after a fall of 2.4 per
cent last year. He thinks gross domestic product will be flat next year and
expand 2 per cent in 1994.
Prof McWilliams said inflation was likely to fall to 2 per cent next year
and 1 per cent in 1994.
He set out his views in a report published by the Chartered Institute of
Marketing - an organisation to which he is economic adviser, a post separate
from his role at the CBI.
The consensus among City economists for this year is that the economy will
shrink by about 0.5 per cent, followed by a modest upturn in 1993. The CBI's
latest published forecast is for 1 per cent growth this year, followed by
expansion of 3 per cent next year.
Prof McWilliams said his prediction of no growth next year followed from
what he predicted will be fragile economic activity in the second half of
this year.
'Businesses are likely to cut back on spending, while consumer demand will
remain weak,' he said.
'1993 is going to start with Britain in quite a depressed position, with
many companies looking exposed.'
Prof McWilliams said growth should start to pick up about mid-1993, with
businesses rather than consumers being responsible for most of the upturn.
High mortgages coupled with rising unemployment and weak house prices would
be likely to put a clamp on spending, he said in the institute's report.
Even though businesses faced problems over the next year, three potential
sources of growth were likely by 1994, Prof McWilliams predicted. Falling
costs would continue to improve companies' cash positions, exports were
likely to grow and the privatised utility companies should have large
investment programmes coming on stream that would add to demand.

Just think of the comments if the next editor of The Economist or The

Alexander Chancellor, a former editor of The Spectator and founding editor
of The Independent magazine, is the latest to join the gravy train. He is
joining Tina Brown at The New Yorker and his defection comes only a few
weeks after Lynn Barber, another Independent star, announced that she will
be a contributing editor of Vanity Fair, Tina Brown's old charge. Barber
will continue to write for The Independent, but Andreas Whittam Smith does
not disguise his concern at the loss of Chancellor.
Given that British film directors are making an increasing mark in

It is not often that the British government has a lot to thank Mexico for,
but Prime Minister John Major and his embattled chancellor should light a
candle for their counterparts in Mexico City.
Normally the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development issues its annual review of the UK economy around this time of
year. Bearing in mind the UK's economic woes, the next report wouldn't make
happy reading for a government desperate for good news.
But Mexico - which wants to join the 24-nation think-tank - stepped in and
asked the OECD at short notice to run the rule over its economy as a prelude
to membership. The only way this was possible was for the OECD economists
who would have written the UK report to switch their attention to Latin
America.
The sighs of relief from Great George Street are almost audible. Had the
organisation's report appeared on schedule, Treasury officials might even
have had to interrupt chancellor Norman Lamont's Italian holiday to deal
with it. It probably won't appear now till early next year.

Will Vadim Hetman, chairman of the National Bank of Ukraine, quit after his
very public dressing down by Ukraine's President Kravchuk? Ukraine's central
bank has only been running for just over a year and Hetman is already its
second governor.
A 57-year-old technocrat who ran Ukraine's largest commercial bank before
being chosen to shake up the national bank, Hetman is no westernised
whizz-kid. But his technical competence combined with his ability to work
the old party network made him an effective choice.
However, in his quest for the status enjoyed by his western peers, Hetman
has already got a taste of the political dangers of central bankers who
speak out of turn. Humiliated by the dizzying collapse of the coupon,
Ukraine's pseudo currency, Hetman has laid into the government's massive
deficit and called for restrictions on credit and spending.
The betting is that Hetman will soldier on. But his credibility will not
survive many more such outbursts.

FT  21 AUG 92 / Universities stand by A-level offers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS and CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIVERSITIES yesterday promised to honour all their conditional offers of
places for the next academic year, in spite of the better than expected
A-level grades awarded earlier this week to school pupils in England, Wales
and Northern Ireland.
Given a record overall pass rate and a 2.1 per cent increase in the
proportion of candidates gaining grades A to C - the results generally
needed to gain admission to university - many institutions may have to make
an unexpected increase in their intake.
Prospects for school-leavers who narrowly fail to secure the grades in their
conditional offer are accordingly bleak.
'Everyone who has been promised a place will get one,' said the Committee of
Vice-Chancellors. 'It may be that some departments will have to admit extra
students over and above what they had planned.'
Prospective students trying to contact those universities which were until
recently polytechnics were hit yesterday by a strike by Nalgo, the local
government union, in support of a 10 per cent pay claim.
Nalgo said 11,000 white-collar workers in former polytechnics and in
colleges of higher education obeyed a one-day strike call.
The strike follows the rejection by Nalgo members of their employers' 4.3
per cent pay offer. The union said two-day and three-day stoppages would
follow later, but normal service would resume today.
It added that the government's offer did little to improve the pay of almost
40 per cent of staff - those on low wages - and ignored the union's claim
for improvements in service conditions.
Mr Nigel Forman, further education minister, said the Nalgo action was
'deplorable'. He added: 'The employers have offered 4.3 per cent, well ahead
of the current rate of inflation and the current average of settlements in

FT  21 AUG 92 / Retirement benefits stressed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is trying to contrast favourably the treatment of British
pensioners with their Continental counterparts as it embarks on further
consultations over its plans to equalise retirement ages for men and women.
The government's message is that British pensioners fare well by European
standards when comparing all services provided and not just the cash value
of pensions. Miss Ann Widdecombe, junior social security minister, said
yesterday: 'European comparisons simply based on cash value take us
nowhere.'
The timing of the initiative will increase speculation that the government
intends to equalise the state retirement age at 65 - a move seen as
politically unpalatable because it would require women to work five years
longer before being entitled to benefit.
The Social Security Advisory Committee, the government's adviser on pensions
policy, this month came out in favour of such a move. It suggested the
Pounds 3bn annual savings could be used to help pensioners penalised by low
pay and interrupted service in their working lives.
Miss Widdecombe, stressing that the government had still not decided between
the options for equalising state pension ages it set out last year, said she
was concerned that current discussions should mark the start of a longer
debate about how best to meet the needs of future generations of pensioners.

FT  21 AUG 92 / Procter seeks to excel with a new formula: Fairy Liquid's
market dominance has been challenged / P&amp;G's response is far from mild
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BATTLE for dominance in the market for washing-up liquid has produced
one of the subtlest though most significant brand-name shifts this year.
Procter &amp; Gamble has decided to abandon its market-leading Fairy Liquid
brand name and call its new washing-up liquid Fairy Excel.
The change is small - designed to retain a successful brand name that first
appeared in the shops 32 years ago - but there is a lot at stake.
P&amp;G was the biggest-spending television advertiser in Europe last year. The
trade periodical Euromarketing says P&amp;G spent Dollars 486m promoting 11
large brands in the European Community's six biggest markets. In the UK
alone, P&amp;G spent an estimated Pounds 70.5m on advertising last year - Pounds
10m of it on Fairy Liquid, which had UK sales of Pounds 61m.
The Fairy Liquid brand is sold in 10 countries, from Finland to Saudi Arabia
 -Fairy Excel has already been launched in Germany.
P&amp;G, a marketing-driven giant and one of the most secretive of
multinationals, has achieved a dominating 42 per cent share of the UK market
with Fairy Liquid.
Two years ago P&amp;G's rival, Lever Brothers, piggy-backed on Persil, its
successful washing powder brand, launching a new washing-up detergent,
Persil Liquid. Lever spent an estimated Pounds 4m on television advertising
for the new brand in its first five months.
But according to marketing industry estimates Persil Liquid has taken no
more than an 18 per cent market share. P&amp;G is spending about 16p on
advertising for every Pounds 1 in sales while Lever Brothers is spending at
almost twice that rate.
So if Fairy Liquid remains the first-choice brand for those who do not have
a dishwasher, why fiddle, albeit mildly, with a powerful brand name?
P&amp;G makes a point of not disclosing any information it regards as
commercially sensitive. 'Anything inquiring into our marketing and research
we regard as confidential information and we are not prepared to disclose
reasons why,' was the official comment yesterday .
But part of the reason for the new brand name lies in P&amp;G's marketing
philosophy - that it must never even be seen to be challenged. An important
factor may have been decisions by the Independent Television Association's
copy clearance executives, who monitor the content and claims of every
television advertisement to cut claims which are demonstrably false. When
Persil Liquid was launched the committee examined its claims of product
superiority and allowed its advertising campaign to go ahead.
Mr Alan Mitchell, editor of Marketing magazine, said: 'Procter's bible is
keeping a definable and demonstrable performance gap of consumer benefits -
'we give a better product to the consumer and shout about it'.'
The response from P&amp;G was swift. Within two weeks of the launch of Persil
Liquid P&amp;G staged a big price promotion in all retail outlets, giving a
two-for-the-price-of-one offer on Fairy Liquid. P&amp;G also speeded
technological improvements to its detergent. Initially it brought out a new
formula Fairy and the copy clearance committee carefully assessed its claims
for the new formula, and again did not refuse to allow the claims to be
made.
Mr Mitchell said: 'The committee finally said: 'It's a nil-all draw, neither
is superior'. The entire raison d'etre of the P&amp;G marketing bible had been
swept away.'
P&amp;G had to make a comeback by using its other strength - product innovation.
That innovation is a detergent P&amp;G says shifts 50 per cent more grease, but
with a molecular structure which penetrates skin less readily.
According to Mr Mitchell, P&amp;G has scored a marketing success with its new
brand name. 'It's very clever. They have changed the name, which focuses on
the fact they have a new product . . .a demonstrably better product.' At the
same time the look of the branding will still be dominated by the
comfortably familiar word Fairy.
P&amp;G will not say how much it has invested in research and development of the
new liquid. But the cost of the battle for brand leadership is heavy.
Fairy Excel promises softer hands. P&amp;G's hands are still punching.

Mr Richard Brucciani, chairman of the CBI's smaller firms' council, said
many family businesses were smaller than they needed to be 'often because

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW safety regulations for the offshore oil industry are to be drawn up by
the Health and Safety Commission as the third stage in implementing
recommendations of the Cullen report into the Piper Alpha disaster.
The commission said yesterday that the regulations would be expressed where
possible in terms of safety objectives rather than specifying particular
precautions. This was in line with Lord Cullen's recommendation - after the
1988 oil platform explosion in which 167 men died - that offshore safety
regulation be cast in a less prescriptive style.
The reforms will incorporate regulations needed to implement European
Community health and safety directives as well as new UK onshore
regulations. They will also include Lord Cullen's recommendations on
measures such as evacuation and rescue.
The commission hopes to have all the regulations in force in just over two
years.

BRITISH COAL is to bring forward closure of two pits in south Wales,
employing nearly 500 miners, leaving just one colliery in the area.
Miners and union officials at Betws colliery near Ammanford, Dyfed, and Taff
Merthyr pit at Trelewis, Mid Glamorgan, have been told their jobs will go in
the next few months. Plans to develop coalfaces have been cancelled for
commercial and geological reasons.
Taff Merthyr, employing 370 men, had been expected to remain open until
after next spring, but has been affected by severe underground problems.
Betws drift mine, opened in 1978, has 95 miners. It is now scheduled to
close early next year instead of in October next year.
The two closures will leave Tower colliery at Hirwaun, Mid Glamorgan, as the
only working south Wales pit, employing 370 men.

FT  21 AUG 92 / Personal pension plan sales tail off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of individuals starting personal pension plans is tapering off,
with most growth in the sector stemming from people topping up existing
plans, the Association of British Insurers said yesterday, Norma Cohen
writes.
The association unveiled its second-quarter figures for new business,
showing that sales remained buoyant overall, although the pace of increase
was slowing.
The value of Department of Social Security rebates payable to holders of
personal pension plans fell by 44 per cent in the quarter.
Mr Mike Jones, association chief executive, said: 'This means that most of
the people who are eligible for rebates have already used them.' Individuals
topping up existing plans will not be able to take advantages of tax
incentives on personal pensions.
New single premium business rose 27 per cent in the second quarter with
Pounds 1.45bn sold. Annual premium business, however, fell by 10 per cent
with only Pounds 304m sold.
Meanwhile, single premium life insurance business recorded a 28 per cent
rise in the second quarter, while new annual premium business fell by 10 per
cent.

FT  21 AUG 92 / Tesco acts against Telegraph
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TESCO supermarket group intends to join some independent newsagents in
refusing to stock The Daily Telegraph tomorrow in the latest development of
a dispute over the retailers' margins.
The newsagents are complaining that the price of the Telegraph's Saturday
editions has risen to 60p at the same time as their margins have been cut
from 26.5 per cent to 25 per cent. Tesco said it would remove the newspaper
from sale 'due to a reduction in trading terms'.
In a separate move, the High Court yesterday made an order preventing the
National Federation of Retail Newsagents and the magazine Retail Newsagent
from making any comment on the dispute.
The court also made permanent an emergency injunction that was granted to
the Telegraph last week against the August 15 issue of Retail Newsagent,
which advised its readers to act in their own interests and take the
Telegraph off the shelves.
The Telegraph agreed not to distribute any further letters to newsagents
warning them that keeping copies of the paper off display and returning them
to wholesalers for refunds could be interpreted as fraud.
W H Smith, which acts as a wholesaler as well as a retailer, has continued
to sell The Daily Telegraph. Two smaller chains - Forbuoys and Martin's -
have kept the newspaper off display for the last two weekends, only selling
it when requested.

FT  21 AUG 92 / Whitehall papers neglected by MPs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERAL parliamentary select committees have failed to examine the
expenditure white papers and annual reports issued by Whitehall departments,
a study sponsored by the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants said
yesterday.
It said the cross-party Trade and Industry, and Scottish affairs committees
had never considered the reports on expenditure plans issued by their
departments. The Employment and Welsh affairs committees had only done so
once each.
This was in spite of departmental reports and their predecessor - the public
expenditure white papers - containing vital financial and policy information
not available elsewhere.
The analysis, by Mr Andrew Likierman and Ms Alison Taylor from the London
Business School, concludes that departmental reports contain substantially
more information on a wider range of topics than the white papers that they
replaced in 1990.
The white papers provide details on the budget allocations made by the
chancellor of the exchequer to each department in the autumn statement. The
reports, which are produced by all 19 departments, include expenditure
plans, policy objectives and performance measures.
The average number of pages has risen sharply in the past two years, with
more use of colour, charts and photographs and a more structured layout.
The research shows that the circulation of the reports has risen steadily
since 1990. The greatest demand from individual purchasers is for the
reports from the departments of Trade and Industry and the Environment and
the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
Mr Likierman criticised the media for failing to give the departmental
reports more attention. There was less coverage of the reports in national
daily newspapers this year than last.

FT  21 AUG 92 / Lloyd's syndicate costs show steep increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COSTS of doing business at the Lloyd's of London insurance market rose
sharply in 1989, the most recently closed year of account, according to
figures released yesterday.
The figures were prepared by the Association of Lloyd's Members, the biggest
organisation of Names, the individuals whose assets support the market's
capital base.
They show syndicate expenses increased 45.3 per cent in 1989, following a 40
per cent rise in costs in 1988.
Mr Roger Pascall of the association said: 'Year on year this is a staggering
increase. Across the market costs must come down. Returns to Names must
improve - and quickly.'
The figures show that about 40 per cent of Lloyd's underwriters earn Pounds
100,000 a year or more. The number of underwriters earning more than Pounds
100,000 rose to 162 from 153 the previous year.
Of the 387 syndicates in the association's survey, 146 paid their
underwriters between Pounds 50,000 and Pounds 99,999, with an average
remuneration of Pounds 77,943.
The figures show that Mr Bob Wallace, of non-marine syndicate 386 managed by
Janson, Green Management, was the highest earner on the market with a total
remuneration of Pounds 412,183.
Six underwriters earned more than Pounds 300,000. More than 24 underwriters
earned more than Pounds 200,000.
Profit commissions included in the salaries, which were paid in the 1991
calendar year, relate to the 1988 underwriting year when Lloyd's reported a
Pounds 510.9m loss.
Lloyd's reported total losses of Pounds 2.06bn in the 1989 year. Under
Lloyd's three-year accounting rules the losses were unveiled to Names in
June. Syndicate expenses of Pounds 561m were equal to 28 per cent of the
insurance market's Pounds 2.06bn loss.
Mr Pascall said the costs of running syndicates was 'disproportionately
high'.

FT  21 AUG 92 / NHS shake-up likely after trusts boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MANAGEMENT of the National Health Service is likely to be reorganised
following the announcement yesterday of a further increase in the number of
self-governing trusts.
The Health Department confirmed that 151 hospitals and other NHS units in
England and Wales have applied to join the third wave of self-governing
trusts which are to be created in April.
Dr Brian Mawhinney, the health minister, has written to all remaining
non-trust hospitals and health units inviting them to join a fourth wave of
trusts in 1994.
Since the launch of the NHS reforms last year 156 trusts have been created
in two waves. Most third-wave applications are likely to be accepted,
meaning the number of trusts in the NHS will have virtually doubled by
April.
More than 70 per cent of the hospital and community health service budget
will then be spent by self-governing trusts, which are managed directly by
the NHS management executive. This would greatly increase the strain on the
executive's six regional offices.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, yesterday confirmed that the
management executive had been reviewing the arrangements for monitoring the
performance of trusts.
'The success of trusts raises the issue of how to ensure their
accountability, assuming that there are, say, 450 trusts, as well as how to
preserve their essential freedoms,' she said. 'The NHS is, after all, a
national system managed locally.'
One option is to create a new management structure by merging the
executive's regional offices with the regional health authorities. The RHAs
 -responsible for managing hospitals and health units which have not become
trusts - will have a greatly reduced role after the third and fourth waves
of trusts. Mrs Bottomley said no decision had yet been taken.
The third wave of applications includes ambulance services and community
health organisations as well as hospitals. Among those applying are
institutions such as Papworth Hospital, Cambridgeshire, which pioneered
heart transplants; and Addenbrooke's, the Cambridge teaching hospital.
Ms Dawn Primarolo, Labour's health spokeswoman, said the boost in the number
of trusts was unwelcome and 'a leap in the dark'. She said: 'There has been
no published assessment of the success of even the first wave of trust
hospitals. All we have is reports of cut-throat commercialisation, expanding
privatisation, cuts in services and in staff but not in waiting lists.'
Cohse, the health service union, said many trusts were financially
unprepared to compete in the NHS internal market.
The union published a survey yesterday which claims that a third of trust
applications contain insufficient financial data to be properly assessed. It
says a quarter rely on 'dangerously optimistic assumptions.'

FT  21 AUG 92 / Royal rebuke on Duchess photos
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BUCKINGHAM PALACE yesterday criticised publication of photographs in the
Daily Mirror and other tabloid newspapers which showed the Duchess of York
with Mr John Bryan, a US friend, by a villa poolside in the south of France.
The intimate photographs, some of which were reproduced in The Sun and Today
newspapers from the Spanish magazine Hola, were taken with a long-distance
lens by an Italian paparazzi photographer.
In a statement understood to have the authority of the Queen and the Duke of
York, Buckingham Palace said: 'We strongly disapprove of the publication of
photographs taken in such circumstances.' The Duke and Duchess were
yesterday with the Queen and other members of the Royal Family at Balmoral.
Publication of the photographs has reopened the argument over privacy and
press freedom. Mr Bryan, a 37-year-old bachelor who has been described as
the Duchess's financial adviser, failed on Wednesday in a High Court attempt
to stop publication.
Mirror Group Newspapers said a further 80,000 copies were printed yesterday
after nearly 3.5m copies produced overnight had sold out by 9am. 'Many of
our regular readers have been unable to buy their copy,' it said. 'These
figures show that there is enormous public interest in the subject.'
Lord McGregor, chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, said yesterday
that he had yet to be approached with a formal complaint by Mr Bryan that
the publication was in breach of the press code of conduct. He told BBC
Radio that he would strongly resist calls for a tightening up of the law on
privacy.
Mr Nicholas Winterton, Commons media committee chairman, said the pictures
appeared to be a 'flagrant breach of privacy', but should not prompt calls
for a legal clampdown. The only way forward was self-regulation overseen by
the commission.
Mr Richard Stott, Daily Mirror editor, defended publication of the pictures,
which appeared over seven pages. He said Mr Bryan had given countless
interviews saying the Duke of York and his wife only needed time to achieve
a reconciliation. 'He frequently said he was only the financial adviser,' Mr
Stott said.

FT  21 AUG 92 / OFT asks for details of credit-card pricing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKS AND building societies are bracing themselves for a fresh
investigation by the Office of Fair Trading into the pricing of their credit
and debit card services.
The OFT has written to them asking for detailed technical information about
the way they run their credit card pricing systems.
The organisations have until the end of next week to provide the
information. Several say the OFT's request - which follows a series of
submissions from large food retailers - is so detailed that the deadline
cannot met.
The investigation is the latest in a series by the OFT in the past 14 years.
It has twice referred the problem to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission
for inquiries, the last of which reported three years ago. Neither
investigation resulted in radical changes in the industry.
The latest investigation is the most disturbing for the banks since
retailers have succeeded in focusing the OFT's attention on the two main
elements in the credit card business: 'merchant acquiring' - the handling of
retailer card transactions - and the interchange fee, the fixed charge paid
by a retailer's bank to the cardholder's bank each time the card is used.
The changes that retailers are pressing for would produce a transformation
of the credit card industry.
Five supermarkets have pressed the OFT to allow them to handle their own
transactions. The rules of Visa International and MasterCard International
prevent the retailers from doing this by barring non-bank organisations.
The retailers' moves follow increases in January in the commissions they pay
to banks.
The OFT letter, signed by Mr Andre Hook of the competition policy division,
says retailers believe the increase in charges follows a rise in the
interchange fee.

FT  21 AUG 92 / Can-do Texas finds doing it much harder: Bush will see
little there for comfort
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF President George Bush was hoping for a shot of adrenalin from his adopted
home town this week, he must have left disappointed.
Houston is by no means as depressed as parts of New England or southern
California, but it shares with the nation a sense of diminished economic
expectations. As Republican speakers in the Astrodome tried to drum up
enthusiasm for a second Bush term, the business mood outside seemed as flat
as stale beer. The legendary Texan 'can do' spirit that Mr Bush doubtless
recalls from his own days in oil exploration is greatly subdued.
'Everybody is sitting anxiously waiting for the national economy to pick
up,' says Mr Bob Greer, chairman of Tanglewood Bank, a small local bank that
has prospered despite the state's financial crash of the mid-1980s.
The outlook is for 'continued tough times', says Mr Bill Gilmer, a senior
economist at the Houston branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. 'The
mood is very cautious and concerned.'
Local businessmen are disappointed that Mr Bush has done little to help
either the energy industry or real estate - two sectors which nearly sank
the region's economy during the 1980s. 'Mr Bush must address economic
problems in Texas if he is to carry the state in November,' says Mr Ray
Perryman, a Texas economic consultant.
Like much of the nation, Houston saw fitful signs of recovery earlier this
year. Retail sales rose 6 per cent in the first five months against the same
period last year. Car and truck sales also rose modestly. But the momentum
of recovery seems to be ebbing and few analysts expect any dynamism in
coming months. Announcements of big layoffs at local oil companies have
shaken consumer confidence.
For a while Houston hoped it might escape the national recession that began
in July 1990. The region continued to create jobs until July last year,
rekindling the myth that the Texas Gulf coast is immune to national trends.
That myth arose because many US downturns have been accompanied by higher
oil prices that worked, locally, to offset the drag from national
recessions.
After Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, oil prices soared to Dollars 35 a barrel,
giving Houston a lift despite the diversification away from energy during
the 1980s. But oil prices swiftly retreated, leaving the local economy
exposed to adverse national trends and yet another energy sector shake-out.
Job growth has turned negative in the past year and the unemployment rate,
at 7.9 per cent in June, is a shade above the national rate.
The number of US drilling rigs fell below 600 in July, a 52-year low. This
compares with about 4,500 during the boom of the early 1980s. The depression
in domestic drilling reflects unexpectedly weak natural gas prices, the
removal of tax subsidies in 1986 (which makes Texas much less fiscally
privileged than Britain's North Sea) and a shift of exploration effort
overseas, partly as a result of tougher US environmental controls.
Mr Gilmer says the banking industry has stabilised after a 'central bankers'
nightmare' in the late 1980s when nine out of 10 big Texan banks failed as a
result of sour energy and real estate loans. Bank profitability is steadily
improving but, ominously, bankers are still reluctant to lend. Indeed, as of
the first quarter, the total of outstanding loans in the south-west was
shrinking.
Small businesses - the fount of job creation according to Republicans at the
convention - are having particular difficulty obtaining loans, partly
because of tighter federal regulatory standards. If you have lost money in
the past it is almost impossible to get a loan, says Mr Greer. The chairman
of the board of the Houston branch of the Fed, who ran a business renting
machinery, was among those recently bankrupted when his bank refused to
renew a loan.
In the longer term there are grounds for cautious optimism. Mr Skip Kasdorf,
head of research at the Greater Houston Partnership (an expanded chamber of
commerce) points out that 40 per cent of Houston's economic base is now
independent of energy, compared with 16 per cent a decade ago. This means
Houston should never again experience a recession as severe as that of the
mid-1980s when 13 per cent of local jobs disappeared.
Unable to compete with financial and distribution centres such as Atlanta
and Dallas, Houston plans to carve a niche in engineering and applied
technology. The federally funded Johnson Space Centre (which operates the

And although Mr Bush is criticised locally for failing to help the oil
sector, he came to Houston bearing one gift: the North American free trade
agreement. With 40 per cent of goods sold to Mexico produced in Texas (and
70 per cent transported through the state), the pact offers a promise of
better times ahead.

A SIGN frequently seen at the Republican convention in Houston reads:
'Family rights forever, gay rights never.' Mr Patrick Buchanan, the
erstwhile presidential challenger who once said Aids was God's punishment
against gays, gave full vent to that feeling on Monday when he attacked the
Democratic party for its links with 'militant' homosexuals.
The Democrats openly endorsed gay rights and had two HIV-positive speakers,
one gay, at their New York convention. In contrast, the Republican platform
implicitly ties the spread of Aids to what it sees as immoral conduct.
Yet, behind the moral certainties, the party seems uncomfortable with the
social issues associated with Aids.
Ironically at this convention, with a central theme of 'traditional family
values,' perhaps the most touching moment came on Wednesday night when an
Aids victim spoke to delegates.
Ms Mary Fisher tried to tie her message to the party's overt theme: 'We do
the president's cause no good if we praise the American family but ignore a
virus that destroys it,' she said.
Republicans have a strategy of using gay rights and Aids as a stick to beat
the opposition, much as it used the issues of crime and communism in the
1980s. Yet, during Ms Fisher's speech, many delegates - perhaps some who had
cheered Mr Buchanan - cried.

FT  21 AUG 92 / Quayle directs attack at Clinton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HOUSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VICE-PRESIDENT Dan Quayle last night attacked the 'cultural divide' across
America between those 'fighting for what is right and (those) refusing to
see what is wrong'.
His acceptance speech to the Republican party convention constituted a stout
defence of his conservative beliefs, an attempt to redefine his image, a
slashing attack on the Democrats and Mr Bill Clinton, their nominee, and a
predictably effusive endorsement of President George Bush.
Mr Quayle portrayed himself as the embodiment of the traditional small-town
values that have featured greatly at the convention, in an apparent attempt
to emulate last month's acceptance speech of Senator Al Gore, his Democratic
counterpart. But his speech was mostly a standard indictment of the
Democrats and, on the face of it, unlikely to do much to enhance his modest
reputation.
He emphasised two crusades he has conducted over the last year. The US legal
system was spinning out of control, replete with 'frivolous law suits'
burdening the economy and weakening the judicial system. Mr Clinton, he
charged, would not address legal reform - 'the trial lawyers won't let him'.
Mr Quayle extolled the Council on Competitiveness - he is its chairman  -
which targets federal regulation, and attacked Congress for trying to kill
it off.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MOVES to impeach President Fernando Collor of Brazil, which are expected to
gather pace next week with the publication of the results of an
investigation into government corruption, will take the country's politics
into a legal and constitutional minefield.
Impeachment is a maze of parliamentary and legal procedures, involving both
chambers of Congress, the national prosecutor's office and the supreme
court.
During the final stages of the impeachment process the president would be
suspended from office for 180 days while the Chamber of Deputies analyses,
debates and votes on the charges.
A two-thirds majority of the 503-member lower house would be enough to send
to the supreme court a recommendation for conviction. The court would make
the final determination on removal from office.
The main cause for confusion is that the relevant part of the 1988
constitution has not yet been ratified, leading some lawyers to argue that
the process should be governed by a 1950 law. Mr Collor is expected to use
this uncertainty to make a series of legal challenges.
The congressional investigating commission has put back publication of the
report from tomorrow to Monday. This was because commission members needed
extra time to review the sums of money alleged to have originated from Mr
Paulo Cesar Farias, Mr Collor's election campaign treasurer and main subject
of the inquiry, and which were deposited in the bank account of the
president's personal secretary.
That money, apparently overestimated in a first tally, is alleged to have
beeen used to pay the president's personal expenses.
The committee meeting to approve the report formally is still scheduled for
Wednesday.
It is still uncertain whether the report will mention Mr Collor by name and,
if it does, whether he will be accused of any crimes. The president's legal
team sent briefs to members of Congress arguing that he could not be
incriminated by the document. Lawyers with the commission have publicly
stated that the inquiry has uncovered enough evidence for five counts of
presidential corruption.
The opposition hopes to avoid a long procedural battle by creating a
political environment to force the president to resign. After the report's
release, opposition parties plan to lend their resources to pro-impeachment
demonstrations.
Mr Collor's political support continues to waver. On Monday, Governor Leonel
Brizola of Rio de Janeiro state is expected to break with the president. The
decision was reached on Wednesday when Mr Brizola met in Braslia Congress
members from his Democratic Labour party.
Pro-impeachment forces estimate that they are 20-30 votes shy of the
two-thirds necessary to oust Mr Collor. A running poll by the opposition
newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo shows 212 on record as favouring impeachment
and 33 opposed, with the rest undecided or yet to respond.

FT  21 AUG 92 / Discordant tones over family values: Republican Party
Convention in Houston - The GOP making politics of wholesomeness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORMALLY, a highlight of any US political convention is the roll-call of the
states voting on the nominations for president and vice-president. It is a
process which gives the unsung party worker a minute in the televised sun,
as he or she proclaims something along the lines of: 'The great state of
Calicutt, the world's leading producer of triangular melons, proudly casts
all its 2 3/4 votes. .  .'
Not so on Wednesday night. The roll-call came late because the Republican
party wanted television prime time to play what it thinks is one of its
strongest tunes this year, the family values melody.
The religious overture was by a television evangelist, the Rev Pat
Robertson, than whom few are more conservative; the intermezzo by Mrs
Marilyn Quayle, than whom few are more certain in conviction; and the
rousing crescendo by Mrs Barbara Bush, than whom few rate higher in the
nation's admiration. The coda was the appearance on the podium of her 22
children and grandchildren and, finally, her husband, the president.
This parade of family wholesomeness was intended to contrast with Clinton
and Clinton, as erstwhile Republican challenger Mr Pat Buchanan maliciously
called the Democratic candidate and his lawyer wife. Far from being just
another 'baby boomer' family, they were promoting, as Mr Robertson saw it,
'a radical plan to destroy the traditional family and transfer its function
to the federal government'. Worse yet, they rated the Spotted Owl more
highly than God.
Mrs Bush, undoubted star of the evening, is far too shrewdly apolitical to
engage in anything other than indirect comparisons. She extolled her husband
as a great family man and recalled 'the best years of our lives', after the
second world war in Midland, Texas, with its round of carpools for the
children, little league baseball, church, Fourth of July fireworks, carols
at Christmas.
'Family,' she proclaimed, 'means putting your arms around each other, and
being there.' With a wife like this, the convention said to itself, how
could anybody not reasonably vote for George Bush?
Mrs Quayle was less reticent in casting her stones at the Clintons, without
mentioning them by name. She unctuously contrasted her baby-boomer values
with, by implication, those of the opposition, who also came of age in the
1960s.
'Not everyone demonstrated, dropped out, took drugs, joined in the sexual
revolution, or dodged the draft,' she proclaimed - the last a brave, even
brazen, reference since her husband avoided military service in Vietnam by
joining the National Guard reserve, as Mr Clinton sought to do.
A career, Mrs Quayle went on, was a real option for women. But 'most of us
love being mothers or wives, which gives our lives a richness that few men
or women get from their professional accomplishments alone.'
The Clintons and the Gores also made much of the strengths of their
respective families last month at the Democratic convention in New York. For
the Clintons, this was political necessity, since they had conceded that
their marriage went through a rocky period and because Mrs Hillary Clinton
is a noted advocate for the rights of children.
This has made her a particular demonic figure in the eyes of Republicans,
who have dragged out, and misquoted, a 1974 legal article in which she is
alleged to have equated motherhood with slavery.
The reality, as an editorial in USA Today pointed out yesterday, is that the
US family is not what it was. Nearly three out of five mothers of pre-school
children are now in the workforce; less than a third of all families are now
'traditional' - married couples with husband working and wife at home.
'Evoking a lost era and inflaming hatreds do not help real families,' the
newspaper, not noted for liberalism, declared. It advised both candidates
'to start pushing for the policies that can do children and families some
good'.
Mrs Bush acknowledged this reality in her speech when she addressed parents
who have sacrificed for their children: 'You may be exhausted from working a
job, or two jobs, and taking care of your children, or you may have put your
career on hold. Either way, you may wonder, as I did every now and then, am
I really doing the right thing? Yes, you are.'
Mrs Bush is so popular that she can get away with invoking the past and
acknowledging present realities. She constitutes a vote-winning appeal that,
for the night at least, put into shadow those less tolerant Republican
elements, notably the religious right, whose preference is indeed to roll
back the clock and whose broader appeal must be suspect. The representatives
of the mythical state of Calicutt could not object to playing second fiddle.

FT  21 AUG 92 / Amnesty criticises US over Haitian refugees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMNESTY International yesterday accused the US of flouting international law
by its policy of sending home Haitian refugees without attempting to
identify those at risk from human rights violations, writes Stephen Fidler,
Latin America Editor.
It said it was deeply disturbed by the policy, now being challenged before
the US Supreme Court. 'International standards insist that no one at risk of
human rights violations should be returned without a full examination of
their case.'
The US administration maintains that those fleeing Haiti are leaving for
economic, rather than political, reasons and so are not entitled to asylum.
The human rights organisation disputes this, saying tens of thousands of
Haitians have been forced into hiding by military repression.
It said other countries, such as France and Switzerland, had made it
difficult for Haitians to request asylum.
Amnesty added that, since an army coup last September, Haitians had been
suffering repression reminiscent of the Duvalier dictatorships. It had
received hundreds of reports of torture, including claims of detainees being
beaten to death.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Hubert Ingraham, a 45-year-old lawyer, is to be sworn in as prime
minister of the Bahamas following victory, in a general election on
Wednesday, over Sir Lynden Pindling, the archipelago's premier for the past
25 years.
Provisional results give Mr Ingraham's Free National Movement at least 31 of
the 49 seats contested, with the remainder going to Sir Lynden's Progressive
Liberal party.
Mr Ingraham had focused his campaign on attacking Sir Lynden's handling of
the economy, which is based on tourism and offshore financial services. He
promised to sell off state-owned enterprises, including several hotels.
The prime minister-elect was a senior member of Sir Lynden's party until his
dismissal in 1984. Mr Ingraham claimed he was fired because he had advocated
the sacking of officials who were publicly linked to narcotics trafficking.
Mr Ingraham will be faced with a need to restore local and foreign
confidence in the economy. He has promised to turn initially to problems in
the tourism sector, which has suffered from the international recession.
He pledged to 'heal' the nation, encouraging blacks and whites to
participate in the economy. 'You removed from office the longest-serving
elected leader in the Commonwealth, perhaps anywhere, and you have done it
peacefully through the electoral process. And for that I congratulate the
Bahamas,' Mr Ingraham told supporters.
Sir Lynden, 62, was one of the longest-serving prime ministers in the
Commonwealth, and has been a colourful and controversial figure.
Advocating increased economic opportunities in the Bahamas for black people,
who make up 85 per cent of the population, Sir Lynden has always argued that
he was seeking economic justice for all Bahamians.
However, his administration had been accused of being corrupt. In 1983,
there were allegations in the US that senior officials of the Bahamian
government, including Sir Lynden, were involved in drug smuggling. He axed
several officials and denied that he was involved.
The charges appeared to have had little effect on his popularity, as the PLP
won elections in 1987.

Party Convention in Houston
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HOUSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SIGN frequently seen at the Republican convention in Houston reads:
'Family rights forever, gay rights never.' Mr Patrick Buchanan, the
erstwhile presidential challenger who once said Aids was God's punishment
against gays, gave full vent to that feeling on Monday when he attacked the
Democratic party for its links with 'militant' homosexuals.
Mr Pat Robertson, the television evangelist, drove the point home with
warnings that Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee,
was seeking to give preferential treatment to homosexuals by giving them
cabinet posts, teaching positions and opening up the military.
The Democrats openly endorsed gay rights and had two HIV-positive speakers,
one gay, at their New York convention, In contrast the Republican platform
implicitly ties the spread of Aids to what it sees as base and immoral
conduct.
'Prevention is linked ultimately to personal responsibility and moral
behaviour,' the party platform reads. 'We reject the notion that the
distribution of clean needles and condoms are the solution to stopping the
spread of Aids.' Instead it suggests 'marital fidelity, abstinence and a
drug-free lifestyle'.
Yet behind the moral certainties, the Republicans seem altogether
uncomfortable with the social issues associated with Aids.
Ironically at this convention, with a central theme of 'traditional family
values,' perhaps the most touching moment came on Wednesday night when an
Aids victim spoke to delegates.
Ms Mary Fisher, the daughter of a Detroit real estate investor and prominent
party backer, said she was a white, wealthy, heterosexual who had contracted
the disease through marriage. But she pointedly added: 'I am one with the
lonely gay man sheltering a flickering candle from the cold wind of his
family's rejection.'
The Aids virus was not a political creature, she added, pleading for
tolerance. Ms Fisher tried to tie her message to the party's overt theme:
'We do the president's cause no good if we praise the American family but
ignore a virus that destroys it.'
Indeed, the Republicans, like the Democrats, support considerable funding
for research, prevention and treatment of Aids. The Republican platform
explicitly endorses 'a massive commitment of resources' for research to stem
the tide of the disease and proudly notes that the Bush administration has
spent Dollars 4.2bn (Pounds 2.19bn) in the past four years.
The Republicans have embarked on a strategy of using gay rights and Aids as
a stick to beat the opposition, much as it used the issues of crime and
communism in the 1980s. Yet during Ms Fisher's speech, many delegates -
perhaps even some of the same delegates who cheered Mr Buchanan and Mr
Robertson - burst into tears.

FT  21 AUG 92 / Breakthrough in Canadian unity negotiations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO, MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S political leaders have made a breakthrough in national unity talks
by agreeing on far-reaching changes in the composition of the two houses of
parliament.
The deal, which balances equal representation for all 10 provinces in a
reformed Senate with a guaranteed percentage of seats for Quebec in an
enlarged House of Commons, has brightened the mood at the constitutional
conference in Ottawa, now in its fourth day.
Participants have cautioned, however, that several emotive issues remain in
negotiations between Mr Brian Mulroney, the prime minister, leaders of the
10 provinces and two Arctic territories, and aboriginal groups. These
include the definition and enforcement of aboriginal self-government,
Quebec's demand for wider powers over some matters now under federal
jurisdiction, and Mr Mulroney's insistence on a stronger mechanism to force
provinces to lower non-tariff trade barriers.
The talks are likely to conclude, in success or failure, by the end of next
week. Mr Robert Bourassa, Quebec's premier, must formulate a question in
early September for the national unity referendum which the province is to
hold in October.
Besides, Canadians of all political persuasions are impatient to put the
long constitutional wrangle behind them.
The agreement on parliamentary reform represents a characteristically
Canadian compromise.
Quebec, which views itself as the guardian of one of Canada's two founding
language groups, would be guaranteed 25 per cent of the Commons seats,
roughly equal to its share of Canada's population.
Western and Atlantic provinces would have the same number of seats in the
revamped Senate as Quebec and Ontario, the most powerful and populous
province. The Senate would have limited veto powers, but its influence would
be enhanced by converting the present appointed chamber to one largely
elected.
Hard-line Quebec nationalists quickly denounced the agreement as a sell-out
by Mr Bourassa. But the province's two biggest newspapers indicated both
drawbacks and advantages.
Canada's inflation rate accelerated slightly to 1.3 per cent in the year to
July, from a 30-year low of 1.1 per cent in June, Statistics Canada said
yesterday.
The low inflation rate, with progress at the constitutional talks, has
spurred forecasts that Canadian banks will soon lower their prime lending
rate from 6.5 per cent.

FT  21 AUG 92 / UK urges Iraq to free jailed Briton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN yesterday demanded that Iraq release Mr Paul Steven Ride, after it
was learnt that the 33-year-old Briton had been sentenced to seven years'
jail for illegally crossing the border from Kuwait, Reuter reports.
His sentencing adds to tension between Britain and Iraq, already heightened
by the British government decision on Tuesday to send warplanes to the Gulf
to help bar Iraqi jets from a planned 'no-fly' zone in southern Iraq.
Mr Ride, who was working in Kuwait for the British catering company, Taylor
International, disappeared on June 28 after he left his office in al-Jahrah,
west of Kuwait city.
The Foreign Office said it had learnt - through the Russian embassy in
Baghdad - that he had been sentenced by a Baghdad court. He was to be taken
to the prison on the outskirts of Baghdad where another Briton, Mr Ian
Richter, had been held until his release last November, after serving five
years on bribery charges.
The sentence was 'totally disproportionate to the alleged offence,' the
Foreign Office said. 'This is yet another example of the lengths to which
the government of Iraq will go to exploit innocent civilians in blatant
disregard of their human rights or any internationally accepted standard of
behaviour.'
The Foreign Office said it would 'use all means at our disposal, all
pressure we can bring to bear' to obtain Mr Ride's 'prompt release'.
Britain has no diplomatic presence in Baghdad as relations were broken off
in February last year at the start of the Gulf war. It has protested about
the sentencing to the head of the Iraqi interest section at the Jordanian
embassy in London.
Diplomats in Baghdad had expected that Mr Ride would be expelled and had not
predicted a jail term.
They believe Mr Ride became lost in the desert and accidentally drove across
the border before being arrested by Iraqi security men, although they were
puzzled how he got through military checkpoints and minefields.
Mr Ride was visited by the International Committee of the Red Cross last
Saturday and the Russian embassy has been seeking a permit to visit him.
His wife and their 15-month-old son live in north London.

BRITAIN'S opposition Labour party yesterday called for the UK's aid effort
to famine-hit Somalia to be stepped up, acusing the government, the EC and
the United Nations of 'dithering disgracefully'.
Returning from a four-day visit to the area, Mr Tony Worthington, Labour

peacekeeping forces in Somalia to be clarified and for a UN conference of
reconciliation between the local parties to be convened. Baroness Chalker,
the overseas development minister, should visit the country to 'see for
herself' the dreadful conditions prevailing, he said.
The government retorted that Britain had been among the first countries to
respond as 'new possibilities for delivery' had opened up, and said it had
provided over Pounds 19m worth of emergency aid since January 1991. It said
Baroness Chalker planned to visit Somalia next month with EC colleagues.

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TOKYO share prices rallied strongly as investor sentiment grew more positive
towards government efforts to support the nation's beleaguered financial
industry.
The Nikkei average rose by 617.02 yesterday to close above the 15,000 level
at 15,267.76. The upward momentum continued early today, with the Nikkei up
another 350 points in late morning trade.
The rally came despite fresh evidence that consumer spending is falling
rapidly, raising serious questions about how soon the economy can recover
its path of growth and help to restore corporate profits.
Investors were encouraged by a statement from Mr Yasushi Mieno, the central
bank governor, supporting the idea, currently under discussion, of banks
forming a joint corporation to purchase land currently held as collateral
for non-performing loans.
The land would then be made available for sale to local and central
government authorities, who would be expected to purchase it with funds
provided in a supplementary budget being drawn up by the government. Reports
yesterday suggested that the package would be ready for presentation at the
end of the month.
Although Mr Mieno said the central bank was not considering financial
backing for the plan, investors interpreted his statement as evidence that
the authorities were taking the financial markets' difficulties seriously
and working in tandem to provide support.
The Finance Ministry was also reported to be considering providing banks
with tax incentives to take part in the rescue of heavily indebted non-bank
financial institutions by, for example, lending money at below market rates.
An official from the National Tax Administration Agency said the agency and
the ministry were discussing 'whether to adopt a flexible approach to permit
banks to set aside special loan loss reserves (that would not be taxed).'
'The authorities finally seem to be serious about providing a safety net for
the banks,' said Ms Alicia Ogawa, banking analyst at SG Warburg Securities.
'If the authorities provide tax incentives for banks, it will help them
speed up bad loan write-offs and undertake more positive support plans for
ailing borrowers,' said Mr Nozomu Kunishige of Kleinwort Benson
International.
In April, the Ministry of Finance said loans by Japan's top 21 banks in
arrears by six months or more in 1991-92 were worth between seven trillion
(thousand billion) and eight trillion yen.
Special loan loss reserves set aside by Japan's 11 big banks surged to
Y835.9bn (Pounds 3.4bn) at the end of March, up from Y492.3bn a year
earlier. Bad loans have been increasing as a result of the economic slowdown
and stagnant property markets, analysts said.
In spite of yesterday's big rise in the market, however, investors remained
cautious. The rally was caused when investors who were betting on a decline
in the market by selling short covered their positions by buying shares.
There is still no rush of new money into the market and the economic news
continues to be bleak.
Average household spending in June declined by 3.2 per cent in real terms
compared to June last year, according to a survey by the Management and
Co-ordination Agency. Spending by wage-earning households declined by 3.4
per cent.
For the second quarter of the year, average spending was off by 0.6 per
cent. After adjustment for the increased number of households, Mr Geoffrey
Barker, economist at Baring Securities, estimated that consumer spending
would contribute nothing to second quarter economic growth.
'It is difficult to see how there will not be a significant negative GNP
figure for the second quarter,' he said.
GNP figures, which will influence the size of any government supplemental
spending package, will be released next month. The unexpected drop in
consumer spending will force the government to take strong measures to get
the economy moving again.

MR Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, yesterday met Zhou Nan, Beijing's
most senior official in Hong Kong, for talks that lasted almost twice as
long as planned.
A brief government statement after the nearly two-hour meeting said the
discussions had been 'very useful' and had touched on many of the main
issues facing Hong Kong. It did not elaborate.
Hong Kong officials said that both men presented their previously stated
positions on the current wrangle over the colony's multi-billion dollar
airport scheme, the pace of decision-making within the Anglo-Chinese Joint
Liaison Committee, and other issues.
Disagreement over the new airport's financing continues to mar Sino-British
ties despite a year-old agreement to clear remaining obstacles to the
airport's construction. China so far has failed to approve the financing
plan, holding up work on the project which is supposed to open by July 1997,
when Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule.
Mr Patten is keen to establish a channel of communication with decision
makers in Beijing. The length of this first meeting was taken as an
encouraging sign he might be able to do business with Zhou.
Mr Patten said the meeting had been 'very friendly' and that he looked
forward to regular and productive contacts with Zhou in the future.
The New China News Agency, of which Zhou is director, released a statement
saying that Zhou hoped to build a 'good working relationship' with the
governor.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index yesterday fell 106.47 points, or 1.89 per cent,
to 5,513.97. This was mostly attributed to foreign selling in a very thin
market.

ARAB participants in Middle East peace talks will go to Washington on Monday
for the scheduled resumption of negotiations, despite their criticism of
what they regard as US bias towards Israel.
Meeting in Damascus yesterday, officials representing Israel's neighbours
and the Palestinians expressed their 'readiness' to attend the Washington
talks.
However, Arab officials also voiced strong misgivings about the US decision
to provide Israel with billions of dollars of loan guarantees without
securing Israeli agreement to a complete settlement freeze in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza.
Mr Farouk al-Shara, Syria's foreign minister, charged that Washington had
damaged its credibility as an honest broker. Arabs believe President Bush's
decision to approve the Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.2bn) in loan guarantees was
hasty and dictated by his desire to make peace with the American Jewish
community before November's presidential election.
'The US gave the loan guarantees to Israel without getting a pledge ensuring
a total halt of Israeli settlement activities in the occupied territories,'
Mr Shara said.
The Damascus meeting also called Washington's pledge to maintain Israel's
military edge over the Arabs 'contrary to peace'.
The Palestinians had threatened to postpone their participation in the
Washington talks in protest at what they regarded as a softening in the US
position on settlements.
The Washington talks will be the sixth round since the latest US-sponsored
Middle East process was launched in Madrid last October.
Negotiations had made scant progress but the election of a new and
apparently more flexible government in Israel has raised hopes of progress.
Lebanon, Jordan, Syria and Egypt were represented in Damascus yesterday by
their foreign ministers. Also participating was Mr Farouk Kaddoumi, the
veteran PLO official.

Taiwan will draft a bill to govern relations with Hong Kong after the

The bill will provide a legal framework for Taiwan's policy on issues such

unofficial Taiwanese representative offices in the territory.
Peng Shu-hung of the cabinet's Mainland Affairs Council said the council was
soliciting the views of scholars, officials and businessmen on the bill. He
denied a newspaper report that it would be drafted within a year, saying
there was no timetable.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED NATIONS officials were yesterday in contact with leaders of
Afghanistan's two warring factions in an effort to ensure the safe
evacuation of western diplomats from Kabul.
Rockets have damaged the French and Turkish embassies and two Russian
embassy staff were killed by rockets last week.
However, it was not immediately clear if a temporary ceasefire could be
arranged two weeks after intense fighting broke out between forces loyal to
hardline dissident leader Mr Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and president Burhanuddin
Rabbani.
Fighting was less intense overnight following a sustained rocket attack on
Kabul which caused hundreds of casualties.
Government troops killed 70 Hezb fighters and injured 120 in the southern
Bini Hisar district and destroyed two rocket batteries, Kabul Radio said.
At least 100,000 people are thought to have left the city in search of
shelter and food, western diplomats say. Life has been severely disrupted
because of damage to water and electricity supplies, and large-scale food
shortages. Hospitals are severely short of medical supplies.
Mr Hekmatyar has demanded the expulsion of Uzbek militiamen led by Gen
Rashid Dostum, as a prerequisite for peace.
Gen Dostum was previously a close ally of former communist-backed President
Najibullah, who fell from power in April this year. However, Gen Dostum has
assumed a key role in the new mujahideen government, after changing sides to
support Ahmed Shah Masood, the new mujahideen defence minister.
This week, the Pakistani government stepped up pressure on Mr Hekmatyar by
cutting supplies in an effort to force him to seek a peaceful resolution.
But he has vowed to fight on.
Some officials believe that his fighters, who now occupy strategically
important ground on the hills outside Kabul, may have to move when winter
snowfalls begin. President Rabbani was yesterday reported to have appealed
to Iran for badly-needed fuel supplies and other aid.
'He (Rabbani) hoped Iran would provide the Afghan people with more relief
supplies, especially oil products, at this critical period,' the Iranian
News Agency said. Iran was a supporter of the Moslem mujahideen guerrilla
groups which toppled the Soviet-installed government.
Last week Mr Rafsanjani told Mr Ustad Farid, since sacked as Afghanistan's
interim prime minister, that Iran was ready to help its neighbour but
reconstruction aid could only be made when calm returned to the country.
A mujahideen peace mission has met Mr Masood and plans a round of talks with
Mr Hekmatyar today, Reuter adds.
The 15-man team sent by Governor Abdul Qadeer of neighbouring Nangarhar
province arrived in Kabul on Tuesday to try to negotiate a ceasefire.
Diplomats said they were not optimistic about a ceasefire, noting that
several had been agreed and broken between Mr Hekmatyar's Hezb-e-Islami and
the government.

FT  21 AUG 92 / Lebanese poll plan revives fear of violence / A look at why
the country's first post-civil war election is so bitterly opposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LARA MARLOWE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Elias Hrawi's Syrian-backed government yesterday appeared
determined to go ahead on Sunday with the country's first parliamentary
elections in almost two decades, in spite of opposition from most of the
country's Christians and widespread fears that the poll could lead to
renewed violence.
Christian groups want the elections postponed until after Syrian troops
withdraw from Beirut and other areas in the autumn as agreed in a
Moslem-Christian peace agreement signed in the Saudi resort of Taif in 1989.
Lebanese politicians, the Maronite Patriarch, the Papal Nuncio and the
French ambassador to Lebanon continued a flurry of consultations yesterday
in a last-ditch attempt to postpone Sunday's voting and stave off a
three-day protest strike by Lebanon's Christian community starting today.
A stormy cabinet meeting called to discuss the elections broke off
inconclusively Wednesday.
Three Christian members of parliament brought an implicit threat back from
their meeting in Damascus with Mr Abdel-Halim Khaddam, the Syrian Vice
President, on Wednesday night. 'If those boycotting the elections endanger
security,' the deputies quoted Mr Khaddam as saying, 'then no one should
expect Syria to help the Christians. No power in the world will come to
their assistance.'
Opponents and supporters of the elections accuse each other of undermining
national unity and dire predictions are made by both sides.
Mr Nabih Berri, leader of the pro-Syria Amal Shia movement and a candidate
in the south, said he fears the Lebanese army - responsible for security
during the poll - could disintegrate, provoking the return of the militias.
General Antoine Lahd, the leader of Israel's South Lebanon Army (SLA)
militia allies in southern Lebanon, condemned what he called 'sham and
illegitimate elections' and warned of 'dangerous developments' if they take
place. Inhabitants of the Israeli-occupied area would have to obtain passes
from the SLA to vote in territory controlled by the United Nations or the
Lebanese government.
Mr Uri Lubrani, the Israeli official responsible for Israeli activities in
Lebanon, later expressed support for General Lahd's position and accused
Syria of trying to force Lebanon into 'bogus elections.'
Voting is scheduled to start on August 23 in northern Lebanon and the Bekaa
Valley, the two regions of Lebanon most firmly under Syrian control. Prime
Minister Rashid Solh is reportedly willing to postpone the August 30
Beirut-Mount Lebanon and September 6 southern Lebanon rounds - on condition
that elections take place there before October 15 when the present
parliament will be dissolved.
But such a 'compromise' is unlikely to satisfy the Christian opposition
unless Syrian troops withdraw from Beirut in the meantime.
Twenty-two contestants - including four prominent Moslems - withdrew their
candidacy this week in protest at the conditions under which the elections
are being held. In addition to the presence of foreign troops, opponents say
the pre-civil war voters' lists are invalid, that a supervisory body
required by the constitution was not formed and that thousands of people
displaced by the war are afraid to go to their home villages to vote.
The Taif Peace Accords established Lebanon's 16 mohafezat, or provinces, as
voting districts. But the government has maintained the smaller caza where
necessary to favour pro-Syrian, pro-government candidates in the Chouf and
the south.
Yet despite the controversy and the LPounds 10m (Pounds 2,220) registration
fee, there is no shortage of candidates for the parliamentary seats, which
still carry privileges in Lebanese society: 275 candidates are disputing 51
seats in the Bekaa and northern Lebanon, while in Beirut and Mount Lebanon,
198 are competing for 54 seats.
Registration for the remaining 23 seats has not yet closed. Thousands of
photo-posters of candidates cover the walls of Beirut, but the lackluster
campaign has elicited more cynicism than enthusiasm.
One exception, Mr Adnan Traboulsi, the fundamentalist leader of a poor but
respected Sunni Moslem clan, assembled 50,000 supporters at a rally last
week. Mr Traboulsi's posters proclaim him to be 'an honest man' in a country
rife with corruption.
The uncertainty surrounding the elections has increased pressure on the
Lebanese pound, which traded yesterday at up to LPounds 2,500 to the dollar
after rising to LPounds 2,340 on the strength of Central Bank intervention
at the beginning of the week. Central Bank officials last week said the Bank
was spending some Dollars 4m each day in foreign exchange reserves to shore
up the currency.

<TEXT>
THE United Nations yesterday flew the first aircraft of food in a month to
300,000 starving civilians trapped in the besieged government-held garrison
town of Juba, in southern Sudan, despite rebel threats they would shoot the
aircraft down.
The successful relief flight came as Africa Watch, an influential
international human rights body, condemned rebel threats to shoot down
aircraft carrying food as showing 'a callous disregard for the welfare of
the people on whose behalf (they) claim to be fighting'.
Mr Paul Mitchell, an official with the UN World Food Programme, said a
Russian Ilyushin 76 transporter aircraft carrying 40 tonnes of food and 5
tonnes of medicines landed successfully in Juba, the first UN aircraft to
land in the town since the UN suspended relief flights due to insecurity on
July 16th.
The 300,000 civilians trapped in Juba, which is under siege by the rebel
Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), face death from starvation and are
completely dependent on an airlift for their survival.
'Food stocks ran out 10 days ago, medicines and supplementary foods are
virtually non-existent,' Mr Mitchell said yesterday. 'Reports from the city
tell of sharp increases of malnutrition and related diseases.'
Africa Watch called yesterday for the SPLA to withdraw its threat to relief
flights immediately.
Noting that a year has passed since the SPLA split into two factions after
allegations of human rights abuses against Dr John Garang, the putative
leader of the SPLA, Africa Watch said human rights violations within the
movement 'continue unabated'.
The organisation called on Dr Garang to release all detainees and demanded
that up to 3,000 child refugees - who are believed to have been forced by
the SPLA to return to Sudan, from Kenya, to fight as child soldiers on the
Juba front - be returned to the protection of the United Nations High
Commission for Refugees (UNHCR).
It also strongly criticised the UNHCR for allowing the children to be
abducted from their protection.
Last night, Mr Lam Akol, a leader of the break-away faction of the SPLA,
confirmed that Commander Mr Silva Kiir, Dr Garang's chief of security, had
forced the children to return to Narus in southern Sudan so that they could
fight on the Juba front.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THIS week's announcement from the Southern African Development Co-ordination
Conference (SADCC) that it plans to turn itself into the more ambitious
Southern African Development Community (SADC) is a sign it had failed to
deliver the goods.
While few dispute the need for a change, it is unclear that this initiative,
which aims to replace a loose arrangement of sectoral co-operation between
nine nations with a formal treaty seeking greater economic integration, is
for the better. With the premise of SADC seeming to provide a bulwark
against South Africa's economic dominance in the region, it seems set to
fail.
As Johannesburg's Business Day argues, it seems an 'exercise in futility' to
try to deny economic links with South Africa just when most foreign interest
in the region wants to use it as a springboard, not a main player. SADCC's
change was forced on it by the South Africa reform process undermining a
basic tenet of its existence: the need to achieve economic independence from
a hostile neighbour (South Africa itself).
Formed in 1980 with nine member states (Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi,
Mozambique, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe), since joined by
post-independence Namibia, SADCC sought to reduce external economic
dependence, especially on South Africa, and promote economic development.
This week's changeover to the new SADC raises questions on two fronts: the
relationship between SADC and South Africa; and the need for greater
economic integration.
South Africa elicits contradictory reactions among SADC members. It can be
seen as the saviour - the region's economic locomotive and, with foreign aid
flows not as free as in the past, a potential paymaster - or feared, as an
economy able to swamp its neighbours.
The dilemma is real, but this week's decision suggests SADC prefers to delay
confronting it. Sound political reasons exist for not having any truck with
South Africa until it has achieved full democracy, but it seems clear the
only hope for achieving a useful regional economic grouping is with South
Africa at its core. Re-organising before addressing the South Africa issue
seems futile.
Setting aside South Africa, analysts are sceptical about the route of deeper
economic integration chosen by SADC. Dr Eric Leistner of the Africa
Institute notes: 'The aims of SADC are more ambitious, so they will fail
more spectacularly (than SADCC).'
Three major problems are involved in this route: the first concerns the
Preferential Trade Agreement (PTA). Eight of SADC's members belong to the
PTA, and SADC overlaps considerably with the PTA, yet SADC will not merge
with PTA - an illogical stance. Second, PTA has had limited success in its
aims, such as tariff reduction, due to lack of economic resources and
political will on the part of its members. Why should things be different
for SADC? Also, the limited success enjoyed in achieving the far less
demanding aims of SADCC casts serious doubt on whether SADC can hope to
progress in the difficult task of economic integration.
Finally, the enormous economic disparities between the member countries of
SADC, in terms of such factors as inflation and access to foreign currency,
make integration problematical. Given these problems, and an unwillingness
to cede sovereignty to regional bodies, a more promising route would for the
SADC countries to focus on aims such as co-operation in sectors such as
energy, transport and movement of goods.

FT  21 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Now Istanbul cares how it is treated - An
ambitious Dollars 6bn sewerage programme for the 21st century
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE previous mayor of Istanbul promised to make the waters of the Golden
Horn as blue as his eyes. Mr Nurettin Sozen, the present incumbent, is no
less ambitious. He is spending Dollars 6bn on a water and sewage programme
for the city's projected 20m population by the year 2010.
It involves new reservoirs, several thousand miles of supply pipe, 15 sewage
plants, and a Dollars 1bn plan to divert a river 150 miles away on the Asian
mainland.
For Turkey's largest city, water supply is not a new problem. If the complex
of aqueducts is any measure, the issue has taxed city planners from
Byzantine times.
But today the waters of this part of the Levant are no longer so sweet.
There is not a single biological sewage treatment plant for a population of
9m people. Officials say more than 90 per cent of the city's effluent is
dumped untreated into the Bosporus or the Sea of Marmara. The remainder is
only partly screened.
Omerli lake, Istanbul's principal water source supplying half the city's
drinking water, is in danger of contamination. Mr Ergun Goknel, head of
Iski, the Istanbul water authority, estimates that 600,000 illegal settlers
have built homes on nearby public land and are discharging their effluent
into the reservoir.
The Berlin water authority has been contracted to look at ways to protect
this vital watershed, a project funded by a Dollars 11.2m credit from the
Norwegian Nordic Bank. Iski is also talking to the World Bank about a
Dollars 1bn programme to protect the reservoir shoreline and provide
existing settlements with full water and sewage treatment.
The World Bank and other soft loan agencies seem set to play a central role
in all of this. Already the German government agency KFW has a water supply
project for European Istanbul. Japan's Overseas Economic Co-operation Fund
(OECF) is looking at a proposal to redirect the Melen river some 150 miles
from the river mouth on the Black Sea to supply the Asian half of the city.
Iski has also had to put its own financial house in order. About half Iski's
financing requirement is expected to be provided by internal revenues. A few
years ago, Iski was raising bonds to fund its working capital needs. Today,
unlike many municipal authorities in Turkey, Iski shows a strong financial
improvement, with water sales not charged for down to 32 per cent in
1990-91, down from 50 per cent the year before. Mr Goknel has introduced new
billing methods, made improvements to reduce system losses and adjusted the
tariff to reflect inflation, now 70 per cent.
The corridors of Iski's head office are inundated with foreign equipment
suppliers and local construction groups awaiting the latest round of
tenders. Taylor Binnie, the UK water consultant, has already designed sewage
systems for both sides of the Golden Horn - the North and South Halic
schemes.
The southern section was completed in 1988 at a cost of Dollars 50m. The
following year, the new municipality ordered that all waste water sea
discharges had first to receive full biological treatment. The treatment
plant and sea outfall at the end of the North Halic section had to be
redesigned. Tenders are expected to go out next year for the plant, but
until it is built in five years time, sewage on the European shore north of
Halic will continue to empty into the Golden Horn and the Bosporus
untreated.
Earlier this month, Binnie now part of the Acer construction group, was
commissioned to design the next phase of the sewage network. The scheme for
the Asian side will intercept the old sewage collectors and streams which
now feed directly into the Bosporus.
Under an earlier agreement with Iski in 1983, Binnie had devised what seemed
an ingenious method of utilising the Bosporus' natural powers for sewage
purification.
The attraction of the scheme was that it utilised the awesome Bosporus
current, avoided both an extensive pipelines network and treatment plants,
and thus required little land acquisition, a big problem in a crowded city.
Under Iski's new environmental rules, however, Binnie was required to find a
site suitable for a large-scale treatment plant. It chose Riva, 30 miles
away on the Black Sea coast. The engineering involves construction of the
main interceptor through the mountains to the treatment plant. According to
project manager Mr Jan Pavel, the interceptor will be as wide as the tunnels
in the London Underground railway.

US knitwear and sportswear makers have expressed opposition to the North
American free trade agreement, saying it will spur unemployment and damage
US companies and communities, Nancy Dunne reports from Washington.
While praising negotiators for putting into place 'sound' rules of origin,
designed to create a competitive North American textile and apparel
industry, the board of the National Knitwear and Sportswear Association said
approval of the agreement would 'tell our industry and its workers they
should not count on the federal government's interest in maintaining apparel
manufacturing operations in the US.
'We cannot understand where our people will find new work, for what jobs
they will be re-educated and/or retrained, where those jobs are expected to
be located, or who will bear the burden of the huge piece of social
engineering in the name of free trade.
'Without domestic workers, there are no domestic buyers.'

the first of its kind between the two countries.
The preliminary agreement was reached by Mr Kwon Young-gak, head of the
South Korean corporation and Yi Zhikuan, honorary chairman of Tianjin
Economic and Technological Development Area. Under the preliminary
agreement, South Korean companies will obtain rights to 130,000 sq metres in
Tianjin for 50 years. KLDC will manage construction of an industrial complex
due to begin in April 1993 for completion by the end of 1994.
The two sides will sign a final contract when their governments give
approval. They will continue to negotiate the price of the land. KLDC will
start receiving applications from October from domestic companies seeking to
operate factories in the complex.

FT  21 AUG 92 / World Trade News: World airlines fall further into loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE world's airline industry fell further into loss last year as smaller
companies descended from break-even into a Dollars 1bn deficit, a survey out
yesterday says, Daniel Green reports.
The 20 biggest airlines cut their losses last year from Dollars 2.7bn in
1990 to Dollars 830m, largely because of the failure of two US airlines,
Eastern and Pan Am.
Between 1990 and 1991, Eastern's loss of Dollars 1.1bn dropped out of the
total and Pan Am cut its deficit from Dollars 638m to a first-half Dollars
283m, the number included in the total for the year.
The report, by Airline Business, shows American Airlines strengthening its
position as the world's biggest airline by sales (Dollars 12.89bn), though
it made only a Dollars 5m operating profit. American also topped the list on
numbers of passengers carried and staff employed.
United Airlines, also of the US, and Air France remain in second and third
positions. A third US carrier, Delta, moved up from sixth to fourth place,
leapfrogging Lufthansa and British Airways.
BA was the most profitable airline in the top 15, the report says.
Fastest-growing carrier was Virgin Atlantic of the UK, whose sales grew 81
per cent to Dollars 584m.
A shift in aircraft delivery has occurred towards the larger airlines: the
top 20 added 374 aircraft last year, while the next 80 reduced the size of
their fleets by 123.
Airline Business' figures are lower than those of the International Air
Transport Association (IATA), partly because it includes non-IATA carriers
such as SouthWest Airlines of the US and United Parcel Services.
A A Tupolev Tu-204 twin-engined passenger aircraft powered by Rolls-Royce
RB211-535E4 engines has made successful test flights near Moscow - part of a
contract between Rolls-Royce and Tupolev signed in April that could be worth
Pounds 500m.

FT  21 AUG 92 / Nato scales down military plans for Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff and Agencies
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATO'S latest plans to protect relief convoys in the former Yugoslav
republic of Bosnia have been substantially scaled down after western
governments this week pulled back from making substantial military
commitments to the area.
Alliance sources told Reuter yesterday new plans would probably involve no
more than 10,000 troops. This compares with earlier estimates of 100,000
troops needed to secure a land corridor from the Adriatic port of Split to
the besieged Bosnian capital of Sarajevo.
The new plan envisages that troops would only secure the port, from which
escorted convoys will leave once they have the go-ahead from the warring
factions.
Military planners are reported to have been encouraged by the UN's
successful delivery of food by road to the besieged town of Gorazde earlier
this week.
The latest Nato thinking brings the alliance closer to plans being developed
by the nine-nation Western European Union (WEU), although any eventual
operation will probably be carried out under United Nations auspices.
The Nato plan is due to be considered by ambassadors on Monday. But some
senior officers say the new blueprint could entail a much greater risk for
western troops, a danger which was underlined yesterday when a sniper killed
a Ukrainian soldier serving with United Nations peacekeeping forces in
Sarajevo.
Meanwhile, aid officials in Zagreb, the Croatian capital, yesterday
confirmed that 'negotiations are in progress with all parties in Bosnia to
liberate people' from detention camps in Bosnia.
The officials would not confirm a US report that Serb authorities had
indicated they might open the camps if the international community assumes
responsibility for the inmates, but a senior western official said: 'The
report is credible. Serbs have in recent days expressed some willingness to
turn some or all prisoners out of the camps.'
An International Committee of the Red Cross official warned, however, that
'there is a real problem. You can't just fling open the doors. Many of them
are safer in the camps than outside, where they will only fall victim to
this 'ethnic cleansing'.'
US intelligence agencies estimate there are about 170,000 people in the
camps, mostly run by Serbs although some are operated by Croats and Moslems.
In New York, the 47-member UN Islamic group called yesterday for a resumed
session of the General Assembly to discuss the crisis over
Bosnia-Hercegovina. UN officials said the session would probably begin on
Monday so that members might voice their views before the London conference
that will be co-chaired by Mr John Major, UK prime minister, and Mr Boutros
Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general.
An immediate goal of the Islamic states is to bring pressure through the
179-member Assembly on the Security Council to lift the arms embargo imposed
on Bosnia-Hercegovina while it was still a republic within former
Yugoslavia.

FT  21 AUG 92 / Eastern Europe banks on the west for advice: A discreet
battle to influence the direction of monetary institutions in the evolving
market economies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER and PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England and the Bundesbank are fighting a discreet battle - for
the hearts and minds of eastern Europe's fledgling central bankers.
At stake is the future shape of capitalism in the new democracies as they
evolve towards a market economy. At this stage, however, the issues tend to
be strictly practical - for example advising on accounting and payment
systems, or explaining just how you control money supply.
Compared with the Bank of England and the Banque de France, which have had
long experience of giving advice and support to central banks in developing
countries, the Bundesbank is a comparative newcomer to the advisory game.
Last year it set up a special department to provide 'technical assistance'
in this field, in an attempt to expand German influence in parts of the
world undergoing political and economic change.
Apart from eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, the Bundesbank has
been in contact with a number of countries from Latin America which have
reformed their central banks in recent years.
Stressing Germany's post-war success in fighting inflation, the Bundesbank
places special emphasis on the need for central banking independence.
Would-be central bankers from eastern Europe, says Mr Hans Tietmeyer,
vice-president of the Bundesbank, are particularly interested in 'how and
where the bank notes for a new currency are to be printed, what they are to
be called, how big they ought to be and what colour they ought to have'.
But, says Mr Tietmeyer, these preoccupations ought to be secondary compared
with questions such as how a central bank controls the circulation of money
or manages a country's foreign exchange reserves - or copes with the
'overhang' of money from a previous currency.
'It is not surprising that people come to us with these requests,' Mr
Tietmeyer says. 'Central banking is one area where we in Germany have a
reputation for special expertise.'
More than 250 east European bankers have come to Frankfurt to learn how the
Bundesbank functions, some of them staying for up to two months. Up to 40
German central bankers have had short secondments to the central banks of
the former communist states, for example, giving help in setting up
accounting systems at the new Russian central bank.
In June, the Bundesbank held a special conference in Prague for the staff of
Czechoslovakia's central bank - the first time it has offered a training
course for central bankers outside Germany.
The Bundesbank has also offered advice to the states of Estonia, Lithuania
and Latvia as they re-established their central banks during the past year,
after 50 years of Soviet rule. Estonia, for instance, gave its central bank
a statute of independence on Bundesbank lines - and specifically pegged its
new currency, the kroon, to the D-Mark when it was launched in June.
The Bank of England has also received numerous requests for help from the
east. Over the past 18 months, 200 central bankers from eastern Europe and
the republics of the former Soviet Union have been to London for special
courses and about 15 of the Bank's staff have spent time on secondment to
the east.
Bank officials admit the rivalry with the Bundesbank. This has been
particularly delicate in areas of the former eastern bloc conquered by
Germany during the second world War, which resulted at the time in
Reichsbank officials being brought in to take over local central banking.
The Bank of England's effort is focused on the London-based Centre for
Central Banking Studies. This was set up in September 1990 and offers a
series of courses lasting up to two weeks to central bankers from the east.
With 10 staff, it costs the Bank about Pounds 2m a year.
The heads of the central banks of Russia, the Ukraine and Kazakhstan are
among the people who have been on the courses in the past few months.
Subjects covered include creation of separate currencies, currency
convertibility, the development of financial markets, relations between
fiscal policy and monetary policy, and press relations.
Early in July, the Bank despatched Mr Tony Latter, a senior manager in the
Bank's international division, for a six-month secondment in Kiev. Mr Latter
is to act as special adviser to Mr Vadim Hetman, governor of the Ukrainian
central bank, and will help out in particular with the introduction of the
hryvnia, the new Ukrainian currency due to come into force next year.
The Bank's involvement in the east is underscored by the personal commitment
of Mr Eddie George, deputy governor of the Bank and a strong candidate to
take over as governor next year when Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton retires.
One of the 12 or so people within the Bank with a good grasp of Russian  -
learned during a spell with the army in Berlin during the 1950s - has been
interested in the region for decades.
The commitment of the two central banks has its limits, however. Mr
Tietmeyer of the Bundesbank explains: 'We don't want to take over any
responsibility for the policies pursued by a bank,' he says. 'We don't want
them to say: 'Well we were advised by the Bundesbank, so it is their
policy.' The responsibility must remain with each country.'

FT  21 AUG 92 / Rebel Abkhazia braces for long struggle: Georgian troops win
a round but the separatists are far from throwing in the towel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SUKHUMI, ABKHAZIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SCENE in two homes in the tiny Black Sea resort of Sukhumi summed up the
mood after nearly a week of fighting between separatist Abkhazians and the
Georgian majority.
On a dirt road, the Arshaba family cowered in their woodframe home. Ethnic
Abkhazians, they awaited word of husbands and brother at the front - and hid
from men like Mr Tkutuli Kukachia.
Mr Kukachia, a 52-year-old Georgian with Josef Stalin's photograph adorning
his wall, sat with friends at his house 100 yards away, drinking victory
toasts of sweet home-made wine.
Fighting between the separatists and the Georgians, which began on Monday
when troops were deployed to remove the Abkhazian government, has marked Mr
Eduard Shevardnadze's evolution from diplomat to tough pragmatist as
Georgian leader.
It has also marked the unification, at least temporarily, of east and west
Georgians, who have been feuding for months. But it may not herald a
permanent peace in the region.
'The Georgians are well ahead in the battle but the Abkhazians will continue
to fight them,' said Russian colonel Valery Krasovsky, commander of
Commonwealth of Independent States troops in Sukhumi. 'All the Abkhazians
are soldiers now.'
Georgian troops control Sukhumi and much of the countryside. But Mr
Vladislav Ardzinba, deposed Abkhazian leader, holed up with 1,500 troops in
the town of Buduata, 40km north of Sukhumi, still directs a battle that is
killing Georgian soldiers.
Mr Ardzinba's men also control the town of Novy Afon, 25km north of Sukhumi.
On Wednesday, they were firing on Sukhumi's Mayatskaya district from just
2km away.
The trouble can be traced back to Stalin, a west Georgian who sometimes
vacationed in Sukhumi. A century ago, Abkhazians made up nearly all the
local population. But Stalin began moving in Mengrelians - west Georgians -
as past of his ethnic control programme. Now, the Abkhazians make up just 18
per cent of the population of the semi-autonomous region and Mengrelians 45
per cent.
The latest fighting resulted from a two-week battle of wills between the
Georgian and Abkhaz leaderships.
The Abkhaz parliament voted to adopt the old 1925 constitution, which
describes the region as independent. That angered Mr Shevardnadze, who
declared the vote illegal. The Abkhaz leadership responded by going to the
nearby Mengrelian capital of Zugdidi and kidnapping 12 of Mr Shevardnadze's
senior officials. That provoked Mr Shevardnadze to order in tanks and throw
out Mr Ardzinba's government.
At Sukhumi port on Wednesday more than 1,000 fleeing Georgians and Russians
jostled for a position on a Russian steamer heading for the Black Sea resort
of Sochi, four hours' voyage north.
Mr Eldgudzha Adamiga, a Georgian who is director of a local hospital, was
sending his Russian wife, Irina, and their 11-year-old twin sons to Sochi.
Despite the destruction which resulted from the Georgian intervention, he
supports the fighting. In his view, the revolution that swept away
communists in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi and elsewhere months ago has
finally reached Abkhazia. Mr Ardzinba represents the old, and Mr
Shevardnadze the democratic new wave.
But he added: 'The partisan war will continue. Ardzinba has his forces.
They're the old Soviets and they'll keep fighting.'

GERMAN and Russian companies yesterday formed the first joint venture
between the two countries to convert arms to peaceful purposes, spokesmen
for both sides said, Reuter reports.
'This could also be the biggest such joint venture in the world,' a German
industry spokesman said of the contract, signed in Schrobenhausen, near
Munich, after a year of negotiations.
Under the deal, 1.6m tonnes of conventional munitions from Soviet stocks
will be destroyed in Russia in a manner sensitive to the environment in
Russia. The components will be recycled.
Munich-based Deutsche Aerospace AG and LUB Lurgi
Umwelt-Beteiligungsgesellschaft, a subsidiary of metals and engineering
group Metallgesellschaft in Frankfurt, sealed the deal with ARTA, a Russian
grouping of defence industry companies.
ARTA said disposing of 1.6m tonnes of munitions from bullets to missiles
would take about 10 years.
German spokesmen said they hoped the deal would pave the way for bigger
ventures in arms conversion, an increasing market now that the east-west
conflict is over, military budgets are being cut and weapons are being
scrapped.
The two German companies entered the joint venture through their newly
established joint venture Entsorgungs und Sanierungstechnik, based in
Schrobenhausen.

FT  21 AUG 92 / Central banks move to ease strain of the D-Mark: Several
European states adjust interest rates as their currencies come under
pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE mighty D-Mark has created new tensions both inside and outside the
European Monetary System this week, forcing several European central banks
to change their short-term interest rates.
The Swedish central bank yesterday moved to protect the krona by raising its
key lending rate from 12 to 13 per cent. This pushed up rates in the Finnish
money market, and the Bank of Finland countered by lowering the tender rate
used in financing to commercial banks to 15.50 per cent from 16 per cent.
Earlier in the week, the Bank of Portugal cut its interest rates by 1 per
cent because the differential between the escudo (the strongest currency in
the European monetary system) and sterling (the weakest) had widened beyond
permitted limits.
Investors continue to be attracted by the high yield of the German currency,
with the Lombard rate at 9.75 per cent and little prospect of a cut before
the end of this year.
The D-Mark is also proving to be popular in the run-up to France's
referendum on the Maastricht treaty on European union next month. Opinion
polls published earlier this week suggest the vote will be close. Dealers
fear that a French 'No' vote will make a realignment of European currencies
more politically acceptable.
The Swedish authorities have experienced serious difficulties this week
trying to staunch the heavy selling of the krona for D-Marks.
Investors find the Swedish currency unappealing for much the same reason
that they dislike sterling. Sweden has fundamental economic difficulties,
with gross domestic product contracting by 1.4 per cent last year and
unemployment standing at a historically high 5.3 per cent.
Many investors also consider the krona heavily overvalued against the
D-Mark. Sweden's export performance in recent years has been poor and there
are no signs of an immediate improvement.
But, although this week's interest rate rise risks exacerbating the
country's recession, the authorities could not afford to watch their
currency fall. The krona is not in the ERM. But Sweden, which is committed
to joining the European Community as well as participating in any eventual
European monetary union, is shadowing the Ecu.
Some analysts consider this policy flawed because Sweden is acting as a
member of the EMS without enjoying the support of mutual central bank
intervention - hence, the need to raise rates this week.
By contrast, the Bank of Portugal had to cut its intervention rate because
the currency was too strong.
Until the start of this week, the escudo was at the top of the EMS grid,
protected by the bank's policy of maintaining high interest rates to reduce
inflation, currently running at an annual 9.5 per cent .
However, the escudo's strength had created strains in the EMS because of its
huge differential against sterling. No two EMS currencies can diverge
against each other's central rates by more than 6.18 per cent. But the
limits were broken last weekend as investors sold sterling for D-Marks.
However the Portuguese cut may turn out to have been excessive. In the
immediate aftermath, the escudo slipped from Es85.84 to the D-Mark to
Es86.90 and slid two places in the EMS grid.
German monetary policy was reflected in other rate changes this week.
Ireland's largest bank, Allied Irish, raised its interest rates by  1/2 a
percentage point to 13 1/2 per cent. It may have been responding to the
upward pressure on European money market rates that followed the
Bundesbank's 0.75 percentage point rise in its discount rate last month.

programmes for 1993 because of a soaring budget deficit, fuelled by the cost
of growing unemployment, which the government estimates will average 13 per
cent in 1993, and provisions by the state of FM20.8bn this year to rescue
the ailing banking sector from collapse,
The latest cuts will involve a 4 per cent reduction in central and local
government administrative costs as well as savings from reduced expenditure
on transport, agriculture, housing and provision of child care facilities.
The numbers entitled to unemployment benefit will be reduced. In addition
the cabinet announced rises in energy taxes to double the yield to FM1bn,
further damping depressed domestic demand.
The latest bout of cuts was decided by the cabinet which sat late into the
night. They underline the continuing fragility of Finland's economy despite
an improvement in its export performance, low inflation and signs of a
recovery in profitability in both the metal and forestry sectors.
Continuing high market interest rates reflect persistent international
unease about the economy, although Mr Michel Camdessus, head of the
International Monetary Fund, took a positive view of its future on a visit
to Finland recently.
The markets are looking apprehensively to next month's centralised wage
negotiations, where employers are seeking a three-year deal with no pay
rises, which the trade unions are unlikely to accept.
In October Prime Minister Esko Aho and colleagues in the Centre
party-Conservative coalition face a test of their political popularity with
local government elections. Observers believe that if these turn out to be
disastrous for the ruling parties it could precipitate a political crisis
and possible change of government.
The current concern is the likely size of the public deficit, expected to
rise by FM68bn this year to FM185bn. ETLA, the country's independent
economic forecasters, believe public debt will level off by 1996 to around
50 per cent of gross domestic product.

FT  21 AUG 92 / Riot police called in to quell jail violence

RIOT police were yesterday called into prisons across France to quell
outbreaks of violence by inmates on the third day of industrial action by
French prison officers.
Mr Michel Vauzelle, justice minister, will this morning resume talks with
the officers' unions after they failed yesterday afternoon. The prison
officers, protesting against the murder last weekend of one of their
colleagues by an inmate at Rouen jail, are demanding higher staffing and
better protection.
Over 100 of France's 150 prisons have been affected by the dispute which
started on Tuesday with strikes and go-slows by prison officers. Conditions
in the jails have fast deteriorated as inmates have protested against the
loss of exercise periods, recreational activities and visits.
Prisoners at Baumettes jail near Marseilles set fire to tyres and blockaded
corridors until riot police arrived to restore order. Riot squads stopped an
outbreak of violence at Mulhouse jail after a prisoner died in a fall from
the roof during a protest.
Similar scuffles occurred at Toulouse, where prisoners rampaged round the
jail in protest at being deprived of lunch, and at Ploemeur in Morbihan.
Prison authorities at Nanterre and Bois-d'Arcy drafted in riot police to
stop the daily routine being disrupted by the strike.
The French government, which had hoped to paint a picture of political
stability in the run-up to September's referendum on the Maastricht treaty,
is anxious to end the prison officers' strike as quickly as possible to
prevent a repetition of last month's embarrassing lorry drivers' dispute.

France's stock market authorities yesterday warned opinion pollsters about
allowing details of their polls on next month's Maastricht treaty referendum
to be leaked, writes Alice Rawsthorn. The warning follows days of volatile
trading on the stock and bond markets reacting to rumours of poll results.
The markets fell sharply on Wednesday morning when results of two polls were

FT  21 AUG 92 / Sterling falls to lowest ERM levelagainst D-Mark: Decline
partly driven by drop in dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and DAVID WALLER

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING fell yesterday to its lowest level against the D-Mark on the
foreign exchanges since Britain joined the European exchange rate mechanism
in October 1990.
The pound's  1/2 pfennig fall in London, to close at DM2.8070, left it
within three pfennigs of its permitted floor against the D-Mark in the ERM.
In New York it dipped further to DM2.8057.
If it reaches the lower limit of DM2.7780, the government will be forced to
support the currency either by intervention on the foreign exchanges, or by
raising interest rates.
The pound's fall yesterday was partly driven by the decline of the dollar,
as dealers sold the US currency in exchange for D-Marks on speculation that
the Bundesbank's high interest rate policy will remain for some time.
The dollar fell to a low of DM1.4455, narrowly above its all-time low of
DM1.4430 reached in February 1991. It closed in London at DM1.4485, down
nearly  1/2 pfennig on the day, and slipped to DM1.4475 in New York.
Expectations that the German central bank will keep its short-term interest
rates high were triggered by its latest figure for money supply growth,
indicating that inflationary pressures in Germany remained strong.
The broad money M3 measure grew at an annualised rate of 8.6 per cent
between the fourth quarter of 1991 and last month, compared with 8.7 per
cent in June.
Although the trend in money supply growth is downwards, the Bundesbank's
target growth rate of 3.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent for the year appears
likely to be missed. That makes improbable an imminent relaxation in the
German central bank's tight monetary policy.
Investors also switched funds out of sterling on concern about the UK's
recovery prospects. Yesterday Professor Doug McWilliams, economic adviser to
the Confederation of British Industry, said Britain faced four more quarters
of contraction with a recovery delayed until 1994. He predicted a 1 per cent
fall in output this year, followed by zero growth next year. Many foreign
exchange dealers believe that the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England
are likely to buy their currencies on the foreign exchanges if the decline
in the dollar and the pound continues.
However, the two rounds of central bank intervention in support of the
dollar over the past month have failed to stop the US currency's slide.
Although the Bundesbank Council meeting concluded yesterday without a change
in interest rate policy, the market is still fearful of a rise in the
internationally sensitive Lombard rate following the increase in the
discount rate.
Money market interest rates in Germany are at around the same level as the
9.75 per cent Lombard rate. In the past, the Bundesbank has used this as an
excuse for raising the Lombard rate.

A rise in the UK money supply last month has reduced fears that the economy
may be sliding into further decline, though it provides little sign of an
upturn. M0, which mostly comprises notes and coins in circulation, increased
by 2.4 per cent in the 12 months to the end of July, after a year-on-year
rise of 1.3 per cent in June and 2.5 per cent in May. Report, Page 7

FT  21 AUG 92 / Treasury to sell Pounds 1bn of privatised company debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is to use an innovative auction process to sell Pounds 1bn of
its approximately Pounds 5bn of loans made to privatised utility companies.
Under proposals unveiled yesterday, borrowers including BT and a string of
regional electricity companies and power generators, will be invited to bid
against each other to repurchase and retire their debt. The Treasury will
select which bonds to sell, allowing the repurchase only of complete issues
of debt. The sale will take place by the end of the current financial year.
Companies which buy back their debts may not achieve significant interest
savings despite the fall in interest rates since privatisation. Even if the
effect was neutral, however, they would be released from restrictive
covenants, gaining greater control over their finances.
Baring Brothers, the merchant bank appointed to advise the Treasury on the
sale, said it could not find any record of debt being sold in this way
before.
'We have developed a structure that takes full account of the market value,'
said Mr Cliff Haddy, a Barings assistant director. 'The companies are not
getting it on the cheap.'
The proceeds will count towards the Treasury's target of Pounds 8bn in
privatisation proceeds for the current financial year. The sale plan calls
for the creation of two bidding pools comprising, on the one hand, the
electricity companies, and, on the other, BT and interested third parties.
The structure was dictated partly because the government has undertaken not
to sell to third parties debt owed by the regional electricity companies
before the beginning of next year.
Barings said its proposals were also cheaper than the alternative of selling
loans to third parties, since marketing and underwriting fees would not be
incurred.
All told, the government estimates that some Pounds 3.74bn of its loan
assets are marketable, comprising Pounds 1.69bn of BT loan stock and Pounds
2.05bn of electricity company debt.
Individual loans range in size from a Pounds 350m debt owed by National
Power to small loans of less than Pounds 50m. Maturity dates stretch from
1997 to 2008. The debt was originally injected to give the privatised
companies what was deemed to be an appropriate capital structure.
Many of the electricity groups concerned said they could not comment on the
sale until they had studied the details of the auction process and had
further discussions with the Treasury, Barings and their own advisers.

FT  21 AUG 92 / Bush tax pledge to spur economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HOUSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush last night dangled the prospect next year of tax cuts
before the Republican party convention, many of whose members have been
demanding radical action to get the economy moving.
But the president is also insisting that tax cuts be tied to commensurate
reduction in federal spending, so as not to increase a budget deficit
currently approaching Dollars 400bn (Pounds 207bn) a year.
Mr Bush set out the tax cut initiative in a speech that was billed as the
climax of the four-day convention and as the launching pad for his fight to
save his presidency.
His address coincided with opinion polls suggesting he has narrowed the lead
held by Mr Bill Clinton, his Democratic challenger in the November 3
presidential election. One poll showed he was lagging just 11 points behind,
against 18 last week.
Mr Bush's proposals were outlined to reporters just before the president
went to the podium.
He accused the Democrat-controlled Congress of frustrating his attempts to
spur the economy along. He also warned voters of the dangers of electing 'a
rubber cheque congress and a rubber stamp president'.
Mr Bush drew a sharp contrast between the vision offered by the Democrats
and the vision offered by his own party. 'Theirs is to look inward and
protect what we already have,' he said. 'Ours is to look forward - to open
new markets, prepare our people to compete, to restore the social fabric, to
save and invest so we can win.'
Beyond the qualified commitment to cutting taxes the president also revived
three earlier proposals - a cap on mandatory spending, a constitutional
amendment to balance the budget and the right to veto specific congressional
legislation that meets his disapproval.
Mr Bush made it clear he would not act until Congress reconvened in January.
His tax cut initiative is therefore dependent on his re-election and,
assuming the Democrats retain control of Congress, cannot even then be
assured of passage in the form Mr Bush would like.
The final two days of the convention have been devoted to building up the
image of George Bush as a man of unquestioned integrity and experience.
Mr Clinton, meanwhile, again took exception to Republican attacks on his
wife.
But polls released last night suggested the incessant attacks on Mr Clinton
and his wife were having some effect.
A CBS News poll taken on Tuesday and Wednesday showed Bush creeping to
within 11 points of Mr Clinton compared with an 18-point gap last week.
A nationwide survey by the Hotline political newsletter and the Houston
Chronicle showed Mr Bush trailing Mr Clinton by just five points, compared
with a 16 per cent deficit when the Republican convention got under way.
A Washington Post/ABC survey, concluded on Tuesday night, had Mr Clinton
ahead by 57 per cent to 32 per cent among registered voters, a margin that
had changed little over the past month.

FT  21 AUG 92 / BP may close Welsh chemicals plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS and BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Petroleum Chemicals is thought to be considering closing at least
one plant in its Baglan Bay petrochemicals complex in south Wales. Up to
1,900 workers are employed at the complex at any one time.
Internal BP documents argue the European petrochemicals industry is
suffering from chronic overcapacity. It says the sector must 'adopt rapid
decisive measures or face slow death'.
The European industry is suffering from overcapacity of as much as 2m tonnes
a year of ethylene, the basic building block of petrochemicals. No
significant manufacturer is presently making profits.
Mr Bryan Sanderson, chief executive of BP Chemicals, the subsidiary of the
oil group, said in an interview this week that if there was a
rationalisation of the industry, Baglan Bay would be 'clearly our marginal
site'.
The complex, near Port Talbot, is the second largest employer in the region
and provides work for 900 employees and between 500 and 1,000 contractors.
In May, the company ended recognition of unions at Baglan Bay.
One option identified by BP is to close a 120,000-tonne per year ethylene
unit at the site. The unit supplies BP's low density polyethylene plant at
Antwerp which the group said this week is being sold to Neste Chemicals, the
acquisitive state-owned Finnish company.
BP has signed a contract to continue to supply the Antwerp plant, but has
not given details of its duration or size.
If BP closes a second ethylene unit at Baglan Bay, the future of the whole
site would be at risk.
The ethylene units supply a 270,000-tonne-a-year styrene plant which in May
was incorporated in a joint venture with Enichem of Italy. Other derivative
plants manufacture vinyl acetate, ethanol and isopropyl alcohol. The Baglan
Bay site also contains a 50kw electricity generator.  Mr Jeff Morgan, branch
secretary of the TGWU, said: 'What we fear is that BP has safeguarded the
styrenes part of the site through the merger (with Enichem).
The power station is also viable. But it is very difficult to say whether
the ethylene business and alcohols can sustain themselves,' he said.

THE depressing stream of French corporate announcements continued yesterday
with the disclosure of flat first-half sales from several companies,

that Random, a group of computer distribution companies, was in judicial
receivership.
Random - founded in 1982 and quoted on France's second market - had built up
a business with sales of FFr1.1bn (Dollars 223m) last year. However, it
reported a loss of FFr44m in 1991. It said yesterday that it envisaged even
higher losses for 1992, making it difficult for it to service its debt, now
FFr300m. Random's management hoped its partners, Compunet in Germany and
Computacenter in the UK might be interested in a rescue.

LEADERS of the Czech and Slovak regional parliaments took a further step
towards the eventual liquidation of the Czechoslovak republic yesterday when
they agreed that both regions would become successor states to the present
federation, Reuter reports from Prague.
'We have agreed to that,' Mr Milan Uhde, chairman of the Czech National
Council, said after a meeting with his Slovak counterpart Mr Ivan Gasparovic
in Prague.
The two leaders discussed the work of commissions of the two assemblies
which are drawing up draft proposals for future co-operation after the
Czechoslovak state is dissolved.
Agreement on the break-up of the state has been one of the few points of
consensus between the winners of June's general elections in Czechoslovakia
 -the Civic Democratic party (ODS) in the Czech republic and the Slovak
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS).
ODS leader Vaclav Klaus and Vladimir Meciar of the HZDS have agreed that
both sides should conclude negotiations over the framework of future
co-operation between the two independent republics by the end of September.
The impending break-up of the country is the result of divergent views on
the future composition of the 74-year-old Czechoslovak republic.
Mr Klaus and Mr Meciar are due to meet in Prague on August 26 to discuss
further steps towards the split.

FRANCE banned imports of household waste yesterday and charged a fourth
businessman in connection with hospital refuse from Germany, Reuter reports
from Paris.
Germany said the ban, which came into effect yesterday morning, had blocked
disposal of up to 700,000 tonnes of everyday rubbish from German homes and
companies.
The ban was announced earlier this week after customs officers in eastern
France stopped a dozen trucks from Germany carrying syringes, bloodbags and
other hospital refuse concealed in ordinary household waste.
The owner of a quarry where some of the refuse was dumped, Mr Georges
Perreux, was held yesterday on charges of illegally importing waste which
could be health and environment hazards. His son and two other businessmen
face similar charges.

FT  21 AUG 92 / Dollar falls near to all-time low against D-Mark: Pound
slides to lowest level since ERM entry as German monetary growth exceeds
target
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR fell yesterday to only a fraction of a pfennig above its all-time
low against the D-Mark. It closed in London at DM1.4455, compared with the
nadir of DM1.4430 reached in February 1991.
The dollar's weakness helped to pull sterling to its lowest point against
the D-Mark since Britain joined the exchange rate mechanism of the European
Monetary System in October 1990.
The pound's fall to DM2.8070 left it less than three pfennigs above its
permitted floor against the D-Mark in the EMS. If it reaches the floor of
DM2.7780, the British government will be forced to support it either by
heavy intervention on the foreign exchanges, or by raising interest rates.
Dealers sold dollars and pounds after the Bundesbank issued its latest
figure for German money supply growth. The broad money M3 measure grew at an
annualised rate of 8.6 per cent between the fourth quarter of 1991 and last
month, compared with 8.7 per cent in June.
Although the trend is downwards, the Bundesbank's target growth rate of 3.5
per cent to 5.5 per cent for the year as a whole will certainly be missed,
giving the German central bank no reason to relax its tight monetary policy.
For sterling, the situation is compounded by worries about the British
economy. The decline in retail sales in July and the slight fall in second
quarter output reported earlier this week suggest that the the immediate
prospects for recovery remain dim.
Yesterday, UK money supply figures for July - showing an increase from
previous month - reduced fears that the economy may be sliding into further
decline, although they provided little sign of an upturn.
M0, which mostly comprises notes and coins in circulation, increased by 2.4
per cent in the 12 months to the end of July, after a year-on-year rise of
1.3 per cent in June and 2.5 per cent in May.
M4, a broader measure which also takes in bank and building society
deposits, rose 5.7 per cent in the year to July 31, after a year-on-year
rise of 5.3 per cent in June and of 5.2 per cent in the previous month.
The changes in the seasonally adjusted figures fit in with the picture of a
flat economy. M0 rose by 1.2 per cent between June and July, while M4
increased by 0.8 per cent.
Professor Doug McWilliams, economic adviser to the Confederation of British
Industry, said yesterday the UK faced four more quarters of contraction with
a recovery delayed until 1994.
He predicted a 1 per cent fall in output this year, followed by zero growth
next year.
Foreign exchange dealers believe that both the Fed and the Bank of England
will intervene heavily in the markets if both of their currencies continue
to decline.
The two concerted interventions made in support of the dollar over the past
month have failed to have any lasting effect. Instead, the central banks may
be waiting for a point when the intervention will work technically, and the
market can be turned.
A key requirement is that dealers should be so short of dollars and sterling
that they enter an intense session of buying when the exchange rate starts
to rise. It appears that, as yet, the market is not sufficiently short of
both currencies.
Although the Bundesbank Council meeting concluded yesterday without a change
in interest rate policy, the market is still fearful of a rise in the
internationally sensitive Lombard rate following the increase in the
discount rate.
Money market interest rates are around the same level as the 9.75 per cent
Lombard rate. In the past, the Bundesbank has used this as an excuse for
'technical' raising of the Lombard rate to stop banks borrowing from the
supposedly emergency Lombard facility.

FT  21 AUG 92 / De Klerk appeals for calm

<TEXT>
MR F W de Klerk, the South African president, yesterday appealed for calm
and tolerance between black and white South Africans, saying that he feared
that the controversy over tomorrow's rugby test match between Australia and
South Africa could 'ignite a powder keg'.
The issue of whether national symbols such as the South African flag and
anthem should be banned from the match has pitted white against black in
bitter verbal battles, highlighting a deterioration in race relations in
recent months.
Whites (who overwhelmingly support rugby) have been infuriated by the
insistence of the African National Congress (ANC) that there be no official
display of flags or singing of the national anthem, die Stem, both potent
symbols of Afrikaner nationalism.
Blacks (who primarily support soccer) argue that these are symbols of
apartheid repression, and that such official displays should be banned from
future sporting events - though the ANC has said it will not object to
individual supporters carrying flags or singing.
The ANC, which largely controls South Africa's access to international sport
through its sanctions campaign, has said it would prevent future rugby tours
unless these conditions are met on Saturday - especially the observance of a
minute of silence for the dead of South Africa's black townships.
At last week's New Zealand-South Africa match, white spectators broke into a
spontaneous rendition of the national anthem during this period.
Yesterday, Mr de Klerk said his government agreed that a minute's silence
should be observed on Saturday, though he stopped short of urging his
supporters to remain silent.
On the subject of deadlocked constitutional negotiations, the president said
government would convene a meeting early next month of like-minded parties -
including the Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party - to plan for the eventual
resumption of talks with the main black group, the ANC.
When talks do resume,they could include radicals from right and left - the
ultra-radical Pan Africanist Congress and a splinter right-wing group -
which had boycotted earlier talks.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Higher interest charges resulted in pre-tax profits of McKay Securities
falling from Pounds 3.81m to Pounds 3.17m in the year to March 31.
Net interest payable by this property investment and development group rose
Pounds 800,000 to Pounds 3.3m following the cessation of capitalisation of
interest on certain developments prior to becoming income-producing.
Pre-tax profits in the current year will be depressed further because of
recession, directors said.
There were no schemes under development or planned to start in the near
future.
Earnings per share came through at 10.4p (11.6p). The final dividend is
3.5p, for a total of 6.7p (6.4p).

</HEADLINE>

Rosebys, the specialist retailer of household textiles, curtains and
accessories hived off by Cattle's, lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds
493,000 to Pounds 606,000 in the first half of 1992.
Historically, the bulk of profits arise in the second half. Forecasts assume
that no discernible increase in consumer spending will come this year, but
'we are continuing to improve gross margins and are exercising vigorous cost
control,' said Mr Roy Waudby, chairman.
In the 1991 year the group made Pounds 2.17m from turnover of Pounds 42.8m.
In March, 55 per cent of the increased capital was placed at 115p per share.
Cattle's retained the minority capital. Yesterday the share price fell 8p to
114p.
Turnover rose 5 per cent to Pounds 20.9m, but most of that stemmed from
retail outlets opened in the previous 12 months.
Earnings per share worked through unchanged at 1.9p on the higher capital.
The interim dividend is 0.9p.

Interest payable fell to Pounds 624,000 (Pounds 799,000) reflecting reduced

Rationalisation measures at the childrens' wear division reflected a sharp

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARLEY yesterday signalled further gloom in the construction sector by
forecasting its first annual dividend cut in almost 20 years, in spite of
higher interim profits.
Sir George Russell, chairman, said the building products group had 'cut
everything else . . . It is time the dividends take their share of the
pressure.'
About Pounds 20m had been cut from costs since 1990, including 3,000 job
losses. Further costs savings of about Pounds 8m had been identified
worldwide.
Short of a 'miracle in demand', Sir George said, the total dividend was
likely to be cut by a third to 4.2p. The interim is maintained at 2.1p,
forcing the company to dip into reserves for the third consecutive year.
Earnings per share fell from 2.2p to 2.1p.
The dividend forecast will be grim news for the UK construction industry,
despite the company's announcement of a small increase in pre-tax profits to
Pounds 9.7m (Pounds 9.4m) for the six months to June 30. Marley, which was
the first to warn of recession in 1989, is considered to be the most likely
candidate to spot any UK upturn.
The bulk of the improvement came from strong growth overseas and lower
interest charges. Sales fell to Pounds 280m (Pounds 282m), due to a 4 per
cent decline in the UK to Pounds 160m (Pounds 167m).
Net debt fell by Pounds 25m to Pounds 100m, with interest payments declining
from Pounds 6.2m to Pounds 4.3m. Gearing stood at less than 50 per cent.
Strong demand in the former east German market for DIY plastics products and
a significant improvement in the US bricks business helped boost overseas
operating profits by Pounds 200,000 to Pounds 10.9m.
In the UK, profits fell by Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 3.5m.
The bricks and tiles businesses doubled losses to Pounds 800,000, due
largely to difficulties in the UK market. Sir George said price cutting
continued to put pressure on building product margins, with no sign of
recovery.
Property disposals were Pounds 2m lower at Pounds 1.7m. Plumbing and
flooring contributed profits of Pounds 12.3m (Pounds 11.3m), while
automotive components rose by a third to Pounds 1.2m.
The higher tax charge of Pounds 3.9m was due to irrecoverable advance
corporation tax. In addition a Pounds 3.6m extraordinary charge was
settlement of a dispute over a vehicle leasing business sold to T Cowie in
1987 for Pounds 17m. After Pounds 5.9m in dividend payments, Marley recorded
a retained loss of Pounds 3.7m.
Marley also announced the closure of two insulation brick factories - in
Northumberland and Manchester - with 200 job losses. The factory closures
alone would result in annual cost savings of about Pounds 4m, Sir George
said.
The shares closed 2p down at 78p.

FT  20 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Accountancy book gets mixed reception as
sales soar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REACTION TO the book Accounting for Growth took several turns yesterday as
sales continued to escalate in City bookshops.
Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm, which has as clients a number of
companies highlighted in the book, denounced it as 'misleading'.
The firm said the book's suggestion that companies using these techniques
were more likely to fail was 'unsupportable and highly dangerous,' and
raised 'serious questions over the quality of analysis in the City.'
Mr Terry Smith, the author, was suspended as head of UK research at UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew, the securities house, after pressing ahead with publication
of the book. It highlights a number of accounting practices used by
companies which he claims help improve their profits or reduce gearing on
the balance sheet.
Mr Smith has received a number of letters of support from investment
institutions.
Meanwhile, Mr Peter Smith, director of investments at Equity and Law, the UK
insurers, said he would insist that all seven of his UK fund managers read
the book. 'I want my chaps' eyes to be as wide open as they need to be.'
However, Interbrand, a firm specialising in valuing brands on company
balance sheets, was last night preparing a memorandum attacking the book for
circulation to more than 100 of its clients.
The negative reaction has, however, continued to have a positive effect on
sales.
Random House, the book's publisher, said it had last night authorised a
third print run of 4,000 copies, bringing the total number produced in
paperback to 16,000. Copies of a hardback version are now also on sale and
the publishers are considering expanding this print run of 750 copies.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britannic Assurance yesterday announced an interim dividend increased from
9.2p to 10.3p and significant growth in premium income for the first six
months of this year.
In line with the rest of the industry, pensions registered the strongest
results, boosted by rising unemployment as people made redundant transferred
their pension funds.
The ordinary branch's with-profits pension business rose 60 per cent to
Pounds 57.8m (Pounds 36m). New business in unit-linked pensions more than
doubled, to Pounds 6.81m (Pounds 3.29m).
Ordinary branch life assurance premiums were up almost 20 per cent to Pounds
41.8m (Pounds 34.9m), helped by the company's single-premium with-profits
bond.
Elsewhere, industrial branch assurance new business rose from Pounds 58m to
Pounds 60.7m. General branch premium income improved to Pounds 15.1m (Pounds
13.1m) and the underwriting loss was cut from Pounds 3.4m to Pounds 2.3m.
Britannic also announced reductions of between 1 and 2 per cent in the
terminal bonuses payable on 10-year and 15-year with-profits products. Mr
Brian Shaw, general manager and actuary, attributed this to the sluggish
markets this year.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FAVOURABLE cash position at Victaulic offset difficult trading conditions
enabling the pipes and fittings maker to report unchanged pre-tax profits of
Pounds 6.9m for the six months to June 30.
Turnover fell from Pounds 57.4m to Pounds 51.2m, mainly reflecting reduced
demand for pipelines from British Gas which has cut capital expenditure.
This is because of uncertainties over the future structure and ownership of
British Gas's network following the referral of these matters to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The uncertainty is likely to continue
into next year.
In the group's other main market - water - some companies reduced investment
on the repair and maintainance of mains, affecting sales of Viking Johnson,
which is involved in the refurbishment of mains.
Trading profit fell from Pounds 6.79m to Pounds 6.46m. However, net cash of
Pounds 10m resulted in interest received of Pounds 461,000 (Pounds 57,000).
Cost reductions, a decline in the workforce and increased margins of 12.6
per cent (11.8 per cent) also helped.
The interim dividend is 2.5p (2.35p) on earnings unchanged at 10.3p.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Vulnerable times for US bond market: Why investors will be
nervous during the Republican convention
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury market dealers and investors will be glued to their television
screens tonight, nervously awaiting President Bush's acceptance speech at
the Republican convention in Houston.
Since the end of last week the bond market has been troubled by rumours that
Mr Bush will temporarily set aside his long-term goal of balancing the
budget and unveil a tax-cutting package aimed at breathing fresh life into
both the economy and his own re-election hopes.
Such a move might be popular with the Republican party faithful, but it
could be a setback for the bond market.
Analysts fear that a tax cut announcement could bring the market's
impressive mid-summer rally to a halt.
The rally has brought long-term yields down from 7.8 per cent in early June
to 7.3 per cent today, the lowest level seen in five and a half years. It
has been built on the gloomy outlook for the US economy, which the market
expects to remain weak well into 1993, and inflation, currently at just over
3 per cent and which should fall even further during next year. The rally at
the long end has also been partly technical - the result of longer-dated
maturities catching up with the gains of short- and intermediate-term
securities.
Successive cuts in US interest rates during 1991 and 1992 made the yields on
short-term liquid assets such as money market funds and bank certificates of
deposit (CDs) extremely unattractive.
This forced investors to switch their money into short and intermediate debt
 -the two-year, five-year and 10-year treasury securities - where yields
were higher. There was less demand for long bonds at the time due to fears
about inflation.
It was not long before the gap between the yield on the long bond (nearly 8
per cent) and on short and intermediate securities (between 4 per cent and
6.5 per cent) grew so wide that investors began moving their money further
up the maturity spectrum to earn a better yield.
'The long end is the most interesting part if you are looking for
significant capital gains,' says Mr Roger Gray, head of fixed income and
currency at Rothschild Asset Management. Demand for treasuries has been very
strong. According to figures compiled by the Investment Company Institute,
net sales of bond funds in the first six months of this year totalled
Dollars 103.9bn, double the Dollars 57.1bn in the first half of last year.
If money keeps pouring into bond funds at its current rate, 1992 will be the
best on record.
The treasury market has been helped by the relatively poor performance of
equities. Bonds have offered better returns than any comparable investments
for much of this year. Many managers of global bond funds remain overweight
in the US treasury bond market, as they believe there is scope for further
gains.
Mr Nick Henderso, head of fixed income at Gartmore, the UK fund management
group, says: 'We're slightly overweight in the US, and have been steadily
building up our position in North America, but we would not increase it
further.'
Mr David Gibson, head of fixed income at Schroder, says: 'Although US bond
yields probably do have further to fall, we think the market is overbought
and that there is now scope for better gains in Europe than in the US.'
International fund managers are watching the Bundesbank closely for signs of
a possible easing in German interest rates which would pave the way for
lower rates in other European countries.
The US market's new-found confidence could be dented by political
uncertainties, especially if President Bush engineers a politically
motivated tax cut at this week's convention. Lower taxes means three things
to the bond market, all of them bad: a stronger economy, higher inflation
and a bigger federal deficit.
The fact that the bond market has reacted so nervously to rumours of a
possible tax cut underlines how vulnerable it is during the election
campaign. Analysts warn to expect further volatility as election day
(November 3) draws nearer, and a possible end to the rally if Governor Bill
Clinton maintains his lead in the polls.
Ms Christine Pinto, senior strategist at Merrill Lynch, believes the market
is in for a rough ride. She says: 'I'd probably say a good bet is that we'd
see a 7.5 per cent yield (on the long bond) before we saw 7 per cent, given
the fact the consensus thinks Bush isn't going to get enough steam up
through to November. The bond market could get a little rattled.'
Any negative reaction to a Clinton victory could be short-lived, according
to Mr Bob Beckwitt, portfolio manager at Fidelity, the biggest fund group in
the US. 'What happens to the economy over the next year is what matters, and
Clinton will have only a marginal effect on the economy if he gets elected.'
What about life after the election? The bulls believe inflation will lie
dormant for the next one or two years as the economy remains weaker than
normal.
Longer-term trends are also moving in the bond market's favour, says Ms
Pinto. She says the US population is ageing, the baby boom generation will
save more and spend less, and the housing market will remain depressed,
which means that poor demand for mortgages will keep interest rates down.
She adds that US households currently have Dollars 3,650bn in short-term
liquid assets (such as bank accounts, money market funds, CDs). Much of that
is earning low returns, and when it matures later this year it is likely to
search for a higher yield elsewhere - possibly in equities, but more likely
in bonds.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Yeltsin unveils share scheme: Proposed vouchers will entitle
citizens to buy stakes in enterprises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON and JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin, appealing to Russians to put up with painful market
reforms on the first anniversary of the abortive coup, yesterday announced
plans for every citizen to become a property owner.
In an anniversary broadcast, he said vouchers entitling every man, woman and
child to Rbs10,000 worth of privatised property would be distributed free
from October 1 through local savings banks.
'This is a sort of ticket to a free economy for each of us. The more
property owners and business people appear in Russia . . .the more benefit
Russia will obtain and the more secure its future will be,' Mr Yeltsin said,
warning that the country would not survive any attempt to return to
Communism.
In an attempt to sweeten the pill of falling living standards, he also
announced a 50 per cent pay increase for teachers, health workers and other
public service employees.
He said the voucher plan would entitle every citizen to buy shares 'in any
enterprise anywhere in the country'. He said voucher holders would also have
the option of entrusting their vouchers to funds which would buy shares on
their behalf.
This is the latest step in the government's laborious privatisation
programme, which is one of the reasons why many state-owned enterprise
managers are clamouring for the resignation of the cabinet headed by Mr
Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister.
Mr Gaidar, who will be strengthened by this new show of support from the
Russian leader, yesterday defended his reforms with a warning that the only
alternative was dictatorship.
'If you are not ready to go towards a market system swiftly and with
determination, introducing emergency rule is the only way out,' he wrote in
Izvestia yesterday.
'On August 19 (1991), the coup plotters tried to cut through a Gordian knot
of social and political problems by reverting to discipline based on orders
and detention camps'.
Underlining the split in the country's 'democratic' forces, vice president
Alexander Rutskoi repeated calls for an 'economic state of emergency' - an
ill-defined recipe which he denies has anything to do with the state of
emergency sought by the coup leaders. He said urgent action was needed to
stop a free-fall in industrial production.
Meanwhile, Mr Telman Gdlyan, a militant anti-communist who made a name for
himself investigating high-level corruption under President Mikhail
Gorbachev, claimed yesterday that a 'fifth column' was preparing a new coup.
The anniversary was marked by a rally for those who ringed Mr Yeltsin's
White House this time last year to defend it against Soviet army tanks.
The rally attracted just a few thousand people - fewer than the organisers
had hoped for but enough not to call it a failure.

FT  20 AUG 92 / MMC to investigate wholesale distribution of newspapers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OFFICE of Fair Trading asked the Monopolies and Mergers Commission
yesterday to investigate the wholesale distribution of national newspapers
in England and Wales after complaints from independent retailers and MPs
that practices restrict competition.
The OFT said it was particularly concerned about barriers to entry into
retail newspaper sales. The main wholesale suppliers can currently refuse to
supply newspapers to shopkeepers who wish to set up new retail outlets.
The MMC would be expected to report to the trade and industry secretary in a
year.
Wholesale newspaper distribution was first referred to the MMC in 1976. Its
report two years later found a complex monopoly existed in favour of WH
Smith, John Menzies and Surridge Dawson - still the three largest wholesale
distributors - and a few smaller companies, but concluded it was not against
the public interest to limit the number of retailers. The subject was
reviewed in 1986 and again in September 1991, when the OFT decided that a
further referral to the MMC was unwarranted.
In 1988, distribution switched from rail to road and exclusive contracts
began to be awarded by some newspaper publishers to wholesalers.
That has resulted in retailers in many areas having only one of the main
wholesalers as a supplier. Retailers who have been denied supply have the
right to appeal to the publishers and wholesalers.
However, according to Mr Alan Taylor, national secretary of the British
Independent Grocers' Association, representing some 2,000 independent
retailers, the appeals system has failed: 'An application from a small
convenience store will be dealt with by a letter stating that 'the area is
adequately served'. But if you happen to be Dillons or Tesco, they usually
decide your area isn't adequately served. Strange, isn't it?'
Mr Ranald Noel-Paton, managing director of John Menzies, with some 20 per
cent of the market, denied his company restricted retail growth: 'We spend
all our time seeking ways to promote sales of newspapers. You do not do that
by cutting a finite cake into ever decreasing slices.'
WH Smith, which has some 27 per cent of the market, said: 'We have been down
this road before and we are quite happy to co-operate with the OFT again.'

FT  20 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Hafnia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Danish institutions must be rueing their decision to reject what looked like
a perfectly reasonable bid for Hafnia by the Swedish insurer Skandia earlier
this year. News yesterday that Hafnia has effectively sought protection from
its creditors - less than two months after the completion of a DK2bn rights
issue - underlines the price paid for what at the time looked like
anti-Maastricht style nationalism. The question mark now is over Uni
Storebrand, the Norwegian company with which Hafnia ill-fatedly tried to
build a pan-Scandinavian insurance alliance. If shareholders are asked to
bail it out of trouble they will no doubt take note of the Hafnia example.

FT  20 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Euro Disney
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
These days a 7 per cent fall in Euro Disney's shares is almost unremarkable.
Yesterday's slide, though, highlights how easily the French stock market can
be unsettled in the run-up to the Maastricht referendum. True, the markets
are thin and there was selling from New York, but in more confident times
such pressure would have been easily absorbed.
The fall also points up the market's difficulty in valuing the shares. With
the company likely to report a loss this year and doubts about dividend
prospects for 1993-94, Euro Disney still looks expensive. Bulls argue that
the cash flow models used to value the shares at flotation may have been
over-optimistic, but that when fed with current assumptions they justify the
share price. As dividends slowly approach, the idea still deserves a
hearing. But with investors refusing to take anything on trust at present,
the market is likely to turn a deaf ear.

FT  20 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Marley
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Marley first warned of a downturn in profits three years ago and has paid an
uncovered dividend for the past two. No surprise, then, that the market
barely twitched yesterday on news that the pay-out this year will be cut by
a third. Of greater concern for the sector as a whole, however, are
indications from Marley's interim figures that producers are losing control
of pricing across the range of UK building products. The cyclical softness
in brick prices now extends through roof tiles and aggregates. Conditions
could deteriorate through the second half if big players, notably Redland
following the acquisition of Steetley, take an aggressive stance.
Without increased demand from the construction industry - and Marley made
plain yesterday it expected no such upturn until well into next year or 1994
 -margins will be restored only if excess capacity is taken out. This could
imply a further round of provisioning. Hepworth got the ball rolling last
month by flagging unspecified reorganisation costs in the second half.
Marley's decision to close two Thermalite plants could give rise to an
exceptional charge of Pounds 10m, suggesting the dividend will not be
covered this year even at the reduced rate.
With Marley's margins under such pressure, cost savings are not flowing to
the bottom line. Even a sharp reduction in working capital and interest
costs this year will be balanced by the write-off of up to Pounds 1.5m ACT
because UK profits are so low. Albeit rather belatedly, the company is
taking steps to form a base from which earnings can grow. But against a
background of serious weakness in its core market, a prospective yield of 7
per cent leaves little to chance.

FT  20 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: UK economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Presumably not even the chancellor will use yesterday's GDP figures to
herald the end of the recession. The tiny rise in non-oil output is well
within the margin of error, and the contrast with July's retail sales
figures is illuminating. It seems clear that those retailers who stocked up
in anticipation of a post-election recovery have had to cut prices heavily
to move goods. The prospect now is for another round of destocking moving
back up the manufacturing chain, and the economy may well shrink in the
third quarter. Ford's decision to move Dagenham to short-time working may be
mostly related to weakness in the continental car market, but it also seems
likely that August car sales in the UK will be disappointing.
Further out, there seems little to tempt the consumer from his shell. High
real interest rates, fear of unemployment and falling house prices are still
powerful restraints. Added to that, today's broad money supply figures may
well point to low growth - or even no growth - next year.

FT  20 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Underpinning at BICC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's presentation by a triumvirate of Scotsmen - two of them
chartered accountants - looks to have persuaded some in the City that the UK
cables and construction group has merit in these turbulent times. The
company's strong first-half cash performance is certainly reassuring, not
least in view of the money squandered on housebuilding and commercial
property in the past. But whether yesterday's 6 per cent rise in the shares
can be sustained may depend largely on what happens to margins in the
group's dominant European cables business over the next 12 to 18 months.
That in itself is progress for BICC, which has long been dogged by balance
sheet worries and the uncertain scale of further property provisions. The
recent rights issue has allayed fears about the former, even if most of the
Pounds 130m remaining off-balance sheet debt is guaranteed by the parent and
treating the convertible as debt makes gearing less comfortable. A major
write-down for Spitalfields can probably not be staved off much longer, but
the rent roll achieved so far on completed developments suggests that
current valuations are no longer wildly unrealistic. Provided it was not
merely a negotiating stance for the benefit of Eurotunnel's Sir Alastair
Morton, yesterday's insistence that there will be no more provisions for the
Channel tunnel is the best news of the lot.
Given that at least some of Balfour Beatty's markets will remain grimly
depressed, prime responsibility for maintaining the pay-out beyond this year
rests with European cables. Current difficulties are not wholly reflected in
the 19 per cent reported drop in first-half operating profits, due to
first-time consolidation for Spain. But a 9 per cent yield on the shares is
surely adequate insurance against things getting worse.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Serbs renew 'ethnic cleansing' policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY and ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MORE than 200,000 people could be forced to flee northern Bosnia because of
a renewed wave of Serb-inspired terror and intimidation, officials from the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said yesterday.
The upsurge in 'ethnic cleansing' in the north of the former Yugoslav
republic coincided with a US report concluding that Bosnia's Serbs have
largely attained their goal of carving a greater Serbia out of
Bosnia-Hercegovina.
The report, drawn up by two staff members of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee who travelled in the region between August 7 and 14, estimates
35,000 people have died in Bosnia, with Moslems bearing the heaviest toll of
nearly five months of bloodshed. It suggests 20,000 or more deaths occurred
during forced evacuation of Moslem villages.
Senator Claiborne Pell, chairman of the committee, said he was deeply
disturbed by the account, the first US congressional report 'to document the
full extent of the horrors associated with the ethnic cleansing campaign
being carried out by Serbs against the Moslem population of
Bosnia-Hercegovina'.
The report found that in some Serbian-run camps 'prisoners have been
systematically beaten and starved'. In some locations there was evidence of
'organised killing'.
The authors assert that 'systematic defects' at the UN and the State
Department contributed to the slow international response to the crisis. As
early as June, reports of atrocities were reaching Washington from US
diplomats, the authors say. 'The UN apparently did nothing in response to
the July 3 memo (noting the existence of camps) and the State Department did
nothing to follow up on the information it was receiving from its missions.'
According to their evidence, paramilitary groups from Serbia operate with
impunity in Bosnia-Hercegovina and are among the most sadistic forces there.
'We believe the death toll associated with the forcible removal of the
Moslem village population of Bosnia-Hercegovina far exceeds the death tolls
from the bombardment of cities or from killings in prison camps,' they say.
'Unfortunately, this most lethal aspect of ethnic cleansing has received the
least amount of public attention.'
In the light of the report, western diplomats said a decision by Mr Radovan
Karadzic, head of Bosnia's Serbs, announced on Tuesday night, to place
Serb-controlled heavy artillery pieces located around the Bosnian capital of
Sarajevo under UN supervision, was 'too little too late'.
A Washington official said, meanwhile, the US had received word that Serbs
might be willing to empty detention centres in Bosnia-Hercegovina if the
international community took responsibility for the inmates. But this
presented a dilemma. 'If you do help, you are assisting in ethnic
cleansing,' the official said. 'Is it in the interests of the international
community to make it easy to drive these people out?'

FT  20 AUG 92 / Leading Article: The price of costly debt
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK economy is in trouble, as today's headlines and the Bank of England's
gloomy quarterly bulletin confirm. The growing burden of consumer and
corporate debts is being compounded by the highest level of real interest
rates at this stage of the economic cycle since the 1930s, as the chart on
the UK News pages of today's FT shows. The nearer the economy shuffles
towards the government's zero inflation target, the higher these real rates
will become. Things may well get worse before they get better.
The depressing news that Ford UK is to cut the working week at two of its
plants, because of sluggish car sales, dims any rays of hope that could be
extracted from yesterday's output figures. While gross domestic product fell
in the second quarter of this year, non-oil output rose by 0.1 per cent
after seven successive quarterly falls. But the rise in manufacturing output
that raised non-oil GDP was in anticipation of a post-election recovery in
spending. This has failed to materialise, as the fall in retail sales in
July confirms. Manufacturers now have little option but to cut production
and draw down recently accumulated stocks, with Ford UK leading the way. A
further wave of redundancies now looks inevitable.
The problem is debt, as the Bank of England bulletin amply shows. Lower
nominal interest rates may have slightly cut debt service ratios, but the
fall in house values means that outstanding debts are still rising as a
proportion of housing wealth. A tenth of all households with mortgages now
owe more than the value of their property. If house prices continue falling
at their current rate, this number could easily double to 2m by 1994.
The Bank is correct in its diagnosis, but typically reticent in its
prognosis. The outlook does not remain very uncertain, as the bulletin
declares. It looks rather certain. Faced with high interest rate bills and
deteriorating balance sheets, consumers have increased their savings. There
is no reason to expect a change of heart.
If anything, the interest rate screw will tighten over coming months. Real
interest rates are already above 6 per cent, compared with 1 per cent in
January 1981, the turning point of the last recession. The combination of
falling inflation and the Bundesbank's stout defence of its tight money
policies, mean that real rates are probably heading higher. A vote for the
Maastricht treaty in September's French referendum would reinforce the
deflationary status quo. A 'no' vote could force still higher interest
rates, as the exchange rate mechanism comes under pressure.
Mr John Major is locked in. He wants a recovery, yet his main achievement -
and principal boast - is lower inflation. But lower inflation would only
raise real interest rates and make the recovery still more sluggish. He is
well on course to achieving his inflation target. But that victory looks
increasingly costly.

FT  20 AUG 92 / High time for plastics surgery: Europe's petrochemicals
industry is under threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Four years ago Shell's petrochemicals division made profits of more than
Pounds 1bn. Last year it made Pounds 23m. This year it is in loss.
Shell is the world's biggest petrochemicals producer, and the rest of the
industry is suffering along with it. The sector is used to cycles of boom
and bust, but this time the damage may be more lasting.
The immediate cause of the industry's plight is familiar. Petrochemicals
manufacturers - which transform oil and gas into chemicals used principally
to make plastics - are reeling under the twin burdens of recession and
overcapacity. This last happened a decade ago, when losses were much heavier
than any sustained before. But a new threat has emerged.
Capacity planned or installed by Asian manufacturers between 1988 and 1995
is equal to more than half of Europe's total production. This expansion
threatens an imbalance of world supply and demand, weakening prices and
margins possibly until the end of the decade.
The question is whether this leaves Europe with a long-term future in
petrochemicals manufacture. This same question arose in the early 1980s when
overcapacity and recession sent the industry into loss. But an extraordinary
surge in demand near the end of the decade enabled the industry to recover.
The final reckoning, however, may simply have been postponed.
In the late 1980s, petrochemicals producers were generating profits verging
on the 'pornographic', according to Mr Bob Lee, director of marketing of
light hydrocarbons at Dow Europe, the subsidiary of the US chemical giant.
The industry reacted by reducing bottlenecks in existing plants in an effort
to expand production, sometimes by as much as 20 per cent. Europe's output
of ethylene - the basic building block of the petrochemicals industry - grew
from 16m tonnes in 1990 to 18m in 1992.
Now, Mr Lee says: 'No one is making money in European petrochemicals.'
Prices and margins have been driven to an untenable low, according to Mr
Roger Longley, a director at Chem Systems, the consultants. 'Return on
investment - presently at minus 2 per cent - looks foul,' he says.
The collapse in profitability is only partly the result of weak demand.
European demand for ethylene actually rose by about 7 per cent between 1990
and 1992, partly the result of increased demand for plastics from the
automobile and building industries. But this rise was less than expected.
It is overcapacity that is inflicting the most serious damage. Not all of
this is due to Asian competition. The European industry has been expanding
production as well. Over the next two years four new ethylene plants, built
by BP Chemicals, Enichem of Italy, and the German groups Veba and BASF, will
begin production. Altogether, a further 2m tonnes will be added to an
already oversupplied market by 1994. None of the new plants, costing some
Dollars 3bn in total, is likely to recover the cost of construction before
the end of the century.
Mr Peter Vogtlander, chemicals co-ordinator at Shell Chemicals, admits: 'We
became over-excited by the results around 1988 and 1989. With margins so
high, we could pay a new plant off within a year. We forgot the lessons of
the early 1980s. Some at the top of the industry should have known better.'
Dr Gary Dirks, manager of international marketing of nitrogen at BP says:
'My economist friends call this the downside of the capital cycle. My less
erudite colleagues refer to it as the march of the lemmings.'
Mr Lee of Dow estimates that within two years the European industry will be
supplying 20m tonnes of ethylene a year at a time when demand will be only
15m tonnes to 16m tonnes.
It is unlikely that balance will be restored as quickly as it was in the
mid-1980s. Then, a combination of falling fuel prices, rapid economic
recovery and a 2m-tonne cut in European ethylene capacity helped the
industry reverse its plight.
This time, the avenues of escape appear blocked. Demand is likely to remain
disappointing at least until the middle of the decade as the principal
international economies remain sluggish. Any increase in demand is unlikely
to lead immediately to higher prices. There is oversupply in the US as well.
Mr Longley of Chem Systems says: 'If prices in Europe pick up American
imports will flood in.'
Nor can the European industry export its way out of trouble. Even during the
best of times, European manufacturers are at a cost disadvantage to US and
Middle East suppliers because they have limited access to cheap gas
feedstocks.
The fall in the dollar has made Europe even more uncompetitive than usual,
according to Mr Longley. The worst case is the basic plastic PVC, widely
used in the construction and packaging industries. The most competitive
European plant produces PVC at Dollars 563 a tonne. A US plant, using cheap
gas rather than oil-derived feedstock, can sell PVC in Europe for Dollars
505, including tariffs and transport costs.
This imbalance has prompted a shift in the balance of trade. In 1987 Europe
was a net PVC exporter of 200,000 tonnes. By last year it was a net importer
of 260,000 tonnes.
Such difficulties are prompting calls for action. 'We just can't afford to
grit our teeth and sit it out waiting for demand to pick up. That would take
until the late 1990s. The industry has to rationalise,' says Mr Lee at Dow.
In a perfect market, the squeeze on margins should mean the least efficient
producers close their plants. But before the sector can rationalise it needs
to overcome some significant barriers to exit. These include:
Cost considerations. The cost of closure, including redundancies and
environmental clean-up, is expensive in the short term. And even if plants
are not producing profits, they may well be generating cash. The most
inefficient plants were closed in the early 1980s. The difference between
the most and least efficient of Europe's 53 ethylene cracking plants remains
considerable. But the number at either extreme is limited - there are few
laggards left.
A lack of urgency. Many petrochemical operations are part of larger
organisations, often state-owned, that do not have proper financial
discipline, says Mr Vogtlander. He says many companies are not aware of
their competitive position and blame their present predicament on the market
rather than their inefficiency. The tendency is to do nothing and hope the
problem goes away, agrees Mr Eric Edwards, a BP manager. The difficulty of
closing ethylene plants which supply derivative plants producing plastics
such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene and PVC. Closure of the
ethylene plant may mean that derivative sites also have to be closed.
Political factors. Some plants may no longer be financially viable, but the
economic impact of closure on local communities is, in some countries,
regarded as unacceptable. One manufacturer comments: 'The Italians have
cornered the market in laggard plants, but closing them is politically
impossible.'
The attitude of the European Commission. The industry fears restructuring
could be blocked or delayed by the Commission which is fearful of cartels
emerging.
In spite of these barriers, one leading company in the industry claims there
are as many as 14 deals in the offing across Europe aimed at rationalisation
and reducing capacity. These range from disposals to joint ventures,
mergers, asset swaps and plant sharing agreements.
Most companies have drawn up lists of European plants that should be closed.
They include those which are too small or too old to be economic. Few
companies include their own plants.
Some steps have already been taken. Internal memos at BP Chemicals talk of a
choice between 'rapid, decisive measures or slow death'. Last week the
company revealed it was selling a polyethylene plant at Antwerp to Neste of
Finland. ICI has announced it is looking to swap assets or set up joint
ventures with other companies in the industry.
But in spite of such moves, the rationalisation process across the industry
is likely to be slow. It needs guts and determination says Mr Vogtlander. 'I
would be amazed if it took sooner rather than longer, but I hope I will be
wrong,' he adds.
Even if the European industry does succeed in restructuring, its future is
likely to remain uncertain. 'The industry believes that when demand
eventually picks up so will prices and margins. They won't,' says Mr Stuart
Wamsley, editor of Focus on Chemicals, an industry newsletter.
The main reason will be the ambitious expansion of supply in Asia. In 1988,
South Korean ethylene capacity was only 500,000 tonnes a year. Next year it
will 3.2m tonnes. China intends to double ethylene output from 1.8m tonnes a
year in 1990 to 3.7m tonnes by 1995. Together with China, Thailand,
Indonesia, Taiwan and Malaysia are expected to add a combined 2.45m tonnes
in new ethylene capacity by the middle of the decade.
'As the Asian plants come on stream, European companies will find it
increasingly difficult to export to Asia, exacerbating the oversupply
problems in Europe,' says Mr Wamsley.
Moreover, as European exports decline, so imports are set to increase.
Low-cost Middle East suppliers, increasingly squeezed by the new Asian
manufacturers, will be forced to divert product to Europe.
Further, although Asian manufacturers may have no obvious cost advantage
over the Europeans, Mr Wamsley believes they too will increasingly export to
Europe and will sharply cut prices in an effort to generate cash. Backed by
large conglomerates, the Asian producers, such as Korea's Hyundai
Petrochemicals and Formosa Plastics of Taiwan, appear willing to endure
losses to win market share.
'There is no room for European manufacturers of commodity chemicals,' warns
Mr Wamsley. 'Once the far eastern plants come on stream, the Europeans don't
have a hope in hell.'
The European shipbuilding and man-made fibres industries - both virtually
destroyed by Asian competition - provide potent warnings for Europe's
petrochemicals sector. If the industry is to avoid their fate, it will have
to rationalise with a speed and determination which it has yet to
demonstrate.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Arts: Walter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE most ardent supporter of C P Taylor would not claim Walter is one of his
best plays. One reason why it is included in the tribute to him in this
year's festival may be that the work pays homage to his native Glasgow.
Glasgow did not encourage Taylor as a playwright. It was the Traverse
Theatre in Edinburgh that discovered him. Afterwards he moved south to
Northumberland, where he wrote his best work. Still, Glasgow was a formative
influence.
Taylor was born there in 1927, the son of a Jewish family which had fled
from tsarist Russia. The Walter of the play is based on a music hall
comedian called Walter Jackson (originally Jacobson). Jackson, like Taylor,
had Jewish parents. He began performing in Glasgow in 1932.
After the war, Jackson became relatively well known beyond music hall. He
appeared in television soaps and did straight acting at the Glasgow
Citizens'. But just as his new career was taking off he died aged 60 in
1977.
The version that appears in a collection of the seven Taylor plays being
performed at this year's festival takes less than an hour to read, but
stretches to two and a half hours on-stage. For all the love and care that
have gone into Hamish Glen's production at the St Bride's Centre, it remains
heavy going.
Walter, the music hall comedian, is left far behind. The play is about the
sex life of a man who wonders how far he remains Jewish. He has left a
Jewish wife for a Jewish mistress, then abandoned her and is now living on
the banks of Loch Lomond with a young Gentile girl who speaks with a Geordie
accent. She wants him to move to Northumberland because the Scots do not
like the English crossing their border and Scotland is full of 'bloody Jews,
communists and film directors'.
The sex life does not seem very satisfactory; nor is the play. There is a
nice joke about Catholics being lovely when they are sober and terrible when
drunk, and Protestants the other way round. Tom Watson plays Walter with
tremendous determination and one admires Tracey Wilkinson as the Geordie
girl. But none of the cast is on fertile ground.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Arts: Byrnam Wood - London Promenade Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE archaic spelling of David Sawer's Byrnam Wood, the latest of this
season's Prom commissions, must be the composer's choice. The point of it is
somewhat obscure - like the point of the piece itself, though on Tuesday
Mark Wigglesworth took the BBC Symphony through it with clean assurance.
Macbeth did indeed provide the inspiration. Quite palpably, 'Birnam wood'
approached Dunsinane in an aqueous mist from which military fanfares soon
emerged, and a menacing thrust; then there was a sort of trio section,
reflective and wanly lyrical (presumably Macbeth's 'I 'gin to be a-weary of
the sun, / And wish the estate o' the world were now undone'). The
fanfare-motifs returned in sharper focus before a numb, discouraged coda.
Though Sawer insists that his 20-minutes-odd piece is not primarily
pictorial or illustrative, it is hard to hear it in any other way. Without
the literary-theatrical clue, we'd have had too little to hang on to. Yes,
there is plenty of fluent, lucid orchestral invention, proving the
composer's keen ear - but it proceeds through calculated harmonic blocks
which are really too transparent, each too patiently explored to keep much
sense of a forward impetus. There are a lot of spidery repeated-figures that
echo Minimalist manners, here more 'evocative' than constructive.
Sawer's score could serve as cogent underpinning for a visible dramatic
burden, but on its own it seemed to accumulate too little force to compel
our attention all the way. However, Wigglesworth judged its sober tempo to a
nicety - a sense of timeless processional gravity maintained at a decent
clip, a strong profile fixed for the long series of disconsolate climaxes. I
admired that very much, and no less his fervent but unhurried exposition of
Shostakovich's Symphony no 13 - the 'Babi Yar' one, on Yevtushenko texts
that used to be politically 'controversial'. The solo bass-baritone was John
Tomlinson, alight with controlled passion and keenly supported by male
voices from the London Philharmonic Choir and the Southwark Festival Chorus.
This angry Thirteenth may not be a 'symphony' in any respectable sense, but
with such performers it had the force of a musico-dramatic document.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Technology: Bar-codes take on a new dimension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From the talking cash resisters at Cannata's Food World in Louisiana to the
high-speed checkout at Sainsbury in London, bar-code technology has become a
standard feature of modern life.
The ordinary one-dimensional bar-code works by using a laser to scan a
pattern of parallel black and white bars and spaces which carry data along a
single line. The laser scanner reads the information and feeds it into a
computer.
Bar-codes have revolutionised inventory management, merchandise shipping and
parts tracking in industries ranging from general retail to healthcare. They
speed up the sales process and help businesses keep a tighter control on
inventory and data.
Yet the capabilities of today's bar-codes are minuscule when compared with
the possibilities of the two-dimensional bar-code, which holds so much
information that it would allow a cash register to play the William Tell
Overture.
Two-dimen-sional bar-codes are being tested by a number of companies, and
the imminent introduction of a new scanner by Symbol Technologies of
Bohemia, New York, will make them available commercially next month.
The original bar-code was developed by Joseph Woodland, a former IBM
employee and Drexel University researcher. Woodland came up with the idea of
using the rectangular format after seeing the black- and-white patterns of
motion picture sound tracks and the dash-dot-dash pattern of Morse codes.
Woodland and his associates started working on the bar-code in 1948, but it
was not until the 1970s, with the advent of lasers and the drop in computing
costs, that the technology became inexpensive enough to be commercially
viable.
The one-dimensional bar code is practical for processing fairly simple
information. But its usefulness is limited by the fact that only 20-30
characters per inch can be squeezed on to a standard label. Symbol
Technologies has developed a two-dimensional bar-code which can store
roughly 100 times more information in the same space.
The company's PDF417 bar-code works by reading the rows and columns. 'With
one-dimensional codes, the information in the height is redundant,' says Rob
Durst, senior director of PDF business development at Symbol Technologies.
'With two-dimensional codes, there's additional information in the height.'
Other two-dimensional bar-codes work by stacking a large number of
one-dimensional bar-codes on top of each other. A high-speed laser scanner
weaves through the stack until it has covered all the rows.
The PDF417 functions like a portable data file or disposable, paper-based
computer memory. It eliminates time-consuming manual data entry, and with it
an element of human error. In addition, Symbol Technology's two-dimensional
bar-code has an error correction formula to help recover a full message if
part of the code has been torn off.
'We started out inventing a bar-code which developed into a portable data
file, and now we have a full-blown data communications protocol for paper,'
explains Durst.
Symbol Technologies says its two-dimensional bar-codes will greatly increase
the speed of moving and receiving goods, but the possible applications for
the medical and hazardous waste industries are even more substantial.
In the case of hazardous waste, two-dimensional bar-codes could contain
warnings, storage details and disposal instructions, as well as
identification. They could also include emergency instructions, allowing
almost instant clean-up of a toxic waste spill.
For the medical community, doctors in remote regions would be able to get a
patient profile from scanning a bar-code, without needing access to a
central database.
'It's not going to be a revolution you'll notice in 1993,' says David
Nelson, an analyst at Lehman Brothers, 'but conceptually it's clear that
two-dimensional bar-codes will become very common over the next decade and
should nearly supplant one-dimensional bar-codes.'

FT  20 AUG 92 / Civil Service bias fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEARS THAT performance-related pay schemes are potentially discriminatory
have been fuelled by Treasury figures showing that women benefit less than
male colleagues from a Civil Service bonus scheme.
The analysis coincides with a rapid spread of performance pay in the Civil
Service and the public sector.
Unions were concerned about discrimination following an earlier analysis by
the FDA Civil Service union of Treasury figures showing that top female
civil servants were considerably less likely to qualify for performance pay
than men.
The Civil Service 'special bonus scheme', introduced in March 1989, is
administered separately from performance-pay schemes and rewards
'exceptional performance' and acknowledges 'particularly demanding tasks'.
Departments can use up to 0.2 per cent of paybills for the scheme.
The Treasury's analysis of 43 departments in 1990-91 shows that 4.8 per cent
of men received bonuses, against 3.9 per cent of women.
The Treasury says in a note to the Council of Civil Service Unions that one
explanation could be a lower incidence of bonuses in jobs dominated by
women, such as secretaries and administrative assistants.
It says departmental returns do not contain sufficient information to test
this hypothesis. Future questionnaires will be amended to make this
possible.
Mr Barry Reamsbottom, general secretary of the CPSA Civil Service
association, said his union reluctantly accepted the extension of
performance-related pay this year. But the Treasury figures heightened fears
of discrimination.
The Treasury analysis shows that 20,719 bonuses were paid in the 43
departments - to 4.4 per cent of staff. Awards varied from Pounds 10 to
Pounds 3,000, with an average bonus of Pounds 168. The total cost of the
awards was 0.1 per cent of the paybill.
The degree to which the scheme is used varies widely. The Inland Revenue
spent 0.01 per cent of its paybill on the bonuses. The Office of Water
Services spent 0.2 per cent.
Nearly half the total number of awards went to administration and executive
officers. In percentage terms, higher and senior executive officers and
grade seven civil servants were most likely to win awards.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Light Relief
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Electricity for the Blackwall Tunnel in east London can be provided by any
supplier and not just London Electricity, the industry watchdog Offer ruled
yesterday.
Professor Stephen Littlechild, director-general of Offer, confirmed that
under rules governing the new competitive electricity market, the tunnel was
a big enough customer to choose its own supplier.
The Department of Transport and the Department of the Environment were in
dispute with London Electricity because they wanted to take power supplies
for the tunnel from PowerGen, the privatised generating company.
Prof Littlechild said he viewed the two tunnels as a single site, with
demand of more than 1MW over a three-month peak usage period - the threshold
above which customers can choose their electricity supplier. The ruling
might have implications for local authorities in purchasing electricity for
street lighting.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Watchdog warns on council tax changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government has been warned against making last-minute changes to the
council tax by the Audit Commission, the local authority watchdog.
In its annual report for the year ending March 31, the commission says the
timetable for introducing the tax - which replaces the poll tax, or
community charge, next April - is 'exceptionally short'.
This has meant local authorities faced a tight schedule for writing the
software for collection of the council tax, training staff to operate the
systems and providing information to the public on the tax.
The commission says: 'It is particularly important that the government does
not introduce late amendments to the council tax procedures which will
require new software routines at a late stage in the process.' Software
problems contributed to difficulties when the poll tax was introduced.
The warning comes as pressure mounts for government action to ease the
introduction of the council tax. There have been calls to adjust the values
of homes on which bills will be calculated to reflect price falls since the
valuation date - April 1 last year.
Backbench Conservative MPs are also pressing for generous Treasury support
to ease the introduction of the tax. Local authority leaders, though, have
backed the commission's warning and urged the government not to indulge in
'last-gasp intervention' to try to keep bills down.
Mr Jeremy Beecham, chairman of the Labour-controlled Association of
Metropolitan Authorities, said late government interference in two of the
three years of the poll tax had discredited the system and compounded
tax-collection difficulties for local authorities.
'If the government panics again and changes the council tax in a bid to keep
bills down, it could kill the tax in its infancy and fatally undermine any
future system of local government finance by creating a culture of
non-payment,' said Mr Beecham.
'Local government will cope with the introduction of the council tax, but
only if the government keeps its hands to itself and does not interfere
simply because it wants to placate its backbenchers.'
A lack of reliable management information in the National Health Service is
a significant obstacle to progress, according to the Audit Commission, which
is also responsible for auditing health authorities.
Financial controls and systems are sometimes 'rather basic' and there are
still too few good finance staff, the commission says.
Meanwhile, Labour has attacked government plans to announce today a further
150 applications for hospital trust status - the third wave due to become
operational in April next year. Ministers will also invite applications for
a fourth wave of trusts.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Naval dockyards may be sold to private sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government is con-sidering selling Britain's two main naval dockyards at
Devonport, in Plymouth, and Rosyth, in Fife, to the private sector.
The Ministry of Defence said yesterday that it was inviting companies to
register by September 18 potential interest in buying one or both of the
royal dockyards, which have been managed since 1987 by private contractors.
Trade unions involved criticised the announcement of a possible sell-off. Mr
Neil Moore, national officer of the GMB general union, said the decision
threatened the future of Britain's dockyards. National security could be
'placed in the hands of private speculators', he said.
The MoD said it would consult all interested parties, including unions,
before taking a decision. If ministers decide to go ahead, tenders are
likely to be issued next spring.
The MoD said: 'Commercial management of the two yards has proved a success
and sale to private-sector operators would be a logical progression.' The
objective was to ensure the most cost-effective support for the Royal Navy,
with any sale having to guarantee that strategic needs were met.
The MoD emphasised that, in the event of a sale, the government would
probably want to retain 'an overriding ownership stake' in refitting
facilities for the Navy's nuclear-powered submarines.
At present refitting of Polaris submarines is carried out at Rosyth and work
on nuclear-propelled 'hunter-killer' submarines is split between there and
Devonport. The MoD announced yesterday that it has given Rosyth a Pounds
120m two-year contract to refit and upgrade weapons on HMS Sovereign, a
hunter-killer vessel.
The operators of the yards - Devonport Management (DML) and Babcock Thorn -
believe the logical option is to concentrate work on nuclear-powered
submarines at a single site.
The MoD said it was possible that a decision on whether nuclear refits
should be concentrated at one dockyard - and at which one - could be made
before any invitation to tender was issued.
Management contracts held by DML and Babcock Thorn are due to expire in 1994
and the MoD is in the process of arranging extensions of up to two years.
Babcock Thorn, which is known to have already declared to the MoD an
interest in purchasing the Rosyth shipyard, proposed in June that the two
yards be brought under a single management structure.
Rosyth and Devonport have both enacted heavy redundancy programmes, with the
combined number of job losses reaching nearly 8,000. Earlier this year DML
warned there was 'a real possibility' that the Devonport dockyard might
close.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Insolvencies total 5% of closures in small businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONLY 5 per cent of small-business closures in the past 12 months were as a
result of formal insolvency applications, according to an analysis by
Barclays Bank.
The bank said the remaining 95 per cent closed for other reasons including
sale, takeover and merger. Many closed because they were unable to make the
business succeed, but only a small proportion left creditors unpaid.
Of the 5 per cent that closed because of formal insolvency applications,
only one in five were because of receiverships. According to the bank
analysis, the rest were because of liquidations or bankruptcies.
Receiverships were down by nearly 7 per cent in the first half of this year
compared with the same period last year. Barclays warned against using the
level of receiverships 'as a barometer of the health of the economy', given
the small proportion of closures that could be attributed to receiverships.
The second quarter saw the number of small business closures fall for the
third quarter in succession. Barclays said this trend 'may indicate
tentative signs of improvement in the economy'. A total of 126,000 closures
in Britain were reported between April and June, the lowest quarterly total
since the end of 1990.
The total number of small businesses has fallen steadily since late 1990,
when closures started to outstrip openings. In the second quarter of this
year there were 110,000 start-ups, a decrease of 15 per cent from the same
period last year.
Greater London and the north-west of England were the only regions to show
increases in start-ups in the first half. New businesses in Greater London
increased by nearly 9 per cent, and in the north-west by nearly 3 per cent.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Deadline for QE2 repair bids set
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CUNARD has set a deadline of tomorrow for bids from US and European
shipyards to carry out substantial repairs to the company's flagship, the
Queen Elizabeth 2, which ran aground off the US coast near Cape Cod,
Massachusetts, 12 days ago.
Further details showing the scale of damage sustained by the liner emerged
yesterday.
Cunard has said that it expects the earliest resumption of service to be
September 29, but marine experts now believe that the damage could put the
liner out of service until at least the middle of October, as well as adding
substantially to insurance costs.
Mr William Coughlin, for General Ship Corporation, in whose Boston shipyard
the QE2 is docked, said last night the damage included 400ft of punctures
and cracks along the keel, and fractured fuel and ballast tanks. He added:
'The damage is much more extensive than we first thought.'
General Ship Corporation is one of several shipyards believed to have bid
for the repair work.
Cunard and Commercial Union, its lead insurer, said last night that the size
of the eventual insurance claim would depend on further assessments of the
repair costs and of the lost passenger revenue.
Cunard has so far had to reschedule eight Atlantic crossings and two
cruises. Passengers are being offered a total refund or fresh bookings.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Failures to reach 80,000 this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TOTAL number of personal and corporate insolvencies in England, Wales
and Scotland will be 80,000 for the year, according to increased estimates
released yesterday by Cork Gully, the insolvency arm of accountancy firm
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, Andrew Jack writes.
The firm says there will be 30,000 corporate insolvencies and 50,000
personal bankruptcies in 1992, which assumes that company failures in the
second half of the year will not exceed those in the first half.
It had previously estimated failures totalling 70,000, but revised the
figure upwards after the Department of Trade and Industry earlier this month
reported figures for personal bankruptcy that were above expectations.
Mr Chris Hughes, managing partner, said there was tentative evidence that
the increase in corporate-sector collapses may have peaked. However, he
stressed that the outlook on personal bankruptcies may yet worsen.
Total insolvencies jumped by 34 per cent between the first half of last year
and this year, with personal bankruptcies rising by 60 per cent in England
and Wales to 18,389 and by 52 per cent to 5,578 in Scotland.
The number of receiverships for all three countries declined during the
period, but liquidations in England and Wales rose by 12 per cent to 12,375
in the first six months of the year.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Names lose campaign to have case heard in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S of London has scored a decisive victory in its legal battle with
dissident US Names.
In the US district court for the southern district of New York on Tuesday,
Judge Morris Lasker dismissed a case brought by some 100 Names  - the
individuals whose assets support underwriting at the insurance market. The
Names alleged that Lloyd's and the agents had breached US securities laws
when they were recruited. The Names started the action - the biggest Lloyd's
case involving US Names - last year.
Judge Lasker ruled, however, that the proper legal forum for any dispute
between the Names and Lloyd's was the English courts.
He said: 'Plaintiffs went to England to become members of a distinctively
British entity, invested in syndicates operating out of London and entered
numerous contracts, all of which stated plainly that Lloyd's affairs and
plaintiffs' investments would be administered in England and subject
exclusively to English law.'
He further found that the transactions into which plaintiffs had entered
with Lloyd's were truly international in character, thus making invalid
plaintiffs' arguments that such clauses illegally deprived them of the
protection of US securities laws.
In a 28-page opinion, Judge Lasker also held that while English laws might
not provide the same remedies as US laws, they were adequate for plaintiffs
to obtain relief.
'The sophistication and fairness of English courts cannot seriously be
challenged,' he said.
Judge Lasker concurred with findings in earlier cases heard by the Tenth
Circuit Court of Appeals and of the federal district court in Chicago, in
cases brought by other US Lloyd's Names. Because of the 'overwhelmingly'
English nature of the dispute, the judge concluded that it was likely he
would have reached the same decision as those other courts under the
doctrine of inconvenient forum - the legal rules under which it is decided
where cases are heard.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Woolwich scheme lets 5,000 keep homes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WOOLWICH, the third largest building society, said yesterday that its
in-house programme for those facing repossession has saved more than 5,000
mortgage holders from losing their homes since the start of the year.
The society, which has 512,300 mortgage customers, said the 5,000 were more
than 12 months in arrears with their payments and would normally have been
evicted.
Last year Woolwich repossessed 2,853 homes. So far this year its
repossessions are running about 20 per cent below last year's level.
Under the Woolwich scheme branches take responsibility for visiting
borrowers with serious arrears problems. Borrowers are encouraged to talk to
all the other lenders to whom they owe money and reschedule their debts.
The society said: 'We are looking after customers who cannot pay all their
mortgages but can pay some of what they owe.'
The 5,000 customers do not have a guarantee that they will never lose their
homes if they keep paying. The society merely says it expects at some stage
to be able to make permanent financial arrangements for them to keep their
homes.
Woolwich said it saw some hope over arrears. Its two-month arrears were
currently 20 per cent lower than they were a year ago and at their lowest
since February 1988.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Recall of parliament rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday rejected demands that it should recall parliament
from its summer recess to debate Britain's new military commitments in Iraq
and Bosnia.
The demands came as ministers privately acknowledged that the conflicts in
both regions might bring pressure for further military commitments in the
next few months.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, voiced doubts about the legal
basis of the proposed air exclusion in southern Iraq. Mr George Foulkes, a
Labour foreign affairs spokesman, said the issue must be debated by MPs.
But aides to Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, signalled that he would not
press Mr John Major to bring MPs back for an emergency debate. Mr Smith was
said to back the prime minister's decisions on the sending of Tornado
fighters to protect the Shia communities in southern Iraq and the limited
use of troops to defend UN aid convoys in Bosnia.
Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, was joined yesterday by Mr Malcolm
Rifkind, the defence secretary, in re-emphasising that the proposed force of
up to 1,800 troops in the former Yugoslavia could be withdrawn if the
situation deteriorated.
Privately, however, senior ministers were voicing concern that the force,
which will operate in Bosnia under the auspices of the UN, could quickly
become embroiled in the conflict. Mr Hurd acknowledged that their rules of
engagement would allow them to return fire if attacked.
It will be some weeks before the troops reach Bosnia. The contingent will
probably be drawn from a battalion currently based in Germany.
Officials said the Gulf contingent of six Tornado ground-attack and
reconnaissance aircraft and two VC-10 refuelling tankers would reach the
area within days. They are expected to be based at Dhahran in Saudi Arabia
or in Bahrain.
Mr Rifkind emphasised that the action against Iraq by the US, France and
Britain was covered fully by existing UN resolutions. It was hoped that the
Baghdad regime would avoid conflict by grounding all flights in the zone.
In private, however, ministers said the move could bring more attacks on the
Shia communities, prompting further western military involvement.

FT  20 AUG 92 / UK real interest rates since 1925: A growing sense of deja
vu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS and KEITH FRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN IS finally paying the price for the inflation of the 1970s. The
economy, struggling to get out of a two-year recession, is burdened by heavy
debts and the highest level of real interest rates at this stage of an
economic cycle since the 1930s.
Real interest rates have been at exceptionally high levels throughout the
past decade, as the chart shows. The build-up of consumer and corporate debt
in the second half of the 1980s occurred even though the real cost of
servicing that debt was higher than at any time in Britain's post-war
history.
The chart tracks the short-term nominal interest rate - 'bank rate', then
'minimum lending rate' and finally 'base rate' - and consumer price
inflation since the UK rejoined the gold standard in 1925. The difference
between the two lines represents the real interest rate.
The red shade represents periods when the real interest rate was positive
and the yellow shade when real interest rates were negative - that is when
the interest paid on outstanding debt was less than the reduction in the
real value of that debt caused by inflation. The blue bars show the annual
rate of economic growth over the same period - calculated quarterly from the
mid-1950s.
The return to positive real interest rates in the 1980s was the direct
result of the turbulence of the previous decade. There were repeated periods
of high inflation during and soon after the Second World War, but negative
interest rates were virtually unknown between then and the 1970s.
After the 1973 oil shock, depositors saw the real value of their savings
destroyed as inflation soared. Companies and individuals that had
accumulated debts before the 1974 property crash saw the real value of their
debts diminish as interest rates failed to keep pace with inflation.
Saving appeared to be foolish and borrowing the path to prosperity, a belief
that lingered throughout the 1980s. Companies and individuals increased
their borrowing, encouraged by rapid increases in nominal asset prices and
the easier credit allowed by financial deregulation.
Nominal interest rates were quite high in the face of rapid credit growth,
but the government had bailed debtors out in the past. The assumption
presumably was that it would do so again.
Yet the government has not kept its side of this implicit bargain. Rather
than allow inflation to accelerate in 1988, the government raised interest
rates, albeit too late to prevent inflation from rising to double figures
again. By joining the European exchange rate mechanism in 1990 it has also
prevented itself from cutting rates further, just as it did in the late
1920s.
The real interest rate in June this year was 6.1 per cent - below its 1980s
peak of 9 per cent in January 1985, but higher than in any year since March
1932 prior to the 1980s. As inflation falls, real interest rates will tend
to rise further, but in January 1981 - when the last recovery was beginning
 -the real interest rate was only 1 per cent. Real rates did not rise above
6 per cent until January 1983, the ninth quarter of recovery.
In the previous recession, in the mid-1970s, real interest rates were
negative, falling to a trough of minus 16.1 per cent in June 1975.
But that was when all the trouble began.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Retail sales volume falls 0.3% in July
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WEAK state of consumer demand was underlined yesterday by government
figures showing that retail sales volumes were 0.3 per cent lower last month
than in June.
The seasonally adjusted figures showed that people were still refraining
from spending in most categories of stores and that the small high-street
upturn that followed the Conservative general election victory was
short-lived.
Spending on food fell for the second consecutive month while spending in
shops selling both food and other goods fell to its lowest volume for six
months. The only sector to show an increase was clothing and footwear -
probably reflecting the marked price discounting that helped cut headline
inflation in July.
The gloomy picture is lightened by the underlying trend. Retail sales showed
a rise of 0.3 per cent in the three months ending on July 31 compared with
the previous three months. In the three months to the end of July volumes
were up by 0.5 per cent compared with the corresponding period last year.
This rise may be due mainly to the boost in consumer spending in the two
months after the April election. Revised figures for the three months to
June indicate a 0.8 per cent increase in volumes in April compared with
March. That was followed by flat demand in May and June.
Between May and July spending in food shops showed a 0.5 per cent increase
compared with the previous three months. Spending in shops which sell food
and other items showed a 0.7 per cent fall on a three-monthly basis.
Non-food sector spending rose 0.5 per cent over the last three months. Sales
of household goods were down 1 per cent.
The British Retail Consortium said retailing continued to be highly
competitive. It added that July's sales were above those in July last year
in value and only just down in volume. 'The fortunes of retailers are
unlikely to improve significantly until consumer confidence returns and the
housing market improves,' the consortium said.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Tec boards suffer exodus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAINING and enterprise councils suffered a further heavy loss of directors
in their second year of operation, according to government figures.
Some 201 of the 1,052 directors of Tecs - excluding chairmen - resigned in
the 12 months to the end of June. Since the 82 employer-led Tecs were set up
more than two years ago to revitalise training and enterprise initiatives in
England and Wales about 400 directors have resigned.
In the first year of operation 27 per cent of Tec directors resigned.
The government yesterday appeared not to view this level of turnover with
great concern. The Department of Employment said the reason for directors
leaving was rarely controversial.
'As senior Tec personnel are not appointed for fixed periods, this turnover
level of busy senior executives represents a perfectly reasonable rate of
natural wastage,' it said.
Birmingham Tec is typical. One director left because he was made redundant
after his company was taken over, two were moved from the city by their
employers and one left because he could no longer spare the time from his
business. Merseyside Tec has lost three, partly because of their other
commitments, the Tec said.
None of the directors who have resigned has publicly blamed frustration with
the way Tecs are progressing. But some say privately that they have become
disillusioned as the government has cut Tecs' budgets.
One executive who left a Tec early this year said he started to think about
his commitment after his secretary told him that he looked angry every time
he came back into the office from a Tec board meeting.
He said he had not made his feelings about Tecs public because he had not
wanted to 'rock the boat' before the general election.

FT  20 AUG 92 / When gloom shades into depression: Emma Tucker finds that
rules of thumb are the only guide through a vague area of economics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS yesterday that gross domestic product, excluding oil and gas
extraction, rose 0.1 per cent in the second quarter signalled the technical
end to the recession in non-oil output.
But few will dare trumpet yesterday's statistics as evidence that good times
are here again.
According to a definition borrowed from the US it takes only two successive
quarters of falling GDP to take an economy into recession and only one of
rising output - however slim - to mark the end.
Some economists, however, suggest that the length of this recession, and the
poor outlook for growth, qualify it as a depression.
There is no technical definition of a depression. The Pocket Economist, an
A-Z guide, says: 'If recession continues, at some imprecise point it becomes
a depression.' It fails to clarify the point.
The Central Statistical Office has no official definition but a spokesman
offered a joke: 'A recession is when you lose your job. A depression is when
I lose mine.'
It is generally accepted that a depression represents a recession of
exceptional depth or duration. The usual association is with the economic
downturn of the early 1930s, the only depression to affect the UK in living
memory.
GDP fell 0.11 per cent in 1930 and 5.49 per cent in 1931, followed by growth
of less than 1 per cent in 1932 and 1933. Unemployment rose to 15.3 per cent
in 1932 before resuming a downward path the following year. Prices fell
almost 8 per cent and did not start to rise again until early 1934.
The current recession has a long way to go before its depth matches that of
the inter-war years.
GDP has fallen 4.2 per cent over eight quarters, with an upward blip in the
third quarter of last year. Non-oil GDP has fallen 4.3 per cent over seven
consecutive quarters.
Prices are still rising, although asset prices have fallen significantly.
Retail prices rose 3.7 per cent in the 12 months to July and producer price
inflation was 3.4 per cent over the same period.
Unemployment was 9.7 per cent in July, but the number of people out of work
and claiming benefit is climbing every month. Many forecasters expect it to
reach 3m next year, taking the rate of unemployment to 10.6 per cent.
Although the figures show that the current recession is not as deep as the
1930s depression, or indeed as deep as the recession in the early 1980s, the
economy faces constraints that did not exist to hold back the recovery in
the 1930s.
In 1931, when Britain abandoned the gold standard, the government was able
to cut interest rates. Britain's commitment to the European exchange rate
mechanism means that the government is prevented from doing so now.
The effect of high real interest rates is compounded this time by the high
levels of consumer debt, particularly in the depressed housing market.
Unless real interest rates fall soon the economy is unlikely to produce
anything more than sluggish growth over the next two years, taking the
current downturn nearer to 1930s proportions. Professor Robert Skidelsky,
historian and biographer of John Maynard Keynes, says this means we may be
nearing a second depression.
He says: 'Obviously if the situation continues and there is no output
recovery for another year and unemployment keeps on increasing, you would be
perfectly entitled to talk about this recession as a depression.'
Even if growth does resume, it is unlikely to return to its long-term trend
of a little over 2 per cent a year for a while yet. So it would be possible
to have growth, and a technical end to the recession, in an otherwise
depressed economy.
This may well be the scenario facing the UK. GDP fell 2.4 per cent last year
and is forecast to fall 0.5 per cent this year. Even if growth resumed trend
levels next year, it would be at least 1994 before the output lost in this
recession was recovered.
It could be that neither slump nor recession are fair characterisations of
the current situation. It is not a slump, because the fall in output and the
level of unemployment do not yet compare with the high levels of the 1930s.
But it is more than a normal recession because output remains depressed,
there is no strong recovery in sight and unemployment is likely to remain
high for longer than would normally be expected.
Perhaps Britain in the 1920s provides a better comparison. In the 1920s
unemployment hovered between 7 per cent and 10 per cent with, on the whole,
feeble growth.
Similarly the UK, because of its adherence to the gold standard, was locked
into fixed exchange rates and was unable to lower base rates to protect
sterling.
Prof Skidelsky says that Keynes had a term to describe the situation - a
semi-slump. This time the government will be hoping for more than a
semi-recovery.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Diet worries cut milk consumption
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FOUR MILLION fewer pints of milk are drunk every week compared with five
years ago, according to a report by the National Dairy Council.
The report blames concern about fat in the diet, a sharp drop in doorstep
deliveries and a fall in the number of children, who are the product's best
customers.
The industry's biggest success was semi-skimmed milk, which hardly existed
in the 1970s and now has a 44 per cent share of sales to households.
The report voices concern that only 62 per cent of homes in England and
Wales have a milk delivery, compared with nearly 90 per cent a decade ago.
Cheaper milk in supermarkets was one reason for this decline, even though
more than 90 per cent of doorstep customers say they value the availability
of milk delivery.
About 200m pints a week are drunk in England and Wales with sales worth
Pounds 3.2bn - 98 per cent of homes buy milk and with the child population
expected to rise this decade there are hopes that demand will increase.
Total demand is slipping by about 0.5 per cent a year, but the council said
its advertising saved the sale of millions of gallons and 'misconceptions'
about milk were being overturned.
Surveys show 90 per cent of people believe milk is a valuable part of the
family diet, compared with 80 per cent in 1986, and 92 per cent say milk is

adults would be healthier if they drank less milk.

FT  20 AUG 92 / BA cabin crews to continue strikes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CABIN-CREW members of the TGWU union employed by British Airways in
Manchester and Birmingham said yesterday that they would press ahead with
their programme of one-day strikes.
They will also vote on whether to take action short of strikes.
The decision, by about 500 crew, came as the airline threatened to suspend
without pay any crew member who went on strike. This followed an improved
offer from BA worth a total of about Pounds 1,000.
Local union officials warned that action would spread to Heathrow, Gatwick,
Belfast and Glasgow should the airline suspend staff.
Seven flights were grounded after strikes at Birmingham and Manchester
earlier this month. Crew elsewhere refrained from action, partly because 221
crew are pursuing legal actions for breach of contract against BA.
The union says the airline imposed worse terms and conditions on crew
without notice, and members would prefer to settle the case through the
courts. BA has offered an out-of-court settlement of Pounds 425 per crew
member.
Under the new terms and conditions about 1,000 staff face pay cuts of Pounds
2,000 on salaries of Pounds 14,000 a year. Next year crews would receive pay
rises only if inflation was above 4 per cent.
The new terms follow a cost-cutting reorganisation of BA shorthaul
operations.
BA said it had not been notified of the planned action and stood by its new
offer.

FT  20 AUG 92 / The enigmatic endurance of a small potatoe: The political
past and future of Dan Quayle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THE truth be told, the political future of Dan Quayle does not lie in the
vice-president's own hands. It rests now, as it has for the last four years,
with George Bush, and the president's patronage is not infinite.
If the Republican ticket loses in November, Mr Quayle will be cut adrift,
just one runner, and not the antepost favourite, in the long race for the
1996 nomination. If it wins, the odds against him will be shorter but the
same contest, perhaps more covert, will be joined - and with an adversary
like James Baker operating under cover and with the president's ear.
Mr Quayle may have the most thankless job in government, but only one
outranks it. As it currently stands, the best chance he has of promotion is
if Mr Bush is physically unable to continue in office. Everything else is a
roll of the dice.
These have been four rough years for J Danforth Quayle, surprisingly plucked
from relative obscurity in the Senate to run with Mr Bush, horribly battered
in the 1988 campaign, and a butt for Democrats and the nation's comedians
ever since.
It has not helped that from time to time Mr Quayle has contributed to the
impression his intellectual capabilities might be lacking, of which the
inability to spell potato was just the latest in a fairly long line (he
encouraged a schoolchild to spell it 'potatoe'). Nor has it helped that Mr
Baker discreetly makes no bones of his belief the vice-president is as much
out of his depth now as he was in 1988.
The net result is found in the polls. A Washington Post/ABC survey last
month found him viewed negatively by 63 per cent, and positively by a mere
26 per cent. Its poll of delegates to this convention found 70 per cent
believing Mr Bush's chances would be improved by dropping him.
Yet Mr Quayle has endured, and not only because of the president's charity.
In an administration which increasingly seemed to be distancing itself from
the Reagan legacy, his office and his capable staff emerged as the back door
through which the true believing conservatives could still enter and hope to
influence policy from the inside.
The vice-president, long popular with grassroots conservatives, became
something of the darling of the Washington right-wing establishment. As
recently as last month it was commonplace to read columns that the real
weakness of the Bush administration was not Mr Quayle, whose place on the
ticket seemed uncertain, but the president himself.
A year ago, when a Bush-Quayle victory seemed so certain, a determined
effort was made to prove that the vice-president was indeed a man of
substance. Two of the most eminent journalists on the Washington Post, no
less, were given remarkable access to Mr Quayle, resulting in a series of
articles that indeed portrayed him in a rather flattering light, beyond a
tendency to lose his temper on the golf course.
Other interviews, including one with the Financial Times, were solicited.
The net result is that the vice-president seems more confident and is
obviously far better equipped to debate Senator Al Gore, the Democratic
running mate, than he was in 1988 to go up against Senator Lloyd Bentsen,
who cut him up ruthlessly with an unfavourable comparison of Mr Quayle to
John Kennedy. Yet that confidence often seems fragile. Last month he seemed
to equivocate on his opposition to abortion. Even his acceptance speech in
Houston is in part designed to redefine his own image by dispelling the
notion that he had a privileged childhood that, inter alia, helped him to
avoid military service.
And in the campaign itself Mr Quayle knows that he is again going to be
confined to second banana, playing the small-town conservative heartland,
securing Mr Bush's base. This is the dutiful role, and Mr Quayle is a
dutiful man, but it does not offer much chance to make more of an
independent name for himself.
Others are going for that shot on the right. Some, such as Jack Kemp,
William Weld and possibly Phil Gramm, have made their pitches to this
convention for conservatism with a less absolute face, while the Pat
Buchanan purity card has again been played. James Baker and Dick Cheney, to
name but two, lie in wait. Dan Quayle is indeed still playing in a tough
school.

a 44-year-old mother - appealed at the Republican convention for Americans

Ms Mary Fisher, daughter of a Detroit real estate investor, said Aids was
not a 'political creature' but affected Democrats and Republicans, blacks
and whites, males and females, in the same brutal way.
Like the Democratic party - whose convention last month heard two people who
were infected with the virus - the Republicans gave her remarks a high
profile. She spoke just before Mrs Marilyn Quayle, wife of the
vice-president, and Mrs Barbara Bush, the president's wife, came to the
podium to speak on a day the convention put aside for 'family values'.
Ms Fisher said she had written to President George Bush and his wife, who
are family friends, to tell them about her disease. She told a TV
interviewer that Mr Bush phoned her immediately after her speech. 'He wanted
to send me his love,' she said.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Speculation mounts over cabinet hit-list: Republican Party
Convention in Houston
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HOUSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Nicholas Brady, US treasury secretary, said yesterday he accepted that
President George Bush would want to reshuffle his cabinet if he won a second
term, but he had not talked to the president personally about leaving,
writes Jurek Martin, US Editor, in Houston.
His remarks were in response to a flurry of speculation generated on Tuesday
night when Mr Bush said in a television interview: 'You'll see plenty of new
faces, plenty of changes in this administration.'
The instant assumption was that Mr Brady, Mr Richard Darman, the budget
director, and Mr Michael Boskin, chairman of the council of economic
advisers, would go, as long demanded by right-wing Republicans dissatisfied
with the performance of the economy.
Of these, only Mr Boskin has previously indicated a desire to leave his
post, although Mr Brady said it was within the president's prerogative to
make changes he wanted and that a second term was a logical time to make
such moves. This was coupled to a report in the New York Times that Mr Bush
was considering keeping Mr James Baker at the White House in a second term,
to serve as overall economic policy chief.
Mr Baker, secretary of state until Sunday when he becomes Mr Bush's chief of
staff and campaign manager, was reported to be resistant to the idea on the
grounds that it was 'too gimmicky'. His return to control over foreign
policy had previously been considered the most likely option should Mr Bush
win in November.
The White House yesterday denied rumours that Mr Jack Kemp, the outspoken
housing secretary, was also on the potential hit-list. His departure would
upset the right and might be interpreted as ingratitude after Mr Kemp's
effusive endorsement of the president in a speech to the party's convention
on Tuesday night.
Mr Bush's main purpose in his television interview, as in many others
recently, has been to demonstrate he is as committed to 'change' as is Mr
Bill Clinton, his Democratic rival. This will be an important theme of his
acceptance speech tonight, in which he is said to be contemplating an
announcement about Mr Baker's long-term future.
But Mr Clinton was quick to latch on to the president's plan for cabinet
changes, saying it was an acknowledgement that Mr Bush's current team had
failed.
Changing the composition of his economics team would demonstrate that on
domestic affairs the president is prepared to turn over a new leaf. Of even
greater immediate interest tonight is the extent to which he will commit
himself to tax cuts.
The risks of going out on a limb and making an unsustainable promise
comparable to his 'read my lips, no new taxes,' pledge of four years ago are
well understood. The more likely approach is a general commitment to
reducing taxes in a second term as progress is made towards cutting the
federal budget deficit.
But this middle way might be seen as ineffective, much as Mr Bush's past
speeches on the economy have been.
An ABC News-Washington Post poll released yesterday, the first nationwide
survey of voting preferences conducted since the party's convention opened,
showed Mr Bush dropped two points in the last week, leaving him trailing Mr
Clinton by 58 to 33 per cent. Republican leaders had forecast Mr Clinton's
lead would be halved by the convention's conclusion.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Bush condemned to deliver the speech of his life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is a hyperbolic trap that journalists and politicians fall into all
too easily. It is the tendency to describe a speech to be given by a
particular politician as the most important that person will ever deliver.
In the popular American imagination the big speech becomes a litmus test of
purpose, toughness, leadership. It is often, these days, imbued with the
muscular qualities which admiring Americans profess to see in Prime
Minister's Question Time in the British House of Commons.
These are the 'big speech' expectations that President George Bush and
Vice-President Dan Quayle are expected to live up to tonight in their
acceptance addresses. Four years ago the fighting speech Mr Bush gave to the
New Orleans convention was considered an important step on his way to the
White House; this time its content is supposed to provide the 'vision thing'
he is normally so poor at supplying.
As Congressman Vin Weber, the articulate conservative from Minnesota, said:
'The most important thing he has to do is to give the American people reason
to believe his second term will be worth voting for.' Newspapers, liberal as
well as conservative, write the same every other day.
This has not been a bad year for political speeches in the US. Governor Bill
Clinton gave a fine one on race in New Orleans in April, although a poor one
to his own convention last month.
Governor Mario Cuomo of New York, savagely witty, and former Congresswoman
Barbara Jordan, regally professorial, turned on their oratorical skills in
New York.
This week in Houston Mr Ronald Reagan and Mr Pat Buchanan have come up with
stemwinders, although of a very different nature. The former president was
perhaps kinder and gentler than in his 'evil empire' days. But the touches,
the self-deprecating humour - 'I knew Thomas Jefferson' - and the evocation
of a finer nation were, well, Reaganesque. Mr Jack Kemp, the housing
secretary, laid down his own effective marker on Tuesday night.
But, in the end, does 'the speech' matter that much? The great addresses to
Democratic conventions used frequently to be given by Senator Edward
Kennedy, and he never made it all the way.
On the Republican side Mr Reagan had to give a lot of good speeches before
he ascended in 1980.
If there have been words that have determined the outcome of elections, they
have often not been contained in speeches. Three presidential debates - in
1960, 1976 and 1980 - mattered far more in defining to the general public
the character and capabilities of candidates. The chaos of Chicago in 1968,
exemplified by the soundless swearwords coming out of the mouth of Mayor
Richard Daley, damned the Democrats
Not that that matters for Mr Bush tonight. He is condemned to give 'the
speech of his life.' Nothing less will do.

<TEXT>
MR Ross Perot said last night he might return to the presidential race if
the two main political parties failed to address the economic crisis facing
the country, writes Jurek Martin.
In an interview with CBS-TV from nearby Dallas, the Texas billionaire said
that, if enough of his volunteers asked him to run, then 'like a fire
extinguisher, if all else fails' he might re-enter the fray.
The interview was vintage Perot, never acknowledging the reasons given for
the abrupt withdrawal last month of his never-declared candidacy. It also
coincided with the publication of his new book, containing some of the
economic policy prescriptions he promised but never made public.
When he quit, Mr Perot was on the ballot in about half of the 50 states. He
has continued some funding of registration drives in the others, but his
movement appears to have died.
Mr Ed Rollins, hired to give shape to the campaign but who resigned before
Mr Perot pulled out, said he was not surprised by the latest remarks, as 'he
liked the limelight'.

<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ATTEMPT by Mr Marclio Marques Moreira, Brazilian economy minister, to
defend fiscal austerity by resisting political patronage appears to be
wilting under the crisis bedevilling President Fernando Collor.
The minister has agreed to release the equivalent of about Dollars 400m
(Pounds 209.4m) in credits for building cheap housing and sanitation
projects, at the request of Mr Ricardo Fiuza, social action minister. He is
one of several ministers from the conservative Liberal Front party (PFL),
the main source of political support for Mr Collor, who might face
impeachment over corruption allegations.
The PFL has been seeking reward for its support, especially since the
party's chances in municipal elections in October have dwindled because of
its clear relationship with the unpopular president.
Mr Eduardo Suplicy of the opposition Workers' party (PT) called the release
of credits 'an attempt by the federal government to please the legislators
who provide its base of support, to ensure that they will vote against
impeachment.'
The strategy of funding public works could be a powerful lobbying card for
Mr Collor, against whom there would be no impeachment proceedings if a third
or more of Congress were to demur. However, Mr Moreira, whose presence gives
the administration credibility at home and abroad, especially in business,
had resisted pressure to open the coffers.
PFL support across the country, though, is not solid. An influential PFL
state governor has broken with Mr Collor and other governors have said the
86 PFL federal representatives should have a free vote on the impeachment
issue. 'The public demonstrations are making legislators think twice about
their stand on impeachment,' said Mr Suplicy.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE investors were yesterday unmoved by government efforts to restore
confidence in the markets, as reaction to an emergency package on Tuesday
was generally muted.
Investors remained unconvinced that the government's support measures would
help either the financial system or the depressed stock market. The Nikkei
average of the leading 225 shares, which fell to a six-year low on Tuesday,
managed to recoup only 341.33 points to 14,650.74, largely attributable to a
technical recovery.
In the package on Tuesday, Mr Tsutomu Hata, finance minister, announced
measures to curb the sale of shares by banks as a means of easing pressure
on the stock market.
The Tokyo financial community was surprised by Mr Hata's admission of the
severity of the problems facing Japan's economy and financial markets.
However, a lack of concrete measures to solve the problems of non-performing
loans discouraged many business-men.
Low volume on the stock market yesterday indicated an underlying market
scepticism. Traders noted that private investors remained on the sidelines;
institutions, the market's main investors, also maintained a neutral stance.
'We're not in a hurry to buy,' said an official at Nippon Life, the
country's leading life assurance company. 'There will be plenty of chances
in the near future,' he added, implying that the market had further to fall.
Prospects for an early market recovery remain bleak because of fears that
corporate earnings will stay depressed in this fiscal year. 'We haven't hit
bottom yet. The market could go to as low as 12,000,' said Mr Jason James,
strategist at brokers James Capel.
Investors now await the government's package of fiscal measures, including a
supplementary budget, which is expected to inject Y6,000bn (Pounds 24.7bn)
to Y8,000bn into the economy.
Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, expressed support for the
finance ministry's emergency package. He said the central bank intended to
back the ministry's efforts by ensuring price stability and maintaining
credit order.
Mr Mieno, who had been reluctant to comment on movements in the stock
market, expressed concern over the effect of sliding share prices on
corporate sentiment.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Iraqi Shias suffer systematic repression: Destruction of
centuries-old culture - Marshland home threatened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE decision by the US, Britain and France to impose an air exclusion zone
over southern Iraq was made against a background of persistent repression of
the Shia population which accounts for more than half the country's
estimated 18.5m population.
For nearly 18 months their suffering at the hands of Saddam Hussein's regime
in Baghdad has been well known to the western intelligence community and
reported on by the few correspondents who had access to the region.
Mr Max van der Stoel, special rapporteur of the commission on human rights
at the UN, issued a devastating report earlier this year on the measures
which had been taken against the Shia and followed up last week with a
further statement to the Security Council which drew particular attention to
the Marsh Arabs.
What has emerged is the all-too-familiar pattern of events through which
Saddam Hussein has sought to control dissident ethnic and religious groups
opposed to Baghdad.
In his original report, Mr van der Stoel pointed to the systematic
destruction of the centuries-old culture of the southern Shia, the
desecration of buildings and graves, and the the disappearance of clergy. In
1970 he estimated there were up to 9,000 clergy in the city of Najaf alone.
There were only 800 remaining before the start of the Gulf War. After the
1991 uprising of those 800 almost all were under arrest or had disappeared.
The report estimated that in addition to widespread executions and torture,
some 150,000 people may have been arrested, of whom some 15,000 came from
Najaf.
While that repression continues unabated, Mr van der Stoel has drawn
attention to an increased threat to the Marsh Arabs who live in the network
of island and waterways to the north and west of Basra, an area of
outstanding natural beauty. He reported that he has a videotape of Iraqi
generals being instructed to 'wipe out' three specific Marsh Arab tribes who
are referred to as an 'un-Iraqi' people.
In addition, many Marsh Arabs were being forcibly relocated in a way which
recalled similar operations among the Kurdish population in the late 1980s.
And the report to the Security Council indicated that perhaps the gravest
long-term threat was the 'Third River Project' which would drain huge areas,
destroy the natural habitat and force out remaining centres of population.
Reuter adds: There is no final agreement among Gulf War allies on a plan to
shoot down Iraqi military aircraft over the southern part of the country
populated by Shia Moslems, a White House spokesmen told reporters at the
Republican convention in Houston.
Mr Marlin Fitzwater said consultations with the allies were initiated by the
US several days ago but that 'a lot of details have yet to be worked out'.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Food and sanity disappear in Somalia: Money is master and
the gun is law in a country dying on its feet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COCKY teenager with a bazooka and G-3 machine-gun slung over his shoulder,
pushes a wheelbarrow down a dusty street in Kismayu, the southern port city
of Somalia. His T-shirt says 'I AM THE BOSS'. Inside the wheelbarrow are two
sacks of looted grain marked 'USA'.
He passes starving mothers and children in the street and then walks past
the Kismayu General Hospital where, yesterday morning, Abdishakur Abdulahi,
a 27-year-old worker, was admitted after a bullet had passed through his arm
and entered his chest. The hospital has no painkillers, no anti-biotics and
no X-Ray machine.
'One guy shot me on the street this morning, I don't know why, maybe because
I am a different clan,' said Mr Adbulahi, lying in a hospital bed with flies
buzzing around his blood-soaked bandages. 'There is no photo so where the
bullet is nobody knows but I am feeling it inside my chest. Many people like
me are dying for lack of money to buy medicines in the market.'
Kismayu, which has changed hands several times during the 20-month civil
war, is under gun law. The hospital receives at least 25 serious bullet
wounds a day.
The gunfire and looting have stalled efforts to feed at least 175,000 hungry
people in the town and a further 100,000 in the surrounding Juba Valley.
'The security situation is very bad for relief efforts,' said Mr Fabio
Baiardi, the Kismayu administrator of the Red Cross. 'There are too many
guns. I think the only hope is for the UN blue-berets to come and restore
order.'
At the town's gun bazaar, traders sell bullets, firing pins and grenades,
set out on a wooden stall. Prices are up, but 30 rounds of ammunition for a
machine-gun cost Dollars 14 (Pounds 7.30) and a grenade goes for Dollars
2.70. 'Money is the master. You can get anything here,' said one gun seller.
Vicious internecine clan warfare in Kismayu accounts for many of the town's
gun-battles. Yesterday, gunmen from the Habir Gidir clan pointed automatic
rifles at Red Cross workers in Kismayu airport as they tried to evacuate 45
members of the Mijeerteen clan on an aircraft flying to Garowe, a northern
Somali town controlled by the Mijeerteen tribe.
Twelve of the Mijeerteen group were abducted by the Habir Gidir gunmen. By
yesterday afternoon, their whereabouts or condition was unknown.
Looting is another severe problem. Yesterday, two people were shot dead at
the airport in squabbles over food airlifted into Kismayu. On Sunday,
off-loading of 3,000 tonnes of sorghum on a UN-chartered ship at the harbour
was suspended after gunmen had looted 300 barrels containing 60,000 litres
of diesel and up to 600 tonnes of food.
'I hear the merchants don't like it when free food comes into town because
it forces the prices down,' said Captain John Sorrenson, the skipper of the
UN ship. At least 1600 tonnes of food remain on board, waiting for the UN to
reach agreement with the dissolute warlords who control the city.
Nearby, more than 12,000 people have constructed a squalid squatter camp
known as Hotel Wammo. Up to 100 people a day are arriving at the camp,
mostly from the Lower and Upper Juba Valley between Gobweyn and Saco Uen.
Most of the new arrivals are bantu people, who used to work on plantations
that are now destroyed. Everything they owned has been looted by Somali
gunmen. 'They are always the last to get food because they have no allies in
the Somali clan war,' said Mr Gean Metenier, Kismayu's Unicef
representative.
Many have walked up to 300km on foot to the town in search of food. Elders
at the camp said seven children were dying a day.
Just outside the camp, three men carry the rigid body of a ten-year-old boy
to an open graveyard in what was once the city's rubbish dump.
Seven scrawny Maribu storks, which feed off carrion, perch on the sandy
mounds of graves watching the simple burial ceremony. The boy's father
places the body in the grave and then puts oil-drum lids on top of the body
to prevent the scavenger birds digging it up. The stomach-wrenching smell of
decomposing flesh hangs heavily in the air.
Three teenagers with bandoliers of bullets and machine-guns are standing
against a crumbling sandstone wall chuckling together. 'That's Somalia,'
said a Somali Unicef official. 'We have lost all our morals and even our
sanity.'

from Tokyo. The new company, Shanghai TAMP Autoparts, capitalised at Dollars
1.12m, is equally owned by the Taipei-based Taiwan Atsugi Motor Parts
Industrial (TAMP) and Shanghai Clutch Factory, a unit of Shanghai Automotive
Industry Corp.
It will begin processing clutch pressure plates in 1994 with a capacity of
2m a month. Atsugi Unisia owns 30 per cent of TAMP, with the rest owned by
Taiwan investors. The Chinese joint venture, to begin trial output in
September 1993, will create 50 new jobs in 1993, rising to 90 by 1997.
Most products to be made by the Shanghai venture will be exported to TAMP,
with some sold in China. The venture is expected to export products to
Japan.

ISRAEL and China yesterday initialled a trade agreement Israeli officials
hope will facilitate increased exports of such items as electronic goods and
farm equipment, Tony Walker writes from Jerusalem. The pact follows the
setting-up of formal relations in January and comes amid increased trade
contacts between the two countries.
Mr Zvi Koren, director-general of Israel's industry and trade ministry, said
the protocol would enable Israel to 'enter the Chinese market directly and
smoothly, without barriers'. Israel's 'visible' exports to China are
expected to reach Dollars 30m this year, against imports of Dollars 4m.
Israeli companies have also been involved in selling military equipment and
know-how to China.
Much of Israel's trade with China has been routed through third countries.
Mr Koren said a 'co-ordinating committee' would start to deal with such
issues as investment insurance, double taxation and copyright.
El Al, Israel's national carrier, will begin direct once-weekly flights from
Tel Aviv to Beijing next month, it said yesterday.

AMERICAN and Chinese trade officials yesterday began crucial talks in
Beijing on US demands for greater market access.
Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, last month presented Peking with a
list of issues that must be resolved in the current negotiating session.
Otherwise, she said, she will publish a list of potential sanctions and
begin public hearings on them.
The talks come at a time when China's trade surplus with the US is rising
sharply. The US international trade commission last week said the US trade
deficit with China had climbed 67 per cent over the comparable period last
year, rising from Dollars 2.2bn to Dollars 3.4bn. Apparel and footwear
headed the list of US imports.
US exports to China in the first quarter rose almost 18 per cent to Dollars
1.6bn from the same period in the previous year. The leading export
commodity was grains, which cannot be counted on to grow if Chinese
production expands.
Leading the US team in China is Mr Ira Wolf, a new assistant US trade
representative. Last month he told a Senate committee that he would try to
resolve the dispute this month. He said thus far China's responses to US
demands for greater market access have been 'inadequate.'
'The Chinese trade system is opaque and, in many instances, is run by the
invisible hand of bureaucrats and through the use of secret directives and
unfair practices,' he said. 'Like many Third World countries, China has
erected multiple, overlapping non-tariff barriers.'

FT  20 AUG 92 / World Trade News: US calls truce in oilseeds row with EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE and REUTER

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US has called a truce in its dispute with the EC over oilseeds subsidies
and put off, at least temporarily, threats to levy Dollars 1bn (Pounds 516m)
in sanctions against EC food and spirits.
Although the 60-day period for compensation talks under world trade rules
has elapsed without agreement, the US has signalled its intention to go into
further meetings with the EC early next month.
A 'strongly worded' message was reported to have been sent to the EC this
week. The US expressed its willingness to continue negotiations into
September, but insisted that a swift solution be found.
The US oilseeds industry and Bush administration officials badly want a
settlement. The threatened Dollars 1bn in sanctions, which would be likely
to lead to retaliation, could set off a trade war that would prove fatal to
businesses and the Uruguay Round.
But the US industry is insisting any agreement be in time to have an impact
on European planting of its 1993 oilseeds. Much of that crop is planted in
the autumn but officials believe agreement could be reached in time.
The American Soyabean Association (ASA), which brought the dispute to Gatt
in 1987, yesterday was still urging the US Trade Representative to act
without delay. In an alliance with producers of sunflower seeds and canola,
another genus of oilseed, the ASA was preparing a letter to the
administration expressing its 'deep concern' about the lack of progress in
the talks.
The ASA has won decisions by two dispute settlement panels. In 1989 and
1992, these found that EC oilseeds subsidies impair the duty-free status
given soyabeans in negotiations three decades ago. 'The deadline for
negotiations under Article 28 is now past,' said Ms Nancy Foster, an ASA
official. 'It is imperative the EC realise the US is serious. We won our
case in 1989. Here we still are and talk, talk, talk has not redressed the
injury'.
In case the administration misses the domestic political significance of
this, it is being pointed out that Governor Bill Clinton, President George
Bush's Democratic opponent in the presidential election this year, has
spoken out strongly on the issue. 'If the EC is trying to stall, it should
think twice before assuming it would get a better deal from him,' an
official said.
Reuter adds from Brussels: Mr Ray MacSharry, EC farm commissioner, yesterday
welcomed the US decision to refrain from activating a list of retaliatory
tariffs. He praised the decision not to publish the hit list of Dollars 1bn
of European wines, liqueurs, cheeses and other goods, saying the two sides
would actively pursue talks on the issue. 'It's in everybody's interests to
find a solution and avert a trade war,' Mr MacSharry declared.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GEORGIAN troops yesterday tightened their hold on Sukhumi, the capital of
the breakaway Black Sea resort region of Abkhazia, after three days of
fighting left at least 50 people dead.
The streets of Sukhumi, which until Monday were filled with thousands of
Russian holidaymakers, were littered yesterday with burnt-out tanks and
downed trees.
Georgian troops were clearly in control, and although there were no civilian
vehicles on the road, the population appeared relaxed, with old men and
women smiling and waving at jeeploads of passing soldiers.
Brig-Gen Zurad Nairashvili of the Georgian army said Mr Vladislav Ardzinba,
the deposed Abkhazian leader, was holed up in the town of Gudauta, 80km
north of Sukhumi, protected by 1,500 men. There was no indication whether Mr
Ardzinba would receive help from his ally, nearby Chechnya, which is an
autonomous region within Russia.
'We shall fight until we win our freedom or they annihilate us,' Mr Zarab
Achba, a member of the Abkhazian parliament, told Itar-Tass news agency.
He was speaking from Gudauta, where many Abkhazian deputies fled as Georgian
tanks and troops occupied Sukhumi on Tuesday.
Gen Nairashvili said the rebels had killed eight Georgian soldiers during
Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, bringing the death toll in fighting to
more than 50 since Monday.
Georgian troops attacked Sukhumi after the Abkhaz parliament indicated it
wanted to declare the republic, part of Georgia, an independent state.
Georgians emphasise that only 18 per cent of the population in the region is
Abkhaz.
The conflict has confronted Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the former Soviet
foreign minister, with his most serious political crisis since taking charge
in Georgia five months ago.

FT  20 AUG 92 / IIF chief to join German bank council
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Horst Schulmann, a former senior economic adviser to Mr Helmut Schmidt,
former German Chancellor, and a central figure in the creation of the
European Monetary System, is to return to Germany to join the Bundesbank's
policy-making council.
Mr Schulmann, 59, managing director of the Institute for International
Finance in Washington, will bring to the Bundesbank an exceptional blend of
domestic and international monetary expertise.
He has been nominated by the regional government of Hesse as successor to Mr
Karl Thomas as president of the local state central bank, who sits on the
Bundesbank council along with Germany's other state central bank chiefs.
Mr Thomas died this month at the age of 63 after serving just 2 1/2 years of
an eight-year term.
The appointment, still to be ratified by the Bundesrat, the upper house of
the German parliament, may add to the central bank's credibility at a time
of controversy over its restrictive monetary policy. His influence is likely
to prove a counterweight to the mainly domestically-orientated policy views
of other members of the Bundesbank council.
Mr Schulmann was Chancellor Helmut Schmidt's personal representative for
economic summits between 1978 and 1982, and in 1980 he was appointed state
secretary at the finance ministry. He spent four years as a senior executive
at the World Bank in the early 1970s.
He joined the Institute for International Finance as deputy managing
director in March 1984, taking over as managing director in January 1987.
The IIF is an agency set by international commercial banks to monitor Third
World debt.
As 'sherpa' to Mr Schmidt, he helped prepare the ground for a succession of
western economic summit conferences from 1978-82. He also helped usher in
the EMS in 1978. He accompanied Mr Schmidt at a historic meeting with the
Bundesbank council in November 1978 at which Mr Schmidt tried to overcome
Bundesbank hostility to the setting up of the EMS. The state central bank in
Hesse has important responsibilities for regulation of Frankfurt's financial
services sector, Germany's largest. He seems likely to pursue measures
designed to strengthten Frankfurt as a financial services centre.

market hits new low as unemployment continues to increase

AS the Frankfurt stock market index fell 8.5 points yesterday, posting a new
low for the year, the Baden-Wurttemberg town of Gosheim lost 49 jobs.
Mr Hubert Hermle, boss of machine tool maker Berthold Hermle and paymaster
to 749 people, says his order book is 42 per cent lower than a year ago.
First-half sales have dropped 22 per cent. The whole works is being put on
short-time until the end of the year, and 49 workers will have to go.
It seems insignificant compared to the 6,000 workforce reduction by the
computer group, Siemens-Nixdorf, or the 89 per cent profits fall of
engineering giant Mannesmann, but Mr Hermle's sorry report is only one of
hundreds of similar cases over the past few months.
The main elements of the picture have been clear since the spring, when
Volkswagen said it planned to shed 12,500 workers over five years. Then came
Mercedes-Benz announcing 20,000 job losses, Porsche 850, and Hoesch, BMW and
Grundig with 3,000 each.
After nine years of rapid, uninterrupted growth - more than 3m new jobs have
been created since 1983 - the western German labour market has stopped
expanding. Suspicions of stagnation, which stirred in the second half of
last year have been confirmed and are turning to fears of a downturn.
The slimming-down process, has gathered pace. Gloomy profit forecasts have
turned into even gloomier results among virtually all large groups, and the
process has spread through the whole of industry.
Unemployment matches the 1988 level at 1.8m or 6 per cent. Unemployment in
the engineering and electronics industries is 13 per cent. Almost 250,000
people are on short-time work.
Continuing international recession, virtual stagnation at home, cramped
public spending, falling consumer confidence, high interest rates and wages
costs are all taking their toll. As the Westdeutsche Landesbank said in its
latest report: 'In recent months economic development has been moving above
all in one direction: downwards and on a wide front'.
The one variable currently within the control of industry is the payroll.
Managers who took on thousands of new workers on the strength of the
unification boom, agreed inflationary wage demands in 1990 and 1991 for fear
of losing output through strikes, and even this year granted an average 6
per cent plus increase, but they are now making economies.
The supervisory board of Lufthansa, DM542m (Pounds 192.1m) in the red in the
first half, meets on August 31 to agree well-signalled job cuts and
restructuring moves.
But there is also the chance of the odd green shoot. A pre-emptive offer
last weekend from the DAG white-collar union to accept effective wage cuts
of 8 per cent for cabin and ground crew, if everyone else did the same,
prompted the airline's board to cut its own pay by 10 per cent.
DAG, said 'exceptional circumstances call for exceptional actions'.

FT  20 AUG 92 / West European car sales decline by 15.3% in year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WEST EUROPEAN new car sales dropped by an estimated 15.3 per cent in July
under the impact of a dramatic fall in new car sales in Germany, the single
biggest European market.
According to industry estimates German new car sales plunged by around 37
per cent in July to only 349,000 from 553,000 a year ago, when demand was
still at a record level in the wake of unification.
The accelerating fall in German new car sales will ring alarm bells in the
European car industry and is expected to force car makers to revise
downwards their earlier forecasts for a decline of only 1 per cent in west
European new car sales for the whole of 1992.
The trend in sales in the other big volume markets in Europe suggests that
they will be unable to compensate for the fall in Germany.
Hopes for a recovery in the very depressed UK market have not been realised.
Sales in July were 8.5 per cent lower than a year ago, and car makers appear
to have accepted that demand in the crucial month of August, which accounts
for more than a fifth of UK new car sales, will be little changed from last
year.
At the same time the European industry is becoming increasingly cautious
about the outlook in France and Spain. Spanish new car sales in the first
seven months were still 16.9 per cent higher than a year ago, but the rate
of increase fell to 8.9 per cent in July, and car makers fear tightening
economic measures will slow the recovery further.
Overall West European new car sales in July fell to around 1.13m from 1.33m
a year ago. Demand was lower than a year ago in 10 of 17 markets across west
Europe.
In the first seven months of the year west European new car sales at 8.5m
were 3.3 per cent lower than a year ago, led most importantly by an
estimated fall of 14.4 per cent in Germany to 2.54m.
Renault, the French car maker, has gained most ground among the big six
volume car makers with a 3.7 per cent jump in sales in the first seven
months increasing its share to 10.6 per cent from 9.9 per cent a year ago.
In July it managed to hold its sales virtually unchanged from a year ago in
contrast to all its volume car rivals.
Despite the weakening German market the Volkswagen group, which includes
Audi, SEAT and Skoda, has consolidated its commanding overall lead. An
estimated rise of 1.6 per cent in its sales volume in the first seven months
has allowed it to raise its west European market share to a record 17.8 per
cent from 16.9 per cent a year ago.
Its lead has been strengthened by the waning fortunes of the Fiat group,
which has seen sales drop by an estimated 8.7 per cent in the first seven
months of the year, narrowly holding on to second place ahead of General
Motors (Opel/Vauxhall) and the Peugeot group, which includes Citroen.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Opposition grows in France to Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OPPOSITION to the Maastricht treaty on European economic and political union
continues to grow in France ahead of next month's referendum, with latest
opinion polls showing that the 'no' vote has risen to 46-47 per cent.
After Denmark voted against the treaty in June, the French vote on September
20 is seen as critical for the plans to deepen European union.
A poll conducted by the CSA research institute for today's L'Evenement du
Jeudi magazine marks a new low in French support for European union. It
indicated that 53 per cent of voters would approve Maastricht, while 47 per
cent would reject it. Another poll for Japanese broker Daiwa Securities
showed a 54-46 per cent majority for the treaty.
French support for Maastricht was around 70 per cent in early June before
the referendum campaign began, according to most opinion polls, but had
fallen to 56-57 per cent by early this month.
The socialist government, which has led the pro-Maastricht lobby and would
be seriously embarrassed by a negative result, yesterday appointed Mr Jack
Lang, the flamboyant arts and education minister, and Ms Elizabeth Guigou,
the glamorous minister of European affairs, to co-ordinate its campaign.
Their appointment was seen as an attempt to liven up the hitherto lacklustre
debate.
Paris financial markets were depressed during the day by rumours about the
CSA poll, which was announced on TV after the markets closed. The CAC 40
Index fell again yesterday, having fallen most of last week, to close 0.14
per cent down at 1,734.
The growth of opposition to Maastricht in France is undoubtedly linked to
dissatisfaction with President Mitterrand and the socialists. This mood has
been fuelled by the latest economic data which has underlined the sluggish
state of the French economy.
Until now the referendum campaign has been relatively low-profile and,
unusually for France, there has been little analysis of the intellectual
issues behind the debate.
One reason is that August is traditionally the month for long summer
holidays in France. Another is that the political agenda has been dominated
by the conflict in the former Yugoslavia.
The appointment of Mr Lang and Ms Guigou to orchestrate the government's
campaign is clearly designed to liven things up. Mr Lang, a tireless
self-publicist and a firm favourite of President Francois Mitterrand,
orchestrated the socialists' campaigns for the 1979 European elections and
the 1988 presidential elections.
He has already assembled a committee of 'celebrities' to campaign in favour
of Maastricht, including actors Gerard Depardieu, Jeanne Moreau and
Catherine Deneuve.
French industrial production fell by 0.4 per cent in June, according to
official figures. The main reason was the poor performance of the energy and
construction sectors, where output fell by 1.37 per cent and 4.76 per cent
respectively. The June fall followed one of 1.6 per cent in May.

was suspending its shares and transferring all of its assets to a new
holding company in a drastic move to keep its insurance and banking
operations running.
Hafnia's insurance and bank subsidiaries - which include Prolific, the
London-based life assurance and pensions company acquired in 1989, and the
Economic, a small general insurance business - expect to continue as before
under the umbrella of a new company, Hafnia Holding 1992.
The old company will suspend debt payments and is understood to be seeking
protection from its creditors.
The news hit share prices across Scandinavia with falls of more than 1 per
cent in the share price indices of the Copenhagen, Stockholm and Oslo
bourses.
Hafnia's difficulties mark the end of an ambitious attempt to create a giant
pan-Scandinavian financial services company.
They will have serious repercussions for some of Scandinavia's biggest banks
and insurers, including Skandia of Sweden, Baltica of Denmark and Uni
Storebrand of Norway. Norwegian authorities last night were reported by the
Oslo newspaper Aftenposten to be considering a rescue plan for Uni
Storebrand.
Hafnia said the creation of a company, which will be wholly owned by the old
holding company, was the 'best way to secure the interests of shareholders
and creditors'. The old company's liabilities amount to DKr6bn (Pounds
553m).
Hafnia first disclosed it was in serious financial difficulties earlier this
summer when it raised DKr1.9bn from shareholders. This capital, however, has
been lost within the space of two months, and the group yesterday said that
it had negative net assets of DKr100m.
The deterioration has been caused in part by provisions against losses on
the group's credit insurance business of DKr250m, and unrealised capital
losses of DKr700m from its big shareholdings in Baltica and Skandia. There
were also unrealised losses of DKr500m on shares and bonds because of
falling prices on Danish markets.
The board said attempts to sell its Skandia and Baltica stakes had not yet
been successful.
Skandia's share price fell by SKr6 to SKr71 because of uncertainty about the
future of a combined shareholding of 39 per cent in Skandia held by Hafnia
and Uni Storebrand. Uni Storebrand's shares fell 2.6 per cent to an all-time
low.
Shares in banks which are big Hafnia creditors were particularly hard hit.
Denmark's biggest banks, Den Danske Bank and Unidanmark, said they had
claims on Hafnia of about DKr1.2bn and DKr450m.
The leading Danish banks and pension funds, the main owners of Hafnia, said
they supported the reconstruction plan as the only way to save the group,
although they risked losing hundreds of millions of kroner.
Analysts said the restructuring of Hafnia applied a temporary protective
layer between Hafnia Holdings and its solvent operations, while the group
seeks a solution to its problems.
The Copenhagen bourse's KFX index of 20 leading companies closed 1.8 points
down at 80.36. The Oslo all-share index fell 2.6 per cent to 336.63 and the
Swedish all-share index lost 1.38 per cent to a 1992 low of 786.92.
Hafnia, which announced earlier this month a plan to reduce costs by cutting
its staff working in Denmark by 22 per cent, incurred a 1991 net loss after
minorities of DKr1.31bn. First-half results are due at the end of the month.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Output rises but fall in sales dims recovery hopes: Official
figures point to economic inertia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK OUTPUT excluding oil and gas extraction rose in the second quarter for
the first time in almost two years, but another fall in retail sales last
month suggested that immediate prospects for economic recovery remain dim.
Non-oil gross domestic product rose by 0.1 per cent in the three months to
June 30, compared with the previous quarter, but weak oil production caused
overall GDP to fall by 0.1 per cent. The year-on-year rate of decline was
0.7 per cent.
Other figures from the Central Statistical Office yesterday added to recent
evidence of economic inertia.
The volume of retail sales fell in July by 0.3 per cent from the previous
month.
The small rise in non-oil GDP in the second quarter ended seven successive
quarters of falling output that began in the second quarter of 1990. Over
that time, non-oil output fell by a total of 4.3 per cent.
GDP including oil and gas production has not shown the same sustained fall
because of a slight increase in output in the third quarter last year due to
extra activity in the North Sea.
Apart from that small upwards blip, overall GDP has fallen by 4.2 per cent
since the second quarter of 1990.
The cumulative fall in output is not yet as steep as the drop at the
beginning of the 1980s when output fell by 5.5 per cent over five successive
quarters.
Mr Tony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, said the rise in non-oil
output showed the economy was emerging from a 'long and serious' recession
and that prospects for a recovery were looking brighter.
For Labour, Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said yesterday's figures
revealed an economy 'tragically stuck' in the grip of recession.
'Even this government must recognise that action is urgently needed to
restore confidence and deal with the unacceptable levels of unemployment,
business collapses and personal bankruptcies,' he said.
A breakdown of the provisional seasonally adjusted figures from the CSO
showed that the small rise in non-oil GDP reflected an increase in
manufacturing output in the second quarter.
Manufacturing output, which accounts for just over one-fifth of total GDP,
rose by 0.4 per cent in the three months to June 30, compared with the
previous quarter.
Service sector output was unchanged on the previous quarter, but was 0.6 per
cent lower than for the same period of 1991.
Output of the distribution, hotels and catering sector rose by 0.3 per cent
on the previous quarter.
The other significant components of GDP - including construction, transport
and communication, and banking and business services - were estimated to
have fallen slightly, or remained flat on the previous quarter.
Oil and gas extraction fell by 4.3 per cent on the previous quarter but was
7.5 per cent higher than a year ago.
UK INTEREST RATES
Falling inflation has left Britain's economy facing higher real interest
rates at this stage of the economic cycle than at any time since the 1930s.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Ford puts UK plants on short-time working
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD, the leading vehicle maker in the UK, is cutting production at its
three British assembly plants in response to disappointing sales in the UK
and weakening demand from export markets.
It warned yesterday that there was no sign of any improvement in UK new car
demand and said that it saw 'no indication of any real recovery before
mid-1993'.
The effect of depressed UK new car sales is being exacerbated by an
accelerating rate of decline elsewhere in Europe led by a sharp drop in
demand in Germany, the single biggest new car market in Europe.
According to industry estimates disclosed today, German new car sales fell
by about 37 per cent in July from the record of a year ago, in the wake of
reunification. As a result, overall west European new car sales dropped last
month by 15.3 per cent. Sales have been lower than a year ago in four of the
past five months.
Ford said its Dagenham, Essex, car assembly plant would work two three-day
and two four-day weeks next month. Output of its Fiesta small car would be
reduced by some 5,000 units.
Six production days will also be cut at Ford's Transit van plant at
Southampton with one three-day week and four four-day weeks up to the end of
next month. Output will be reduced by about 1,245 units.
Ford's Halewood, Merseyside, plant which produces the Escort/Orion range,
has already been reduced to single-shift working for the last two weeks of
August, cutting output by around 2,750 cars and small vans.
Rover, the second-placed UK vehicle maker, announced earlier this week that
it was introducing a three-day week for five weeks on its Metro and Mini
assembly line at its Longbridge, Birmingham, assembly plant.
The production cuts come as UK motor industry hopes of a recovery in demand
in August, the main car sales month of the year, are fading fast.
New car registrations so far this month are almost unchanged from last
year's depressed level of 368,000 in the whole of August, and carmakers are
having to cut production to reduce bloated stock levels.
Ford has again been forced to revise downwards its forecast for UK new car
sales for the whole of 1992. It fears that sales may be even lower than last
year's very depressed level of 1.59m, the lowest total since 1982.
Overall UK new car sales have fallen by more than a third from the peak year
of 1989, and sales in the first seven months of the year were still 4.3 per
cent lower than a year ago.
The other volume car makers in the UK - Vauxhall, Nissan and Peugeot - said
they had no plans to reduce output.
Ford, the UK new car market leader, has continued to lose share this year in
Britain and the west European new car market, with only the Fiat group of
Italy suffering a bigger fall among the big six volume carmakers.
Elsewhere Ford will have cut 38 production days (by end August) on its
Sierra line at Genk, Belgium and 20 days on the Genk Transit van line. Some
51 production days have been cut at the small Azambuja, Portugal van and
pick-up plant.

FT  20 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPECULATION that there would be no rise in UK interest rates gave a further
boost to stock index futures, though reports of a French opinion poll
indicating reduced support for the Maastricht treaty weakened sentiment a
little later in the day, writes Joel Kibazo.
After a weak opening at 2,356, the September contract on the FT-SE moved
steadily forward for the first two hours of business as dealers moved to
reduce bear positions. The speculation about German Lombard rate, along with
strength in the gilts and short sterling markets, helped to boost the
contract further.
Following the strong morning rise, the September future traded in a narrow
range of 2,378 and 2,382 for the rest of the session, with the news from
Paris only causing a slight dip in mid-afternoon.
September closed at 2,379, up 16 from Tuesday's close and around 4 points
above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 12. Turnover
remained dull, reaching a mere 6,915 contracts.
In traded options, turnover was poor in spite of the expiry of the August
stock options. Volume reached 29,204, with the FT-SE 100 option on 7,515
lots. Hanson was the top stock option on 3,055 contracts.

FT  20 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Move by OFT hits WH Smith
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE decision by the UK Office of Fair Trading to refer distribution of
national newspapers by publishers and wholesalers to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission hit WH Smith and John Menzies, two of the leading
companies in this area of business. Smith tumbled 14 to 391p and Menzies
retreated 19 to 320p.
A somewhat pointed statement by Menzies yesterday said there had already
been two previous enquiries into the industry, in 1974 and 1985, as well as
a decision last year by the former OFT director general not to make a
referral to the MMC. While analysts agreed that a fresh inquiry was unlikely
to uncover anything new, it was felt that anything which provoked negative
sentiment in a thin and volatile market was bound to be damaging to the
shares.
Mr Nick Hawkins at Kleinwort Benson said: 'Smith has its results next week,
which should give it a good forum to dispel some of the worries, but the
poor sentiment is likely to overhang the stock for some time yet.'
Coincidentally, Kleinwort moved from a buy to a hold on Smith yesterday
prior to the announcement, Mr Hawkins arguing that the shares had had a good
run and may prove volatile ahead of the results. The house advised a switch
into Kingfisher, which appreciated 5 to 450p.
Euro Disney falls
Shares in Euro Disney fell heavily in Paris and London after broker Morgan
Stanley became the first major US house to issue a sell recommendation on
the stock, arguing that the French theme park operator will make a loss in
the year to September 1993. In London, the stock closed at 800p, down 60.
The house was said to have blamed higher than expected operating costs and
lease payments to the finance companies used by Euro Disney to fund its
operation. These had been estimated at FFr950m per year, but were now put at
around FFr1.3bn, according to Morgan Stanley. It expects to publish its full
recommendation and figures shortly.
Arch Euro Disney bear Mr Nigel Reed at Paribas said he believed the company
faces at least two years of losses and that the stock is likely to remain
under pressure, chiefly because the market has little on which to value the
shares other than Euro Disney's net asset value.
Hanson easier
Conglomerate Hanson was held back by a bearish piece of research from US
brokerage house Merrill Lynch, which changed its near-term recommendation
from 'above average' to 'neutral' following the decline in third-quarter
profits reported last week.
Merrill analyst Ms Carol Neves said that because of the continuing worries
about the UK economy, and particularly the housing market, the conglomerate
was 'continuing to mothball brick kilns'. She added that prices and earnings
for titanium dioxide, the whitener that represents a significant part of
Hanson's income, were under pressure because of a world glut. She has
trimmed her earnings per share forecast for this year by 3p to 17p. The
stock eased 1 1/4 to 191 3/4 p on healthy turnover of 5.5m.
Reed hit again
Pressure on magazine publisher Reed International intensified yesterday
after the company's broker was said to have joined the list of those turning
negative on the stock. The shares declined 9 to 459p, making a two-day slide
of nearly 20.
The fall began at the end of last week when agency broker James Capel said
that, although the company was solid, the shares were expensive in the short
term and clients should look for opportunities to switch out.
There was further selling yesterday as talk circulated that Cazenove, Reed's
broker, was said to have taken a more negative view. Cazenove never comments
on market speculation, but Reed is known to be holding interviews with
analysts from various securities houses at present and a number of forecast
cuts are believed to be in the offing. The company was talking to SG Warburg
yesterday and is likely to have spoken to its own broker beforehand.
Good business was seen in electricity utilities as investors switched out of
the package and into the individual stocks.
The first salvo was fired in the battle to launch the Racal demerger from
its Chubb subsidiary, due in October. Joint broker Smith New Court produced
a hefty research document, claiming that the value of Chubb suggests a
pre-split share price of 78p for Racal and that investors should buy up to
70p. County NatWest, the other joint broker, will publish its research in
the next few days. Racal held steady at 63 1/2 p.
Mining group RTZ put on 6 to 533p, supported by a buoyant copper market and
recent dollar strength.
Britannic Assurance moved ahead 13 to 923p after announcing a raised
dividend with its interim results.
Glaxo gained 8 to 728p, with SG Warburg said to have turned more positive.
A series of forecast cuts hit Unigate as the group became the latest in the
food manufacturing sector to face a downward revision. The shares fell 22 to
253p. Northern Foods shed 13 to 252p in sympathy.
A big buyer of Forte took the hotel group to the top of the trading volume
list in the market yesterday. Kleinwort Benson was said to have purchased
7.5m shares at 129p and placed them at 130p. Total turnover reached 21m. The
stock gained 3 to 131p.
An upbeat presentation to analysts after the company had reported interim
profits at the top end of market expectations boosted BICC. The shares
reversed a recent downtrend and jumped 17 to 279p.
Consideration of results from Hickson International prompted a number of
analysts to lower forecasts and the shares receded 7 to 167p.
International conglomerate Lonrho closed 5 higher at 81p, after touching
84p, on suggestions that Malaysian trading company Genting, which already
has a 5 per cent stake in Lonrho, was interested in acquiring the 10 per
cent shareholding held by Fidelity, of the US. Analysts, however, discounted
the talk.
Airports group BAA jumped 14 to 671p in thin trading, sentiment boosted by
news that it had signed a deal to sell advertising space.

3,167 and industrials rose 26 to 4,009.

FT  20 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets: Bears find some opposition in Milan -
Some analysts say it is time to buy while others remain cautious
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
With many Italian blue chips trading at a fraction of their former levels,
some of the country's equity analysts are sticking their heads above the
parapets and saying the time is now right to buy.
Historically, the prices seem cheap. The Comit index, which rose 0.41 to
401.18 yesterday, is now less than half its May 1986 peak of 908.2, and
Fiat's ordinary stock, at around L4,100 (Dollars 3.70), stands at just above
a quarter of its record high on an adjusted basis. Encouraged by the
unexpected resolve of the new government in tackling the huge budget
deficit, some analysts claim that such bargains cannot last.
The success of Mr Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, in confronting the
scala mobile wage indexation system and bloated pension provisions has been
impressive. In the six weeks since taking office, the new government has
achieved more than some predecessors in as many years.
Crucial decree laws have been proposed to cut spending, while the L30,000bn
emergency budget won parliamentary approval in record time. Privatisation is
now under way in earnest, and the Treasury has transformed the country's
four biggest public sector groups into joint stock companies as a first step
towards flotation.
Such changes have come as a tonic to the optimists searching for a ray of
hope amid the gloom surrounding the economy and the lira after two months of
rising interest rates and devaluation fears.
Recent figures from the New York-based Institutional Brokers Estimate System
(IBES) show the consensus of Italian analysts predicting a rise of 12 per
cent in corporate earnings this year. Coupling this with recent political
successes, some houses are awash with buy recommendations.
Such advice should be treated with caution. The consensus earnings forecasts
'are still dangerously high', according to one analyst. Gemina-Credit
Lyonnais Sim expects earnings to drop by 8 per cent this year, and
attributes the bullish IBES numbers to updating delays. 'Saying share prices
are attractively low is fine as long as you do not own them,' says one
observer. 'This year's upbeat earnings forecasts are a rerun of 1991, when
estimates were consistently too high. Talking about bargain hunting is
dangerous.'
'Looking at historical values is meaningless,' agrees a colleague. 'At the
market's peak in 1986, Italian companies had everything going for them.'
Earnings were rising, largely thanks to cost-cutting; the economy was
growing strongly, having emerged relatively late from the 1981-83 recession;
there was political stability under the Craxi government; and inflation and
interest rates were falling fast.
Today's scene is different. Domestic growth is slowing, many export markets
are in recession, Italian interest rates are high and the lira is pegged to
the narrow band of the European Monetary System.
The yield gap between the bond and equity markets lies at the core of the
arguments in favour of caution. 'Historically, shares may seem cheap, but
measured against bonds they look very expensive,' says one economist. With
yields of 13 to 14 per cent on government bonds and an earnings yield of 8
per cent at best on shares, 'equities have to be incredibly attractive' in
view of the risks.
Such caution is reinforced by the far greater liquidity of the bond market
compared with current daily volumes of L50bn to L60bn on the bourse.
Only when interest rates fall substantially will equities become attractive.
The immediate outlook is for rates to stay high, or even to rise should the
lira come under renewed pressure. Not even rumours of devaluation alter the
prognosis. Analysts say that devaluation would be interpreted as a sign of
failure, which would keep the pressure on the currency.
Lower interest rates depend on the government's ability to get a grip on
fiscal policy and tackle the deficit. So far, ministers have shown admirable
resolve in making previously unthinkable spending cuts, while Mr Amato has
used the tacit threat of new elections, unpopular in parliament, to push
through tough decree laws. But with much deeper spending curbs ahead, the
government's true test, and the decisive signal for the stock market, will
come in September when ministers draw up their 1993 budget plans.

FT  20 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Official measures
produce limited advance in Nikkei
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FINANCE Ministry's emergency package to support the banking system had a
limited effect on equities, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average rallied 341.33, or 2.4 per cent, to 14,650.74. However,
some traders were disappointed that the index failed to recoup Tuesday's
620-point loss. It fell to a low for the day of 14,194.40 in mid-morning,
before setting a high for the session of 14,807.01 in the afternoon on
arbitrage-related index-linked buying.
Volume increased modestly to 220m shares from 185m, while rises outscored
declines by 626 to 321, with 144 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all
first section stocks recovered 14.62 to 1,117.12, and in London the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 4.17 to 925.68.
The Finance Ministry's measures were greeted with cynicism by dealers and
investors, as the package failed to reveal new and concrete measures to
support the banks, or the stock market. Directives by the ministry
requesting banks to refrain from selling stock holdings to boost interim
profits, and allowing them to shore up profits by removing stock evaluation
losses from the interim profit and loss statements, were welcomed by the
banks, but criticised by analysts as a temporary solution.
Some analysts welcomed the drastic change in the ministry's attitudes
towards the banks and stock market. Mr Jason James, strategist at James
Capel, said the ministry was finally addressing the seriousness of the
problems.
However, institutional investors failed to react. 'We are encouraged by the
shift in the authorities' stance, but we would have to see the major
economic measures to be announced at the end of this month,' said a fund
manager at a leading life insurer, 'we are in no hurry to buy.'
Banks were firm, Fuji Bank advancing Y50 to Y1,340. Nippon Housing Loan, the
home-loan company, moved ahead a further Y24 to Y191. It was again the day's
leading active issue, rising on short-covering by dealers.
High-technology blue chips rose on bargain hunting and short-covering.
Hitachi improved Y11 to Y729 and Toshiba Y7 to Y554. However, Sony declined
Y20 to Y3,540 and Pioneer Electronic Y10 to Y2,660. Both stocks had led the
fall on Tuesday, and some dealers, pessimistic over the companies' earnings
results that were announced after the market closed yesterday, sold ahead of
the news.
In Osaka, the OSE average picked up 190.94 to 15,728.16 in volume of 17.3m
shares.
Roundup
THE REST of the region was almost equally split between advances and
declines.
SINGAPORE recovered from an early fall on bargain hunting and the Straits
Times Industrial index, which sank more than 3 per cent to a 19-month low of
1,269.40 in the late morning, ended a net 1.16 up at 1,312.11. Volume rose
to 74.03m shares from 59.27m.
SEOUL's index climbed 14.14 to 479.09 in anticipation of the government's
planned bail-out and on the back of a late buying spree in Daewoo shares.
Brokers said 10 of Daewoo Group's 17 listed stocks went the day's limit up
as investors discounted rumours that the group's chairman harboured
political ambitions.
Brokers said government measures were expected to include the issue of stock
stabilisation bonds (SSB), a waiver of inheritance taxes on SSBs and an
easing of tight money supply. Government officials declined to comment.
NEW ZEALAND eased in thin, volatile trading but Fletcher Challenge and
Telecom rose. The NZSE-40 capital index shed 3.05 to 1,498.17.
Fletcher Challenge ended 3 cents up at NZDollars 2.58 after reporting its
first ever loss of NZDollars 157.5m, in line with expectations. Telecom was
3 cents ahead at NZDollars 2.35, after touching NZDollars 2.38, following
strong interest overnight in the US. The company is expected to report a
steady first-quarter result today.
HONG KONG retreated on an afternoon sell-off by overseas institutions, the
Hang Seng Index falling 54.72 to 5,620.44 in turnover down from HKDollars
2.52bn to HKDollars 2.02bn. Sentiment was dented further by heavy selling of
Hang Seng Index futures, and Jardine Matheson dropped HKDollars 3 to
HKDollars 53 on rights issue rumours.
AUSTRALIA was brought gently lower by weak bank stocks. Westpac again
slipped below its ADollars 3.00 rights issue price, to ADollars 2.97 for a
loss of 4 cents, while ANZ fell 7 cents to ADollars 3.21. The All Ordinaries
Index dipped 3.4 to 1,561.6.
BHP's offer to buy 37.5 per cent of Foster's Brewing at the equivalent of
ADollars 2.39 per share came after the close, when Foster's was 10 cents off
at ADollars 1.73. The deal was on the cards, but the price may interest the
market today.
TAIWAN's weighted index fell 38.98 to another 19-month low of 3,733.93.
Sentiment, already weak, was hurt by reports quoting Tsai Wan-lin, head of
the Cathay insurance and construction group, as saying he would visit China
to explore investment opportunities; this was perceived as a further threat
to the weakening domestic property market.

FT  20 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Financial sector depresses
Nordic bourses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST anniversary of the putsch in the former Soviet Union saw bourses
in relatively quiet mood, writes Our Markets Staff, perhaps awaiting the
German M3 figures which are expected to follow today's Bundesbank meeting.
On that day a year ago, the FT-SE Eurotrack index dropped 7.3 per cent.
Yesterday, it closed slightly lower than it did then.
Nordic markets were depressed by the slow erosion of the Scandinavian
financial sector. The suspension of payments by the insurer, Hafnia, left
COPENHAGEN's CSE index 3.24 lower at 292.85, and within that Den Danske Bank
DKr10 lower at DKr324.
STOCKHOLM dropped 1.3 per cent, the Affarsvarlden general index ending 10.9
down at 797.4, led by the financial and banking sector which registered a
3.2 per cent fall. There were rumours, later denied, that S-E-Banken might
be the next in line for government handouts. S-E-Banken dropped SKr1 or 5.1
per cent to SKr18.50, a 12-month low.
OSLO fell 2.6 per cent as Den norske Bank and Uni Storebrand ended NKr1.1
down at NKr3.2, and NKr2.1 lower at NKr15.9 respectively, both at new lows,
and the all-share index tumbled 9.06 to 336.63. HELSINKI's bank and finance
house index lost another 3.5 per cent as the Hex index closed just 1.8 lower
at 648.7.
FRANKFURT was dominated by derivatives trading ahead of Friday's close of
August calls and puts on the DTB. After Tuesday's disturbing Mannesmann
interim report, there was also some serious questioning of companies whose
results could be disappointing.
Turnover rose from DM3.9bn to DM4.5bn as the DAX index fell 8.50 to
1,524.72, another low for the year. Within that, carmakers were generally
weak with Volkswagen down DM7.50 to DM325.50; Metallgesellschaft dropped
DM11 to DM314; MAN, and Mannesmann shed another DM7.40 to DM286.20, and DM4
to DM234.20 respectively; and Viag fell DM9.30 to DM338.50.
July German car registration figures, and progress reports from Daimler and
Volkswagen are expected next week. MAN has been dropping on both fundamental
and technical considerations, said Mr Matthias Welticke at Merck Finck in
Dusseldorf, with worries about its truck and printing machine divisions and
a previous 'bottom' of DM310 for the stock well and truly breached.
While Metallgesellschaft is viewed as a failed recovery stock, Mr Welticke
thinks that Viag's results today will reflect that company's solid, energy
utility base more than the problems in its aluminium, and chemicals
offshoots. Lufthansa, meanwhile, stayed among the winners with a rise of DM3
to DM101.
PARIS closed above the day's low but trading remained nervous ahead of the
September referendum on Maastricht. The CAC 40 finished 2.51 lower at
1,734.21, but off its worst level of 1,722.40, in low turnover of FFr1.28bn.
Euro Disney was the day's most prominent faller as sell orders from US
investors, prompted by a sell note from Morgan Stanley, knocked the share
price as low as FFr75 before a close FFr6.40, or 7.7 per cent lower at
FFr76.60 in volume of 1m shares.
L'Oreal rose FFr16 or 1.8 per cent to FFr929 on buying by a UK broker.
AMSTERDAM closed firmer, on buying of index constituents from the European
options exchange. The CBS Tendency Index fell 0.2 to 111.90. Hunter Douglas
remained weak following its poor interims on Tuesday, dropping Fl 8.80 or 15
per cent to Fl 47.20, a new 1992 low.
ZURICH featured a 15 per cent drop in Adia bearers, down SFr33 at SFr182 on
a newspaper report predicting that the employment agency group would make a
loss in 1992. The SMI index, meanwhile, fell 12.9 to 1,775.7.
MADRID saw a Pta35 fall to Pta2,475 in Repsol as the general index eased
0.39 to 208.27. The state-owned oil group said that it plans to go ahead
with an international share placing, probably in the last quarter of this
year, in spite of the present weakness in stock markets.
VIENNA rose slightly but traders said the move was not convincing enough to
shake the market out of its downtrend. The ATX index of 18 leading shares
edged up 4.8 to 732.18 and the all-share Vienna bourse index rose 1.4 to
354.05.
ISTANBUL's 75-share index fell for the third day, ending down 16.13 at
4,035.93.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper 'heretic' forced out of
Chilean think-tank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SANTIAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHILE'S RULING Christian Democratic Party has excommunicated one of its
chief economists for the heresy of proposing that the state copper company
Codelco, the world's biggest copper producer, should be privatised.
Mr Pedro Calvo was forced to resign from the Christian Democrat's economic
think-tank this week after his comments to a national newspaper provoked a
major earthquake in political circles.
The government immediately went on the record as saying it had no plans to
privatise Codelco. It argued that it was too important to the Chilean
economy: it produces 13 per cent of the world's copper, close to a third of
Chile's exports, a fifth of the government's income and 4.5 per cent of the
country's gross domestic product. A tenth of Codelco's gross sales, which
totalled Dollars 2.77bn last year, goes directly to the armed forces.
The company's public nature is enshrined in the Chilean constitution and has
been an article of faith since the copper industry was nationalised in the
1970s.
Yet Mr Calvo is not alone in his unorthodox views. The private-sector Mining
Chamber and leading businessmen have leapt to his defence, arguing that the
government is trying to stifle genuine debate on Codelco's problems. These
include a history of under-investment, ageing mines, falling production,
overmanning and rising production costs.
Investment is the most pressing problem. Codelco has provided more than
Dollars 17bn to the state's coffers since its creation in 1976. But the
government has reinvested only 0.2 per cent of its profits back into the
company.
'Privatisation is the only technical solution for Codelco's problems,' says
Mr Hernan Guilloff, president of the Mining Chamber. 'Only a few politicians
and those who have their jobs to defend disagree.' The latter include
Chile's powerful Copper Workers Union, whose 19,000 members are the most
vocal defenders of Codelco's state ownership.
Leading businessmen, such as Mr Fernando Leniz, who sits on the boards of
several large Chilean companies and is considered the elder statesman of the
country's private industry, argue that Codelco's public ownership is an
anomaly in a country that pioneered privatisations in Latin America. He and
others are urging the government to sell off the remaining state concerns to
release resources for spending on health and education. 'If we consider
Codelco, the ports, water companies and the few utilities that remain in
state hands, the government could easily raise Dollars 10bn within five
years,' Mr Leniz wrote in El Mercurio, Chile's leading newspaper.
Although few politicians risk broaching this taboo subject in public, the
idea that Codelco should be opened to some kind of private sector
participation is gaining strength across the political spectrum. It also has
supporters within the government and the company itself. They argue that the
state can no longer meet the estimated Dollars 700m a year Codelco needs to
develop new mines, modernise its smelters and clean up the industry.
They concede, however, that the issue is too explosive to be tackled in the
final two years of President Patricio Aylwin's government. 'It would destroy
the ruling centre-left coalition,' says Mr Juan Pablo Letelier, a Socialist
deputy in congress who opposes Codelco's privatisation.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Latin American banana producers
attack EC quota plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BOGOTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LATIN AMERICAN banana-producing countries have issued a joint statement
opposing the European Commission's plan to impose quotas on banana imports
from January 1, 1993.
Ministers and other delegates from eight countries meeting in Bogota
criticised the commission's proposal for violating the principles of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and undermining efforts to open up
Latin American economies.
Mr Juan Manuel Santos, Colombia's foreign trade minister, said a quota
system combined with the 20 per cent tariff could cost Latin American
exporters USDollars 5.6bn over the next 10 years. The exporters are
launching a diplomatic offensive to persuade European countries to reject
the quota proposal.
'We have sufficient allies to veto it,' said Mr Santos, referring to the six
EC members who do not apply any import restrictions now.
The Latin Americans are taking the banana issue to the Gatt on the grounds
that a quota system is illegal. They are also sending a letter to Mr Douglas
Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, setting out their position.
According to the joint statement, the commission's plan would upset world
banana trading, raise the price of the fruit for European consumers and
damage Latin American economies by reducing export income and putting jobs
at risk.
At present, the exporters' group includes the Central American countries and
Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela. Mr Santos said that Mexico was expected to
join soon and the group might be able to unite all the remaining Latin
American producers. All the countries would accept higher tariff levels
rather than face quotas.
Colombia and Ecuador are particularly indignant over the EC's treatment of
them as 'transnational' exporters, when most of their marketing is in
national hands. Between them, the two countries supply about 20 per cent of
EC banana imports; last year Ecuador earned more than USDollars 700m and
Colombia USDollars 380m from world-wide banana sales.

field agreement

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA AND Brazil yesterday signed a letter of intent opening the way for
the joint development of a potentially huge gas field in north-western
Argentina in a project that could involve investment totalling USDollars
8bn, writes John Barham in Buenos Aires.
The presidents of Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales SA, Argentina's
state-owned oil company, and Petrobras, its Brazilian counterpart, signed an
agreement that would give Petrobras a 15 per cent share in its
underdeveloped Northwest Basin.
YPF plans to sell 55 per cent of the basin to private investors in October.
It will retain 30 per cent, with the remaining equity held by Petrobras,
which is expected to receive a discount to the privatisation auction price.
A YPF official explained that Brazilian involvement was vital to attract
private investment to the Northwest Basin. 'This basin is only interesting
if the gas has a market,' he said, 'and the only market is in Brazil.'
Three southern states of Brazil plus the state of Sao Paulo, the country's
most heavily industrialised region, could consume about 30m cubic metres of
gas a day exported from the Northwest Basin along a 2,400 km (1,500 mile)
gas pipeline. The entire project would cost Dollars 8bn and take eight years
to complete, the official said.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Radioactivity worry at Kazakh
field
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW potential hazard has emerged for companies wishing to invest in the
former Soviet Union's energy sector: radioactivity.
British Gas is carrying out an environmental study of the Karachaganak oil
and gas field in north-western Kazakhstan to check whether it was
contaminated by a number of underground nuclear explosions carried out in
the area between 1962 and 1987. The company, together with the Italian
state-owned oil company Agip, won exclusive rights to negotiate for the
development of the field in July.
The testing involved smaller nuclear devices designed for peaceful purposes,
rather than weapons, which were tested at Semipalatinsk, 600 miles away in
north-east Kazakhstan. The two latest tests were in 1984 and 1987.
Although the detonations were on the periphery of Karachaganak, rather than
on the field itself, experts say there could still be a risk of
contamination.
The company insisted yesterday it was aware throughout negotiations with the
Kazakhs that the area had been a nuclear testing site. Two initial studies,
carried out by British Gas and Agip, and Control Risks, the security
consultants, had found no radioactivity, but the full environmental survey
now under way would include further radiation checks.
'We are 99 per cent satisfied that there is no problem,' BG said yesterday.
British Gas and Agip hope to sign a contract to develop the field by next
summer, likely to entail investment of Dollars 6bn over the first ten years,
and up to Dollars 20bn over the 40-year life of the field. With 20 trillion
(million million) cubic feet of gas and 2bn barrels of oil, the field is one
of the biggest in the world.
The field will help British Gas to achieve its aim of increasing earnings
from exploration and production, and will increase Agip's oil and gas
reserves by about 50 per cent.

London COCOA prices showed no inclination to come down from the day's peaks,
closing up to Pounds 17 a tonne higher. The market rallied on Tuesday on
concern over growing conditions in west Africa, exacerbated by talk that one
trade house was circulating bullish crop forecasts. COPPER prices were
consolidating on the LME after the Dollars 90 rise of the past two days and
at one stage three-month metal dipped back towards support around Dollars
2,540 a tonne. But renewed strength in Comex prompted mixed buying and short
covering in London, which sent the price up to Dollars 2,560 by the close,
up Dollars 4 from Tuesday. New York ORANGE JUICE prices were sharply down at
midday as traders reacted to reports that Brazil had lowered its bulk price
in line with Florida cash prices. Brazilian processors had been hesitant to
cut prices until after the USDA Florida October crop assessment, said one
analyst, but with estimates circulating for a sizeable Florida crop they had
little choice. Nymex PLATINUM futures were higher by midday on talk of
overnight Japanese buying. In Chicago SOYABEANS were lower in late trading
after news suggesting a possible record crop in the eastern Midwest.

FT  20 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Low subscriptions to
Czechoslovak country fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL investors have subscribed Dollars 30.8m for the first
closed-end Czechoslovak country fund, seven months after the fund was
launched with the aim of raising Dollars 100m, writes Richard Waters.
The delay and low level of subscription were caused by uncertainty over the
country's future, said Robert Fleming, the manager of the fund. The
fragmentation of Yugoslavia had left many potential investors concerned
about the aftermath of a division of Czechoslovakia, it said.
Investments will initially be made in the Czech republic, though Fleming
does not rule out investments in Slovakia. The European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, which has two seats on the board of the
Czechoslovakia Investment Corporation, committed Dollars 10m of the capital.

FT  20 AUG 92 / International Bonds: Signs of revival in floating-rate note
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE flow of floating-rate notes picked up momentum yesterday, with three
offerings by financial institutions based in the US, France, and Japan. A
large offering of notes for BankAmerica Corporation, the US bank holding
company, provided further signs of a revival of the floating-rate note
market.
Unlike the recent spate of subordinated floating-rate notes with minimum and
maximum coupon levels, aimed at pockets of Swiss retail investors, the
latest offers are aimed at a broader market.
BankAmerica's Dollars 500m offering of senior notes paying interest of 3/8
point above the London interbank offered rates was targeted at mainstream
floating-rate investors, including fund managers, banks and some retail
investors, according to lead manager Kidder Peabody.
Interest in the FRN market among bank issuers has been boosted by poor swap
market conditions: some banks can now achieve cheaper floating-rate funding
by tapping the floating-rate sector, than by raising fixed-rate funds and
swapping the proceeds. But the depth of investor demand for conventional
floating-rate notes has yet to be tested. The FRN market also continues to
provide access to capital through the issuance of subordinated debt.
Sumitomo Bank yesterday launched two subordinated FRNs, totalling Dollars
500m. The two callable deals, maturing in 2006 and 2007, count as Tier 2
capital under Basle guidelines. The paper was placed in the Far East and is
not expected to be actively traded.
Meanwhile, Credit Foncier, the French agency, also raised lower Tier 2
capital in the FRN market, using the 'minimax' structure. The Dollars 150m
issue pays interest at  1/8 point below Libor, with a minimum interest rate
of 5 per cent and a maximum rate of 10 per cent. The deal was arranged by
Paribas.

FT  20 AUG 92 / International Company News: Amoco Canada takes CDollars 429m
write-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMOCO Canada Petroleum, which bought the troubled Dome Petroleum for
CDollars 5.2bn in 1988, took a CDollars 429m (USDollars 363.50m) write-off
on its western Canada oil and natural gas properties in the first half.
This represents the cost of consolidating these holdings and expected losses
on asset sales. The write-off was even higher than the company had estimated
earlier this year.
After the special charge, the final second-quarter loss was CDollars 510m,
against a loss of CDollars 108m a year earlier. Revenues were CDollars 887m,
compared with CDollars 967m, reflecting lower gas prices mainly.
The company, 100 per cent owned by Amoco of the US, became Canada's largest
gas producer with the takeover of Dome and also had the largest reserves.
The first-half loss was CDollars 481m, against a deficit of CDollars 129m a
year earlier, on revenues of CDollars 1.8bn against CDollars 2.1bn. The
Canadian company's CDollars 2.6bn debt is guaranteed by the parent.
Amoco Canada is completing a broad restructuring including heavy layoffs,
asset swaps with other companies and also asset sales and shutdowns.

<TEXT>
FLETCHER Challenge, the New Zealand conglomerate, yesterday unveiled an
ambitious programme to reduce its debt, including a further sale of
NZDollars 3.5bn (USDollars 1.88bn) worth of assets. The move follows the
announcement of a loss of NZDollars 157.5m in the year to June 30, compared
with a profit of NZDollars 481.9m last time.
Assets targeted for sale include the Rural Bank and FCL's NZDollars 500m
property portfolio in New Zealand. It was also considering the partial sale
of the Natural Gas Corporation and floating its Chilean forest products
division.
The methanol division, the largest in the world following last year's
purchase of Cape Horn Methanol in Chile, was also being reviewed.
Turnover during the period was NZDollars 10.02bn against NZDollars 10.48bn.
The total dividend is down to 14 cents, compared with 27 cents.
Mr Hugh Fletcher, chief executive, said the group was expecting a recovery
in earnings this financial year, with a profit of around NZDollars 300m,
excluding abnormal items.
He said this forecast was based on a slow recovery in the world economy and
given the nature of commodity forecasts the result could 'end up NZDollars
100m either way'.
In the year to June 30, FCL earned NZDollars 305.1m, excluding abnormal
items, compared with a profit of NZDollars 493.9m last year. Abnormal losses
were NZDollars 472.8m, against NZDollars 154.7m, producing a net loss of
NZDollars 157.5m.
The abnormal losses included the provision of NZDollars 400m for potential
property write-downs, mostly relating to problems in the group's Australian
subsidiary, Jennings.
The primary division had a good year reflecting better prices for New
Zealand's agricultural commodities. Energy was the star performer,
contributing 60 per cent of the earnings of NZDollars 540m before interest
and tax. Last year the division earned NZDollars 436m.

Westcoast

<TEXT>
PETRO-CANADA, the partially privatised Canadian energy group, is further
rationalising its activities by selling its 37 per cent stake in Westcoast
Energy, the Vancouver-based pipeline operator and natural gas producer.
Petrocan said yesterday a group of securities dealers, led by ScotiaMcLeod,
had agreed to buy the Westcoast shares for CDollars 342m (USDollars 285.59m)
or CDollars 16.25 a share. The price will be paid in two near-equal
instalments. Petrocan is Westcoast's largest single shareholder.
The proceeds will be used to reduce Petrocan's CDollars 1.5bn debt. But the
company expects to post a CDollars 54m after-tax charge from the sale
against third-quarter earnings.
Petrocan first bought a stake in Westcoast shortly after its creation in the
mid-1970s as Canada's national energy company. It augmented its holdings in
1988.
The Canadian government sold 20 per cent of its stake in Petrocan to the
public in July 1991. The stricter disciplines required of a publicly traded
company coupled with the recent slump in the domestic oil industry have
forced Petrocan to take a narrower focus.
It has sold numerous oil and gas producing properties in the past year and
is rationalising its service station network.
Petrocan's share price rose 50 cents to CDollars 8.13 after yesterday's
announcement, but remains well below last year's flotation price of CDollars
13.
Westcoast earned CDollars 53.9m on sales of CDollars 784m in the first half
of this year. It has a 3,000-mile network of natural gas pipelines serving
British Columbia, the US Northwest and California. It also produces oil and
natural gas, and has interests in gas distribution and sulphur production.

J. C. PENNEY, the fourth biggest US retailer, yesterday said it expected to

The announcement comes only a day after Sears and IBM said they were merging

The J. C. Penney venture, Advanced Retail Communications, is expected to
start operating in 1993. It will deliver television, audio and data services
to shopping malls and other retail locations using a combination of digital
satellite broadcasting and earth-based transmission networks.
The partners expect to draw on Penney's high-speed data network in the US
and GTE's existing satellites, while Capital Cities/ABC will look after the
programming needs of large retail chains and smaller independent retailers.

AIR CANADA, frustrated in its second attempt to take over its rival Canadian
Airlines International, has turned to United Airlines of the US for a
commercial alliance.
The operational link-up, which becomes effective on October 25, will improve
service and cut connection time at the airlines' hubs in North America,
Europe, Latin America and the Pacific.
An equity link is not planned.
The two airlines will merge their frequent-flyer programmes and co-operate
in computer reservation systems and marketing.
United, four times the size of Air Canada, said further benefits would come
to both airlines from the 'open skies' agreement being negotiated by Canada
and the US. This will allow limited entry of US airlines to the Canadian
domestic market and greater access for Canada to the US market.
Air Canada had a first-half loss of CDollars 293m (USDollars 246.2m), or
Dollars 3.96 a share, including restructuring charges. Second-quarter
traffic rose 14 per cent, but with larger capacity its yields fell. However
Air Canada is still stronger financially than its rival.
Canadian is now considering an offer from its employees to put up CDollars
200m in new equity.

PIONEER Electronic, the audio and video equipment specialist, yesterday
reported a 50 per cent decline in consolidated operating profits to Y3.48bn
(Dollars 27.56m) in the three months to June. Sales climbed by 2.3 per cent
to Y144.55bn.
Net after-tax profits were down by 30 per cent to Y4.98bn.
The company blamed the poor performance on the weak economy in Japan, and on
the rise in the value of the yen against the dollar.
Sales of audio products fell by 14.7 per cent to Y37.4bn, while video
product sales rose 3.1 per cent to Y44.2bn. Sales of electronic products for
cars were relatively successful, rising by 15.4 per cent to Y52.9bn in spite
of sluggishness in car markets.
Weak demand in Japan took its toll on sales of audio products, commercial
sing-along karaoke systems, and car stereos for car manufacturers. However,
consumer-use laser disc player sales rose in Japan and the US, while car
compact disc player sales advanced in both countries.
Domestic sales were down by 7.3 per cent to Y54.35bn, while overseas sales
rose by 9.1 per cent to Y90.2bn.

FT  20 AUG 92 / International Company News: Jennings and UK Paper 'mistakes'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FLETCHER Challenge had made two serious mistakes, Mr Hugh Fletcher, chief
executive, told a briefing, writes Terry Hall.
One was in Jennings, the group's Australian subsidiary, which had required a
100 per cent writeoff of all debt and equity investments in the latest
accounts.
The other was in buying UK Paper. 'In hindsight we should not have acquired
UK Paper.' He said operationally the British plants were running above
expectations, helped by cost and staff reductions. Production of fine papers
was up from 285,000 to 328,000 tonnes.
'But our strategy was based on the assumption that pulp prices would decline
much more than European fine papers. This turned out to be woefully wrong.
'European paper price declines have been overpowering so while the long term
strategy may have been right, the timing was abysmal.'
He said UK Paper had lost NZDollars 107m (USDollars 57.8m) before interest
and tax, and NZDollars 117m after tax in the past year. The international
pulp and paper division lost NZDollars 94.9m, compared with a profit of
NZDollars 288.3m last year.
Mr Fletcher said pulp prices had passed their cyclical low, and were rising.
Paper remained a large problem due to an abnormally big drop in newspaper
and magazine advertising in the US. But again prices were improving.

CANON, the Japanese leading office equipment maker, posted a rise in
non-consolidated pre-tax profits for the interim term to June thanks to
foreign exchange gains.
The company unveiled a 4.5 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y39.9bn
(Dollars 316.04m) despite a 2.8 per cent fall in sales to Y507.3bn and a 15
per cent decline in operating profits to Y31.2bn. After-tax profits rose a
marginal 1.3 per cent to Y22.3bn.
Canon said its sales were depressed by a slump in its camera sales due to
the sluggish domestic and overseas economies. Camera sales fell 19.4 per
cent to Y78.8bn, although office equipment, such as fax machines and
information equipment, rose 3.3 per cent to Y406.6bn.
A rise in non-operating profits, thanks to Y5.4bn in gains on foreign
exchange, helped the company at the pre-tax profit level.
For the full year to December, Canon forecasts a 1.1 per cent rise in
pre-tax profits on a 2.4 per cent increase in sales. The company expects
brisk demand from retail customers for its printers to support overall
sales.

The company said it was holding talks with its shareholders and partners

FT  20 AUG 92 / International Company News: BHP offers ADollars 1.72bn for
32% stake in Foster's
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BROKEN Hill Proprietary (BHP) yesterday moved to end the uncertainty
surrounding Foster's, the world's fourth biggest brewing group, by offering
ADollars 1.72bn (USDollars 1.27bn) for a 32 per cent shareholding formerly
controlled by Mr John Elliott.
The offer follows BHP's decision in June to appoint receivers to
International Brewing Holdings (IBH), a private company controlled by Mr
Elliott, which owned the shares through its subsidiary International Brewing
Investments (IBI).
BHP said in June it would acquire IBI's Foster's shares at 'full value' if
such a purchase were necessary to prevent a 'fire sale' by the receiver.
Mr Ian Ferrier, the joint receiver, said he was 'minded to accept the
offer', but had appointed advisers to 'explore the market for other possible
buyers'.
Mr John Prescott, BHP managing director, said the offer 'advances the
process of restoring value to Foster's, and gives all other serious bidders
an opportunity to put alternative proposals to the receivers'.
Analysts said there was little chance of an alternative bid emerging because
of the substantial premium over the market price required to repay IBI's
secured debts of ADollars 1bn to BHP and ADollars 1.2bn to a syndicate of
banks headed by Hongkong and Shanghai Bank.
If the offer goes through, BHP will acquire 720m Foster's shares for the
equivalent of ADollars 2.39 per share, compared with last night's closing
price of ADollars 1.73.
BHP said it would pay ADollars 1.5bn in cash, plus a 27 per cent
shareholding in Inar, an IBH subsidiary which was the vehicle for a ADollars
740m preference share investment in the group by BHP.
The offer would allow the receiver to repay ADollars 1.2bn owed by IBI to
the banking syndicate, which blocked an earlier attempt to unwind IBH by
refusing a BHP offer to buy its debt.
About ADollars 300m would be returned to BHP by the receiver when the
preference share investment becomes due for repayment in November, leaving
the group with exposure to IBI of about ADollars 100m after taking account
of the transfer of Inar shares and an earlier decision to write off accrued
interest.
The Foster's shares acquired by BHP would be worth about ADollars 1.2bn at
last night's closing price, compared with the cash price of ADollars 1.5bn.
However, BHP would break even if the share price rose to ADollars 2.39.
The deal would make BHP the largest shareholder in Foster's, and would allow
it to control the group in concert with Asahi Breweries of Japan, which owns
19.9 per cent.
However, BHP has said repeatedly it does not wish to be a long-term
shareholder in Foster's.
BHP has acquired IBI's so-called Faversham and Fresco options over nearly
600m Foster's shares, which would lift BHP's Foster's shareholding to nearly
50 per cent.
The group is thought unlikely to exercise the options unless the Foster's
share price rises above the exercise prices.
Mr Elliott, once chairman and chief executive of Foster's, remains a
director, but he and two other IBH representatives are likely to resign
before the next shareholders' meeting.

staff by 1,400

<TEXT>
NORDBANKEN, Sweden's ailing state-owned bank, yesterday announced a group
re-organisation plan which included a cut in staff by 1,400 people over the
next 18 months.
The bank's short-term aim was to cut its costs drastically, introduce
substantial savings and improve its customer services with the eventual
objective of being privatised, according to Mr Hans Dalborg, the bank's
chief executive.
In May, the Swedish government was forced to rescue Nordbanken with a
SKr20bn (Dollars 3.76bn) financial package of guarantees and loans and it
will become the sole owner of the bank at the end of this month. In the
first four months of the year the bank suffered a SKr1.97bn operating loss
due to bad debts and non-performing loan provisions and its financial
position remains precarious.
Nordbanken said it planned to widen share ownership in Carnegie, the group's
investment and stockbroking arm as part of an aim to focus the bank more on
its activities inside Sweden.
Institutions, individuals and Carnegie's customers are invited to buy shares
in the subsidiary which will be floated on the stock market. Nordbanken
remains a minority shareholder. Carnegie operates in eight countries and is
wholly-owned by Nordbanken.
Jyske Bank, Denmark's fourth biggest banking group, expects a pre-tax loss
for 1992 after posting a DKr479m (Dollars 85m) deficit for the first half of
1992.
The bank gave no estimate for the expected full-year result but forecast a
positive performance for the rest of 1992. The bank last year reported a
DKr178m pre-tax profit.
It attributed its disappointing first-half result to difficult trading
conditions in the Danish finance sector, coupled with high interest rates
and a slump in domestic private demand and business activity.

FT  20 AUG 92 / International Company News: Nedlloyd reports flat profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEDLLOYD, the Dutch transport group, reported flat net profits for the 1992
first half.
However, the group said the long-term trend was 'positive' because the
figures did not rely as heavily on book profits from divestments as they did
the year before.
Net profit totalled Fl 1m (Dollars 605,000) against Fl 2m in the same period
of 1991. Operating profits were also barely changed at Fl 62m compared with
Fl 60m.
'Disappointing economic growth and intensified competition had a negative
influence on the operating results,' the company said.
However, it noted that post-tax results from ordinary activities, which
excluded gains on divestments, showed a profit of Fl 3m in the first half,
compared with a Fl 35m loss the year before.
In the first half of last year, Nedlloyd's results included a book profit of
Fl 40m on the sale of its stake in Transavia, the Dutch charter airline, to
KLM.
Nedlloyd also managed to turn in a slim net profit in the first half of 1992
because of a decline in interest charges and a rise in profits on the sale
of fixed assets.
The company, which is struggling to reduce costs at a time of a general
slowdown in world trade and increased pressure on shipping tariffs, said it
expected to end the year with a 'modest positive result'. Until now,
Nedlloyd, which has not paid a dividend for two years, has said only that
operating profits would show an improvement.
Turnover fell to Fl 3.22bn from Fl 3.31bn. However, if companies divested in
1991 are eliminated, turnover rose by nearly 7 per cent.
Within Nedlloyd's land-based operations, the road cargo division posted a
'clearly negative' operating result, but the Unitrans division reached the
turnround point after previous losses.
Operating results in ocean shipping were hampered by the bad market for
tankers and difficult conditions in the short sea liner trade, it said
without giving figures.
Nedlloyd's shares, which had weakened this week ahead of the figures, partly
on fears that the company might show a first-half loss, rose by Fl 0.30 to
close at Fl 38.00.

REPSOL, the Spanish state-run oil and gas conglomerate, will float up to
Pta100bn (Dollars 1.07bn) in shares at the end of the year in an offer aimed
at institutional investors, Mr Oscar Fanjul, chairman, said yesterday, AP-DJ
reports from Madrid.
Mr Fanjul told a Madrid newspaper that Repsol will float between Pta50bn and
Pta100bn in shares in November or December.
At the current market price of Pta2,510 per share, Pta100bn in shares
represents 13.3 per cent of Repsol stock.
Mr Fanjul said it was likely that the Spanish government would lose its
majority shareholding in Repsol as a result of the new offering, but would
continue as the single largest shareholder. The state currently has a 64.4
per cent stake in Repsol through its energy holding company Instituto
Nacional de Hidrocarburos.

FT  20 AUG 92 / UK Company News: A quest for new connections - Cable and
Wireless's search to find a partner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HARDLY A month goes by without a new story or rumour surrounding Cable and
Wireless's plans to seek an alliance or partnership with another
telecommunications company.
First there were talks with American Telephone and Telegraph, the giant US
telecommunications group, on a global alliance between the two companies.
Earlier this year Cable's share price rose on news of the talks but fell
sharply when they failed.
Next, reports suggested US West, one of the seven 'Baby Bell' regional
companies spun off from AT&amp;T in 1984, was in talks about forming a
partnership with Mercury Communications, Cable's UK telephone subsidiary.
Then rumours suggested the talks were off because of US regulatory problems;
earlier this week the talks were confirmed as on again. The market, punch
drunk with rumours of telecommunication alliances, no longer knows what to
make of it. So what is Cable up to?
The group confirms it is seeking a link-up between Mercury and another
telecommunications company. One purpose is to increase Cable's profits
generated outside Hong Kong. For the year to March HongKong Telecom, in
which Cable holds a majority stake of 58.4 per cent, generated 60 per cent
of the group's Pounds 644m pre-tax profits.
There are two ways for Cable to grow: expanding existing operations and
establishing new ones.
When it comes to the latter Cable is hopeful of getting licences to operate
in parts of eastern Europe, Australia, Sweden, Japan and elsewhere. In the
long term it is looking at establishing a network linking the large towns
surrounding St Petersburg and Moscow, known as the 'Golden Ring'.
These ventures could prove expensive on top of existing capital spending
commitments of Pounds 1bn over the next three years. The group, therefore,
needs a partner to inject equity.
With regard to expanding existing operations Mercury is the obvious
candidate. Measured by trading performance it is expanding faster than
Cable's other businesses, with revenue growing by 34 per cent in fiscal 1992
compared with HongKong Telecom's 28 per cent growth.
Mercury was set up in 1982 to compete with British Telecommunications. It
concentrated on the lucrative international market. It has 7 per cent of the
domestic market compared with 18 per cent of the international market.
It believes the only way of challenging BT's dominance in the UK is by
winning over more residential customers by making a significant inroad into
the local market.
Mercury plans to increase the number of residential customers from 200,000
to 2m by the year 2000. To expand in the local residential market would
require a significant amount of investment - which is another reason Cable
is looking for a partner.
To achieve its twin goal of challenging BT's dominance in the UK and
establishing new operations abroad it therefore started talks with US West
about selling a stake in Mercury.
US West would need US government permission to take a stake in Mercury in
order to participate in international services. The Federal Communication
Commission, the US regulatory authority, has said waivers to participate in
international services had been given to other Baby Bells in the past and
would probably be given in the future.
Mr James Ross, Cable's chief executive, envisages four elements to an
agreement with another telecommunications company.
It must be a strategic alliance that would link Mercury's long-distance
network with a local network in the UK. This could require a massive
investment to take on BT in the UK. Any deal would probably lead to Cable's
partner agreeing to underwrite part of that investment.
Cable is seeking a stake in the partner's cable television interests, not
because it wants to diversify into cable - although it could provide
long-term benefits - but so it can reinforce its commitment to build
Mercury's residential customer base.
For example Cable is negotiating to take a stake in TeleWest, US West's
cable television joint venture in the UK. If the talks succeed US West's
cable television network would be able to provide a local network to Mercury
at no great extra cost to itself. Mercury would provide the long-distance
links and probably the exchanges, known as switches.
The cable television companies are already installing telephone lines into
homes and offices. TeleWest is the largest UK cable operator with 17
franchises serving 2.9m homes. Between 40,000 and 50,000 have signed up for
telephones. A partner mould be expected to pay cash for a stake in Mercury
to finance its future expansion in the UK. With net debt of Pounds 612m
compared with shareholders' funds of Pounds 2.9bn for the year to end-March,
Cable does not need to reduce borrowings, Mr Ross says. In fact he expects
net debt to rise to about Pounds 1bn in the next year. An equity stake in
Mercury would be mainly used to finance its expansion instead of reducing
borrowings.
The sale of a stake in Mercury would put a value on it and thus could lead
to a separate listing from Cable. HongKong Telecom already has its own
listing on the Hong Kong, New York and Pacific stock exchanges.
Mr Tim Hirst, telecommunications analyst at Kleinwort Benson, says: 'The
market believes Mercury is worth about Pounds 2bn. So any sale that values
it at more than that will have a positive impact on the shares.'
The talks with AT&amp;T - about creating a global alliance between the two
telecommunications groups - failed because they did not include the four
elements outlined by Mr Ross. US West appears to be able to meet all four.
By publicly spelling out Cable's terms for doing a deal in the future Mr
Ross is trying to tell the market that any talks currently taking place are
likely to be more focused.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Arts: Tchaikovsky - Edinburgh International Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS year the festival has a musical mission: to present Tchaikovsky in bulk
and in the round. On paper this may not look a very startling proposition;
but already halfway into the first week, its fulfilment is proving
wonderfully ear-opening. In the words of an impassioned programme note by
Conrad Wilson, 'Tchaikovsky, 99 years after his death, remains the most
neglected of great popular composers. . . the truth is that we hear a
handful of his works again and again while the remainder of a sizeable
output is ignored.'
The achievement of a more rounded composer-portrait is the goal of the 1992
musical schedule, and it has been approached with expert skill and taste.
The popular pieces are not excluded - that would be a different but equal
sort of absurdity - but ranked alongside others less often or indeed never
heard.
So there are the Violin Concerto, the First Piano Concerto and the last
three symphonies - but also the other symphonies (Manfred included) and
piano concertos; such orchestral rarities as the Overture on the Danish
National Anthem and the cantata Moscow; a generous helping of the songs,
piano solos and chamber works; and a rare opera (Iolanta) staged and an even
rarer one (The Oprichnik) in concert form.
One of the points proved after only a short period of festival attendance is
how little justice the popular Tchaikovsky impression - of big gestures,
exotic colours laid on with a trowel, emotional splurge - does to his
compositional personality. In this regard, the morning recitals by the
Borodin Quartet devoted to the three string quartets (and placed,
interestingly, alongside one of Brahms's three) have been particularly
revealing - and this in spite of the patches of ragged ensemble and rusty
tuning from this usually most suave and euphonious of leading quartet
groups.
To proceed from the early B flat quartet movement through the D major
Quartet, no 1, to the F major, no 2, has been to follow Tchaikovsky step by
step in his most assiduous attempts at mastery of craft. His most
characteristic mode here is, if anything, too earnest a desire to cross
every t and dot every i, with the direct consequence, on occasion, of prolix
point-repetition.
But in the movements where the balance between form and content is exactly
struck - the contained, magically tender Adagio of the First and the
rhythmically asymmetrical scherzo of the Second, with its delicious
sleights-of-hand with the first beats of the bar - the Tchaikovsky that
emerges is a composer of singular and unparalleled richness, copious in
'feeling', but also copious in the discipline and containment of that
feeling, and vernally fresh in the sheer sound of his every invention.
The same heart-easing freshness was the great joy of the First Symphony
('Winter Dreams') at the close of Monday's first-rate Usher Hall concert by
the Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra under Dmitry Kitayenko.
On Tuesday the Scottish Chamber Orchestra had set themselves the fascinating
task of elucidating the ties of kinship between Tchaikovsky (in the Rococo
Variations and the orchestra version of the Souvenirs de Florence Sextet)
and Stravinsky (in Apollo and the re-scoring of the Sleeping Beauty Bluebird
pas de deux). This worked out rather less well than one hoped only because
the conductor, Yury Simonov (replacing the ill Charles Mackerras), was in
self-indulgent mood, demonstrating show-off stick technique rather than
close communication with the SCO players, and woefully slowing Apollo down.
Even so, the relationship between the two greatest Russian composers was
made the nub of an out-of-the-ordinary concert adventure. Of those, over the
coming Edinburgh weeks, there promise to be a good many more.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Arts: Dido and Aeneas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE strange thing about the American Mark Morris is that while his dances,
moment by moment, look far from radical, they feel like nothing else. Morris
is a master of pronging you between two or more different reactions at once;
he seldom lets you have just one simple response.
I have acclaimed his dance realisation of Purcell's Dido and Aeneas in these
pages before. At his British debut at the King's Theatre, Edinburgh, on
Tuesday, I was newly struck by the second witches' scene, in which the evil
is depicted at once as something comic, pathetic and horrifying. One witch
mimes taking a lover: she kisses him ardently on the lips, slits his throat
and lets him fall splat to the floor. Meanwhile, the Sorceress (Morris
himself) lies on the floor, at the front centre of the stage. Deftly,
rapidly - it's easy to miss this - she masturbates.
Alternating with these scenes are the grand tragic power of Dido - also
played by Morris - and her court and Aeneas. Morris catches the doom that
hangs heavy on Dido from the first, her noble, joyless despondency. Then, as
soon as Morris-Dido has given herself in love and brief consummation with
Aeneas, Morris-Sorceress comes tearing on to wreck everything. Dido and
Sorceress are two sides of the same psyche. The side that reluctantly admits
passion is succeeded by the side that destroys it.
And so to Dido's final return to doom - her vehement dismissal of Aeneas and
her mighty, lamenting, immolation. All this Dido is a triumph of gesture,
and it is in her Lament, as Dido's voice sings 'Remember me,' that Dido
rises to the heights as she mimes the same gesture to east, west, south and
north in huge, despairing arcs.
It is a privilege to hear again the eloquent singing of Della Jones in both
roles. Gareth Jones conducts the Scottish Ensemble and Schola Cantorum with
clarity and tautness. Only the murky vowels of Rebecca Evans's Belinda are a
slight blot on proceedings.
The entire Morris company dances with startling flair, combining butchness
and delicacy, attack and flow, in characterisations both vividly depicted
and yet objectively delivered. Robert Bordo's set, a half-abstract map of
the Mediterranean sea, casts a beautiful aura around the stage events.

FT  20 AUG 92 / FT Law Report: Beware governments bearing gifts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CELIA HAMPTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Industry used to take a rather detached view of the European Community's
rules on anti-competitive government subsidies. These have not essentially
changed since 1956 but, in the past, most companies were able to dismiss
them as someone else's problem.
Inertia is no longer wise. In the last few years, the Commission has given
enforcement of the 'state aid rules' increasing priority in relation to
manufacturing industry (problem sectors, such as steel and shipbuilding, and
particular sectors such as transport and agriculture receive special
treatment). It is now applying articles 92 and 93 of the EC Treaty to a
wider range of cases. Companies should take care to be aware of them.
The Commission's policy is not yet fully mature, and the European Court is
still giving basic rulings on the extent of its powers. The subject remains
a hot political issue: the rules give the Commission the role of enforcing
competition rules between governments, which is unique among the competition
authorities of the world.
At company level, the state aid rules may pose a threat to a company lucky
enough to benefit from public funding, whether by direct grant, tax
concession, development zone benefits or whatever. The fact that a company
can complain to the Commission about an unfair advantage being given to a
rival enables the rules also to be used as a weapon. If the Commission
decides not to act, the company may appeal to the European Court.
Current examples on the Court's case list include a complaint by the French
company, Matra, against approval of aid for Ford and Volkswagen to build a
car factory in Portugal which will have the capacity to make up to 400,000
multipurpose vehicles a year. Matra, their main European competitor, argues
that the Commission failed to apply the state aid rules consistently with
the Treaty's overall competition policy (Case 225/91).
The association of independent French courier companies, SFEI, is using the
rules more indirectly. It alleges that the Commission failed to identify as
a state aid the benefits conferred on a competitor in the form of cheap
premises, staff time, etc, by the state-owned French post office.
An expensive complication in this case is the need to bring two separate
suits before the Court. Challenges to the Commission's decisions in
competition cases involving companies now go to the Court of First Instance.
State aid decisions, on the other hand, are addressed to member states and,
although affected companies can challenge them, the case has to be brought
before the main European Court.
Most of the legal issues arise from the Commission's refusal to act on
SFEI's allegations against the conduct of companies (TNT and five post
offices) involved in a joint venture which the Commission had approved.
These will be tried by the Court of First Instance in Case T-36/92, but the
state aid issue is going to the main Court in Case 222/92.
Another reason to invoke the rules might be to challenge a tax or levy, the
proceeds of which are used to benefit specific producers or products. The
Court has ruled that this can be classified as a state aid (Cases 149 &amp;
150/91, judgment of June 11 1992).
Such a challenge would also involve the Commission since it alone has power
to rule whether a state aid is unlawful: the national courts cannot strike
down their own taxes on this ground in the way that they could, say, a tax
that discriminated against imports from other EC countries.
Article 92 of the Treaty says that 'any aid granted by a member state or
through state resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens
to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production
of certain goods shall, in so far as it affects trade between member states,
be incompatible with the common market'. It goes on to say that aid for
certain broad purposes (eg for areas of serious unemployment or development
of certain economic activities) 'may be considered compatible'. This
suggests that any others would be incompatible as a matter of law.
However, this is weaker language than, for example, the 'prohibition' of
anti-competitive conduct by articles 85 and 86. Moreover, the Court has
ruled that, however much an aid may appear to contravene article 92, its
unlawfulness is not absolute or unconditional since the next article lays
down procedures for review of state aids and for declarations of
incompatibility by the Commission (Cases 78-83/90, judgment of March 11
1992).
In view of the Commission's increasingly creative recourse to the rules, it
is important for companies to know what is likely to trigger an inquiry. It
may result in a legal obligation to pay back to the government any subsidy
the company is found to have received, possibly some years before. A
particularly uncomfortable situation arises when an enterprise has been
bought from the state at a price which makes it affordable but which
contains a discount or allows past losses to be written off. This means that
the state has conferred a hidden money benefit, as alleged in British
Aerospace's acquisition of Rover.
Only non-discriminatory aid given to consumers and disaster relief are
specifically allowed by the Treaty itself. The Commission has issued some
useful guidance, such as the blanket approval this May of certain low levels
of aid to independent small and medium-sized companies and the temporary
approval of higher levels of aid in Germany's new Lander.
The Commission has power under article 93 to declare an aid which was
granted in the past incompatible with the common market. This is why in
practice a company may have to repay a subsidy, although in theory this
should not happen, since all plans to grant new aid or alter existing
schemes should be notified to the Commission. Two distinct procedures apply
to 'old' and 'new' aids, and the Commission must select and follow the
correct course of action from the start (Cases 312/90 and 47/91, judgment of
June 30 1992).
Politically the most contentious application of the state aid rules is to
public enterprises and state shareholdings. The Treaty explicitly places the
question of ownership beyond the reach of EC law (article 222): it passes no
judgment of any sort on the public ownership of industry.
The Commission's current purpose is to ensure that state enterprises compete
with the private sector as nearly as possible on equal terms. In identifying
payments which are to be treated as aid, the test to be applied is the
'market economy investor principle' by which a payment to an enterprise by
the state is assessed as an investment made by a hypothetical private
investor.
The Court upheld the directive introducing the concept (Cases 188-190,
judgment of July 6 1982) and it has since approved refinements in its
application, for example by allowing an investment to be judged in the long
term or from the point of view of the conglomerate holding company, rather
than by the shorter-term criteria of the capital markets (Cases 305/89 -
Fiat/Alfa-Romeo, and 303/88 - Lanerossi).
The state aid rules show no signs of becoming depoliticised, especially in
the light of the Commission's recent approval of the French government's
injections of capital into the computer maker, Bull, which drew an immediate
protest from the UK. The UK itself, however, is by no means immune from the
rules: the suggestion of a development zone for Ravenscraig following
closure of the steelworks drew an immediate adverse reaction from Brussels.
The Commission's own deliberations are no stranger to controversy. Among the
hard cases to face the commissioners on their return from holiday is the
proposal to impose import duties on vans made in Austria at a plant which
has benefited from subsidies. It is felt that this could operate to the
detriment of EC producers. Austria has a free-trade agreement with the EC
and is an applicant for membership. The result of this will pose new
questions for the Efta countries due to participate next year in the
European Economic Area, and may send ominous signals to the countries of
central Europe.

FT  20 AUG 92 / People: Harvey Nichols' Maney replaced by Wan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The replacement of Dick Maney, managing director of Harvey Nichols, with the
group finance director of its new Hong Kong parent Dickson Concepts,
surprised and saddened the London retailing community yesterday.
When young businessman Dickson Poon took over every Sloane Ranger's
favourite store last August, he promised 'no dramatic or immediate changes'.
Yesterday, the new managing director 38-year-old Joseph Wan alleged that
'someone from Hong Kong can be more effective and efficient' in carrying out
Dickson Concepts' plans in Europe.
Maney, a stylish and talented American retailer, was brought in by John
Hoerner, then chairman of Debenhams, from Lord &amp; Taylor in 1987, and was
credited with successfully enlivening the upmarket fashion store. Only in
April he was giving details of the store's plans for the future and claiming
'we are delighted that in the present economic climate Harvey Nichols can
have such a positive approach to 1992'.
But, increasingly, he must have found that approach being dictated by head
office. Wan, who qualified as a chartered accountant with Peat Marwick in
London, and worked for the firm also in Hong Kong, says the idea - greeted
by other experienced retailers with some scepticism - is 'to take Harvey
Nichols further upmarket'. Wan joined Dickson Concepts as group finance
director five years ago; he steps down from that position and says he is in
London to look after 'existing and future strategy' of the Hong Kong group
in Europe. Immediate plans include two new restaurants and a food hall - all
located on the fifth floor - as well as a boutique opening in Hong Kong.
Harvey Nichols cost Dickson Poon Pounds 60m last year, and Wan says he must
'achieve a profit level to justify the investment'.
'I do have some retailing experience,' he adds in competent though not
immaculate English. 'We have over 100 retail outlets, and I have
participated in the management of them. Dickson Concepts also has exclusive
distribution rights in the Far East for many of the famous brands Harvey
Nichols carries.'

FT  20 AUG 92 / Technology: Driven by devotion - British Entrepreneurs /
Louise Kehoe finds a self-starter who is committed to business through thick
and thin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PETER RIGBY is no fan of venture capitalists. Indeed, this business builder
prides himself in never having borrowed money to fund his Birmingham-based
computer sales and services group - Specialist Computer Holdings (SCH).
He admits, however, to having been tempted at times to 'cash in some chips'
and sell equity to investors. 'I've had opportunities, but I believe that
you cannot be half-hearted about business, you have to be totally committed,
financially and personally, so I have always resisted. I am not interested
in finding an 'exit route' as the financiers call it.'
Financial gain is not the prime motivation for entrepreneurs, Rigby
believes. He was driven, rather, by the challenge of proving his own
abilities. 'I didn't want help or handouts, it had to be down to me.'
Building a business is no easy path to riches, Rigby observes. 'It is almost
all consuming. It occupies all of your thinking. You have to make sacrifices
in terms of family life and personal interests.'
Rigby first 'took the plunge' in 1975. Then in his late 20s, he traded a
successful career in computer sales for 'an awful office' and uncertain
prospects. His first venture was in recruitment, specialising in the
computer industry.
Over 12 years the business grew to become the largest of its type in Europe
and was highly profitable, Rigby says. He sold Specialist Computer
Recruitment to a group of investors in 1987. 'I was sad to sell it. Building
a company is a bit like having a child, it is hard to let go, but my
interests were in the sales and services sector.'
After forming a mainframe computer services company in 1980, Rigby caught
the first wave of the personal computer boom by establishing Specialist
Computer Centres (SCC) as a national dealership chain. He now prefers to
call SCC a 'systems integrator' because it specialises in putting together
'solutions' for large corporate clients rather than simply delivering
pre-packaged products.
SCC now has annual turnover of Pounds 60m making it one of the largest
independent PC sales organisations in the UK and by far the most important
part of the group, which recently reported fiscal 1992 turnover of Pounds
83m with profits of Pounds 5m.
Moving beyond the original PC base, the company now offers networking
products and workstations. Another SCH company which distributes PC
equipment to smaller dealerships accounted for revenues of Pounds 21m last
year. Other group companies offer training and financing.
The past year has not been easy for the group. With PC prices in a
nose-dive, it had to increase its volume of sales by 20 per cent to maintain
turnover at just above last year's level.
'Anybody could succeed in the boom years of the 1980s,' Rigby maintains.
'The recession of the past two to three years has put management skills to
the test.'
More worrisome to Rigby than the economic climate is the 'shambolic mess'
that the computer industry is in, as leading manufacturers struggle to come
to terms with technology and market trends that have undermined their
profitability. Relationships with his key suppliers have suffered as a
result, he complains. 'They are obsessed with their own problems.'
He is also watching changes in PC distribution channels. In the US a growing
proportion of PCs are sold through discount 'superstores' and 'direct' mail
and telephone orders at the expense of traditional dealerships and system
integrators. The same trend is now beginning to emerge in the UK.
'We are flexible,' Rigby claims. He is already hatching plans for a chain of
superstores that may ultimately include branches outside the UK. 'I'm
confident we will launch a pilot superstore this year. We are wholly
prepared to invest Pounds 10m to establish 17 stores over the next three
years.'
Rigby appears undaunted by the prospect of plunging into retailing, despite
no prior experience. He has spent the past three months in talks with a US
superstore company, with a view to forming a joint venture. Although these
plans fell through, he has learned a lot.
As in many aspects of his business, Rigby is self taught. 'For the
entrepreneur, personal qualities are more important than a university
education,' he says. 'The business manager today has to be a good all
rounder. It is not enough to be a good technician, or a first-class
salesman, or a finance man. Some of these skills can be understood in the
academic environment, but many can only be learned in the workplace through
contact with calibre individuals and companies.'
As a self-starter, Rigby resents being typecast as a 'product of the
Thatcher years'. He speaks derisively of those who 'sought success on the
backs of other people's money'. Too many, he maintains, 'were not prepared
to put their own resources at risk, but expected an immediate personal
return in terms of income, opportunities for capital growth in the form of
share options, and a rich lifestyle'.
Did the Thatcher government improve the business climate? 'I don't think the
climate has ever been favourable for entrepreneurs in the UK,' he says. He
acknowledges, none the less, that the regulatory and tax environment in the
UK is 'probably the best in Europe' for business.
However, a big deterrent to entrepreneurial activity in the UK, he believes,
is the lack of respect that is given to individuals who are successful in
business. 'People don't like or admire business success here as they do in
the US. In Britain we need to acknowledge the contributions of people who
create employment, opportunities and wealth.'
Rigby's goal is to build SCH into a Pounds 500m business group over the next
two to three years, while remaining a 'quality' business. 'I don't want to
sacrifice standards,' he stresses.
'To participate in the computer business you have to be fleet of foot. You
have got to recognise and adapt to change, explore new ideas and take
chances.'
The series will conclude next week by observing the differences between
British and US entrepreneurs.

FT  20 AUG 92 / People: Scheele brings Padilla to Jaguar from US
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nick Scheele, who took over as chairman and chief executive of Jaguar in
April, has his first key appointment in place at the troubled luxury car
manufacturer.
He is 46-year-old James Padilla, who was born in Detroit and who has spent
almost his entire working life there since he joined Ford in 1966.
Padilla arrives as Scheele's number two, with the title of executive
director of engineering and manufacturing - a new and key position at the
British company which has proved an extremely expensive proposition for Ford
since the US car giant's 1989 purchase. The two men know each other from the
mid-1980s when Scheele was running the purchasing budget for the North
American assembly plants.
Scheele's predecessor, Bill Hayden, a leading manufacturing expert,
previously from Ford Europe, likened the production facilities at Jaguar to
a plant in Gorky when he was first put in following the acquisition. When he
retired, he left a large gap on the engineering and manufacturing side.
The directors responsible for those areas, who had previously reported to
Hayden, are now reporting to Padilla.
Since 1991 Padilla has been director of the small car segment within North
American product development. An engineering graduate, he had been made
programme operations manager in 1990. He had a year out of Ford in 1978 on a
White House fellowship programme.
Jaguar claims that Hayden made great strides forward in terms of
productivity, and, particularly, quality. Padilla will be continuing in that
vein, and will also be in charge of what is a highly ambitious new model
programme - with plans for a new saloon and sports car as well as a smaller
executive car to compete in the BMW 5-series market.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Technology: Queue buster flies in
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A mobile airline check-in system designed to shorten those interminably long
queues at airports has been developed by Speedwing, British Airways'
external IT consulting and marketing division.
Speedwing has developed software that enables British Airways staff carrying
Poqet hand-held computers to access its mainframe computers to check in
passengers and luggage.
Passengers arriving at Heathrow Airport Terminal Four for British Airways
international flights will be the first to take advantage of the system.
Airline staff at the airport will 'comb' the queues in search of passengers
who are waiting to check in for flights that are about to depart.
Instead of queuing, passengers will be invited to complete the check-in
process on the spot. A special desk will issue boarding passes and luggage
tickets to these passengers. While the advantages for passengers are
obvious, the airline also expects to benefit.
Since the cost of delaying the departure of a Boeing 747 is approximately
Pounds 900 per minute, British Airways estimates that the system will save
it approximately Pounds 8m per year.
The 'queue buster' system is based upon the use of the Ram mobile data radio
network, which provides wireless computer communications. British Airways'
use of radio data communications has been made economically attractive by
the advent of public networks.
In the past the airline has experimented with the use of radio
communications, but faced the prohibitive cost of building its own radio
network infrastructure. The Ram system is expected to be completed this
year.
The airline is also phasing in the system at some US airports. Future uses
may include group check-in at hotels or on trains or buses taking people to
the airport. During a trial of the system, mobile computers were also used
to rebook connections for passengers aboard a delayed flight.
Another use of the system is by pilots who want to access weather and
traffic information directly, rather than via operations control staff.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Accountancy Column: Firms take a bullish view of the future
 -Andrew Jack considers a survey that shows the profession is still
optimistic about its prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INTRIGUING survey doing the rounds of the firms at the moment brings bad
news for those who believe there are too many accountants in the world, but
mixed blessings for those involved in professional practices.
A survey by Lafferty Business Research of the opinions of 66 senior partners
in 39 countries and regions is inevitably subjective, but it does provide
some useful insights into the machinations of those at the helm of some
leading firms.
The main impression (as the chart shows) is one of optimism for the future.
Asked to project growth over the next five years, most of the partners
expected their firms to grow well above the increase in gross domestic
product.
Mr Jim Butler, senior partner of KPMG Peat Marwick in the UK and chairman of
its worldwide network, said he expected double-digit growth in each year
over the decade.
Mr Brandon Gough, his opposite number at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, was more
circumspect. 'The 1980s saw a particular, perhaps even unique, configuration
of events which created rapid growth. We may not see its like again.'
Overseas, there is a clear transatlantic division. Partners in North America
have been humbled by the severity of the recession. Mr Robert Nason, head of
Grant Thornton in the US, says growth will parallel the economic recovery,
the degree of which is still unknown.
But the worst position appears to be in Scandinavia. The Norwegians in
particular are gloomy. Mr Paul Bellamy, head of Grant Thornton in that
country, highlights the financial difficulties for firms as a result of the
economic crisis in the country, with rising bankruptcies and the dire
position of the banking industry. He also stresses the competitive fee
pressures from clients, combined with a relaxation in accountants' ethical
rules on tendering for contracts.
Elsewhere in Europe, partners are more optimistic. Mr Hans-Heinrich Otte,
senior partner at BDO Deutsche Warenstreuhand Aktiengesellschaft, says there
has been a boom in fee volumes in Germany, driven by the opening up of the
former eastern Germany. Requirements for auditing from the end of last year
in the new Lander is generating substantial new income.
Growth in Eastern Europe is equally strong, although several partners
suggest that future expansion may be held in check by the lack of local
professionals.
There is similar optimism in Portugal. Mr David Sargison, the partner in
charge of Arthur Andersen, which dominates the country, stresses it remains
a small, underdeveloped market.
More companies are coming under the requirement for a legal audit each year,
while he believes that other business for the firms will be driven by issues
including privatisations, regulation, the adoption of new EC laws, foreign
investment, the internationalisation of existing companies, the growth in
complexity of the tax system, and expanding demands for information.
In general, growth will not be uniform between different parts of the
accountancy firms' practices, however. As competition intensifies and demand
for new services stabilises, the importance of audit is on the wane almost
everywhere.
Arthur Andersen even believes it is declining in less mature markets such as
Spain, although in Brazil, Mr Ernesto Rubens Gelbcko of Directa BDO sees
expansion driven by that country's economic growth, new requirements for
auditing, and privatisation work.
On the other hand, tax and consulting advice are projected to grow. In the
US, partners highlighted demand for additional tax advice in response to
fiscal measures taken by the federal government, as well as the financial
crises in state and local government.
But consulting is widely seen as having the strongest potential for future
growth. Partners stress areas such as information technology, electronic
data processing, productivity enhancement and environmental services.
If there is one concern which dominates partners' minds more than any other,
it is litigation. Legal actions and awards continue to rise, according to
the survey, driven by both the theory that accountancy firms have 'deep
pockets', and by the apparent belief in the role of auditors to detect
fraud.
Several partners voiced concern about the combination of corporate collapses
triggered by the recession, combined with fee competition which might risk
compromise on quality of service. Concerns are particularly high in the US
and other parts of the developed Anglo-Saxon world.
Even in Korea, Mr David Telepak of Young Wha Accounting Corporation worries
about the risks. He points out that the country has no indemnity insurance
cover available to professional service firms. Yet he expects potential
lawsuits to rise in tandem with the number of bankruptcies, the growing
sophistication of shareholders and the liberalisation of the financial
markets.
Litigation is one factor which is likely to drive incorporation. Mr Anthuan
Xavier of Simpson Xavier Horwath International in Ireland says he will not
be surprised if there are at least two accountancy firms on the Dublin stock
exchange by the end of the decade. But KPMG's Mr Jim Butler in London
insists by contrast that partnership is right at least for his firm and that
it acts in the best interests of the public.
Several partners still believe there is scope for a mega-merger between two
of the 'big six' firms, notably Arthur Andersen and Price Waterhouse. A
larger number believes some middle-tier firms will unite among themselves,
but that smaller firms which are not affiliated to international networks
will disappear over the next few years.
'Times are going to be much tougher than the firms realise,' says Mr Michael
Lafferty, who co-ordinated the analysis.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Putting a fresh
price on an old name / A look at a bold new attempt to calculate brands'
balance sheet value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What's in a name? The answer is a touch more than Dollars 31.2bn (Pounds
16.30bn) if it happens to be Marlboro.
The Philip Morris-owned cigarette brand is the most valuable in the world
according to a new assessment of brand values to be published next month by
Financial World, the US business magazine.
Coca-Cola occupies the number two slot. At Dollars 24.4bn, it is worth more
than twice as much as its rival Pepsi-Cola, which is ranked fourth at
Dollars 9.6bn.
The list is published just as controversy has flared again in the UK over
the question of brand values. Terry Smith, head of research at UBS Phillips
&amp; Drew, the securities house, was suspended from his job last week after his
criticism of a number of legal accounting practices which he claims could
give a misleading impression of a company's financial position. The
practices include that of capitalising brands as intangible assets in the
balance sheet.
Accountants, finance directors, and marketing directors have been at odds
over the issue since the Nestle bid for Rowntree in 1988 raised questions
about the market valuation of such Rowntree brands as KitKat and Quality
Street.
Since then a number of leading UK companies - including Grand Metropolitan,
Guinness, Ranks Hovis McDougall, and United Biscuits - have put at least
some of their brands in the balance sheet.
Guinness, for instance, does not capitalise its beer brand, valued at
Dollars 2.28bn and ranked 17th in the world by the US survey. The drinks
group recognises only acquired brands such as Johnnie Walker and Bell's
Scotch whiskies, Gordon's gin and Asbach brandy, which have a clear
benchmark for valuation, identifiable earnings, and could be sold
separately.
Ian Duncan, Guinness's managing director, finance and administration, says:
'I have no doubt that our practice of recognising acquired brands in our
balance sheet is correct; and I believe it is becoming widely accepted that
brands like ours with a wide, international consumer franchise are real,
substantial and highly valuable assets just as much as, and indeed sometimes
more so than, property and plant, which can be subject to more risk of
obsolescence.'
Much of the criticism of brand valuation has focused on the judgements used
in calculating values; and one or two oddities emerge from the Financial
World estimates.
The magazine bases its approach on methods devised by Interbrand, the UK
consultancy. To find Marlboro's brand value, for example, it first estimated
the brand's annual operating profit - Dollars 3.4bn based on sales of Pounds
15.4bn and a profit margin of 22 per cent.
It then calculated that a non-branded cigarette, employing the same capital
as Marlboro, would have made profits of only Dollars 462m.
This amount was deducted from Marlboro's Dollars 3.4bn operating profits,
leaving Dollars 2.9bn. After a 43 per cent provision for taxes, the final
figure of Dollars 1.7bn was deemed to be the net brand-related profits.
The Dollars 1.7bn was then multiplied by a factor of brand strength,
dependent on market position, overall market prospects, degree of
internationalism, and marketing support. The Marlboro multiple, picked from
a range of 12-20, was 19, giving a brand value of Dollars 31.6bn.
Using these methods, the survey ranks Guinness's Johnnie Walker Red Label,
the world's best-selling Scotch, 14th in its list of brands with a value of
Dollars 2.54bn (Pounds 1.32bn), and Gordon's gin in 28th place at Dollars
1.1bn (Pounds 578m). The total value of the two brands is far above the
Pounds 1.39bn balance sheet value that Guinness puts on all its spirits.
Such disparities illustrate the problems attached to brand accounting with
which the accountancy profession is still wrestling.
But the problems need not detract from the use of brand valuation as an aid
to management. The debate on brand values in the US has centred not on their
place in corporate financial reporting but on their use as a counter to
undue emphasis on short-term financial performance.
The feeling persists among marketing managers that profit-based performance
measures encourage actions, such as over-pricing or extensive sales
promotions, that produce quick profits but erode long-term brand values.
