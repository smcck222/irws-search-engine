FT  29 SEP 92 / Healthcare for ethnic minorities to be probed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WAYS of improving the provision of health services to Britain's ethnic
minorities are to be examined by the government following a report by Dr
Kenneth Calman yesterday.
Dr Calman, in his first report as the government's chief medical officer,
draws attention to the need to address particular health issues affecting
ethnic minorities and to 'take positive steps to eliminate discrimination
within the NHS'.
There is evidence, Dr Calman says, that people with different genetic and
cultural backgrounds can experience patterns of disease that give rise to
particular needs from the health service.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, said after publication of the
report that she wanted the NHS to be 'more precisely tuned' to the needs of
people from ethnic minorities.
Lady Cumberlege, junior health minister, is to meet representatives of
ethnic minority communities, NHS managers and professional bodies as the
first step towards drawing up an action plan for meeting special needs. The
government is also looking at ways of improving employment and promotion
opportunities in the NHS for people from ethic minorities.

GT Management, international investment managers, has agreed to rent 24,000
sq ft in Alban Gate in the City, one of the largest new office blocks in
London. The lease is for 25 years, with the option to cancel after 10 or 15
years.
The deal follows last week's decision by Chemical Bank, the US investment
bank, to take 164,000 sq ft of space in Alban Gate instead of Canary Wharf,
the failed Docklands development.
The letting reduces the vacant space in Alban Gate to 149,000 sq ft, or 40
per cent. The building's other tenant is Dibb Lupton Broomhead, solicitors.

FT  29 SEP 92 / BBC cuts ordered to counter overspend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BBC Television yesterday said it was facing a Pounds 20m budget overspend
because of 'flaws' in its 'financial allocation process' and that it would
have to make cuts in 'housekeeping, premises, capital investment and
programmes', Gary Mead writes.
Sir Michael Checkland, director-general, has instructed BBC Television to
make cuts of almost 3 per cent to stay within its Pounds 700m annual budget.
The BBC could not say precisely where the cuts would fall, but it said
'housekeeping, premises, capital investment and programmes' would all be
affected, in that order.
The corporation would not be drawn on the nature of the defects in the
accounting system. 'What we are talking about here is how the money within
the television services is shared out across the two networks. It is not
producers overspending their budgets,' it said.
The government is due next week to publish a green paper on the future of
the BBC.

A FORD union official yesterday claimed anti-British feeling had provoked
Ford of Europe to announce 1,500 job losses at UK car plants, Lisa Wood
writes.
Mr Andy Richards, convener at Bridgend, south Wales, one of the Ford plants
affected by the cuts, alleged that the management board of Ford of Europe
was 'dominated by Germans using their position in a nationalistic way.'
He said that job losses had only been announced for UK plants, not those in
France, Germany and Spain.
Ford said yesterday that only two members of the board were German, the rest
were mainly Americans.

FT  29 SEP 92 / Buyer sought for sports car maker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISCUSSIONS were said last night to be proceeding with 'several' potential
buyers for Ginetta Cars, the maker of sports cars based in Scunthorpe,
Humberside, which is in receivership.
Mr David Stokes, the joint administrative receiver with Cork Gully, is
operating the company as a going concern, with final development being
continued of a new car planned for launch at next month's Birmingham motor
show.
Ginetta, the subject of a management buy-in led by Mr Martin Phaff nearly
three years ago, is one of the less well-known UK specialist carmakers.
However, since the company was founded in 1958 it has built a small but
loyal following based mainly on successes in motor sport.
Following the buy-in, Ginetta launched an ambitious expansion programme,
notably into export markets. Its entry into receivership, at the request of
its directors to its bankers, Barclays, was triggered last week by
sterling's collapse and its adverse effect on the company's foreign-currency
borrowings.
It was most heavily hit by the effect of sterling's fall on around Pounds 1m
of yen borrowings. Total indebtedness is around Pounds 2m. In 1990 Ginetta
had signed a three-year deal to supply at least 30 cars a year over the next
three years to Wary House, the Japanese importing company, based near Tokyo.
At the time, the deal appeared to be a sufficient coup for Sir James
Cleminson, chairman of the British Overseas Trade Board, to travel to the
company's base to welcome Japanese delegates to the signing ceremony.
Ginetta produced 150 cars in 1991 but had intended to raise the total to 300
this year.
The Scunthorpe company is the second specialist UK carmaker to go into
receivership within two months. Land Rover, the four-wheel-drive subsidiary
of British Aerospace's Rover Group, is to launch a new 'flagship' Range
Rover model at next week's Paris motor show. It will be longer than the
current model, have a larger engine and what is claimed to be the world's
first electronic air suspension system.

FT  29 SEP 92 / Sheffield censured over student games
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government's watchdog on public spending has severely criticised
Sheffield City Council for failing to monitor and manage last year's World
Student Games, held in the city. The games unexpectedly lost Pounds 10.4m
after the council had budgeted Pounds 5m of public funds to cover a
shortfall of income.
Mr Gordon Sutton, the district auditor responsible for monitoring the
council's spending, says those running the games failed to install proper
systems of financial control and had no idea of the scale of impending
losses only weeks before the games took place in July.
The games failed to achieve expected revenue from television rights,
commercial sponsorship, merchandising and ticket sales. Sharp cutting of
costs as the shortfall became apparent led to some loss of control. One
economy measure - to cut resources in the box office - resulted in it
becoming impossible to reconcile ticket sales with cash receipts.
The report deals only with the running of the games themselves. Capital
costs of more than Pounds 140m for an athletics stadium came out of
borrowings and will be paid back over several decades from local taxes.
The report comes as the council contemplates up to 800 redundancies to
eliminate a potential Pounds 7m overspend on its budget of more than Pounds
700m. Mr Mike Bower, leader of the Labour-controlled council, last night
refused to link the losses on the games with the job cuts, saying the
budgetary problem could just as well have come from overspending on
education, housing or cleansing.
The council will consider the report on Friday, when it will go into secret
session to consider a confidential document by Mrs Pamela Gordon, its chief
executive, on the role of Mr Ray Gridley, Sheffield's director of housing.
Mr Gridley was seconded to run the games after the council took on their
management in 1990.
Previously, the idea was to keep the games at arm's length, with the company
Universiade GB set up specially to run them. But the company had constant
funding problems as it struggled to win sponsorship.
Mr Sutton says council officers failed to set up systems to monitor Mr
Gridley, and he unintentionally misled councillors about how well things
were going. There was then a failure to press for more detail. Mrs Gordon
says in her own report on the games, also published last night, that the
line between optimism and over-optimism is sometimes difficult to draw.
Mrs Gordon said last night that she saw no reason to resign but would await
councillors' reactions at Friday's meeting.
Mr Gridley said he did not accept all Mr Sutton's findings and that the
positive achievements of the games should be 'included in the balance'.

FT  29 SEP 92 / Municipal insurer runs for cover: The troubles that are
forcing MMI to look for a rescuer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOCAL government leaders are reflecting ruefully on events which led to the
possible demise of Municipal Mutual Insurance, the local-authority-owned
company. For most of its 89 years Municipal Mutual stuck to the solid but
unexciting business of insuring everything from schools to dustcarts - it is
the insurer for nine out of 10 metropolitan, district and county councils.
Now it is on the brink of insolvency after expansion into other areas of the
insurance market in the 1980s - when it frequently undercut its larger
rivals to increase market share - and a sharp increase in claims in the last
two years.
Led by Mr Andrew McLean, who resigned as chief executive earlier this year,
it focused its expansion into motor and home insurance. The group also built
up a portfolio of high-risk international commercial insurance in the London
market. Between 1987 and 1991 premium income increased from Pounds 397m to
Pounds 917m.
Mr Mike Shaw, director of finance at Gateshead Metropolitan Council, said:
'They should have stuck to basics. There was never any problem until they
were allowed to go into all these new areas.' The company had been a victim
of the 1980s enthusiasm for 'privatisation'.
Local government leaders were also unhappy about changes to the ownership
structure which gave individual policyholders similar voting rights to those
of the local authorities themselves.
The changes diluted local authority control ahead of the 1989 Local
Government Act, which forced local government to divest ownership of
commercial businesses, giving management more leeway to pursue expansion.
The expansion was followed by deterioration in trading conditions in the
insurance industry as a whole, following a spate of bad weather, recession
and crime-related losses. Municipal Mutual was exposed to rising claims on
its liability business - insuring local authorities against the cost of
legal claims for negligence.
The group paid out several million pounds to relatives of those killed in
the Hillsborough football disaster in 1989. Claims to former residents of
Staffordshire children's homes psychologically injured by the 'pindown'
disciplinary regime will amount to more than Pounds 2m. Schemes designed to
protect local authorities with tight budgets against the cost of stand-ins
for teachers absent through illness have also led to losses of millions of
pounds.
Compensation claims from individuals suffering minor injuries after
accidents on poorly maintained streets have increased sharply. Mr Henry
Croft Baker, a local authority insurance specialist with the brokers
Fenchurch, said authorities had been seen as a 'soft target' by claimants,
encouraged to claim by the increasing size of court awards.
Overall claims increased to Pounds 906m in 1991, more than three times the
level in 1987, leaving Municipal Mutual with a pre-tax loss of Pounds 132m.
After increasing provisions to pay for future claims, Municipal Mutual's net
assets - assets less liabilities - had declined to Pounds 4.9m. This left it
with a solvency margin - assets as a percentage of non-premium income - well
below minimum levels normally accepted within the industry.
Management was tightened last year when company chairman Mr Maurice
Stonefrost, former chief executive of the Greater London Council, who took
over at the end of 1990, took a more active role.
Premium rates were increased sharply, local authorities asked to retain much
larger deductibles (the portion of a claim paid by the buyer) and management
controls tightened. In April Municipal Mutual sold its commercial risks
business and closed its Australian subsidiary.
But the acute shortage of capital combined with the uncertain size of future
claims has forced more radical measures. Following Mr McLean's departure in
May, Mr Brian Wright, the retiring chief executive of Sun Alliance, was
invited in to spearhead efforts to find a buyer, while actuaries from UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew have been attempting to calculate the size of future
liabilities.
In the summer a succession of potential companies - including Britain's Sun
Alliance and Eagle Star - examined Municipal Mutual's books. Most were
scared off by the company's potential future liabilities. One executive
said: 'Although there is no black hole, the business is fundamentally
unattractive. The liabilities are just unquantifiable.'
Talks with Paris-based Garantie Groupe Mutuelle de Fonctionnaires, which
since July has pursued an interest in buying Municipal Mutual, are also
understood to have found this issue something of a sticking point.
Municipal Mutual insisted yesterday that talks would continue this week. In
the meantime some local authorities are looking for alternative cover. The
Association of Metropolitan Authorities last week advised members whose
policies came up for renewal to buy policies from other insurance companies.
Mr Croft Baker estimates that Municipal Mutual has lost as many as 5 per
cent of its local authority customers over the past five to six months.

FT  29 SEP 92 / Electricity regulator challenged: Power users seek judicial
review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEMBERS OF Coffer, the group representing electricity interests, are to make
a legal challenge against Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity
regulator.
The group said yesterday that the majority of its members, which include
large industrial users of electricity, trade unions and coalfield
communities, had decided to apply for a judicial review.
This follows Prof Littlechild's rejection of charges by Coffer that he had
failed to ensure that electricity distribution companies were fulfilling
their obligation to buy the cheapest possible electricity.
The decision was taken at a meeting last Friday. However the Major Energy
Users Council, which represents some of the UK's largest industrial
companies, was not present and will not decide whether to back the move
until a meeting of its executive committee on October 13.
The council said last night that no implications should be read into the
delay.
Coffer maintains that new gas-fired stations being built by the electricity
companies to supply part of their needs do not produce the most economical
electricity.
Prof Littlechild told Coffer in a letter two weeks ago that he was already
reviewing the economic purchasing obligations, but Coffer said yesterday
that this reply was unsatisfactory.
Mr Roger Lyons, chairman of the Trades Union Congress energy committee,
said: 'The gas-fired power station programme will mean intolerable increases
in electricity prices for all electricity consumers - domestic, small
business and industry. What British industry really needs is the cheap
energy that is already being provided by our large, efficient coal-fired
plant using British deep-mined coal.'
Offer, the electricity regulation office, said: 'Our position remains as it
was in Prof Littlechild's letter.'
UK electricity consumers received better service from their electricity
companies last year, according to Offer.
In its latest report on the reliability of electricity distribution, Offer
gives figures for the number of supply interruptions and the time taken to
correct them for each of the 12 distribution companies in England and Wales
and the two power companies in Scotland.
These show that London Electricity had the lowest number of interruptions
per 100 customers, followed by Norweb. The poorest service was given by
South Wales Electricity, but Offer notes that this company was engaged in
major works which involved planned interruptions.

FT  29 SEP 92 / Ruling safeguards lift-truck jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of manufacturing in the UK by Lancer Boss Group, the biggest
British-owned lift-truck producer, was secured yesterday after two years of
uncertainty caused by a green-belt planning row.
Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, has granted Boss planning
permission for a project to consolidate manufacturing on one site in the
company's home town of Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire.
Boss manufactures in seven sites scattered across the town, and Sir Neville
Bowman-Shaw, chairman, had warned that objections to the consolidation plan
might have forced the company to relocate its manufacturing operations
overseas.
Mr Howard's decision safeguards 600 jobs in Boss's manufacturing and related
departments at Leighton Buzzard. It could also mean the creation of 500 jobs
in the town by boosting the company's status as an efficient, high-volume
producer.
Boss has manufactured lift trucks in Leighton Buzzard since 1959, and two
years ago announced the consolidation plan to remain competitive in the
cut-throat global lift-truck industry and to take advantage of growth
markets such as the Far East.
The plan involves a 37,000 sq metre extension of one of the Boss factories,
which would encroach on the green belt by 95 metres.
Local planning permission was granted last year but objections from Friends
of the Earth, the environmental pressure group, and a local preservation
society led the environment department to call in the plan, and Boss was
asked to submit a review of possible alternatives.
Mr Howard yesterday said: 'I have had to balance the benefits to the
national and local economy against the harm that will be done to the green
belt.
'I have carefully considered the evidence relating to the availability of
alternative sites, but concluded that none has been identified which would
be suitable for the purpose and available within the required timescale.'
The decision will be an immense relief for Boss employees and components
suppliers in the UK.
Over the past decade Boss has bought manufacturers of lift trucks in Spain,
Germany and Italy, all of which could have provided immediate production
capacity at the expense of running down the British plant.
Mr Trevor Bowman-Shaw, vice-chairman, said the uncertainty over the plans
would delay the start of the extension, as other Boss European factories
have had to be given priority while the planning permission was being
reviewed.
Boss expects to finalise the extension plan towards the end of next year.

FT  29 SEP 92 / Coal contract talks delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEGOTIATIONS on the new contracts between British Coal and the electricity
industry have run into further delays. It is now unlikely that Mr Michael
Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, will be able to announce them
at the Tory party conference next week, as originally planned.
Sources close to the talks said yesterday that several weeks of further
negotiation might be needed.
One of the issues delaying completion is how the risks in the contracts
should be shared between British Coal, the generators and the distribution
companies. These risks could come from actions by the electricity regulator
or the government.
There were also suggestions yesterday that the volumes of coal to be
supplied under the contracts might be further reduced. These are believed to
be about 40m tonnes a year, reducing to 30m. This compares with 65m tonnes
this year.
The government has apparently decided not to impose any political deadlines
on the talks, which are vital to the proposed privatisation of British Coal.
Previous attempts to secure a deal by a set date have all failed, and have
if anything complicated the complex negotiations. However some urgency will
begin to creep into the talks if the government is to meet its timetable of
initiating the privatisation by the end of this year.

GUINNESS Peat Aviation (GPA), the Irish aircraft leasing company, and Air
Ukraine, Ukraine's national carrier, yesterday announced the creation of Air
Ukraine International, a joint-venture airline offering flights from Ukraine
to western Europe and North America.
In an effort to win back western passengers who prefer to fly to Kiev on
western airlines, Air Ukraine International is to lease two new Boeing-737s
from GPA for its European flights, and plans to lease a number of Boeing-767
aircraft for services to North America to be launched in summer 1993.
The move is unusual for GPA, which controls less than 10 per cent of the
joint venture. GPA's regular business is to lease aircraft, but the Irish
company apparently realised that unless it contributed to the financing of
Air Ukraine International, it would be a long time before the Ukrainians
would be in a position to afford western aircraft.

FT  29 SEP 92 / World Trade News: World trade deal hangs on oilseeds row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER and FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES of an agreement on the Uruguay Round world trade talks depend on the
outcome of today's council meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (Gatt) to try to resolve the EC-US dispute over oilseeds.
European Commission officials say that US interest in getting an overall
Gatt settlement will be measured by its attitude to the bilateral row over
the EC oilseeds regime, and whether or not Washington is prepared to open
hostilities over it. If it does not, talks on the Uruguay Round are expected
to resume at senior level.
The US is holding in abeyance punitive tariffs on Dollars 1bn (Pounds 585m)
worth of EC food exports, after both sides agreed at the beginning of this
month to seek a resolution by today's meeting in Geneva.
This truce coincided with a softening of both sides' positions on the extent
to which farm subsidies should be cut, the issue which has held up
conclusion of the Uruguay Round for 20 months.
Hopes were also raised in Brussels that President George Bush might be
moving to bolster his fading chances of re-election through an October deal
on Gatt.
Negotiations between top officials have proceeded intermittently all month,
and were not blown off course even by the US announcement that its beefed-up
export enhancement programme would raise subsidised wheat exports from 17m
to 30m tonnes. Wheat and soya - the main commodity in the oilseeds row - are
at the heart of the Uruguay Round impasse.
But recent indications that Washington is seeking a halving of EC production
of oilseeds have tempered the optimism of those in Brussels who were
relatively bullish about concluding the round.
The EC maintains that US soya producers have lost market share in the EC to
lower-cost producers from Argentina and Brazil. It proposes to compensate US
producers, nonetheless, under Article 28 of the Gatt code, and argues that
as long as it is observing Gatt disputes procedures, the US can not
retaliate unilaterally.
Most senior officials in Brussels have always believed the oilseeds dispute
could only be settled within a deal on the Uruguay Round. Although the row
has grown, one official said both sides were still preparing to meet to
discuss a deal on the Uruguay Round.
Frances Williams adds from Geneva: In Geneva, both sides seem to want to
play for time, in the process invoking arcane procedures that take Gatt into
uncharted legal territory. The US will today ask for an arbitration panel to
decide within 30 days on the amount of trade lost by oilseeds producers
because of the EC's subsidy regime. In the meantime, it says it is ready to
go on with the talks. Washington has put losses at Dollars 2bn for all the
countries affected. In negotiations the EC has offered compensation of no
more than Dollars 400m.
The EC, which opposes arbitration, will try to activate a rule allowing Gatt
members as a whole to try to resolve the compensation dispute if the
protagonists fail to agree.
The oilseeds dispute is just one of a number of rows that are directly
related to the continued stalemate in the Uruguay round of global trade
talks. Also on today's Gatt council agenda are the recent US decision to
increase wheat export subsidies, which has angered other grain-exporting
countries, and the EC's proposals to restrict banana imports from Latin
America.
The Gatt council is today likely to approve establishment of working parties
to draft membership terms for Ecuador and Taiwan. It is also expected to
approve applications for observer status from Latvia, Lithuania and
Kazakhstan.

FT  29 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Russian oil and gas fields out for tender
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian government is putting out for tender oil and gas fields off the
far eastern island of Sakhalin, according to the Itar-Tass official news
agency.
The announcement appears to mean that at least some of the remaining eight
fields off the island are to be offered for tenders for feasibility studies,
following the award in March of a feasibility study for two of the fields to
a Japanese-American consortium composed of Mitsui, Marathon Oil and
McDermott.
The political infighting surrounding the award of the contracts has been
intense, with the local administration and Moscow disagreeing on the
companies to be awarded the contract, and the powerful Russian oil lobby
pressing the government not to award tenders to foreign companies.
To counter this latter pressure, Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister,
has specified in the order he signed on Friday authorising the tender
process that foreign companies bidding for the reserves 'would be required
to make maximum use of Russian labour and resources'.
The order also asks the relevant Russian ministries to specify the areas
open to tender within the next two weeks - which suggests that a struggle
may still be going on as to how much to allocate to foreign investment. Mr
Gaidar has also asked the ministries to set up a commission to regulate the
tender process.
Among the oil companies which bid unsuccessfully for the first tender
awarded to the Japanese-American consortium were the Japanese Sodeco
company, set up in the 1970s especially to do a feasibility study on
Sakhalin but awarded no more contracts since the completion of the study of
two fields; and the US companies Exxon, Mobil and Amoco.
The Russian government is anxious to finish the feasibility studies this
year, and begin exploitations next year - following a five-year delay
largely taken up with inter-agency and inter-administration squabbles about
the development.
Russian oil production is now in a crisis, with production falling rapidly
because of lack of investment and as yet only limited foreign involvement in
the fields.

FT  29 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Storm clouds gather over Genoa harbour -
How Italy's maritime trade is caught between an archaic monopoly and EC
reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Ezio Alcide Rosina, the chief executive of Italy's state-owned
Finmare shipping group, docked his latest vessel, the Via Ligure, at Genoa's
old harbour, he hardly imagined the struggles ahead.
Berthing the bright green ship, the first of five specially commissioned
roll-on roll-off ferries, in the country's biggest and most unionised port
was deliberately provocative. The previous day, Finmare had tried, and,
failed, to inaugurate a service to Sicily from Voltri, a vast new port to
the west of Genoa's old docks.
'I wanted the people to see the ship and what we planned to do,' said Mr
Rosina. Finmare's reasoning was faultless. Rather than using Italy's
overcrowded motorways, container lorries would drive onto the wide decks of
the German-built vessel for the overnight journey to Sicily.
That was almost three months ago. Since then, the Via Ligure's log has
summed up the troubled summer at Italy's biggest port. Caught between an
archaic monopoly, guaranteeing dock unions' exclusive rights, and a European
Community deadline to abolish restrictive practices, the Via Ligure and a
handful of other vessels have turned into stalking horses for reform.
Last month, successive attempts to load cargo prompted strikes, barricades
and legal action from unions and employers in a battle of wills decisive for
the future of Italy's maritime trade. All that has been missing so far is
the violence seen in the UK in the early 1980s, when Mrs (now Lady) Margaret
Thatcher liberalised port employment in Britain. With legislation to remove
union privileges, theoretically to be put forward this week, such conflict
may be next on the list.
Mr Giancarlo Tesini, Italy's transport minister, explains why matters have
become so confused. The government planned legislation following a European
Court of Justice ruling that the dock-workers' monopoly contravened EC
rules. However, Genoa's dockers persuaded a local court that the EC law was
inapplicable, and the monopoly could continue.
Matters grew more complicated after Sir Leon Brittan's competition
directorate issued a 60-day warning to the Italian government at the end of
July to comply with Community rules or face a formal procedure. Meanwhile,
Genoa port employers took legal action to break the monopoly.
Mr Tesini has responded with a draft law abrogating the dockers' monopoly
and opening the way for greater private-sector involvement in Italy's
state-run ports. The bill should be passed by the end of this month,
although that deadline looks likely to slip. Should parliament delay, he
says the government may transform it into a decree law, by-passing
time-consuming debate. But with the EC deadline imminent, the conflict
between employers and dock workers may hot up.
Private shippers claim that Genoa's tradition of restrictive labour
practices and mismanagement by compliant left-leaning port authorities
account for its steady decline. Cargoes have slumped and the number of
dockers has plunged over the past decade to about 1,000. Employers see
abolition of the dockers' monopoly as Genoa's last chance to regain its
position as one of the leading ports in the Mediterranean.
But it is the development of a huge new container facility at Voltri, the
Via Ligure's base, which has fuelled the fires. Unlike Italy's other 144
ports, Voltri's management has been entrusted to a special company, Voltri
Terminal Europa (VTE), in which the Fiat group has a 95 per cent stake, with
the rest held by the Genoa port authority. In practice, VTE is not covered
by the dockers' monopoly, enabling it to use non-union labour when it opens
next year.
Having started service before Voltri's main facilities entered operation,
Finmare's roll-on roll-off terminal became the flash point. While VTE's
management defends the right to choose its own workers, the dockers' union
has tried to extend its monopoly.
Tension eased earlier this month after Mr Tesini issued a special decree
underlining Voltri's autonomy, ahead of resolution of the wider dispute over
dockers' rights. To ease tempers, VTE has taken on two union members
alongside its own staff for a limited period, and the Via Ligure is back at
work. 'The dockers must realise they are defending a privilege that no
longer has any reason to exist. The rules have changed,' says Mr Tesini.
However, he avoids confrontational language. 'I don't want to declare war on
the port workers.'
Hence his reluctance to speculate on whether dockers will accept the demise
of their monopoly. Imposition of the new law in the face of possible union
opposition 'is up to the forces of the Ministry of the Interior, it's not a
matter for the transport minister'.
Rather than threatening force, he prefers to focus on other ports, where
labour relations are already much more flexible. 'Just look at Ravenna,' he
says. For Mr Tesini, the Adriatic port offers a snapshot of how labour
relations in all Italy's docks must change, with a more entrepreneurial
union role and private-sector interests involved in managing day-to-day
activities, with the state-appointed port authority remaining as an umpire
in the background.
Only by encouraging labour flexibility and letting private companies run
their own terminals can Italy's ports remain competitive, he stresses. But
it remains to be seen whether the softly, softly approach will be enough to
persuade Genoa's militant dockers to give up their monopoly without a fight.

FT  29 SEP 92 / Attorney-general sets sights on Brazil's president: Collor
could be adding criminal charges to his troubles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE political future of Brazil's President Fernando Collor will be decided
by a historic vote in Congress, scheduled for today, on whether to begin
impeachment proceedings against him for corruption.
In the capital yesterday both sides claimed to be confident of victory. But
amid all the suspense surrounding the vote it has been easy to lose sight of
what Mr Collor is actually accused of. Even if he survives today's vote he
may soon face criminal charges.
One person who has not forgotten is Mr Aristides Junqueira, the
attorney-general. He told foreign correspondents yesterday: 'My work is
currently being overshadowed by the political process but once that is out
of the way the criminal process will move to the forefront.'
Mr Junqueira has sent 15 questions to Mr Collor to answer by the end of this
week and expects then to recommend criminal charges against the president
and 14 other people. 'I have extremely strong indications that crimes were
carried out by the president,' he said.
While politicians have been trying to muster votes, the federal police have
been hard at work calculating the assets of Mr Collor and Mr Paulo Cesar
Farias, his former campaign treasurer and alleged frontman, and attempting
to piece together how the alleged corruption scam worked. They have already
recommended that Mr Farias be charged with nine offences, including running
a crime-racket.
Estimates of how much money was involved range from the Dollars 6.5m (Pounds
3.8m) found by a congressional inquiry to have been illicitly funnelled to
Mr Collor, to upwards of Dollars 1bn a year. The 87-day inquiry and police
probe have investigated property in Paris, millions spent on replenishing
the First Lady's wardrobe, and cheques to Mr Collor's advisers and
relatives, including his ex-wife.
Mr Benito Gama, the pro-government head of the inquiry, says he was
'profoundly shocked' by what it uncovered: 'I never imagined we would find
such a network and we probably only touched the surface.'
When the inquiry into Mr Farias began in May, Brazilians expected a
cover-up. Many leading Brazilian politicians are tainted with corruption
accusations and no important figure has ever been jailed for corruption. But
the testimony of Mr Collor's former driver led the congressional inquiry to
use subpoena powers to request 40,000 cheques.
Helped, ironically, by a regulation brought in by Mr Collor's government to
make all cheques carry the name of the payee, they found what appears to be
an astonishing web of corruption.
The scheme, as pieced together by the inquiry, was simple. First Mr Farias
arranged a network of people in strategic positions in ministries and state
companies.
Police inquiries show that money was extorted through various means, such as
overpayment on government purchases, commissions on licences and
authorisations, rigged bids and kickbacks from contractors. The latter were
given receipts by Empresa de Participacoes e Consultos (EPC), one of Mr
Farias's companies.
The inquiry obtained cheques showing that 32 large private companies had
paid some Dollars 15m to EPC in the last two years for services they could
not explain. Many details of the operation were kept on computer disk, which
even listed the preferred hobbies, restaurants and holiday destinations of
ministers and the favourite perfumes of their spouses.
Most of the money detailed by the inquiry that stayed in Brazil went to EPC
and BrasilJet, a private jet leasing company that never leased any aircraft.
Some was then allegedly funnelled into the accounts of Collor family members
and aides through phantom bank accounts whose signatories were found by
graphologists to be EPC employees.
Bank documents show that Dollars 2.37m was deposited in the account of Mr
Collor's secretary to pay the president's household expenses.
Police are also investigating the First Lady who, as head of a government
charity, awarded contracts to family members and allegedly channelled funds
to a phantom institution sharing the address of her family home.
They have also announced investigations into the possible manipulation of
state pension funds, interference in the running of Petrobras, the state oil
monopoly, use of insider information for commodity trading, such as Brazil's
suspension of coffee exports for a few days last year, and the renegotiation
of Dollars 86m debt owed by Alagoan sugar refiners.
Mr Collor and Mr Farias had made little attempt to hide their wealth. Having
stayed in his own house rather than move to the official presidential
residence, to prove his 'commitment to austerity', Mr Collor then spent
Dollars 2.5m landscaping his gardens, according to the company which carried
out the work.
Mr Farias, a former trainee priest turned tractor dealer, spent Dollars 3m
building a heavily guarded mansion overlooking the bay in Maceio in 1990, a
year when his declared income was Dollars 24,000. He bought a Dollars 2.7m
apartment in Paris, mansions in Sao Paulo and Braslia and a black Lear Jet
named the Black Bat.
While denying he has had any contact with Mr Farias for two years, Mr Collor
has made no attempt to answer the allegations point by point.
Mr Claudio Vieira, the president's former personal secretary, said monies
unearthed by the inquiry were the residue of a Dollars 5m campaign loan from
Uruguay, but the inquiry rejected his documents as not credible and the
operation unsuitable for an aspiring president.
Mr Collor claimed on national television that he had no idea where the money
came from for his personal expenses. Mr Junqueira snorted at this yesterday:
'Can you imagine living in a house and seeing new cars appear, expensive
refurbishing undertaken, millions of dollars appearing in accounts and just
saying 'how nice' without knowing or wondering where the money came from?'
However, despite his certainty that crimes were committed, he cautioned: 'I
think it is very difficult in Brazil for someone to go to jail for
corruption.'

FT  29 SEP 92 / International swoop cracks big cocaine-smuggling ring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALIAN and US police said yesterday they had smashed one of the world's
biggest cocaine-smuggling and money-laundering networks in a huge
international swoop that had led to the arrest of more than 200 suspects.
The 34 people arrested in Italy included two kingpins of Colombian cocaine
cartels and members of Italian Mafia families. Some 167 people were arrested
in the US, including a senior executive of Colombia's national bank.
Two people were arrested in Costa Rica and police said they had found a huge
cache of drug money in Britain.
The swoop, called Operation Green Ice, took some 10 months to plan and most
of the arrests were made last week. It was carried out jointly by Italian
police and the US Drug Enforcement Administration.
The drugs organisation used intricate methods - including bank accounts,
couriers and ships as well as dummy and real companies in many countries -
to smuggle cocaine from South America to Europe. Some of the money to pay
for the drugs was then sent back to South America via bank accounts and
companies in Austria, the US and Switzerland. Some remained in Europe.
Officials said the most significant arrest in Italy was that of Jose 'Tony
the Pope' Duran, 38. One Italian anti-Mafia official called him 'the most
important distributor in the world of cocaine for the Colombian drug
cartels'.
Mr Duran, alleged to be the head of the Pereira cartel, was arrested at a
bar in Rome last week.
UK investigators said they had arrested two men, believed to be Americans,
in the Kensington area of London last Friday and seized 43kg of cocaine with
an estimated street value of Pounds 7m during their contribution to
Operation Green Ice.
Customs officers and police also seized nearly Pounds 2.5m of what is
believed to be drug-laundered money from various locations, including a
lock-up garage in south-east London.
The men arrested in the UK were being held and questioned at an undisclosed
London location.
Mr Douglas Tweddle, chief UK customs investigator, said last night: 'This is
a major blow to the drug barons. We have managed to take a lot of money away
from them. . . it will make it very difficult for them to operate in the
future.'

FT  29 SEP 92 / Political resentment thrives in a country divided: The
economic divergence between north and south, reflected in the impeachment
drive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS ironic given Brazilian President Fernando Collor's rhetoric of
modernisation that he should hail from one of the country's most backward
states, while the most advanced states are at the forefront of the campaign
to unseat him.
Alagoas, in Brazil's poverty-stricken northeast, is the kind of place where
men kill for honour and hired gunmen cost less than a pair of sneakers.
Another world entirely from the industrialised south, its air is heavy with
the sickly aroma of sugarcane on which the state's economy has been based
since colonial days.
Brazil's notorious income gap - the world's highest - is particularly
shocking in Alagoas where 27 families carve up 40 per cent of state income.
Four fifths of the 2.47m population lack clean water and earn an average
monthly wage of less than Dollars 100 (Pounds 57) per household.
Taking advantage of the population's poverty and lack of education, politics
in Alagoas is conducted on the basest level. Candidates proffer cement, food
parcels, medicines or money in an innovative system known as voto carbono.
Voters must present a carbon copy of their ballot slip to receive their
bribe. In much of the state plantation workers are kept in penury by
plantation bosses who command their votes.
Physical intimidation of candidates is common. Mr Wilson Perpetuo, the state
home secretary, says: 'Alagoas has a tradition of political violence. He who
has had power or lusts after it won't accept someone else having it, and so
shoots him.' The Collor family, it seems, is no exception. Mr Collor's
senator father shot a colleague on the floor of the House (hitting the wrong
man), while his brother-in-law recently took aim at a mayor.
Mr Collor's critics say that his alleged lack of morality and imperial
attitude in his 30 months in office reveal his true colours as a
northeastern aristocrat. One of his own ministers comments: 'His problem is
he took the politics of Alagoas to Braslia.'
Such remarks are provoking mounting tension between north and south,
particularly as the campaign for impeachment has been concentrated in the
south where all the leading newspapers and TV networks are based.
Mr Jose Afanio Godoy, editor of the Journal de Alagoas, complains: 'The
south just couldn't take being governed by a politician from a poor
northeastern state.'
Behind this resentment lies the political over-representation of the small
north and northeastern states and the huge divergence between north and
south economically, a gap heightened by the south's rapid industrialisation
since the 1950s.
While national per capita income is Dollars 2,600, conditions for the 42m
inhabitants of the northeast are among the poorest in the world. Almost half
live below the poverty line. Life expectancy in Alagoas is 19 years less
than in Sao Paulo.
Mr Marcio Porangaba Costa, economics professor at Alagoas University, says
'the northeast is for Brazil what Ethiopia is for the world'.
Yet politically it is the south that feels discriminated against. With a
population of 61m and contributing just 17.9 per cent of GDP, the north and
northeast has 264 senators and congressmen, almost as many as the 289 for
the south and southeast with its far larger population of 84m and 75.9 per
cent of GDP. It takes 10,750 voters to elect a congressman in the northern
state of Roraima compared to 330,000 in the southern state of Sao Paulo.
The blame lies with the military rulers of 1964-85 who, to retain power with
a semblance of electoral legitimacy, increased the representation of small
rural states that could be easily manipul-ated.
Southerners have long been uncomfortable with this situation, pointing out
that without the north, Brazil would be a very rich country. Sao Paulo state
alone has a GDP equal to that of Mexico. However, although Sao Paulo once
attempted segregation, Brazilians generally take pride in the country's
social harmony - remarkable considering its large population and ethnic mix.
But the Collorgate scandal is changing that, centred around a northeastern
president who has challenged southern economic interests by opening up the
Brazilian market. Separatist parties have formed in the south, together with
campaigns to form new southern states to increase political representation.
In Sao Paulo last week Radio Atual, a radio station for the large community
of northeastern migrants, was attacked and 'Get Out Northeastern Rats'
painted over its walls.
Mr Alceu Collares, governor of Rio Grande do Sul, proposes revising the
federal structure. 'Brazil is the only country in the world where minorities
govern,' he complains. But with small states dominating Congress it would be
difficult to muster support among congressmen to change the political
balance.
Moreover, there seems little likelihood of improving the economic balance,
partly because it suits the northeastern elite to have the majority of the
population poor, backward and easy to control. Northeastern presidents such
as Mr Collor and his predecessor Jose Sarney have failed to reduce the gap.
Nor, as state governor from 1986-89, did Mr Collor improve income
distribution within Alagoas.
These days Mr Collor is not popular in Alagoas. Many locals accuse him of
bringing the state's name into disrepute, not least because his presidency
has become known as 'the Republic of Alagoas'.

FT  29 SEP 92 / Perot continues to tease US voters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire who continues to tease the last drop of
suspense out of a bemused public, indicated yesterday morning he might not
announce the next step in his political plans until the end of this week.
He said on breakfast television that the leaders of his volunteers, convened
in Dallas, would yesterday hear presentations from the US presidential
campaigns of Governor Bill Clinton and President George Bush, return home to
report to the state movements, and then tell him what to do.
If the process stayed on schedule, he said, 'it will happen by the end of
the week'. Reiterating his now familiar line, he added: 'I don't make the
decision. The volunteers will make the decision about what they believe is
in the best interests of the country.'
Later in the day, after meeting Mr Clinton's officials, Mr Perot was all
agog. 'It was fascinating. . . It was like standing in front of a firehose
with hard facts and information pouring out,' he said, adding that he had
found much common ground with the Democratic contender's economic programme.
He adopted a similar line after talks with the Bush camp, saying: 'There is
a great deal of overlap.'
Both Mr Bush and Mr Clinton also took to breakfast television programmes
yesterday morning in an orgy of muesli politics, but both confessed they had
no idea if Mr Perot would enter the presidential contest. Mr Bush said his
team would present to Perot supporters a specific plan to lower both taxes
and the federal deficit. Mr Clinton said his delegation would do the same.
Mr Bush argued that the question of taxation would be 'the big difference in
this election'. He is now claiming the Clinton plan would mean higher taxes
on any American earning more than Dollars 36,600 (Pounds 21,800) a year,
well below the Dollars 150,000 threshold (or Dollars 200,000 for a couple)
that Mr Clinton says would be necessary to finance his investment schemes
and provide middle-income tax cuts.
Pressed over whether he would abide by his recent promises not to increase
taxes 'ever, ever,' Mr Bush insisted this was what he meant.
Mr Clinton countered by trying to get more mileage out of Mr Bush's refusal
to engage him in debate. He said 'George Bush is like a kid on a play yard'
saying 'we will do it my way or no way'.
Mr Clinton's lead over Mr Bush has narrowed from 21 percentage points to
nine points, a poll for the ABC News/Washington Post said yesterday, Reuter
reports from Washington. The survey gives Mr Clinton 51 per cent of the vote
and Mr Bush 42 per cent.

FT  29 SEP 92 / Canadians warned over No vote: Economic arguments grow
louder ahead of referendum
</HEADLINE>

FORCES campaigning in support of Canada's proposed new constitution are
warning of the economic cost of a No vote in next month's referendum.
The economic argument has become more vociferous as opinion polls show
increasing support for the No campaigners in Quebec and the western
provinces of British Columbia and Alberta.
According to a poll by Angus Reid Associates, half the voters in the two
western provinces plan to vote No in the October 26 referendum, against 34
per cent who support the new constitutional proposals. In Quebec, opponents
outnumber supporters by 45 per cent to 38 per cent.
Supporters of the deal, including all three main political parties and
premiers of the 10 provinces, are trying to convince voters that the
proposals - though imperfect - offer the best way to preserve national unity
and avoid economic uncertainty. Prime Minister Brian Mulroney has also been
underlining the likely economic cost of a No vote.
Royal Bank of Canada, the country's biggest financial institution, has
painted a bleak picture of a break-up of Canada. The bank estimated in a
detailed study that the growth rate of a fragmented country would average
only 1 per cent a year over the next decade, compared with 3 per cent if the
country stayed intact.
Unemployment by the end of the century would be in the 10-15 per cent range,
against 7-11 per cent in an undivided country. The bank said that
'uncertainty about political and economic changes would greatly reduce the
availability, and increase the cost of, international capital to the
Canadian economy and would undermine domestic investor and consumer
confidence.'
However, opponents of the constitutional deal, known as the Charlottetown
Agreement, contend it will not bring political and economic calm. Led by
Quebec nationalists - and westerners who argue that the deal gives away too
much to the francophone province - they argue that the perennial tensions
between French and English-speaking Canadians will remain unresolved.
A large body of opinion in British Columbia, which has the fastest-growing
population in the country, is especially upset at a provision guaranteeing
Quebec 25 per cent of the seats in the House of Commons. Quebec separatists,
on the other hand, claim the agreement fails to meet the province's demands
for greater autonomy.
Supporters of the deal remain confident of turning the tide of public
opinion before October 26. Their highly organised and strongly financed
campaign will only reach full pitch next week with a TV advertising blitz
and pamphlets sent to every Canadian home.
They are also pinning their hopes on a relatively large proportion of
undecided voters who are said to be susceptible to arguments of the economic
damage which might be caused by rejection of the Charlottetown deal.

A PAKISTANI Airbus A300 crashed yesterday while trying to land at Kathmandu,
Nepal, killing all 148 passengers and 12 crew, four guards and three
engineers.
The Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) aircraft was on a flight from
Karachi to Kathmandu. It lost contact 10 minutes before it was due to land
and crashed 22km from the airport, Pakistani officials said.
The passenger list included at least 34 Britons, 30 Spaniards, 14 Dutch, 10
Italians, two Swiss, two Canadians, one Japanese and three Americans. The
aircraft also carried 30 Nepalese, two Bangladeshis, and 30 Pakistanis.
Pakistani civil aviation staff are due to arrive in Kathmandu today to
investigate.
It was the second Airbus crash near Kathmandu within two months. On July 31,
a Thai Airways A310-300 hit a Himalayan ridge after trying to land at the
airport, killing all 113 people on board.
Kathmandu airport is one of the world's more difficult airports for pilots.
They have to descend steeply to the runway to avoid the surrounding
mountains. The airport has no radar and aircraft are guided in by radio
beacon.
However, Mr Nagendra Prasad Ghimire, deputy chief at the airport, was quoted
as saying that the crash occurred in scattered clouds and moderate winds.
The pilot had given no indication of any problem.
Yesterday's was the A300 model's first fatal accident, although there have
been four previous crashes including a training accident in Egypt and a
runway overshoot in India.
A fifth A300, owned by Iran, was shot down by the USS Vincennes over the
Gulf in 1988, killing 290 people.
The A300, introduced in 1974, was the first aircraft type built by Airbus.
It is a wide-bodied twin-engined aircraft capable of flying up to about
8,000km, the distance from New York to Istanbul.
The crashed PIA model was one of the first built, taking to the air for the
first time in 1976. PIA bought it in 1986.
The design of the A300 bears little resemblance to that of the A320 model
which has crashed three times, including once in France last year, and whose
computerised controls have attracted criticism from some pilots.

FT  29 SEP 92 / Angola's time has come to vote for lasting peace: Today's
elections can only be a success if the loser accepts defeat gracefully
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANGOLANS go to the polls today to elect the first democratic government in
the country's blighted history.
The elections offer Angola's 10.5m people their first opportunity for
lasting peace and democracy in 500 years scarred by the slave trade,
Portuguese colonialism and three decades of civil war. The war, fuelled by
the US, Soviet Union, South Africa and Cuba, cost Angola an estimated
Dollars 30bn (Pounds 17.5bn) in lost economic output and left an
impoverished country with 500,000 people dead, 60,000 amputees mutilated by
land mine explosions, and the roads, railways and communications in tatters.
If the polls go smoothly Angola will also be able to start seriously on
economic reform which could tap the country's mineral and agricultural
resources and turn it into an economic powerhouse of southern Africa.
Success will depend particularly on whether the loser will accept defeat
gracefully or re-ignite the violent tensions between the ruling, former
Marxist, MPLA government and the US- and South African-backed right-wing
Unita.
Already western diplomats in Luanda are talking about the 'Ghost of 1975' -
the year when violent conflict erupted on the once graceful streets of
Luanda before independence from Portugal, and the 350,000 mostly Portuguese
white community evacuated the city and left the country bereft of skilled
personnel.
Elections for the presidency and the 223-member national assembly have come
down to a two-horse race between President Eduardo Dos Santos' MPLA and
Unita, lead by Mr Jonas Savimbi.
Political observers in Luanda say the critical factor to Angola's future is
'The Savimbi question'. If Mr Savimbi, who has spent nearly three decades
fighting a guerrilla offensive in the bush, wins the presidency, will he be
able to change his political personality and rise to the challenge of
national reconciliation? If he is defeated, a scenario he seems unwilling to
countenance, will he claim the elections were rigged and plunge the country
back into violence?
Despite considerable efforts to demobilise the 200,000 soldiers before
election day, both sides have kept back armed forces and secret arms caches
as an insurance policy.
Mr Savimbi in his harsh campaign style has emerged as an aggressive
authoritarian. Widespread human rights allegations made by top-ranking Unita
defectors that Mr Savimbi personally oversaw burnings, killings and torture
of internal dissidents are impossible to verify but have permanently
tarnished his image.
Mr Savimbi's inflammatory campaign rhetoric, his claim that he can lose the
elections only if they are rigged, and his veiled threats against
'half-castes', whites and foreigners, have only served to increase fears
about his post-electoral behaviour, particularly among Angolan intellectuals
and the 40 per cent of the population living in the cities who were under
MPLA control throughout the war.
In private, and among western diplomats, however, Mr Savimbi has shown a
more conciliatory image, and has said he is prepared to accept defeat if the
elections are free and fair and if most of the 4.86m registered voters are
allowed to get to the polling stations.
Both sides are confident of victory, but there are a number of
imponderables.
If the voting goes along tribal lines, as in many other African countries,
Mr Savimbi is likely to win. He would draw support from his Ovimbundu tribe,
which makes up 35 to 45 per cent of the country, and from other smaller
tribes like the Cokwe and Ociwambo. The Mbundu tribe, which solidly supports
the MPLA, makes up only a quarter of the population.
But this tribal cleavage could be complicated by the urban-rural divide,
particularly in the heavily populated towns in the central region like
Huambo, Benguela, Lobito and Cuito. If tribal loyalties are not as strong as
expected, many urban people including the Ovimbundu, who have lived under
the MPLA throughout the war, could vote for the MPLA despite its poor
record.
The war fatigue of the population and the positive role in the transition of
the United Nations and international donors have brought Angola through 16
difficult months to today's vote.
Western diplomats point out that if the elections are free and fair, a
defeated party which is inclined not to accept the result should know that
in the post-cold war era, the international community will no longer fund a
civil war, and that without foreign donors rehabilitation of the economy
will be impossible.

FT  29 SEP 92 / Bombay scandal 'cost Rs5bn'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By R C MURTHY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE net loss to the Indian banking system from the Bombay securities scandal
is expected to be about Rs5bn (Pounds 103.5m), according to Mr S.
Venkitaramanan, governor of Reserve Bank of India, the central bank.
The scandal involved some Rs35bn of fraudulent dealings but Mr
Venkitaramanan's new estimate is for money which, after investigations and
legal proceedings, will prove irrecoverable.
Standard Chartered of the UK, the worst-hit foreign bank, has provided
Pounds 100m against potential losses from the scandal.
Mr Venkitaramanan, speaking in New York after attending the International
Monetary Fund annual meeting, also said financial sector reform was being
resumed after being delayed by the scandal, which surfaced in April.
The Indian authorities have announced a decision in principle to allow the
Indian private sector to enter commercial banking, the central bank governor
said. Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, has asked for a Dollars 500m
loan from the World Bank to back financial sector reforms this year, to be
used partly to help set up an asset reconstruction fund for banks saddled
with bad debts on their balance sheets.
The Asian Development Bank plans a Dollars 400m loan to help meet an 8 per
cent capital adequacy requirement imposed on banks by the Reserve Bank.
It also emerged in Washington that the government has asked the IMF for a
Dollars 5bn extended fund facility to replace the present standby
arrangement, which runs out in April.
The new three-year facility would include the Dollars 1.2bn unused portion
of the existing Dollars 2.2bn standby, and an enhanced structural adjustment
facility bearing lower interest rates.

FT  29 SEP 92 / Banks close to deal on property bad debts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING Japanese banks are close to agreeing their first concerted action to
deal with their huge property-related bad debts.
These debts, caused by the steep fall in property prices over the past two
years, could handicap the banking industry for several years.
The banks plan to set up a joint body which would purchase from them
property used as collateral for non-performing loans.
It is understood the banks reached an outline agreement yesterday on the
structure of a joint company. Mitsubishi Bank is believed to have played a
leading role in the talks, and the Bank of Japan has been kept fully
abreast.
Official estimates have put bad debts at about Y7,000bn to Y8,000bn (Pounds
33.8bn-Pounds 38.6bn). However, revised figures, due for release by
mid-October, are likely to show a sharp rise, and banking industry
executives admit privately that bad debts may amount to between Y30,000bn
and Y60,000bn.
The possibility of the banks receiving government help has met with heavy
criticism in the popular press. A joint organisation in which the banks are
seen to be taking the lead in sorting out their problems is widely seen as a
pre-condition for any tax concessions to ease the bad debt burden.
The proposed joint body would play a vital role in establishing the extent
of bad debts and thus helping the banks to cleanse their balance sheets. As
the property market is so sluggish, many banks have been unable to sell
their holdings and establish the scale of their losses.
Banks would jointly finance the company, which they would own in proportion
to the extent of their bad debts. It would initially purchase relatively
marketable property used as collateral on non-performing loans at a price
set by independent assessors. The joint company would then be responsible
for eventually selling the land in the open market.
In addition the company would be allowed to buy and sell claims on loans
which have real estate as collateral.
Meanwhile, the government yesterday began transferring public funds into
bodies which will invest in the stock market through trust banks to help
underpin share prices.
The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications trans-ferred Y1,000bn into the
Postal Life Insurance Welfare Corporation. Disappointment that more public
money has not yet flowed into the stock market helped to push the Nikkei
average below 18,000 yesterday. The stock market has rallied strongly since
the government announced an emergency economic package in late August.
The package, which is due to be approved by the Diet later in the autumn,
increases the ceiling on public investment via trust banks from Y1,700bn to
nearly Y2,800bn.

FT  29 SEP 92 / Japanese fear rising yen will hurt exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE exporters could be badly hurt by the yen's recent rapid rise, Mr
Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Keidanren, the country's federation of
economic organisations, warned yesterday after the dollar had slid to a
record post-war low of Y119.65 at its close in Tokyo.
Mr Hiraiwa said the break-even point for most Japanese companies was a
dollar exchange rate of Y120. Manufacturers could cope with a slow
appreciation against the dollar but the government would need to take
emergency measures to protect them against a rapid rise in the yen, he said.
Mr Hiraiwa was reflecting growing concern that the yen's rapid appreciation
could dampen exports, which are one of the few sources of growth in a
largely stagnant economy.
The yen has strengthened markedly over the past week as investors have
sought a safe haven from the turmoil in European currency markets. The
dollar was also hit by worries that US employment data due to be published
later this week will show the economy is still mired in recession.
Government officials meanwhile sent apparently conflicting signals about the
authorities' stance. A senior official at the Ministry of Finance hinted
that intervention to stem the yen's rise was becoming more likely.
However, Mr Yuji Tanahashi, vice minister at the Ministry of International
Trade and Industry (Miti), said most Japanese companies could cope with a
stronger yen, which could help to curb Japan's growing trade surplus.
Most private-sector analysts believe a further cut in interest rates is
unlikely because the government would not resist a gradual appreciation of
the yen to about Y115 to the dollar. However it is thought the authorities
would intervene to slow the rate of the yen's appreciation.
Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, underlined this stance yesterday by
stressing that the yen's level should be set by market forces. He indicated
that the authorities' main concern was that the currency should move
smoothly to a new exchange rate.
The depressed state of the domestic economy was highlighted by Miti figures
showing large retailers' sales fell by 2 per cent last month compared with
1991. Most significantly, supermarket sales have started to fall, by 0.4 per
cent last month, suggesting that consumers are starting to cut back on
everyday purchases of food and clothing as well as luxury goods.
Sales at department stores fell by 3.8 per cent, the sixth successive month
in which they have declined. Sales at small local shops, which is where most
daily shopping for food and other necessities is done, are relatively
robust, Miti said.
The ministry's forecasts for steel output suggest there is little prospect
of the downturn in manufacturing abating this year, with crude steel
production expected to drop by 4.3 per cent in the three months to December,
which would be the sixth consecutive quarterly fall in steel output.

FT  29 SEP 92 / Syria sees no change in Israeli stance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS, UN Correspondent and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE LATEST round of Middle East peace talks in Washington failed because the
new Israeli government was no different from its predecessor on the issue of
withdrawing from occupied lands, Syria charged at the United Nations
yesterday.
Mr Farouk al-Shara, the Syrian foreign minister, asserted that the claim by
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's Labour prime minister, to have changed policies
and priorities 'lacks until now credibility in actual application'.
He repeated that a settlement must be based on the inevitability of Israeli
withdrawal from all occupied territories, including the Golan Heights, and
'the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people'.
Anyone in Israel who believed total peace could be achieved without this or
that saturating the country with a sophisticated military arsenal could
guarantee security was gravely mistaken. 'Any manoeuvre for partial
withdrawal or intermediate steps will not bring peace either to the region
or to Israel itself.'
Referring to Israeli calls for talks at a higher level than those held so
far, Mr al-Shara described it as an attempt to undermine the framework and
mechanism agreed at the Madrid peace conference last year which began the
latest peace process.
He reaffirmed that Syria wanted an honourable peace, but this must mean that
'no grain of sand of our land is lost and no concession of any of our rights
is made'. Reuter adds from Jerusalem: Earlier yesterday Mr Rabin said peace
between the two countries was in the hands of Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad. He told Israel Radio that Syria had to agree to talks at the
highest level but said an imminent summit was unlikely.

FT  29 SEP 92 / Donations trial ruled out for Kanemaru
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE prosecutors yesterday formally indicted Mr Shin Kanemaru, the power
broker of the ruling Liberal Democratic party, for violating a law on
political donations, but said he would be summarily fined and not face
trial.
The prosecutors' decision and their stated intention to halt investigations
into other politicians for similar violations have provoked widespread
disgust, prompting LDP officials to suggest that a parliamentary committee
may be set up to study the scandal.
Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, head of the Keidanren, the country's main business
federation, said an 'extremely large gap' existed between the ethics of
politicians and ordinary people. He added: 'We've reached the stage when an
immediate overhaul of the political system is essential.'
Mr Kanemaru, 78, has admitted receiving Y500m (Pounds 2.4m) from a parcel
delivery company, Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin, far exceeding the Y1.5m limit set by
the Political Funds Control Law. Under that law, he is subject to a maximum
fine of Y200,000, and prosecutors said the fine would be imposed without
requiring him to face the embarrassment of a trial.
Meanwhile Mr Kiyoshi Kaneko, 60, a former provincial governor, will face a
trial after being indicted yesterday for having received Y100m from Tokyo
Sagawa. He was charged with falsely reporting a donation, a charge carrying
a maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment or a Y300,000 fine.
The contrasting treatment of the two politicians has rekindled public debate
over the need for political reform, as has the suggestion that the
investigation is over, even though a dozen senior LDP officials are reported
to have received Sagawa money.
It is generally perceived that Mr Kanemaru received more lenient treatment
after negotiations between senior members of his faction and the
prosecutors. However, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, yesterday
insisted that the prosecutors had been 'impartial'.
Doubts over Mr Kanemaru's political future have prompted a power struggle
within his faction, the LDP's largest. It appears most faction members want
the 'godfather', as he is known, to remain in control, but continued public
outcry would diminish his standing and may prompt him to resign before the
next election.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'I FELT happy watching him burn,' Mr George Skosana said on his release from
prison, one of 154 South African political prisoners freed over the past
four days in what the government says is an attempt to foster
reconciliation.
Mr Skosana was recounting the crime for which he was sentenced to death in
1987: the burning alive of a police informer in Pretoria in 1986. He says he
would do it all again, as part of the struggle for political freedom in
South Africa.
Chilling comments such as these from 29-year-old Mr Skosana highlight the
political sensitivity of the prisoner release programme, agreed at the
weekend between President F W de Klerk and Mr Nelson Mandela, president of
the African National Congress (ANC). Under the agreement, 150 ANC political
prisoners have already been freed, with a further three - the most
celebrated among them - released on parole yesterday.
Between them, they have committed some of the most frightening political
crimes in South African history, including the car bombing of a Durban
beach-front bar in which three white women died. The bomber, Mr Robert
McBride, left prison yesterday pledging to work for reconciliation - but
noting that he would take up arms again 'if the situation becomes the same
as in 1985,' when the ANC was banned and its activists ruthlessly hunted
down by police.
Mr McBride often made clear before his release that he regretted the deaths
caused by his action. In a memo written in prison, he talks of his remorse:
'I personally will live for the rest of my life with the memories of those
who died. . .I can never expect the families of those who died to forget,
nor can I expect them to welcome my release. But reconciliation is not about
forgetting our pain, it is about forgiving.'
His release has provoked numerous phone complaints to the Department of
Correctional Services, and radio talk shows in the days leading up to his
release carried calls from many whites angry at his release.
But far more furore appears to have been generated by the release yesterday
of Mr Barend Strydom, nicknamed 'white wolf', the only right wing prisoner
to have been freed so far. He is a self-confessed racist who killed seven
blacks in a shooting spree on Pretoria in 1988, as part of the right wing's
'third freedom struggle'.
Mr Strydom's crime gained notoriety, quite apart from its brutality, because
he smiled while carrying it out. He told the court during his trial: 'During
the shooting, the wounded did not appear to realise the gravity of the
situation. I smiled. I see myself as a friendly person. It was difficult to
suppress my laughter. I smiled and carried on.'
Even more controversial will be government plans to grant amnesty to serving
security force officers who have never been charged but who are believed to
have committed politically motivated crimes. The ANC argues that this must
be done by a multi-party interim government.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE YUGOSLAV federal authorities and Croatia agreed yesterday to hold
top-level peace talks in Geneva, but the war in Bosnia raged on, dramatised
by a bomb attack on a funeral in Sarajevo.
The international mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, visiting Belgrade
for talks with Yugoslav and Serbian leaders, announced that the presidents
of Yugoslavia and Croatia had accepted an invitation to open peace talks in
the Swiss city tomorrow.
President Dobrica Cosic of Yugoslavia and the Croatian president, Mr Franjo
Tudjman, are to try to reach agreement on the demilitarisation of Prevlaka,
a key peninsula on Croatia's southern Adriatic coastline, the mediators
said.
Mr Vance and Lord Owen, the co-chairmen of the peace process, were on their
first visit to Belgrade since Yugoslavia's virtual exclusion from the United
Nations last week.
Lord Owen, the European Community envoy, said that 'significant progress'
had been made on various issues including the opening of Prevlaka and key
roads in Croatia.
An accord on Prevlaka, currently under the control of the Yugoslav army,
would unblock access to Dubrovnik, the Croatian port. He said Yugoslav
officials had agreed on the 'desirability of soon opening' the
Belgrade-Zagreb motorway, closed since last August.
Meanwhile, three people were killed and more than 20 injured when a shell
hit a cemetery during a funeral in Sarajevo, Bosnian radio said.
The radio blamed Serb irregulars for firing the shell but there was no proof
of who was responsible. Doctors at the city's French hospital confirmed
casualty figures and said many of those wounded were in a serious condition.
The US said yesterday it had new witnesses to corroborate reports that as
many as 3,000 Bosnian Moslems were executed at Serbian-run detention camps
near the town of Brcko last May-June, Reuter reports from Washington.
'Until recently, nearly all of the reports alleging large scale murders have
either come to us second hand, or have contained elements that raise
questions about their credibility,' State Department spokesman Richard
Boucher said.
But he said the department had recently received two accounts from former
prisoners in a brick factory who said they had witnessed the murders and
estimated as many as 3,000 were killed. He said some of the dead were later
cremated in an animal slaughterhouse.

<TEXT>
ROMANIA'S democratic opposition parties, shocked by the strong showing of
former communists and hardline nationalists at the weekend elections,
yesterday pledged to intensify the political struggle before presidential
run-off elections on October 11.
Mr Emil Constantinescu, presidential candidate for the 18-party Democratic
Convention (DC), who will oppose President Ion Iliescu in the run-off, said
that Romania now more than ever needed a strong president who would respect
the law, unite the country and restore Romania's tarnished image abroad.
He warned that exit polls indicated that extremist parties, such as the
Socialist Labour party and Romania Mare, the Greater Romania party, an
openly anti-Semitic and xenophobic organisation, could find a place in a
governing coalition alongside the Democratic National Salvation Front, which
supports Mr Iliescu. The DNSS, staffed largely by former communists and
ex-secret policemen, retains widespread support in working class and rural
areas and looks set to emerge as the largest party in parliament.
Official results in the parliamentary elections and the first round of
presidential voting are not expected until later this week.
But partial official results last night indicated Mr Iliescu was leading
with 46.5 per cent against 30.9 per cent for Mr Constantinescu.
Mr Ion Raciu, vice-president of the National Peasants party, the dominant
force behind the fractious DC, said yesterday that Mr Constantinescu, a
hitherto little-known academic and ex-communist party member, had faced 'an
impossible task'.
Teenage pop hysteria came to Romania yesterday as fans of American star
Michael Jackson greeted him with tears and shrieks when he flew to Bucharest
aboard a private jet for a charity concert, Reuter reports from Bucharest.
The Jackson concert has sparked more excitement among the young than
Sunday's elections.

Turkey yesterday attacked the major powers and the international community
as a whole for their failure to use military force to counter 'the Serbian
aggression' in Bosnia, writes Robert Mauthner in New York.
Mr Hikmet Cetin, the Turkish foreign minister, told a news conference during
a meeting of the UN General Assembly that his government was becoming
'increasingly discouraged' by the ineffectiveness of UN and EC efforts to
stop the slaughter of Bosnian Moslems. In a reference to the extreme
reluctance of the US and other members of the Security Council to
contemplate the use of military force in Bosnia, Mr Cetin said this was a
serious mistake.

FT  29 SEP 92 / Study points to high cost of new cars in EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN car buyers are paying as much as 30 per cent more for new cars than
consumers in the US and in Japan, according to a study by Ludvigsen
Associates, the UK-based automotive analysts.
Ludvigsen Associates, which carried out the controversial basic research for
the UK Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry into pan-European car
pricing, claims that 'the European car buyer is spending more than he should
for personal transportation', both in absolute terms and in relation to
household income.
The report is the first co-ordinated attempt to compare car prices between
Europe and the other main world markets, the US and Japan.
According to the study, the largest differences are with car prices in
Japan. It claims that European car prices (net of tax) are 33 to 43 per cent
higher than equivalent prices in Japan, while European prices are 15 to 45
per cent higher than in the US.
On average it takes 27 weeks of gross family income for a European to buy a
car compared with 21 weeks in America and 15 weeks in Japan. The UK is at
the European average, while the Germans, French and Belgians need four weeks
less.
The Ludvigsen report is likely to re-ignite the vexed debate over car
makers' pan-European pricing policies and the wide disparities between car
prices across the European Community, following earlier studies this year
published by both the MMC and the European Commission's competition
directorate.
The Ludvigsen report claims that inefficiencies in the European motor
industry are one of the factors behind much higher prices in Europe than
Japan or the US.
'Judged by hours required to assemble a car, the Europeans attain less than
half the productivity of the Japanese and little more than two-thirds that
of the American domestic producers.' According to an analysis of both
efficiency and labour rates, America's per-car production costs are Ecu135
(Pounds 105) higher than Japan's while Europe's are Ecu220 higher.
The Ludvigsen report, which is likely to be fiercely contested by car makers
in Europe, concludes that European car plants employ close to 150,000 more
assembly workers than they would if average Japanese standards were
maintained. It claims that this is equivalent to a surplus staffing level in
Europe of at least 17 per cent.
While European consumers pay over the odds for new cars compared with
Japanese and American car buyers, Ludvigsen claims that new research
confirms that large price differences remain within Europe.
In Denmark, transaction prices, excluding taxes but taking into account
typical dealer discounts, are 65 per cent of those in the UK. In Belgium
they are 80 per cent of the British level, in Germany 89 per cent, in France
93 per cent and in Spain 94 per cent.
The report claims to have unearthed 'startling' findings about disparities
in wholesale car prices, the prices at which cars are sold by the car makers
to their dealers.
It urges Europe's car price watchdogs to investigate wholesale car prices as
well as retail prices and claims that 'private buyers in continental
markets, paying list prices, pay less for their cars than do British dealers
buying their cars from the factory.'

FT  29 SEP 92 / Germany cancels ceremony for V-2: Bonn bows to pressure on
commemoration of Hitler's ballistic missile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY yesterday bowed to foreign and domestic pressure by cancelling this
weekend's ceremony commemorating the first wartime launch of the V-2
ballistic missile.
The decision by the German aerospace industry federation came shortly after
Mr Erich Riedl, parliamentary state secretary in the Bonn economics
ministry, withdrew his official support for the event.
The climbdown followed several days of criticism in Britain and in Germany
about the planned ceremony marking the 50th anniversary of the rocket's
first launching on Peenemunde on the Baltic coast.
The industry federation said: 'The planned scientific-technical celebration
to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the birth of space travel on October
3 will not take place.'
The V-2, one of the 'wonder weapons' with which Hitler hoped to win the
Second World War, was the forerunner of modern space rockets and long-range
military missiles.
Earlier yesterday, Mr Riedl was criticised by Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the
economics minister, for his decision to hold the keynote speech at the site
of the Peenemunde base. Critics in Britain - the target, along with Belgium,
of most V-2 firings in 1944-45 - charged that the ceremony would
unnecessarily resurrect war memories. Publicity given to the commemoration
has added to Anglo-German ill-feeling, already stirred by the bitterness
over Britain's ignominious exit from the exchange rate mechanism a fortnight
ago. Britain's tabloid and broadsheet press has given the story of the
planned V-2 ceremony great prominence during the last few days.
The event also drew fire from several Bonn cabinet ministers and opposition
politicians.
A spokeswoman for a museum in Nordhausen, east Germany, commemorating
concentration camp prisoners who died helping to assemble the weapons,
yesterday condemned the ceremony.
The spokeswoman said that the proposed event had shown a 'lack of piety
towards thousands of victims.'
Before they were forced to retreat from their association with the event,
the German aerospace sector and Mr Riedl himself tried to portray the
October 3 ceremony purely as a celebration of technical achievement.
The most famous of the Peenemunde workers was the base's second-in-command
Wernher von Braun.
He went on to become the chief rocket designer for the US National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) after it was formed in 1958.
Between September 1944 and March 1945, 1,115 V-2 rockets hit Britain, of
which 518 fell on London, causing 9,000 casualties.
Antwerp, the rocket's other main target, received 1,341 rockets and suffered
30,000 casualties.

FT  29 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Delors argues for bigger payments to
budget
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE competitiveness of EC industry could be damaged if member states' budget
contributions are frozen, Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president,
warned yesterday.
EC officials claimed that the crisis in other areas of Community policy had
not affected discussions on the 'Delors II' package, covering Community
spending from 1993 to 1997. But the budget question at yesterday's meeting
of EC finance ministers was greatly overshadowed by the anguished debate on
the future of the European monetary system.
Mr Delors told the ministers that capping contributions at 1.2 per cent of
GNP was bound to hit spending on training, research and development, and
EC-wide telecoms, road and rail networks. The Commission wants to raise
contributions to the 1993-97 budget to 1.37 per cent of GNP.
Britain, which holds the EC presidency, claimed in a paper presented to
ministers that if contributions were held at 1.2 per cent the EC's resources
for 1997 would increase by Ecu15bn (Pounds 11.7bn) from Ecu66.6bn this year.
But the Commission argued that Britain had included in its calculations
agricultural surpluses which could not be redistributed to other areas of EC
policy. The calculation was also based on annualised growth projections of
2.5 per cent, which now look unrealistic. According to Brussels, the
increase would be Ecu11bn in 1997 - not enough to cover the Commission's
plans for spending on so-called 'internal policies'.
Yesterday's meeting was the last chance for finance ministers to state their
position on the proposed budget before serious negotiations begin. Since
July, national officials have been discussing an 85-point British
questionnaire on the budget plans. Foreign ministers will take up the debate
at their meeting next Monday.
Several states, including Belgium, Germany and France, took the opportunity
to argue for a new political discussion of the long-standing British budget
rebate.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Maastricht treaty on European economic and monetary union should be
dropped in favour of a more limited agreement on a new European central
bank, according to the former president of the Bundesbank.
This would have two big advantages, Mr Karl Otto Pohl, told Der Spiegel
magazine. It would enable the Danes, mostly concerned about their social
security system, to vote Yes. It would also mean Europe would not have to
wait until 1997 or 1999 for a central bank and joint currency.
Mr Pohl said European monetary union and a new central bank could be set up
without political union, as long as the bank's main priority was price
stability. Asked if Italy and the UK could be members, he said no country
should be excluded but 'very strict entry criteria' would have to be
fulfilled.
'The French and Germans must now show joint leadership. Both could in a
short time establish a central bank, which the Dutch, Belgians,
Luxembourgeois and Danes could join. As soon as other EC countries are in a
position to subject themselves to the discipline of such a system, they
should also take part.'
A majority of Danish voters would consider voting Yes in a second referendum
on Maastricht if special arrangements are made to exempt Denmark from some
treaty obligations, Hilary Barnes reports from Copenhagen. A Gallup poll
published yesterday said 64 per cent of those questioned would consider
voting Yes if there was an exemption from participating in a common European
defence policy, a common currency and European citizenship.

FT  29 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: French franc pays price for
partnership with D-Mark - William Dawkins considers why the currency has
come under such pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRANC'S elevation in recent years to the position of junior partner to
the D-Mark is ironically one reason why the French currency has come under
such pressure in recent weeks.
The structure of the market in francs and franc-denominated bonds, notes and
equities shows why it has suffered more from fears about the stability of
the European monetary system than from doubts about the health of the French
economy.
Foreign investors have come to use the franc in recent years as 'a proxy for
the D-Mark', in the words of one US banker. So, selling francs is clearly a
rational step for investors worried that the franc/D-Mark parity might break
in a general collapse of the EMS. Market estimates have it that between
FFr50bn (Pounds 5.7bn) and FFr100bn (Pounds 11.4bn) has been dumped in the
past fortnight on the Bank of France, which may have used up all the FFr97bn
of currency reserves it held at the end of August.
Investment demand for francs and French capital instruments has expanded
sharply in the past five years or so, thanks to the internationalisation of
French finance and industry and success in curbing inflation and the budget
deficit.
Broadly, the main franc investors fall into three categories, explains Mr
Christopher Potts, senior economist at Banque Indosuez. First, there are
other central banks, commercial banks and intermediaries; then corporate
investors which buy and sell francs to cover business in the French
currency; and finally international funds, which hold equities and bonds in
francs.
'All of them have made substantial profits in recent years on the rise of
the franc and other European currencies. Now they feel the tide has turned,'
he says.
The signs are that all three kinds of investor have been heavy sellers of
francs. A leading US commercial bank reports selling from Scandinavian
central banks, which held francs in their reserves and needed to liquidate
some of their portfolios to buy their own currencies. Understand-ably, they
sold their riskiest holdings first, says the US banker.
But the biggest pressure on the franc has probably come from the
international funds, especially Japanese ones, Mr Potts believes. They have
held on to their underlying franc-denominated investments through the
crisis. But they have hedged on the French currency - buying and selling the
franc in forward markets - to make enough dealing profits to cover the loss
in value of their underlying investments.
Typically, Japanese and some other foreign funds used to hedge 40-50 per
cent of their franc-denominated investments and accept the exchange rate
risk on the rest, estimates Mr Potts. In recent weeks, he estimates that
they increased that proportion to 70 per cent. 'If your hedging ratio goes
up like that over one month, that means huge flows out of the franc,' says
Mr Potts.
The market for francs used to be less liquid than for other currencies, but
dealers in Paris reckon that over the past five to seven years it has become
as easy to buy and sell francs as any leading currency in any time zone. The
Bank of France has built up a sophisticated network of correspondent banks,
which trade on its behalf, and includes other central banks, highly rated US
and European commercial banks and leading French banks, both state-owned and
in the private sector.
The French central bank cannot, by contrast, lean on the powerful
state-owned banks to help it support the franc. It does not have the legal
means to do so, since France scrapped foreign exchange controls two years
ago and French banks are only allowed to hold a limited proportion of their
funds in a single currency.
However, French commercial banks are said to have an informal accord under
which they quote unattractive prices on French bonds and currency to US
banks.
Certainly the biggest French banks would not like to be caught speculating
hard against the franc. This applies just as much to state-owned as to
private-sector banks, since both are largely run by former Treasury
officials and maintain close communications with the Treasury and the
central bank.
Mr Dominique Hoenn, head of market operations at private sector Paribas,
says: 'There is no difference between the nationalised banks and us.
Probably they have not speculated much against the franc and certainly
neither have we because we believe in its value.'
The same applies to commercial interest rates. French base rates reflect
market conditions just as much as in any leading economy, but the timing of
any rate change is the result of close concertation between the banking
system and the government.
Says Mr Potts: 'There is very close co-operation on the timing of rate
changes. Unless they all agree on a move, it won't happen.'
An example is the fact that base rates have stayed unchanged since last
week's increase in the Bank of France's 5-10 day repurchase rate, the
interest rate for borrowers of last resort. So the clear understanding
between the state and the banks has helped the authorities, in defending the
currency, to hold off any damage to the domestic economy.
But for how long? Overnight money market rates - set by the market alone -
shot up during the past week to between 21 and 26 per cent, more than twice
their normal levels, in response to rise in the central bank's repurchase
rate. Unless the cost of overnight borrowing drifts back again towards
normal soon, French banks will require a base rate rise to stem their
losses.

rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN'S central bank cut its marginal overnight lending rate to commercial
banks from 50 per cent to 40 per cent yesterday in a cautious adjustment
towards a 'more normal interest rate level'.
It said the reduction had been made possible by declining turbulence on the
international foreign exchange markets and a drop in Sweden's money market
interest rates.
But Svenska Handelsbanken, a leading commercial bank, warned yesterday in
its latest economic forecast that for at least the next six months interest
rates would remain above the levels existing before the financial crisis
began.
However, it suggested a Swedish export recovery would strengthen overseas
market confidence in the country's fixed exchange rate policy and the
interest rate differential rate between Sweden and Germany would narrow.
It predicts a further drop of 0.4 per cent in GNP next year after an
estimated decline of 1.7 per cent this year. The forecast shows only a
modest 1.5 per cent recovery in 1994.
It also predicts a sizeable decline in property investment of 46.5 per cent,
but a strong recovery in the trade balance and the balance of payments.
Swedes, however, will see real incomes fall next year by 1.9 per cent, with
only a 0.7 per cent improvement in 1994.

FT  29 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Bundesbank acts to curb money supply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank acted again yesterday to drain funds from the money market
and prevent a further ballooning of the money supply in the wake of the
heavy intervention on currency markets in recent weeks.
This week's round of securities repurchase agreements (repos), totalling
DM28bn, (Pounds 11bn) would be cancelled, it said. Last week's DM20bn
transaction also did not take place. Commercial banks use repos as a form of
refinancing.
The German central bank also made use yesterday of Treasury bill offers and
currency repos to banks for the seventh day running. They were issued at 8.8
per cent to run for three days.
Altogether, dealers estimated, the Bundesbank has now drained at least
DM65bn from the money market, including the latest cancelled repo, with a
remaining overhang of liquidity of between DM70bn and DM100bn.
Further liquidity draining operations were thus likely to occur in coming
days, they added. This could mean that the DM16bn repo due next week could
also be cancelled.
While the Bundesbank is concerned that the growth rate of M3, the broad
monetary aggregate - already running well above its target range this year -
should not be accelerated by the effect of the massive currency
intervention, some economists think it could act more vigorously to remove
liquidity.
'They have a lot of scope to compensate any short-term oversupply of central
bank money supply', said Mr Peter Bofinger, economics professor at Wurzburg
university.
'They can absorb a huge amount of liquidity at very short notice.'
He said the central bank should go more on the offensive and show its
strength in the international foreign exchange and money markets.
It is the rapid growth in M3, at a higher than expected annualised rate of 9
per cent in August against a 1992 target range of between 3.5 and 5.5 per
cent, that mainly lies behind the Bundesbank's determination to keep
interest rates high.
Last week economists forecast that an annualised expansion rate of more than
10 per cent could be recorded for M3 this month because of the liquidity
created by unprecedented D-Mark central bank sales throughout Europe in
recent weeks.
The Bundesbank cut interest rates two weeks ago as part of the lira
devaluation package in the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM). But many
German economists reckon it will now keep the Lombard rate at 9.5 per cent
and the discount rate at 8.25 per cent.
There has been speculation of further cuts on Friday when the Bundesbank
holds its next council meeting - outside Frankfurt in Schwerin in the east
German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
But several economists said they expected no more reductions yet. Economists
from Dresdner Bank, Nomura Research, and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said the
Bundesbank would concentrate on trying to bring the money supply into line
and thus dampen inflationary tendencies.

A MAJORITY of Danish voters would consider voting Yes in a second referendum
on the Maastricht treaty next year if special arrangements are made to
exempt Denmark from some treaty obligations.
A Gallup poll published yesterday said 64 per cent of those questioned would
consider voting Yes under these circumstances and only 16 per cent would
vote No.
In a referendum in June 50.7 per cent of voters rejected ratification of the
treaty, while 49.3 per cent voted in favour.
An agreement giving special exemptions to Denmark from participating in a
common European defence policy, or introducing a common currency and
European citizenship is under discussion between the minority government and
other parties in the Folketing.
An official Danish proposal to the other 11 members of the EC is expected in
late November in time for the Danish issue to be discussed at the European
Community heads of government meeting in Edinburgh in December.
The Gallup poll results indicate that voters have not regretted the outcome
of the referendum in June. If there are no concessions some 90 per cent of
those who voted No would do so again, while only 83 per cent of those who
voted Yes would do so.

FT  29 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Ireland forced into sharp base rate
rise - Weak sterling undermines the Irish punt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Irish Central Bank yesterday raised its base rate by 3 percentage points
to 13.75 percent, as sterling's weakness continued to undermine the punt on
the foreign exchange markets and the Irish government reaffirmed its
determination to keep the punt aligned with the German mark.
The rise in the central bank's key short term facility was triggered by a
dramatic surge in short-term money market rates in Dublin to between 20 and
25 per cent at the end of last week, as speculative pressures drained
liquidity from the market.
Mr Brendan Lynch, the chief economist at Bloxham stockbrokers in Dublin,
said: 'Almost everybody from individuals to companies trading in the UK
market have been putting their money into sterling in the expectation of a
devaluation (of the punt).'
Mr Bertie Ahern, the Irish finance minister, said yesterday, however: 'It is
clearly in the overall national interest that we continue with our existing
exchange rate policy of maintaining the current parities of the Irish pound
within the narrow band of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism.'
He said low inflation (an annual 2.8 per cent in August), a healthy balance
of payments surplus on the current account (around 7 per cent of GNP),
public spending under control, and rising manufacturing output and exports
precluded the need for a devaluation.
Business and opposition political leaders were quick to throw their support
behind Mr Ahern's defence of the punt yesterday. Mr Ruari Quinn, the economy
spokesman for the opposition Labour party said: 'We are between a rock and
hard place. We have a large residual dependency on the UK economy, but if we
follow sterling down it would be like swimming towards the Titanic.'
About 31 per cent of Ireland's exports are destined for the UK, and some 40
per cent of its imports come from Britain. Exporters, especially those
working on tight margins in the food industry, are therefore being squeezed,
while their own domestic market faces stiffer competition from UK imports.
Yesterday's interest rate rise, now signifies a real interest rate of almost
11 per cent, allowing for a 2.8 per cent inflation rate, adding further
pressure on profits.
Business leaders were already warning last week that promised pay awards
over the next two years under the tripartite programme for social and
economic progress, would now have to be renegotiated, a proposal immediately
ruled out by Mr Peter Cassells, head of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions
(ICTU).
Retail banks and building societies are expected to pass on the interest
rate increase in the coming days, which will have a big impact on personal
disposable incomes. Eight out of ten householders in Ireland own their own
homes.
Mr Michael Green, head of the Construction Industry Federation, warned
yesterday that the housing market and construction industry could face major
cuts if interest rates could not be reduced again soon.
Mr Ahern said he was 'confident that these increases will be for a short
period only and that a return to lower interest rates will be possible when
the markets settle down again'.
A key weapon in the government's defence of the punt in the past fortnight
has been its remaining exchange controls, which limited the availability of
funds to speculators in offshore markets. These controls are due to be
dismantled, however, by the end of the year, leaving the punt as exposed as
the other currencies have been hitherto in the ERM. Even with the controls
in place, it is estimated that central bank reserves, which stood at IPounds
3.03bn at the end of July, have shrunk by more than 50 per cent.
The government will also face increased exchequer borrowing costs, as its
floating rate notes and gilt issues mature. It is estimated that of the
IPounds 4bn in Irish gilts held by non-residents, some IPounds 500m have
been sold since the ERM crisis began. The government will be under pressure
to keep interest rates high, to underpin its securities and to roll over
maturing gilts.
The credibility of the government's economic policy is thus facing its
severest test since the punt joined the ERM in 1979. There will be no
relegation for Ireland to a 'second division' EC according to Irish
ministers. The question is whether the markets believe that is now feasible.

ONLY 19 per cent of Belgians have confidence in the government, compared
with 35 per cent in June, according to an opinion poll published yesterday,
Reuters reports from Brussels.
Publication of the poll coincided with last-ditch talks yesterday by
Belgium's shaky centre-left coalition government to avert a crisis over the
1993 budget and national reforms which could force new elections.
After a weekend of talks failed to produce an agreement, Mr Jean-Luc
Dehaene, prime minister, is staking the government's survival on getting a
deal this week to rein in heavy public spending and on reforms giving more
autonomy to French-speaking Wallonia and Dutch-speaking Flanders.
The main party in the coalition, Mr Dehaene's Flemish Christian Democrats
(CVP), says the budget and state reforms have to be sorted out before its
annual congress next weekend. If there is no deal by then, political
analysts say the CVP's position in the coalition would be threatened.

FT  29 SEP 92 / UK retreats over demands for reform of ERM: Qualified
apology for criticism of Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN was last night retreating from its demands for an overhaul of the
European exchange rate mechanism after a barrage of criticism from its
European partners.
At a meeting of European finance ministers in Brussels, Mr Norman Lamont,
the chancellor, softened earlier charges that 'fault-lines' in the ERM
forced sterling and the Italian lira to withdraw from the system.
Mr Lamont's retreat headed off the threat of British isolation on the ERM
issue. Instead, EC ministers chose to emphasise a new consensus based on the
need for early ratification of the Maastricht treaty, without renegotiation,
and adherence to the strict economic convergence criteria as a pre-condition
for joining a future European economic and monetary union (Emu).
In a four-point communique, ministers also stressed their opposition to a
two-speed Europe with France and Germany leading a group of core currencies
into a monetary union. The aim was for all 12 members to proceed together.
Mr Lamont gave a qualified apology for recent criticism of Germany and the
Bundesbank in certain sections of the British press, saying he was 'sorry'
if it had given offence but 'very frank' exchanges were sometimes needed. He
said he did not hold himself responsible for everything said in the British
press.
The Brussels meeting was billed as an important session to prepare for the
emergency European summit called by Mr John Major, UK prime minister, to
discuss reform of the ERM and ratification of the Maastricht treaty,
following its lukewarm endorsement in the French referendum.
But EC finance ministers mounted a fierce defence of the ERM and the
European Monetary System as 'a key factor of economic stability and
prosperity in Europe'.
Mr Lamont, a strong advocate of floating the pound outside the ERM and a
critic of the Bundesbank's role in the sterling crisis, said he would now be
satisfied 'in large part' if the Birmingham summit confined itself to
'technical' issues. Earlier, the British government had made reform a
precondition for sterling's re-entry into the ERM.
Mr Lamont also stressed that these 'technical' issues would be part of a
'medium-range' debate on the operation of the ERM. No ERM decisions which
would affect the financial markets would be taken at Birmingham.
Mr Horst Kohler, state secretary in the German finance ministry, rejected
British criticism. 'We are not talking about the failure of the ERM but how
the system's rules were not applied.' A senior Luxembourg official, echoing
comments by other delegations unsympathetic to Britain, predicted that
Birmingham 'would not go down in the monetary history of the EC'.
In spite of his bruising encounter in Brussels, Mr Lamont denied that
yesterday's meeting left Britain isolated. Other countries shared the UK's
concerns about the monetary turbulence of the past fortnight.
Mr Michel Sapin, French finance minister damped recent speculation that
Paris and Bonn were creating a Franco-German alliance or a mini-Europe.
In a gesture to Mr Lamont, Mr Sapin said: 'In no sense has Britain been
isolated. Britain is one element and an active element of the consensus
shown in this communique.'
But Mr Jean-Claude Juncker, the Luxembourg finance minister, said: 'If the
British government chooses to wait (on Maastricht) that is their problem,
but we won't accept that someone can try to block implementation of the
treaty.'
Mr Kohler expressed concern to Mr Lamont about recent anti-German sentiment
in the British press and remarks attributed to Lord Tebbit about the
management of the Bundesbank.
Mr Lamont said that some 'harsh' words had been exchanged in recent weeks,
and he was sorry if they had offended anybody - but sometimes there had to
be 'very frank exchanges of opinion'.
He also underscored a commitment to reduce inflation, now that Britain has
in effect devalued the pound through its withdrawal from the ERM.
He would raise interest rates if necessary in future, he said, stressing
Britain's support for the convergence criteria laid down in the Maastricht
treaty.

FT  29 SEP 92 / Sterling hits new low as franc rallies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Economics and Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING HIT a new low against the D-Mark last night, while equities and
gilts also lost ground as investors took a glum view of the UK's economic
prospects now the pound is floating.
Elsewhere in Europe, stocks and bonds slipped on worries that the German
Bundesbank may take its time to ease credit policy, a move that may drive
further into the distance the possibility of large cuts in interest rates
across the continent.
Gloom about the economic outlook was particularly intense in Ireland, where
the central bank was forced to increase interest rates by 3 percentage
points to strengthen the punt, which has weakened in recent weeks amid the
turmoil on currency markets.
The French franc strengthened against the D-Mark, indicating that
devaluation of the currency looks unlikely.
The pound was quoted last night after the close of European trading at DM
2.5080, 27 pfennigs below its former ERM floor of DM2.778, although it
rallied in late New York trading to DM2.5115. Earlier, it had closed in
London at DM2.51, down 3 1/2 pfennigs on the day.
Sterling's weakness, even though Britain is now out of the ERM, may make it
difficult for the UK government to sanction the further cuts in interest
rates that many industrialists and politicians think are required to hasten
recovery.
Investor nervousness was increased by a lack of government clarification
over the future of UK economic policy.
Such sentiments took their toll on the London stock market, where the FT-SE
100 index of leading shares closed 41.0 off at 2,560.0, while gilts were
down by up to  1/4 point. Some of the pressure may have come from investors
taking profits after the rise in shares and short-dated gilts since sterling
left the ERM.
The mood among UK investors to some degree reflected torpid sentiment
elsewhere in Europe, caused by indications of a lack of strength in the
European economy and uncertainty about the direction for currencies.
In Frankfurt and Paris, the bourses fell by 4 per cent and 2 1/2 per cent
respectively, while the Swedish stock market suffered a decline of 4 1/2 per
cent.
In Germany, shares suffered on reports of the poor outlook for earnings
growth at Volkswagen, the car company, and a bleak assessment of the German
economy by the IFO economic research institute in Munich.
On currency markets, trading conditions were quiet, indicating the eight
remaining members of the ERM have staved off the chance of further
realignments. The franc rallied in London to FFr3.373 against the D-Mark,
nearly 6 centimes above its floor - a level it maintained in New York. This
suggested the intervention of the Bundesbank and the Bank of France had
stopped devaluation of the franc.

RESCUE TALKS between Municipal Mutual Insurance and a French insurer
appeared to be in trouble yesterday, casting further doubt over the future
of the stricken British company.
As Britain's ninth largest insurance group struggled for survival, the
Department of Trade and Industry, which regulates the insurance industry,
came under fire for allowing the company to continue trading. MMI insures
nine out of 10 of Britain's local authorities.
Groupe GMF, the Paris-based holding company that controls the Garantie
Mutuelle des Fonctionnaires insurance group, said it had decided not to
investigate further the possible purchase of MMI's business. But Mr Brian
Wright, chairman of MMI, insisted that discussions were continuing.
He added: 'Municipal Mutual and its subsidiaries are continuing to write new
business and pay out claims in full.'
In a fresh twist last night, GMF said other member companies of the Eurosafe
alliance - a loose network of European companies which insure local
authorities and civil servants - would continue talks with MMI.
MMI's future has been in doubt since its auditor issued a severe warning
with the latest set of accounts for the 12 months to December 31. It showed
the company was below the statutory minimum 'solvency margin'.
Last week, a report commissioned by the leading local authority associations
from accountants Touche Ross recommended that those using MMI should seek
alternative cover when policies came up for renewal. Touche stresses there
is a strong possibility MMI will cease trading in the very soon.
The DTI, criticised by Labour MPs over its handling of the case, said: 'We
are keeping in close touch with the company. We have been in constant touch
and we understand that discussions are continuing.'

FT  29 SEP 92 / Hurd to prepare ground for October emergency summit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, is to hold meetings with his
European counterparts to try to clear the way for some progress at the
emergency European Community summit in Birmingham in mid-October.
However, the sour atmosphere at yesterday's Brussels meeting of EC finance
ministers looks likely to make his task difficult.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, will use bilateral meetings tomorrow with
Mr Francois Mitterrand, the French president, and Mr Poul Schluter, the
Danish prime minister, to urge that the summit should lead to a declaration
on devolving decisions to national and regional levels for agreement at the
Edinburgh summit in December.
The government is becoming resigned to further weeks of public wrangling
among Tory MPs over its approach to Europe, even if next month's summit lays
the foundation for a move on decentralising decision-making. Ministers
believe Tory MPs on both sides of the argument will feel they can influence
the government's approach by speaking out.
Downing Street denied that the conclusions of yesterday's Brussels meeting
on discussion of the ERM at Birmingham had been a setback, saying it had not
expected the ERM 'fault-lines' to be resolved in one day. Officials said the
communique reference to early ratification of the Maastricht treaty had to
be related to recognition of the UK's strategy of awaiting the Danish
government's plans for moving forward.
Eurosceptic MPs will see the outcome as putting back further the prospect of
sterling's re-entering the ERM.
Mr Major's difficulties in reconciling his EC negotiations with divisions
within his own party were underlined again yesterday.
As Euro-sceptic MPs talked of possible cross-party alliances to defeat the
Maastricht bill, Mr Hugh Dykes, a leading Tory Euro enthusiast, urged the
government to 'see off' the dissidents once and for all.
He demanded that ministers give a lead by bringing forward the bill to
ratify the Maastricht treaty as soon as possible.
'For months now my colleagues and I have been warning members of the
government what would happen if they failed to explain and defend their EC
policies adequately,' he said.
While Downing Street, however, rejected the idea that Mr Major would deliver
an ultimatum on Europe at the party conference next week, and insisted that
ministers' weekend remarks reflected a fully agreed cabinet view, Lord
Tebbit, a former Tory cabinet minister, said the government was not at one
on the issue.
'There are powerful voices within the cabinet who believe that the
(existing) Maastricht treaty is fatally flawed . . . , that it was a brave
effort at the time it was negotiated, but that things have moved on and we
could do very much better now,' he told BBC radio.
'To say that the government is entirely united is, I think, perhaps
stretching it a little.'
Later, writing in today's Daily Mail, Lord Tebbit launched a bitter attack
on the prime minister. He said that Mr Major had become prime minister after
his predecessor had been accused of 'three grave errors', over entry to the
ERM, relations with Germany over Europe and the poll tax.
However, he said, Mr Major had now left the ERM and been wrongfooted in his
attempt to take Britain to the heart of Europe.
Lord Tebbit concluded by saying that Mr Major was still at risk in the move
to the council tax as successor to the poll tax.

FT  29 SEP 92 / National Savings makes steep rate cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Savings yesterday announced sharp cuts in the interest it offers on
fixed-rate savings products. The cuts varied between 0.75 percentage points
and a full point.
The Building Societies Association said the reductions, which take effect
over the next fortnight, would ease pressure further on mortgage rates.
Meanwhile, Halifax Building Society, the largest mortgage lender, signalled
it was looking for high-value low-risk customers in the housing market as it
and Woolwich, the third largest, cut their basic mortgage interest rates to
9.99 per cent.
Halifax's cuts mean many of its mortgages are now slightly more expensive
than those of Abbey National, its main market rival, which last week cut its
rate to 9.95 per cent.
However, Halifax has structured its charges to ensure that it undercuts
Abbey National for some very large loans.
The Halifax and Woolwich cuts apply immediately to new customers and from
November 1 for existing borrowers.
National Savings' launch in July of its First Option Bond, which offers a
fixed rate over one year with tax paid, brought protests from building
societies, which said it was impossible to match. The initial rate of 10.34
per cent gross was soon cut to 9.67 per cent and it has now been reduced to
8.67 per cent.
Similar cuts were made yesterday to National Savings' more traditional
products, and the new 39th Issue Savings Certificates will be sold in units
of Pounds 100 rather than units of Pounds 25.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian government is putting out for tender oil and gas fields off the
far eastern island of Sakhalin, according to the Itar-Tass official news
agency.
The announcement appears to mean that at least some of the remaining eight
fields off the island are to be offered for tenders for feasibility studies,
following the award in March of a feasibility study for two of the fields to
a Japanese-American consortium composed of Mitsui, Marathon Oil and
McDermott.
The political infighting surrounding the award of the contracts has been
intense, with the local administration and Moscow disagreeing on the
companies to be awarded the contract, and the powerful Russian oil lobby
pressing the government not to award tenders to foreign companies.
To counter this latter pressure, Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister,
has specified in the order he signed on Friday authorising the tender
process that foreign companies 'would be required to make maximum use of
Russian labour and resources'.
The order also asks the relevant Russian ministries to specify the areas
open to tender within the next two weeks - which suggests that the political
struggle may still be going on as to how much to allocate to foreign
investment.
Mr Gaidar has also asked the ministries to set up a commission to regulate
the tender process.
Russian oil production is now in a crisis, with production falling rapidly
because of lack of investment and as yet only limited foreign involvement in
the fields.

A SINO-British row over how to finance a USDollars 22.5bn (Pounds 13bn)
airport in Hong Kong has not stopped the colony awarding another contract
for HKDollars 821m (Pounds 62m) in land reclamation, Reuter reports from
Hong Kong.
The contract, awarded to a consortium of Hong Kong, Dutch and Italian
companies puts into place one of 10 'core' projects in the controversial
airport development. The consortium comprises Hong Kong's Universal
Dockyard, Blankevoort International Dredging of the Netherlands and Dragomar
of Italy.
The deal, to reclaim 68 hectares on the West Kowloon waterfront, brings to
16 the contracts let to date, totalling HKDollars 17.13bn. The reclamation
is set to carry crucial highway and railway links to the airport the
government is trying to build on Chek Lap Kok island in Hong Kong harbour.
Mr Rafael Hui, projects co-ordination director, said the second-lowest bid
was selected after the lowest was ruled unacceptable. Work on the 32-month
reclamation contract begins next month.

THE international mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, confronted
Serbian and Yugoslav officials in Belgrade yesterday with fresh allegations
of ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and tried to bolster the Geneva peace process.
Mr Vance, the United Nations envoy, and Lord Owen, the European Community
envoy, were expected to discuss reports of ethnic cleansing of Croats and
Moslems by Serb forces, as well as stepped-up air attacks which are seen as
part of the campaign to force non-Serbs to flee from Serb-controlled regions
of Bosnia.
Sarajevo radio yesterday warned the inhabitants of the besieged Bosnian
capital of imminent air attacks.
The co-chairmen of the Geneva conference held closed-door talks with
Yugoslav President Dobrica Cosic and General Zivota Panic, the commander of
the Yugoslav army.
Diplomats in Belgrade said the two envoys would seek an accord on the
demilitarisation of Prevlaka, a strategic peninsula on Croatia's southern
Adriatic coastline which is controlled by the Yugoslav army.
An accord on Prevlaka would unblock access to Dubrovnik, the Croatian port.
The two envoys were also expected to take up the creation of safe passages
for civilians in Bosnia and the return of Croatian refugees to UN
peacekeeping zones in Croatia, said UN officials.
They were due to discuss the reopening of the Belgrade-Zagreb motorway,
closed since last August.
Thousands of Croats have threatened to stage a march on their former homes
in Baranja, north-eastern Croatia, many of which are housing Serb refugees
from Croatia.
The envoys met Mr Radoje Kontic, the deputy prime minister of Yugoslavia,
instead of the prime minister, Mr Milan Panic, who was still in the US.
Later yesterday they were due to meet Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the president
of Serbia.
UN peacekeepers put intense pressure on the Croatian government yesterday to
prevent thousands of refugees from going ahead with a 'march to their
deaths' into Serb-held territory, Reuter reports from Zagreb. One UN
official said yesterday that the threatened march into the Baranja region of
eastern Slavonia by up to 10,000 unarmed refugees impatient to reclaim homes
before the start of winter would be a 'Balkan Sharpeville'.

Three people were killed and more than 20 injured when a shell hit a
cemetery during a funeral in Sarajevo, Bosnian radio said, Reuter reports
from Sarajevo.
The radio blamed Serb irregulars for firing the shell but there was no proof
of who was responsible. The city's French hospital confirmed casualty
figures and said many of those wounded were in a serious condition.
The previous attack, on August 4, occurred during the funeral of two
orphans. The grandmother of one of the children and four other people were
injured but no one was killed on that occasion.
Bosnian radio said tank, mortar and artillery fire on the town of Gradacac,
in northern Bosnia, had left at least four people dead.

FT  29 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Lamont wilts under Community fire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN LAMONT received a civic lesson in the new politics of the European
Community yesterday.
The British chancellor has become a hero among Euro-sceptics in the
Conservative party after his pledge to follow a 'British economic policy and
a British monetary policy'; but at the end of a bruising meeting of fellow
EC finance ministers last night, he found out that this may not mean much if
Britain intends to remain a member of the Community.
In the face of a barrage of criticism, Mr Lamont retreated from earlier
British calls for an overhaul of the Exchange Rate Mechanism following
sterling's withdrawal. Now, it seems, he would be satisfied with a
'medium-term' debate on the ERM's weaknesses which would deal with
'technical' matters. This is well short of the fundamental reform which he
and Mr John Major, his prime minister, set down as preconditions for
sterling's re-entry into the ERM.
Mr Lamont, who never disguised his discomfort with the restrictions which
ERM membership imposed on British exchange rate policy, also signed up to a
joint communique describing the European Monetary System as a 'key factor of
economic stability and prosperity in Europe'. And, for good measure, he
offered a qualified apology for some of the German-baiting followed in the
British government and press.
Clearly, a funny thing happened on the way to Brussels. The best explanation
is that Mr Lamont discovered that the price of total isolation inside the EC
on a matter of substance is something which no member is prepared to pay.
Mrs Thatcher discovered this too when, in 1989, she reluctantly agreed to
the conditions for ERM entry.
For Mr Lamont, it was clear yesterday that Britain's criticisms of the ERM
stuck in the collective craw of the Europeans. First, because of its
high-handed decision to enter at an unrealistically high rate to the D-Mark
in 1990; second, because its withdrawal was coupled with calls for a
suspension of the ERM earlier this month.
In response, all EC ministers mounted an emotional defence of the system as
a bulwark of monetary stability, and promised to push ahead with ratifying
the Maastricht treaty. All delegations committed themselves (on paper at
least) to the path of fiscal and inflationary rectitude set out in the
treaty as a pre-condition for entry into a monetary union.
This solidarity produced some extraordinary scenes. Mr Horst Kohler, state
secretary of the German finance ministry, offered fulsome praise for Irish
efforts to prop up the punt with higher interest rates - prompting Irish
press releases proclaiming Dublin's determination to join the putative
fast-track ot monetary union.
Other delegations rubbished real or imagined British plans for using
Birmingham as a means of delaying ratification of Maastricht - an indication
of how the ERM mess poisons relations on the major issue facing the Twelve.
And here is the nub of the matter. Britain has never been entirely trusted
by her EC partners. Its on-off relationship in the post-war era makes this
inevitable. But whatever their suspicions, most believed that Britain talked
sense. After the U-turn on the ERM and the outburst of Bundesbank bashing in
Britain, some EC countries are no longer sure.

FT  29 SEP 92 / The Week In Luxembourg: Commission discretion over
competition priorities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRICK COURT CHAMBERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Court of First Instance (CFI) has ruled that the European
Commission has a discretion not to investigate complaints under the EC
competition rules.
In a judgment with implications for future competition law enforcement, the
CFI said the Commission had the right to exercise such a discretion,
particularly when it felt it was in the Community's best interests not to
take any action.
The decision arose out of a case brought by Automec, an Italian car dealer,
which had complained to the Commission about its exclusion from the BMW
dealership in Treviso.
Automec had also taken action against BMW in the Italian courts, alleging
infringement of EC competition rules when BMW terminated its distributorship
after 24 years.
The Commission rejected Automec's complaint on two main grounds. First, the
Commission said it was powerless to order BMW to supply cars or to permit
use of its trade mark, when the only allegation of infringements of the
competition laws concerned restrictive agreements and not abuse of a
dominant position.
Second, the Commission claimed it was not obliged to issue a decision on
alleged infringements of the EC competition rules.
It said it was only required to decide whether to investigate or reject a
complaint. If it considered a complaint did not itself contain sufficient
matters of fact or law to indicate an infringement, which it was within the
Commission's powers to terminate, the Commission had a discretion whether or
not to investigate the complaint further.
The Commission, as an administrative body, had to select priority areas for
action in the interests of administrative economy, it said.
The issues raised by Automec were already before the Italian courts which
had concurrent jurisdiction to apply the relevant competition rules. No
question arose of individual exemption, which was the only area of exclusive
Commission competence.
The CFI dismissed Automec's appeal. The court, drawing together aspects of
previous caselaw, approved the Commission's position that it can decide not
to investigate a complaint where it considers its resources better employed
elsewhere in the Community interest.
While the Commission is still obliged to examine every competition
complaint, it now has the Court's authority to decline to investigate
complaints which do not in themselves contain sufficient evidence of an
infringement.
Case T-24/90, Automec v Commission, CFI, FC, September 18 1992.
Commission failure to act on competition complaint
The CFI has condemned the European Commission for failing to take a position
on a complaint under the EC competition rules within time limits set down by
the Treaty of Rome.
The complaint was brought by French car dealers against five Japanese car
importers and the French government. The allegation was that their imports
from other member countries were restricted by French government
arrangements with the French Toyota, Mazda, Honda, Mitsubishi and Richard
Nissan importers.
The car dealers claimed the five Japanese importers undertook to limit
French sales to 3 per cent of annual car registrations, excluding competing
distributors of Japanese makes. In exchange, the French government imposed
discriminatory restrictions on competing Japanese imports.
The dealers called for action by the Commission under the Treaty of Rome's
rules. But when the Commission failed to define its position within the
two-month time limit, they brought an action against the Commission in the
CFI.
The Court rejected the Commission's claim that the action was inadmissible.
However, it said that there was no need to rule on the substance of the
application because the Commission had later defined its position and
eventually issued a decision rejecting the complaint - a decision which is
also under appeal (Case T-7/92).
The Court rejected the complainants' other actions for annulment and
damages.
This case is important in confirming previous caselaw on actions for failure
to act. It also makes it clear that subsequent definition of its position by
the Commission outside Treaty of Rome time limits may not make a failure to
act action before the Court inadmissible.
Case T-28, Asian Motor France and others v Commission, CFI FC, September 18
1992.
No review of favourable competition decision
The Dutch banking industry has failed to overturn a favourable Commission
decision declaring that certain transfer charge arrangements were permitted
under EC competition rules.
The banks, represented by the Dutch federation, challenged the reasoning of
the Commission's decision in so far as it found their agreement restricted
competition within the common market.
The reason for the Commission's clearance of the agreement was that it found
no significant effect on trade between EC member countries.
The CFI ruled the judicial review action inadmissible because the operative
part of the Commission's decision had not been challenged.
Only acts capable of affecting defined legal positions are susceptible to
review. It is only the operative part, not the reasoning, of a Commission
decision that can produce such legal effects. Moreover, the Court may review
only the legality of the Commission's reasons which support the operative
part of the decision.
In this case, the finding that the agreements restricted competition was
manifestly not a reason relied on for the decision granting negative
clearance.
Case T-138/89, Nederlandse Bankiersvereniging v Commission, CFI 2CH,
September 17 1992.
Free movement rules not applicable in purely domestic context
The European Court of Justice has confirmed that Treaty of Rome rules on
free movement do not cover activities limited to the territory of a single
member country. The Court said that was a matter for national courts.
Case C-153/91, Camille Petit v Office National des Pensions, ECJ 5CH,

FT  29 SEP 92 / People: Gwyn Howells (m)eets the MLC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gwyn Howells, marketing director of Reebok UK, who helped make Reebok the
best-selling sports shoe in Britain during his spell with the company, is
joining the Meat and Livestock Commission in the same capacity. His is the
first senior external appointment made by Colin Mclean, who took over as
director general at the beginning of September.
Howells' arrival signals an increased concentration on sophisticated selling
on the part of the MLC, which promotes the red meat industry with an annual
budget of around Pounds 50m. The (M)eat to Live campaign has a similar feel
to the award-winning White Line TV ads for which Howells was responsible at
Reebok last year, according to an MLC spokesman. 'We are pleased to have
recruited a high-profile person from an up-beat company,' he adds.
The previous marketing director, Garry Dobbin, died earlier this year.
'The food industry, and meat in particular, has taken a series of knocks to
its image in the past few years,' the MLC goes on. 'While we have had a
stable market in terms of meat consumption over the past twenty years, we
cannot afford to be complacent.'
Howells, 43, says he had achieved what he set out to do at Reebok,
establishing it as the market leader in Britain, in terms of volume and
value, 18 months ago. He sees the challenge at MLC as similar, in that it
involves 'staying in tune with consumers' life-styles'.
*****
Charles Novotny, 54, has been appointed chief executive of Tarmac's quarry
products division. Novotny has been with the company for 18 years and was
previously the division's assistant chief executive; he replaces Jack
Mawdsley, who has already announced that he is leaving at the end of the
year to pursue personal interests.
*****
David Holden has been appointed finance director and company secretary of
MARSHALLS following the retirement of George Taylor.
*****
Gordon McKie, formerly general manager of John Menzies' financial services
division, has been appointed finance director and company secretary of
BRITISH THORNTON HOLDINGS.

Philip Gothard, group financial controller, has also been appointed company
secretary of JAMES WILKES.

FT  29 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow finishes up 25 points
after late burst
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
AFTER trading quietly in a narrow range for most of the day amid concern
about the economic and earnings outlook, US stock markets ended higher on a
burst of late buying, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 25.94 at 3,276.26. The
index spent all but the last 30 minutes not much more than 5 points above
Friday's close, but late demand added almost 20 points at the finish. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended up 2.27 at 416.62, while the
Amex composite fell 1.24 to 377.25 and the Nasdaq composite lost 1.86 to
575.34. Turnover on the NYSE was 158m shares.
Turmoil in European financial markets continued to cloud investor sentiment
in the US. Overnight stock prices in Frankfurt, Paris and London all fell
sharply amid concern about economic growth and whether the German monetary
authorities would lower interest rates. With Europe trapped in a financial
and economic quagmire, the chances of an export-led recovery that many US
investors had pinned their hopes on now appears less likely.
Combined with last week's bad news on durable goods orders and personal
income and spending, the outlook for US economic growth remains bleak: US
investors can only hope for another cut in domestic interest rates, although
analysts doubt that the Federal Reserve will make such a move in the near
future.
Among individual stocks, BF Goodrich fell Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 41 3/4
after the company warned that third-quarter earnings would come in below the
43 cents a share it made in the second quarter, and even below the 30 cents
many analysts had forecast.
Goodyear fell Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 58 3/8 after reporting that revenues
in the third quarter would be close to the Dollars 3.1bn earned in the
previous three months. Investors might also have been unnerved by the
resignation yesterday of the company's chief financial officer.
Chemical Bank rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 32 1/8 in busy trading after the
broking house Oppenheimer upgraded the stock from 'market-performer' to a
'short-term buy'.
Oakwood Homes firmed Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 13 7/8 on reports that analysts
expect mobile home stocks to benefit from demand for low-priced housing if
difficult economic conditions persist.
Gulf Canada, quoted on the American Stock Exchange, jumped Dollars  3/8 to
Dollars 4 15/16 after the company said that testing confirmed the likelihood
of a large gas field in South Sumatra. Gulf has a 54 per cent interest in
the field.
Canada
A WEAK financial sector continued to drag Canadian issues lower. Toronto's
composite index lost 17.50 points or 0.52 per cent to end at 3,367.99.
Losing issues outpaced gainers 318 to 218. Volume was 23.625m shares worth
CDollars 266.6m compared with Friday's 24.012m shares worth CDollars 279.2m.
Westcoast Energy said it will offer CDollars 16 a share for Union Energy.
Union Holdings will tender its 60 per cent stake in Union Energy for cash.
Union Energy stock gained  7/8 to 16 1/8 in heavy trading, while Westcoast
shares lost  5/8 to 16 3/8.

BOURSES fell as a weakening dollar, bearish comment on major companies and
profit-taking combined to undermine share prices, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT saw a weekend report predicting operating losses at Volkswagen and
pessimistic forecasts for the west German economy from the Ifo economic
research institute. The DAX index ended 38.32, or 2.5 per cent lower at
1,475.04, and just 6.13 points above its 1992 closing low.
Turnover fell from DM4.6bn to DM3.8bn. Ifo said on Sunday that the business
climate in west Germany had clearly deteriorated in August, and saw no
improvement over the next six months. Falling export orders and order
backlogs were causing widening production cutbacks and occasional price
reductions, it added.
VW fell another DM17.30, or 5.9 per cent to a four-year low of DM276. The
weekend stories underlined questions about the pricing of its new Golf model
for which, according to outside estimates, production is now running at some
50,000 to 60,000 a month and still building up compared with 75,000 a month
at peak for the old Golf. One downgrade yesterday took VW's 1993 EPS down
from DM30 to DM20 a share.
MILAN saw Olivetti drop 3.4 per cent after the computer company released
worse than expected interim results. Elsewhere, share prices closed mixed
but slipped in after-hours trading.
The Comit index fell 1.15 to 360.45 in turnover estimated at between
L70bn-L80bn after Friday's L80.9bn.
Olivetti fell L57 to L1,625 on news that its losses had widened in the first
six months to L93bn from L74bn in the year-ago period. Dealers said that the
results prompted selling by speculators.
Fiat gained L2 to L3,450 at its official settlement but then fell back to
L3,380 in the after market, in the wake of last Thursday's 54 per cent drop
in first half pre-tax profit. There were reports in the afternoon that
several analysts who attended a briefing with Fiat were cutting their
forecasts for 1992 results. Forecasts for 1992 net profit now range from
L400bn to L600bn, mainly generated by asset sales, sharply down from L1.11
trillion in 1991.
PARIS dropped 4 per cent, reflecting the weaker dollar and frustration that
the central bank had not yet lowered domestic interest rates. The CAC-40
index fell 73.27 to 1,770.26 in turnover of FFr2bn.
Most of the fall was to be seen in the big blue chips, with Total falling
FFr9.30 to FFr210.10 after remarks to analysts by the chairman Mr Serge
Tchuruk. Elf dropped FFr19.80 to FFr350.20 while Peugeot lost FFr34 to
FFr541 and Michelin lost FFr10 to FFr196.50.
Bucking the trend was Primagaz which rose FFr27 or 3.6 per cent to FFr787,
the best performance of the day, in the wake of its pleasing interim
figures.
STOCKHOLM fell 3.7 per cent in thin trading to its second consecutive low
for the year, as sentiment remained depressed by high domestic interest
rates. The Affarsvarlden General index fell 25.5 to 672.4 in turnover of
SKr407m after SKr456m.
Astra A free shares, the day's most actively traded stock with turnover of
SKr100m, fell SKr17 to SKr526 while Ericsson's B frees lost SKr6 to SKr109
on domestic selling.
Electrolux fell further amid rumours that the company will lower, or cancel
its dividend for 1992. The B frees closed SKr12 lower at SKr166. The company
had no comment.
OSLO fell almost 2 per cent, hit by a weaker dollar and by declines on
foreign share markets. The all-share index closed 6.37 lower at 323.62 in
extremely thin turnover of NKr97m.
Norsk Hydro rose SKr1 to SKr141 on the suspension of shares in the chocolate
and confectionery maker, Freia Marabou, 44 per cent owned by Norsk. Kraft
General Foods later said that it was offering to buy Freia Marabou for
NKr450 per share, valuing the company at NKr8.8bn.
AMSTERDAM was upset by further falls in Pirelli NV following the release of
disappointing interim results after Friday's close. The tyre group, in which
its Italian parent holds an 80 per cent stake, lost 13.7 per cent as its
shares fell Fl 3.30 to Fl 20.70, its lowest close since March. The company
also forecast further losses in the second half and warned of further
restructuring. The CBS Tendency index fell 1.4 or 1.25 per cent to 110.8.
ZURICH sold on the good news, following yesterday's referendum votes in
favour of sharp cuts in stamp duties on securities transactions, and on
expensive plans for modernising trans-Alpine transport. The SMI index fell
31.6, or 1.7 per cent to 1,879.2.
MADRID remained stuck in negative mood as the general index built on last
week's fall with another fall of 4.75 to 195.02 while the Ibex was 2.6 per
cent weaker. Telefonica shed Pta29 to Pta996.
BRUSSELS was weaker as Clabecq, the steel group, was suspended after
announcing bigger-than-expected losses for 1991/92. The Bel-20 index closed
down 8.96 at 1,109.10.
Clabecq, suspended at Friday's close of BFr558, cited lower productivity in
the first half combined with weakness in global steel prices for the fall in
earnings.
DUBLIN's ISEQ overall index dropped 31.19 or 2.6 per cent to 1,189.50 on
fears that the central bank's three-point rise in its key interest rate to
13.75 per cent as well as the punt's appreciation against sterling would
harm Irish company profits.
VIENNA followed senior bourses lower as the ATX index lost 11.01 or 1.3 per
cent to 817.12. Bundeslander, the insurer, went against the trend, putting
on Sch2 to Sch502.

FT  29 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls below
18,000 on worries over high yen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Nikkei average fell below 18,000 for the first time since September 16
on worries over the effects of the high yen on the Japanese economy, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index closed down 422.15 or 2.3 per cent at the day's low of
17,972.61, after hitting the day's high of 18,397.47. Although hopes that
public funds would be invested in the stock market buoyed up share prices in
early trading, the fall in the futures market prompted arbitrage-related
selling.
Volume fell to 200m shares from 355m. Declines outnumbered advances by 634
to 320 with 167 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first
section stocks fell 22.44 to 1,349.09 and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
rose 1.05 to 1076.21.
Market participants had expected the injection of public funds as a part of
the government's package to support the financial system and stock market.
However, traders said that the thin volume had possibly turned fund managers
away.
Traders also blamed the higher yen for the fall in share prices. The yen
moved to a new all-time high against the dollar, closing at Y119.65,
prompting worries about foreign exchange losses at leading exporters.
High-technology issues and car manufacturers with high export ratios were
lower. Hitachi lost Y17 to Y745 and TDK, the magnetic tape maker, fell Y190
to Y3,330. Honda Motor lost Y80 to Y1,280 and Nissan Motor Y9 to Y615.
Issues chosen as new components of the Nikkei average as of October 1, were
traded actively. Hazama, the construction company, rose Y11 to Y555 and
Seika, a machinery trader, gained Y1 to Y696. Minebea, however, lost Y4 to
Y506 on profit-taking.
But issues due to be replaced in the index plunged. Godo Shusei fell Y100 to
Y570, Daito Woolen Spinning &amp; Weaving lost Y100 to Y420 and Takashimaya Y100
to Y863.
Itoman, the trading company which will be absorbed by Sumikin Bussan, an
unlisted trading company affiliated with the Sumitomo group, saw heavy
volume, but closed unchanged at Y124.
Mitsui Mining &amp; Smelting led market volume, but fell Y11 to Y508 on
profit-taking. The issue had previously gained popularity on reports of a
gold mine discovery in southern Japan.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 287.83 to 19,502.24 in volume of 13.4m
shares.
Roundup
The Nikkei's fall below 18,000 in Tokyo undermined markets in the Pacific
Basin yesterday. Taiwan was closed for a holiday.
HONG KONG closed sharply lower amid political uncertainties and the Hang
Seng index fell 88.96 to 5,597.2, but off its day's low of 5,579.46.
Turnover was a thin HKDollars 1.57bn against HKDollars 1.67bn on Friday.
HSBC Holdings, which topped the most active list, fell HKDollars 1.50 to
HKDollars 54 and Swire Pacific eased 50 cents to HKDollars 35.75.
AUSTRALIA closed fractionally higher after staying in negative territory for
most of the day. The All Ordinaries ended 0.1 up at 1496.5, but turnover was
thin at ADollars 181.9m.
The Westpac share issue shortfall continued to weigh on banks. Westpac
slipped 1 cent to ADollars 2.85 after topping the industrial trading list
with 5m shares traded.
NEW ZEALAND dropped to a five-month low as investors sold Fletcher Challenge
and other leading stocks. The NZSE-40 capital index fell 33.08 to 1,434.62,
the lowest close since April, as FCL ended at NZDollars 2.00, down 15 cents
on the day and 47 per cent lower since June 8. Turnover was moderately high
at NZDollars 30m.
SEOUL fell in very thin trading as nervous investors remained on the
sidelines. The composite index lost 8.19 to 516.04 with turnover at
Won142.77bn following Won121.77bn in Saturday's half-day trading.
Brokers said political instability was the major culprit behind the market's
weakness, since President Roh Tae-woo announced he would shortly quit the
ruling Democratic Liberal party.
MANILA retreated as investors shifted from index-linked issues to secondary
stocks. The composite index eased 3.14 to 1,386.47 in combined turnover of
1.09bn pesos from Friday's 340m pesos.
BANGKOK's property and finance shares lost ground in afternoon trading as
the SET index suffered its greatest daily loss in two months, ending 10.10
or 1.2 per cent lower at 849.07 in turnover of Bt9.97bn. The major property
company, Krisda Mahanakorn, fell by its 10 per cent limit, dropping Bt22 to
Bt204.

FT  29 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets: Sweden and Spain lead European decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe, once again, was the centre of share price volatility last week.
Excluding the UK, it showed a fall of 2.9 per cent in local currency terms
on the FT-A World Indices, the worst performers being Sweden and Spain.
In Sweden a government pledge to provide a safety net for the country's
financial system was outweighed by heavy loan losses, domestic institutional
illiquidity and fears for the property and construction sectors.
Spain introduced exchange rate controls, effectively closing the peseta
forex market and stabilising the currency. 'However', says Mr Stephen Hughes
of Nikko Europe, 'international investors pronounced their verdict on the
intervention . . . through massive selling of Spanish assets. Prices
collapsed on both the fixed and variable income markets.'
There was no obvious advantage, last week, in being in a hard or soft
currency. Germany and Italy fell by similar amounts, the first because the
strength of the D-Mark threatened its export margins and the second
discovering that a stiff budget and high interest rates, designed to counter
the weakness of the lira, were no obvious prescription for strength in
equities.
The two rises of the week were in Switzerland, stimulated by the strength of
its currency and a decline in short-term interest rates, and in the UK.
Sterling did not lose a lot last week but it was enough to bring a 1.8 per
cent rise in local currency terms down to one of 0.3 per cent in terms of
the dollar.
Along with Europe, the land of the dollar helped push the FT-Actuaries World
Index to a 0.7 per cent fall on the week.
The US only had two bad days in its 1.9 per cent fall. On Tuesday, it fell
on a drop in bond prices; on Friday, a strong recovery in bonds was not
enough to offset more bad economic news, and renewed uncertainty about the
presidential election battle.

FT  29 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Trinity first beneficiary of relaxed float
rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRINITY HOLDINGS, the maker of Dennis fire trucks and buses which is coming
to the market next month, will be the first beneficiary of a more relaxed
Stock Exchange attitude towards flotations. That follows the failure of many
new issues earlier this year to attract retail interest.
The Stock Exchange has allowed a firm placement of 75 per cent of Trinity's
shares, leaving only 25 per cent available for the public through
stockbroker intermediaries. Baring Brothers, Trinity's advisers, expects to
raise at least Pounds 30m.
The flotation is expected to value Trinity at about Pounds 80m and leave the
group virtually free of debt.
With flotations of this size in the past the Stock Exchange has required
that half the shares be made available through a public offering or an
intermediary offering.
Despite the extra expense of marketing a public offering, many of the
companies that hurried to the market after the April general election failed
to jolt private investors from what appeared to be a recession-induced
investment strike.
As a result underwriters were left with shares and a number of the new
issues were labelled retail 'flops'.
Trinity yesterday published its pathfinder prospectus in spite of continuing
nervousness in the London market, and the last minute withdrawal of a
proposed flotation of Woolcombers last week.
In the prospectus the group forecast it would make operating profits of
Pounds 8.5m in the year to January 1993. This compares with a profit of
Pounds 5.58m on sales of Pounds 82.1m last year.
Baring Brothers expects to price the issue early next week and will accept
applications until noon on October 14.
Trinity, like other UK based exporters, is likely to benefit from sterling's
recent devaluation; some 33 per cent of its sales are exported.

FT  29 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Trading warning hits Merrydown shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER FRANKLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares of Merrydown Wine, the USM-quoted cider, wine and health foods
company, yesterday fell 43p to 255p after Mr Richard Purdey, chairman,
warned of stiff competition in the premium cider market, writes Peter
Franklin.
Speaking at the annual meeting, Mr Purdey said the company was operating in
difficult market conditions. The premium market continued to endure
competition from new, cheaper brands.
Despite a strong April to June quarter, Merrydown believed the cider market
would show only slight growth over the year as a whole, he added.
Pub trade continued to be tough and this affected sales of all the company's
products. However, in the take-home market, sales of canned cider were
growing fast.
The statement accompanied news that Merrydown has acquired Sorelle - a
sparkling herbal fruit drink - from Premier Teas, part of Hillsdown
Holdings.
No purchase price was revealed but Mr Purdey said the acquisition was in
line with the strategy of acquiring brands compatible with the company's
product range and balancing its alcoholic/non-alcoholic drinks ratio.
The acquisition follows the purchase in May of Piermont, which Mr Purdey
said was performing well.

<TEXT>
Xtra-Vision, the Dublin-based video rental company that is quoted on the
USM, reported a 29 per cent fall, from IPounds 708,000 to IPounds 504,000
(Pounds 525,000), for the six months to August 2.
The result was struck on static turnover of IPounds 10.8m and after a lower
interest charge of IPounds 800,000 (IPounds 886,000).
Earnings per share came out at 0.33p (0.47p).
Mr Colm Menton, chairman, said the second half had got off to a good start,
particularly in Ireland, although the current economic climate necessitated
a cautious approach when making any forecasts about the full-year outcome.

FT  29 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Drummond warns of first half deficit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Operational problems at the Drummond Group are likely to result in a small
loss for the half year to September 30, in which case the interim dividend
will be passed.
This warning was given yesterday by the group, which makes fabrics and
associated products for the clothing industry.
Since July the trading performance has deteriorated largely because of
operational problems arising from the integration of the Courtauld Woollens
business acquired earlier in the year.
There were also production and technical problems within its own woollen and
worsted divisions.

<TEXT>
IN A MOVE to eliminate its borrowings, Hoskins Brewery, the Leicester-based
real ale brewer, is selling nine public houses to Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley
Breweries for Pounds 2.45m cash, writes Graham Deller.
Announcing the disposal along with a 46 per cent jump in annual profits, Mr
Barrie Hoar, chairman, said: 'This will enable us to take advantage of new
opportunities which are compatible with our current activities.'
Following the deal, USM-quoted Hoskins will continue to operate the
Beaumanor brewery and a reduced estate of seven pubs. 'We will be seeking to
expand the brewing activities of the group and increase sales within the
free trade market,' Mr Hoar said.
The nine pubs contributed about Pounds 22,000 to pre-tax profits of Pounds
83,060 (Pounds 56,685) in the year to March 31, struck after interest
charges of Pounds 137,932 (Pounds 172,145).
Turnover amounted to Pounds 1.75m (Pounds 2.08m). Earnings per share were
1.38p (1.23p).

FT  29 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Finding the way to the right bar - Andrew
Bolger charts the progress of Tim Martin's fast-growing career
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISMAY AT the deal being offered to the capital's drinkers set Tim Martin on
a path which should lead to flotation of his chain of London pubs within the
next two months.
Mr Martin, 37, who came to London in 1978 intending to become a barrister,
remembers: 'I was shocked by the pubs, which all had loud music, keg beer
and high prices.'
Despite joking that he spent three years researching the licensed trade
while studying law at Nottingham, Mr Martin was not a particularly
sophisticated consumer: 'I only realised I had been drinking real ale at
university when I tasted keg.'
His bar exams did not progress well, so he used a quick profit from selling
his flat to buy an eight-year lease on a pub in Muswell Hill, north London.
It had real ale and no jukebox - features maintained in the 44 pubs
currently operated by his company, JD Wetherspoon.
The rapidly-expanding company made pre-tax profits of Pounds 2m on sales of
Pounds 21m in the year to July 31. The flotation will raise about Pounds
20m, most of it new money, which should give the chain a market
capitalisation of Pounds 40m-Pounds 45m.
Mr Martin, who owns just under half of the existing company, always intended
to build a chain of pubs, and during the eighties developed other elements
of the formula he wanted - offering one low-priced beer, with careful
attention to food and decor.
The pubs trade under the names of JJ Moons, Moons Under Water and White
Lions of Mortimer. Sometimes a name with local historical significance is
chosen, but the group's pubs are now all being badged with the JD
Wetherspoon logo.
Mr Martin said: 'We cut across accepted wisdom in the pub trade, which
during the eighties was dominated by the awful fashion for market
segmentation.
'People who run high-quality pubs think you can charge high prices. By
charging low prices, we attracted large number of students and pensioners -
people with low discretionary income, but who as regulars can generate high
volumes. They also contribute to a good mix of clientele.'
Wetherspoon's other distinctive policy has been its willingness to open pubs
in new locations, coverting shops and car showrooms. Mr Martin believes that
much of the recent regulatory concern over the brewers' tied-house system
has been misplaced, and the real problem is the lack of competition at the
retail level.
He said: 'Most areas only have a limited number of good locations with
licences - which none of the big groups will sell.'
To overcome this, Wetherspoon has been prepared to shoulder the considerable
costs involved in obtaining licensing and planning permission to convert
good locations into pubs. Having bought a car showroom in Crouch End, it was
two years before the group was able to open it as a pub.
Mr Martin said he followed the example of McDonalds, the fast food chain,
which puts a lot of resources into researching and securing the right
locations.
Instead of buying sites and then trying to obtain permissions, the current
depressed property market enables the group to take six-month options on
attractive sites, during which time it can seek planning and licensing
clearance.
Mr Martin's said his pubs, which strive to have a welcoming and unmenacing
atmosphere, had proved trouble-free - even when opened in supposedly rough
areas. As the group's formula became more established, it was easier to
persuade the authorities to grant licences.
Wetherspoon is now also approached by developers, whose planning permission
requires them to include a pub. The group has opened a pub in Leicester
Square, runs the only one in the new Liverpool Street railway station and
was chosen to operate the sole traditional pub in Heathrow's Terminal 4.
The pubs are at present evenly divided between leasehold and freehold
properties. Mr Martin said: 'Leases give a high return on capital, so the
proportion of freeholds will diminish. We are not a property company.'
The company has 44 pubs within the M25 and planning and licensing permission
for a further 19. The need for funds to develop these sites was one reason
for the flotation, which will leave the group's balance sheet with gearing
of about 50 per cent. Leading shareholders include John Govett and 3i.
Mr Martin, advised by Kleinwort Benson, aims to have 200 pubs within and
around the M25 before looking further afield. But he has no doubt that the
formula will travel: 'London is very diverse, so we are confident that it
will work well in different parts of the country.'

FT  29 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Standard Chartered gets ADollars 71.5m in
settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STANDARD CHARTERED, the UK-based international banking group, is to receive
ADollars 71.5m (Pounds 30m) cash as a court settlement for an ADollars 100m
loan made to GPI Leisure International, an Australian leisure company, in
1988.
The payment is in addition to the realisation of assets already recovered by
Standard Chartered in relation to the GPI Leisure loan and accounted for in
previous years.
The defendants in the proceedings, brought in a New South Wales court,
included Australian National Industries, Spedley Securities, and two former
directors of ANI and Spedley.
GPI Leisure was also a plaintiff in the court case.
The cash payment is dependent on a number of preconditions being met in the
next 90 days, otherwise the case will resume.
Details were not released but Standard Chartered said that all parties were
reasonably confident that the requirements would be met. The bank declined
to give further details about the nature or details of the dispute.
The cash will be included in Standard Chartered's 1992 accounts.

FT  29 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Linread recovers to more than Pounds 1m in
'tough market'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LINREAD, the Birmingham-based maker of fasteners and components for the
motor and aviation industries, has recovered from the financial doldrums in
which it has languished since the second half of 1990.
It announced pre-tax profits for the first half of 1992 of Pounds 1.05m,
compared with losses of Pounds 1.37m struck after restructuring and closure
costs of Pounds 1.5m, and a full year deficit of Pounds 2.2m.
That translated into earnings per share of 5.62p (losses of 6.91p).
'The market place is tough,' said Mr Peter Tahany, chairman, and it will
remain so for the next 18 months. Turnover slipped from Pounds 21.6m to
Pounds 20m.
The interim dividend is 1.5p, against 2p in the comparable half-year and a
total 1991 distribution of 3.5p.
Recovery owed more to the elimination of loss-making business and
rationalisation started last year than to any strengthening of demand from
the motor and aviation industries.
Although the search continued for higher productivity, to relieve the
pressure on margins, the main cost-cutting programme had been completed.
Sale of surplus property provided a net Pounds 331,000 to boost profits and
to strengthen the balance sheet.
This factor, combined with tighter control of working capital, helped to
reduce gearing from 59 per cent to 44 per cent.

FT  29 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Maple Leaf acquires 50 pubs from Bass
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Maple Leaf Inns, the joint venture company launched three months ago by
Pubmaster, the independent pub retailer, and Labatt, the Canadian brewer,
has bought 50 pubs in the Midlands and Wales from Bass.
Terms of the sale have not been disclosed.
Maple Leaf, which now operates 68 pubs, intends to expand further, said Mr
John Brackenbury, chairman.
Labatt signed a distribution deal with Pubmaster in June, increasing the
number of UK pubs in which its brands are sold from 7,000 to 9,000, and
securing a place in the UK's ten top-selling lagers fours years after its
introduction.
Bass has now sold about 2,650 pubs in the past three years, leaving it with
less than 100 for disposal to meet the requirements of the government's beer
orders during the next month.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHNSON MATTHEY, the precious metals group, has bought for an undisclosed
cash amount Alta, a Pittsburgh-based company which claims to be the world's
leading supplier of high purity titanium.
Demand for this material is expected to grow strongly in the next five years
as new generations of semiconductor devices using advanced titanium
technology come into production.
Mastering the technology necessary to produce titanium of at least 99.999
per cent purity is difficult and JM, which is one of Alta's customers, is
effectively taking a short-cut.
Mr Richard Wakeling, chief executive of JM, said the acquisition would
strengthen his group's position as a leading electronics materials supplier
and it would help it in its push to win more market share in the Japanese
semiconductor industry.
In 1991 Alta, which employs about 50 people, made sales of Dollars 10m
(Pounds 5.8m) and at the year-end had net assets of Dollars 5m.
Mr Wakeling said it would make an immediate contribution to profits.

FT  29 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Oilseed rape
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TODAY'S MEETING in Geneva of the governing council of the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade could be a day of reckoning in the US's six-year
dispute with the EC over the latter's restrictions on oilseed imports.
Without a last-minute outbreak of common sense, the two sides seem poised
for a tit-for-tat trade war.
The sequence is expected to be simple: the US will demand that the EC
accepts binding independent arbitration to settle the dispute. The EC will
refuse, instead recommending further negotiation. The US will then unleash a
threatened Dollars 1bn of sanctions against EC farm exports, prompting the
EC to hit back.
Negotiators must realise that this way madness lies. The dispute could
disrupt a swathe of US-European trade in products ranging from aircraft to
whisky, and hurt many other exporting nations.
EC officials say the only move that can break this vicious circle is a
settlement of the Uruguay round of world trade talks. This would be highly
desirable. The solution lies largely with the US and EC: the mainly
agricultural issues separating them are trivial compared with the potential
gains for all from a settlement.
On the other hand, success is far from assured. EC member states may be even
less willing to push for a settlement than before the French referendum on
Maastricht. And with President Bush trailing in the polls, he may be in no
position to compromise further for an agreement that might not yield enough
votes to make a difference. It would be reckless to rely on the Uruguay
round to avert a trade war. More likely, an escalation of the oilseeds
dispute will disrupt efforts to conclude the round.
The immediate priority must be to prevent the issue from blowing up today.
To this end, the EC needs to review its position. The Gatt has twice ruled
that US complaints against the EC oilseed regime are justified. Bilateral
negotiations aimed at setting EC compensation are deadlocked. The time has
come for the Community to accept that independent binding arbitration is the
only fair route to a settlement.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The collapse of Mr John Major's government has come six months too late, or
four years too early, for Mr John Smith's Labour party. If the events of the
past fortnight had taken place in March or early April, then even a Labour
party led by Mr Neil Kinnock might have bettered the 35 per cent of the vote
it attracted in the general election. As to the next contest, which need not
be held until April 1997, Labour can expect to do exceedingly well - if the
Conservatives are still at one another's throats, and if their leader still
has all the authority of a deflated balloon.
You only have to state those two big 'ifs' to see that the principal
opposition party, which is afire with complacency this week, has work to do
if it is not to risk the loss of a fifth general election. It cannot rely on
the proposition that the Tory party will continue to govern with effortless
incompetence.
This is not to say that Labour will derive no long-term benefit from what
has happened. It can never again be said that it is Labour alone that is the
party of devaluation. It is no longer possible to see an early end to the
Conservatives' civil war over Europe. Even when peace is restored the task
of reconstruction will be arduous. The likable new prime minister who
replaced Mrs Margaret Thatcher is an asset whose value has fallen as sharply
as house prices in the south-east.
Mr Major can no longer rely on the support of such pillars of Conservatism
as the Daily and Sunday Telegraphs and the Daily Mail. He is the same chap
we admired during the Gulf war, the Tory hero who surprised everyone by
standing on his soap-box and winning in April, the negotiator who outfoxed
the continentals at Maastricht. Yet he is now the subject of destructive
analyses, whose sub-texts are: 'is he a man of straw?' and 'why did we not
see this before?' You may picture such future triumphs as you will for the
prime minister - including a victory drive up Whitehall in a chariot drawn
by the half-naked figures of Messrs Kenneth Baker, Nicholas Budgen and
Michael Spicer - and even in such a fantasy he is still not quite the man he
was before he was obliged to flee the exchange rate mechanism.
This vision of Conservative distress has given the Labour conference in
Blackpool a lift that is unjustified by the party's long record of electoral
failure. Mr Major may yet recover, if not completely then at least
sufficiently to ride home again on an inflationary boom. Alternatively, if
he tries and fails to put a son-of-Maastricht bill through the Commons, or
if he shames himself and shies at that fence, he can be replaced. There is
plenty of time.
The danger for Labour is that it will waste the autumn on
self-congratulation. This danger has been compounded by the recent
achievements of its new leader, Mr John Smith. Headline success may merely
lengthen the period during which the party fails to reform. Last week Mr
Smith demonstrated his ability to command the House of Commons. Yesterday
the conference endorsed his stately policy of sticking by Maastricht, and
returning to managed exchange rates (for which read the ERM). It rejected
the Labour Europhobes' calls for a referendum. It threw his defeated rival,
Mr Bryan Gould, off the national executive committee within hours of the
latter's resignation from the shadow cabinet. It is impossible not to
compare Mr Smith's growing ascendancy over his party with Mr Major's loss of
control over the Conservatives.
None of this will help Labour if it does not find a way of convincing
middle-class voters that its aspirations for social justice do not threaten
the prosperity that, in spite of the recession, capitalism has brought to so
many of them. The latest evidence comes in a Fabian pamphlet, Southern
Discomfort, by Giles Radice. It is based on qualitative research among
aspirant working-to-middle-class voters in five south-eastern marginal
constituencies. As you might have guessed, Labour, while thought to be
caring and fair, is seen as the party that is most likely to take things
away, look after losers, and fail to reward or even understand the ambitions
of the 'ordinary man'. Nothing that has been said at this conference so far
suggests that Labour realises what it has to do about that fatal perception.
I have a suggestion. If Mr Bill Clinton becomes president, visit the US to
see how he did it. The Democratic candidate is running a campaign that does
not merely seek to allay the fears of the American middle class. It promotes
Mr Clinton as the friend of capitalism, the man who wants prosperous
ordinary people to prosper.
There are many differences between the US and British polities, but on this
central question the Democrats are instructive. What they have to teach is
more fundamental than talk of accommodation with the Liberal Democrats,
electoral reform, green politics, or any of the other items in the party's
grey 'agenda for change'.

FT  29 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Wrong track on insiders
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS a widespread perception, in and out of the financial markets, that
Britain's present legislation on insider trading does not work. So much the
better, it might be thought, that the government is about to seize the
opportunity presented by an EC directive on insider trading to overhaul the
earlier domestic legislation. Yet many in the City fear that the forthcoming
Criminal Justice Bill will fail to deliver a significant improvement on the
much criticised status quo.
One of the chief shortcomings in the existing law which contributes to a
high rate of acquittals in insider dealing cases is that the definition of
an insider has been too tightly drawn. Those who have escaped criminal
sanctions despite profiting from inside knowledge have often done so because
they were at one remove from the company whose shares were traded.
Equally problematic has been the difficulty of proving intention; that is,
demonstrating that people made their profits knowingly from privileged
information. And the Treasury itself has recently been irked by indications
that insider dealing was taking place in the gilt-edged market, where the
legislation did not operate.
On the basis of preliminary drafts of the proposed legislation circulated
all too briefly around City institutions in the summer, the government is
now seeking to widen the definition of an insider to ensure that those who
are not necessarily close to the company are no longer immune from criminal
sanction. It will even be illegal, if the present drafts find their way into
law, for a broker to encourage people to deal in a company's shares, where
they are not given the inside information to which the broker has had
access.
The proposed legislation also shifts the onus of proof onto the defence to
prove that a given transaction was not prompted by inside information. The
problem of proving intention would thus disappear. And the Treasury will
have its revenge on those who penetrate its defences by introducing the
gilt-edged market to the offence of insider dealing.
The legislation seems well designed to secure a higher level of convictions
in insider dealing trials. The questions concern the risk of overkill and
the possibility that the flow of information from companies to the markets
will be impeded under a regime that also widens the definition of inside
information. The Treasury is anxious that City analysts should not be
deterred from diligent investigation. Yet it wants them, perversely, to
confine their work to publicly available information.
Equally worrying for analysts is a proposal that the definition of inside
information should be widened to include data that is not specifically about
the company whose shares are being traded. Unpublished industry information,
for example, will qualify as inside information. And there are more
technical concerns about the impact of legislative detail on underwriting
practice.
The more fundamental criticism of the draft proposals, however, is that they
fail to address the real problem. The reason why there have been a mere 28
insider dealing trials in 11 years is that the process of investigation and
detection is not effective. Yet the government is not proposing to remedy
the weaknesses of an unduly fragmented investigatory system. Nor is it
looking into the appropriateness or otherwise of introducing civil remedies
for insider dealing. Nor, again, at the abuse of Chinese walls in the
post-Big Bang City. A wider opportunity is undoubtedly going by the board.

FT  29 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Rational roads
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IS TRANSPORT in Europe too cheap? Try asking the Swiss, reluctantly
embarking on one of the biggest rail projects of the century. The cost of
building two train tunnels totalling nearly 50 miles on a north-south axis
under the Alps is put at SFr14.9bn (Pounds 6.7bn), but finance charges and
inflation are likely to push the final figure to a colossal SFr24bn.
The Swiss themselves will derive little benefit from the project: the
trains' main function is to give piggy-back rides to the heavy volumes of
road traffic making the trans-Alpine journey between Germany and Italy. Up
till now Switzerland has sought to protect its fragile Alpine environment by
refusing access to vehicles weighing more than 28 tonnes, but the country's
moves towards membership of the European Community have obliged it to open
up a trans-Alpine route for the 40-tonne juggernauts at present taking
alternative routes through Austria and France.
In a rational world, the cost of the tunnels would be borne by those for
whom they are being built - their users. The world of transport, however,
operates differently. Although users of the Alpine tunnels will be charged a
fee, it cannot be a large one because transit traffic would simply revert to
cheaper, more environmentally damaging, routes. Consequently, few (if any)
of the Swiss taxpayers faced with the bill for building the tunnels will
live long enough to see the project's revenues cover its costs.
The case of Switzerland's Alpine tunnels is symbolic of the transport
difficulties facing a unifying European market. New patterns of
transnational trade are putting increasing strains on both transport
infrastructure and the environment. The combination of cheap road transport
and a relaxation of border controls has opened up tempting opportunities to
exploit quite narrow price differentials across national frontiers: one
apocryphal story tells of a vegetable producer growing potatoes in Germany,
sending them across the Alps for peeling and processing in Italy, then
bringing them back to Germany for packing and distribution.
There is no case for seeking to restrict such cross-border trade. On the
contrary, an efficient market should encourage it. What is open to question,
however, is whether a market can be regarded as efficient if participants
are relieved from the obligation to meet the costs they impose on others.
Governments and taxpayers, particularly those bearing the increasingly heavy
cost of transit traffic, are unlikely to be able to fund the provision of
either the transport infrastructure or the environmental protection
necessary to cope with forecast rate of traffic growth: nor should they be
expected to do so. Instead, a common EC transport policy should have at its
heart what at present it so badly lacks: an intelligible system of charging
road users not just the full cost of providing the infrastructure they use,
but a sum reflecting the cost to the environment of preferring this mode
over less damaging ones. It may well be that it makes sense to transport
lorry loads of potatoes across the Alps and back to be peeled: but until a
rational system of charging for road use is in place, it will be impossible
to know.

FT  29 SEP 92 / Figures lose their shape: Germany's economic powerhouse
looks fragile at home
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Germany went on holiday this summer, light was still flickering at the
end of the economic tunnel. Now, after the European currency turmoil of the
past month, the light seems to have gone out. Hopes built on a recovery in
exports have been doused by the sharp appreciation of the D-Mark against the
currencies of leading trading partners. With the fading of these hopes, the
mood in industry has darkened, the green shoots of the 'blooming landscape'
promised in the east have died, and the indecisive manoeuvring of the
political leadership in Bonn has become overlaid by a mood akin to
desperation.
Buoyed by the tidal wave sweeping through currency markets, the D-Mark
stands more than 4 per cent higher against a trade-weighted basket of
European currencies than at the start of the year. It is 10 per cent up
against sterling, 11 per cent higher against the lira.
According to German economists, this shift has pushed Germany to the verge
of recession - even though, according to the stern message of the
Bundesbank, 'there can be no talk of recessionary trends'.
Real gross domestic product, the independent central bank points out in its
September report, was 'only'  1/2 per cent lower than in the relatively
strong first quarter. However, it concedes: 'Uncertainty about the further
course of business activity has undoubtedly increased.'
This uncertainty was magnified in yesterday's report from the respected Ifo
economics institute in Munich, which described a slump in west German
industry's hopes for the coming six months, and amplified further in the
stock markets. The report was a prime factor behind yesterday's 2.53 per
cent drop in the Frankfurt DAX index.
The broad range of manufacturers, distributors and building companies
sampled monthly by Ifo said incoming orders had fallen again in August,
inventories were building up and orders in hand were shrinking despite
production cuts. 'Production plans for the coming months are tending
increasingly towards reduction,' Ifo said.
Instead of a second-half economic upswing, universally expected six months
ago, west Germany now faces a period of further decline. Most of this year's
overall growth, now expected to be less than 1 per cent, seems likely to
stem from the freak surge recorded in the first quarter  - mainly
attributable to unseasonably fine weather - which boosted the construction
industry.
All leading economic indicators have turned resolutely downwards since that
false spring, when year-on-year GDP growth was 3.2 per cent. By the end of
the second quarter the advance was down to 0.6 per cent. In the three months
to the end of June, capital investment was 4 per cent lower than a year
earlier.
When the Ifo report of a fall in August's industrial order intake is
officially confirmed, that will mark the sixth consecutive month of decline
in west Germany. At the half-year mark, new foreign orders were more than 7
per cent lower than in 1991, and industrial output was down 3 per cent.
Production in the capital goods industry, which accounts for about 50 per
cent of all west German industrial sales, had fallen 4 per cent. The
consequences for the labour market have included stagnating employment and a
10 per cent rise in the number of jobless.
Bonn and Frankfurt are still digesting the impact of recent international
monetary turbulence - and are waiting to see whether it will be followed by
fresh upheavals. The D-Mark's parity against the French franc now looks
reasonably secure after last week's strong and successful defence by the
Bundesbank and Bank of France. But, in the wake of the Anglo-Italian
decisions to suspend participation in the ERM, a further round of
'competitive devaluations' by other weaker currency economies would deal a
fresh blow to Germany's export-dependent economy.
Bonn is pondering the advantages and drawbacks of a move, always implicit in
the Maastricht treaty, towards a 'fast-track' monetary union with a few
other EC partners. If, as a result of hold-ups in Maastricht ratification
elsewhere, such a procedure were agreed with France and the Benelux
countries, the economic benefits would be only limited. The Bundesbank would
probably remain in charge of the process - but a 'two-speed' march towards
European union would provide fixed exchange rates for Germany's trade flows
to countries at present purchasing only about 29 per cent of total German
exports - a much smaller part of overall trade than the EC, which accounts
for 54 per cent of exports.
As the Bonn government considers the future path of European integration,
the Bundesbank sits at its shoulder, nagging it about a still more pressing
matter. The economic deadweight of the former East Germany is a far more
serious constraint on economic policy than was imagined when unity was
forged two years ago.
As the bank's September report says: 'For a fairly long time to come western
Germany will have to accustom itself to a high level of transfer payments to
eastern Germany. Due regard has not been paid to this in a large proportion
of the public sector budgets and in negotiated pay settlements.'
Transfers this year will reach DM170bn, up DM20bn from last year, according
to new estimates from Deutsche Bank, the biggest private sector bank. 'A
fairly long time' in Bundesbank language is translated into '10 years and
more' by some independent economists.
The thrust of the central bank's report, which focuses, as usual,
relentlessly on domestic policy, is that none of the conditions which it
requires before interest rates can be reduced has yet been met.
Although inflation has fallen since the March peak of 4.8 per cent and is
now holding at about 3.5 per cent, most of the decline is accounted for by
the 'base line' effect of indirect taxation increases dropping out of the
calculation in July and the moderating influence of falling import prices
due to the strength of the D-Mark. 'In other words the progress made in
combating inflation has not yet been consolidated,' the report adds.
Nor has there been any significant progress in combating wage inflation,
notably in the east. The bank is especially concerned about this year's
agreement to raise public sector pay in the former GDR to 80 per cent of
western levels by July next year.
The Bundesbank's anti-inflation struggle has been considerably complicated
by its difficulties in meeting this year's 3.5 to 5.5 per cent target for
growth in the broad M3 money supply. Already in August, M3 was growing at an
annualised 9 per cent. The unprecedentedly large intervention during the
past month by the Bundesbank and other European central banks to hold down
the rise of the D-Mark against partner currencies has led to large flows of
liquidity on to the Frankfurt money market. Although the Bundesbank is doing
its best to neutralise these inflows through money market operations, the
rush of speculative funds into the D-Mark will push year-on-year growth in
M3 still higher this autumn. This degree of overshooting - unparalleled in
the 18 years since it started monetary targeting in 1974 - poses an enormous
challenge for its credibility.
Bonn, too, needs to maintain public confidence. It has promised an
about-turn in its spending policies. But, as is clear from recent Bundesbank
statements, Frankfurt's scepticism has yet to be overcome.
The 1993 budget tabled recently by Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, allows
for a nominal increase of only 2.5 per cent in federal spending ' a
distinctly non-inflationary tack in a year when price inflation is expected
to average 3.75 per cent. In the next three years, the average target
increase will be even lower at 2.3 per cent. The implication is an absolute
limit on spending increases until 1996 of almost DM11bn a year.
According to Mr Helmut Kaiser, an economist at Deutsche Bank, Mr Waigel's
words are 'welcome . . . but not entirely credible', if only because the
minister has not yet said how he intends to make the necessary cuts.
Room for cuts elswehere is slender indeed: about 11 per cent of federal
spending is currently consumed by interest payments; another 10 per cent of
the Bonn budget ' the sums are fixed by legislation ' is consumed by
allocations to regional and local authorities.
The only areas where significant cuts might be made are in the subsidies
paid to industries such as coal and agriculture, which account for almost 40
per cent of Bonn's annual spending. 'Experience shows, however, that
attempts to (dismantle subsidies) generally fail,' notes Mr Kaiser.
By adopting Mr Waigel's thinly-detailed proposals the government has put
itself on a hook, and the Bundesbank is unlikely to let it wriggle off
easily. Earlier this month when it snipped a  1/4 point off its Lombard rate
and  1/2 a point off the discount rate, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the bank's
president, said it was contributing to easing exchange rate tensions. The
move, he added, could also be seen as a shift in line with the needs of a
weakening economy.
In that case, if the German economy descends into recession, he and his
colleagues may be prepared to take a more radical approach to interest rate
cuts.
If the Bundesbank holds its current rigid line, keeps rates high and thereby
smothers economic resurgence in its main European export markets, the
evidence so far suggests there is no chance of an export-led recovery in the
near future. The only apparent alternative appears to be a significant
easing of rates over the next 12 months, leaving the markets to realign the
D-Mark with its battered neighbours, and the postponing of the Bundesbank's
dream of 2 per cent inflation to some uncertain point in the future.

FT  29 SEP 92 / Technology: Apple's Newton slow to ripen: Technically
Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS A veteran Apple Computer watcher, one learns to tolerate hyperbole. Apple
is a company whose vision has frequently overreached its ability to execute.
Newton, the 'personal digital assistant' that Apple previewed in May, now
appears to be the latest example of this failing.
Apple is 'less and less convinced there is a market for these things in the
near term in the consumer market', John Sculley, Apple chairman and chief
executive, is reported to have told an industry conference in California
last week.
But wasn't Newton supposed to usher in a new category of products that 'use
digital technology to bridge the gap between personal computers and consumer
electronics', to quote Apple press releases?
Apple officials cannot verify exactly what Sculley said last week, but
attendees at the conference say that he backpedalled on earlier extravagant
claims.
Sculley stressed the business applications of Newton - a hand-held
electronic notepad. Listeners came away with the impression that Newton will
be too expensive and limited in function to have a broader mass-market
appeal.
Newton will initially sell to 'individuals who will use it primarily in
connection with their business', Apple officials explain. Sculley was merely
attempting to balance perceptions that Newton will be a consumer product by
describing its potential uses in business, they say.
The computer might, for example, replace weighty maintenance manuals for
complex machinery, or a doctor might use it to file patient notes. 'Our
perception of the market for Newton has not changed,' Ken Wert, marketing
manager of the Apple PIE division, insists.
There has been some confusion, Apple concedes. Indeed so. Last January the
company trumpeted its plans to launch a new category of 'digital consumer
products' at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, a gathering of
manufacturers and retailers.
In May, Apple followed up with a glimpse of Newton, its first-generation
'personal digital assistant' technology. Speaking again at the Consumer
Electronics Show, this time in Chicago, Sculley hailed the announcement as
'the birth of a mega-industry'.
Not unreasonably, many concluded that Apple would target and price Newton as
a mass-market consumer product, although competitors in the hand-held
computer market were sceptical even then.
Rather than 'defining a new product category', it is now clear that the
first Newton will be an electronic alternative to the pocket diary or
personal organiser that many busy business people use. As such it must
compete with established products such as Hewlett-Packard's 95LX hand-held
computer.
This is by no means the first time that Apple has whipped up excitement by
promising to 'define a new market'. Almost a decade ago Apple executives
made that same claim prior to the introduction of Lisa, an innovative
personal computer that incorporated one of the first 'graphical user
interfaces'.
Lisa was a flop - too expensive for most of the computer enthusiasts who
appreciated its features and too different from the IBM personal computer
that was rapidly gaining ground in the corporate PC market.
Eventually, Apple's Macintosh personal computer, which owed much to the
original Lisa, did redefine personal computing and secure Apple's future.
Now Newton is beginning to look like a 1990s version of Lisa - a product
that will be much admired by the computer cognoscenti, yet too expensive for
most potential buyers.
Defining new markets is a slow and expensive process. Apple, more than most
companies, should know that.
Newton is the first step, but it may be the first of many before Apple can
achieve its dream of delivering computer power to the masses.

FT  29 SEP 92 / Technology: Going back to basics - The pharmaceutical
industry is turning to nature as a source of new drugs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARJORIE SHAFFER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world's pharmaceutical companies are conducting a romance with mother
nature. Lured by the novel compounds that only nature can concoct,
established giants such as SmithKline Beecham, Merck and Glaxo, and a host
of small start-ups are scouring the world's forests for the next blockbuster
medicine.
Although drug discovery is always risky, many scientists believe there is a
good chance of finding interesting medicinal compounds in nature, especially
in the species-rich tropical rain forests.
Plants and other forms of life have historically been an important source of
medicines. Morphine is derived from opium, for example, and penicillin is a
fungal metabolite. Moreover, there are some 250,000 species of flowering
plants in the world, and only 1,100 of them have been investigated
thoroughly for their medicinal properties.
'You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out that you may find
something in the remaining 99.5 per cent,' said Michael Balick, director of
the Institute of Economic Botany at the New York Botanical Garden.
The field was given an enormous boost by taxol, a promising anticancer
compound derived from the bark of the Pacific yew tree, a conifer found in
the remaining virgin forests of the US's Pacific Northwest. Taxol is now
being tested against ovarian and breast cancers.
The US National Cancer Institute first discovered taxol in the 1960s but saw
its natural products program languish in the 1980s. The institute is now
screening thousands of plants, marine creatures and micro-organisms for
activity against human cancers.
Searching the world's plants for drugs became passe among researchers in the
last two decades as the molecular and computer-driven route to drug
synthesis eclipsed any other method of discovering medicines. Today, armed
with new techniques borrowed from biotechnology, companies can screen
thousands of chemical extracts from plants for activity against human
cancers and other diseases in a very short period.
'There is obviously a lot of renewed interest in this area,' said Randall
Johnson, director of biomolecular discovery at SmithKline Beecham's US
headquarters in Philadelphia. 'Every month interesting compounds from nature
are emerging from these new mechanism-based screens, and nature is proving
to be a very rich source of compounds that can combat human disease,' he
said.
In Europe, a product from the ginko tree, one of the oldest living trees,
called ginkolyte, is used extensively to promote blood flow. James
McChesney, director of the Research Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences at
the University of Mississippi estimates the compound generates as much as
Dollars 300m a year in sales in Europe.
SmithKline Beecham is now clinically testing a plant-derived drug called
topotecan as a treatment for ovarian cancer. The drug is an analog of
campotothecin, a compound extracted from trees in China and India.
Campotothecin was originally discovered by the National Cancer Institute in
the easy 1960s, but proved too toxic in cancer patients and was dropped from
the NCI's programme. SmithKline resurrected it a number of years later,
creating a water-soluble analog that was less toxic, said Johnson.
Glaxo too has an interest in campotothecin. The company is studying analogs
of the compound and it is searching for new plant medicines as part of a
research consortium with the University of Illinois in Chicago, one of the
leading academic centres involved in medicinal plants. 'We are not looking
so much at medicines from plants per se, but substances that can be
improved, modified and refined for a safe and effective drug,' said Rick
Sluder, a Glaxo spokesman.
Another promising product is artemisinin, an antimalarial drug originally
derived from a plant found in China and south-east Asia, according to
McChesney. 'The excitement is that the compound is effective for
drug-resistant malaria and is practically a miraculous drug for cerebral
malaria, a serious form of the disease,' he said.
So far, there are no obstacles to obtaining large quantities of the plant.
Artemesia annua, from which the compound is derived, is a 'worldwide
naturalised weed,' said McChesney. 'You could probably find it growing in a
vacant lot in New York City,' he said.
The controversy surrounding taxol has underscored the issue of supply.
Conservationists are worried that in the rush to extract taxol from the bark
of the Pacific yew tree, remaining stands of the tree will be obliterated.
However, McChesney said researchers have now found that taxol can be
extracted from the yew's needles, rather than its bark.
Amid the resurgence of interest in plant medicines, many small start-up
companies have emerged with novel approaches to drug discovery. Shaman
Pharmaceuticals, based in San Carlos, California, for example, is exploring
traditional plant-derived medicines already used by native tribes and
communities. 'By using traditional knowledge there is greater likelihood of
yielding an active compound or a pharmaceutical,' said Lisa Conte, Shaman's
president.
Shaman is the traditional name for 'medicine man'. Founded in 1989, the
company already has two drugs in clinical trials. One is an anti-viral drug
against respiratory infections; the second is a broad-spectrum antifungal
agent derived from a plant used by native tribes in North America and Africa
for the treatment of infections.
Conte claimed that by using traditional medicines, Shaman's 'hit rate' - the
number of times screening finds a compound with activity against a certain
target - is 'one in two extracts versus the mass screening process in large
pharmaceutical companies which is one in thousands'. Shaman has policies for
compensating countries where its drugs are found. 'We are creating an
economic alternative to rain forest destruction,' said Conte.
'If they can make a living by collecting our products, it gives them an
incentive for leaving the forests intact.' Compensating a country where a
drug is discovered is a controversial idea in the pharmaceutical industry.
But Balick of the New York Botanical Garden said that drug companies are now
much more receptive to the notion.
Last year, for example, Merck signed an innovative agreement with Costa
Rica's National Institute of Biodiversity that could be one model for how
the industry could negotiate agreements that would direct money back into
source countries. Under the agreement, Merck paid the institute Dollars 51m
for the right to analyse indigenous plants and animals for possible
medicines or other products.

FT  29 SEP 92 / Technology: Old tyres take on a new life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The global mountain of several billion old tyres represents a tempting store
of materials and energy - and several ambitious projects are under way in
the US and Europe to recycle used tyres and/or burn them in power plants.
A machine for recycling tyres on a smaller scale is the Multi-Purpose
Disposer (MPD), launched this month by AEA-Beven, a joint venture between
AEA Technology of Harwell and Herbert Beven, a UK engineering company.
Each MPD, which will cost about Pounds 250,000, can consume 100,000 tyres
per year by pyrolysis. It heats them to a high temperature (above 1,000 deg
C) in the absence of oxygen. This breaks the tyres down chemically into four
by-products:
Fuel gas can be used to heat the MPD itself or burned off-line in a furnace
or boiler.
Fuel oil, similar to diesel, can also be burned in the plant or elsewhere.
Carbon or 'char' has a range of applications, including absorption of
organic chemicals from industrial effluent.
Steel is clean scrap for reprocessing.
The first MPD has been sold to North American Tyre Recycling, which has an
exclusive licensing agreement to market and manufacture the system in the US
and Canada. The company expects to sell 90 units over the next five years in
North America, where the stockpile of discarded tyres is estimated at about
3bn.
The demand is expected to come from tyre remoulders, waste management
companies and local authorities faced with large numbers of tyres clogging
up their landfill sites.
Ray Allen, head of AEA environmental engineering department, says there is
no competing technology for disposing cleanly of tyres on a small, local
scale.
The MPD makes it possible to process waste tyres where they arise - avoiding
the need for costly and environmentally damaging transportation to a large
central site.
And AEA says the machine emits less pollution (nitrogen oxides and sulphur
dioxide) than conventional large incinerators.

MOVING MOUNTAINS: LESSONS IN LEADERSHIP AND LOGISTICS FROM THE GULF WAR By
Lt General William G. Pagonis with Jeffrey L Cruikshank Harvard Business
School Press Dollars 24.95, 248 pages
IT MAY NOT be surprising that a war which the US managed to get other
countries to pay for has quickly produced a soldiers' story for business
schools. Lt Gen 'Gus' Pagonis, the diminutive Greek-American general who
commanded the entire logistical effort behind Desert Shield, Desert Storm
and the return of US troops from Saudi Arabia, has produced the Gulf War
Management Guide.
It is a tale of some heroics. The task of ferrying 560,000 armed forces
personnel halfway across the world and back to fight a war while keeping
them fed, fuelled and fit is equivalent, claims Pagonis, to moving the
population of Alaska and all their belongings to the other side of the
world.
Some of the book's numbers are boggling: the US army in the Gulf ate 122m.
meals, burned 1.3bn. gallons of fuel, read 500 tonnes of mail a day and
erected 500 new traffic signs in Saudi Arabia to guide a total of 52m. miles
driven in the theatre of operations - about 100 round trips to the moon.
Try organising that . . .
As the general does concede, he had much in his favour: such as the fact
that Saudi Arabia had huge underused military and civilian airbases (built
by the US Corps of Engineers) and vast equally underused ports within nearly
ideal range of Kuwait on which to land his forces. Neither did it hurt that
the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia had a highly-developed local economy
from which Pagonis and his men were able to procure water, trucks, fridges,
timber, fresh food and the countless other things upon which modern armies
march.
But as a concentrated task of military organisation, the deployment of US
forces in the Gulf probably has no equal. And to compound it, Pagonis was
asked under immensely demanding deadlines to organise Gen Schwarzkopf's now
famous 'Hail Mary' attacking sweep across hundreds of miles of desert to
attack Iraq's exposed western flank. Pagonis describes that to achieve this
it was necessary to create a giant military crossroads in the desert through
which an average 18 military vehicles a minute passed every day for a month.
So what does it take to run a show like this? Above all, it seems, a clear
head, fabulous self-confidence, shrewd common sense and a limitless capacity
for hard work. All characteristics Pagonis draws out, at some length, in a
detailed description of his upbringing, sculpted by the American Dream, as
the son of a Greek immigrant who sailed to the US aboard a ship called
Democracy and worked his son from the bottom up in the family hotel.
At less length, Pagonis takes us through the breathless, and breathlessly
told, task of organising and dismantling Desert Storm, and to his
conclusions; which, says the blurb, provide 'an inspirational model for
today's business executives trying to cope with an increasingly global and
complex environment'.
In essence, these apparently boil down to having a clear 'vision' of what
needs achieving, banging it home relentlessly and consistently to
subalterns, delegating where possible, being a good listener and, above all,
being ruthlessly well organised. In other than the management jargon Pagonis
employs, it seems to come down to something the rest of us might term
'military efficiency'.
But Pagonis' assertively self-confident tone gives the book, in its intended
role as champion of the logisticians' underrated art, a slightly paradoxical
feel. He makes it seem that one of the biggest military deployments in
history somehow wasn't a problem. There must have been some real cock-ups
somewhere, surely?

WRITERS ON STRATEGY AND STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT By J. I. Moore Penguin Pounds
7.99. 311 pages
EXECUTIVES AND management consultants, as well as business students, have
for 30 years made use of a Penguin reference paperback called Writers on
Organisations. Updated several times since publication in 1964, it
summarises the teaching of four dozen leading international writers, from
Frederick Taylor and Max Weber to Tom Peters, Robert Waterman and Rosabeth
Moss Kanter.
Penguin has now produced a companion paperback on the associated subject of
strategy and strategic management. This is a newer field, so the book's list
of big names is shorter than its companion, even if the volume is longer -
allowing the typeface to be larger (a welcome relief) and enabling over a
dozen pages to be allotted to each of several strategy 'greats'. These
include Igor Ansoff, Harvard's Michael Porter, and Canada's Henry Mintzberg.
Significantly, Mintzberg also rates a decent entry in the Organisations
volume. Indeed, part of his strategy entry is about organisational issues -
an indication of the extent to which the two subjects have become more
integrated since Mintzberg and others realised that the relationship between
strategy and structure is not linear in either direction - as previous
academics had argued with great authority, and ad nauseam - but is
constantly iterative.
The new volume is notable for the attention it pays to such influential
academics as Richard Rumelt, James Brian Quinn, and Charles Lindblom, names
known by far too few 'educated' European managers. But it does have
important omissions. Though it includes some of the many contributions made
to strategic analysis and management by McKinsey &amp; Co, the consultancy,
there is no mention of Ken-ichi Ohmae, whose pathfinding work on global and
'Triad' strategy has helped companies worldwide understand the forces
shaping modern international business, and how to react to them. Another
curious omission is the two-man team of CK Prahalad and Gary Hamel, of
Michigan University and London Business School respectively, who since the
late 1980s have had an impact on US and European executives which comes
close to that of Michael Porter.
On those writers who are included, some readers may be frustrated at the
shortage of critical analysis. But then, as with the Organisations book, the
purpose of the new one is to summarise the most important work of the
leading writers. With a few exceptions - such as a jibe at Ansoff, and at
Porter's controversial insistence that his 'generic strategies' are mutually
exclusive - readers must deploy their own judgment.

FT  29 SEP 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (25): What makes the top
dogs tick
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A HEAD FOR BUSINESS by Corinne Simcock Kogan Page Pounds 16.95, 164 pages
WHAT MAKES a top manager tick? Corinne Simcock has tried to find out by
interviewing 13 senior British managers on how they have run their affairs
during the recession. The best corporate survival strategy, it turns out, is
to keep a firm grip on cash-flow. If costs have to be cut, the knife should
go in clean, deep and early.
That said, there is no single recipe for success. Sir Owen Green, outspoken
chairman of BTR, is dismissive of the fashion for returning to basics or
core business. He calls it 'hocus-pocus.' The core, he says, 'is 'that which
is left after the apple is eaten.' By contrast, Christopher Lewinton, whose
TI Group recently acquired the Dowty engineering concern, believes companies
should concentrate on preparing themselves for slow growth for years to
come. According to Sir Christopher Hogg of Courtaulds, 'companies survive
because they do things for their customers which are distinctive and which
their customers want. There's no other reason.'
All this sounds like good common sense - but it is hardly original. Perhaps
the fault lies in Ms Simcock's failure to draw her subjects out
sufficiently. Nor, though, do the assembled great and the good sound
particularly brilliant in their comments on everyday life. Sir Owen Green's
reservations about Europe are the kind of chatter one could hear in any Home
Counties pub.
Sir Graham, admittedly, comes across as one of the most thoughtful of the
business leaders. It is sobering to realise, as he points out, that the
Rover group spends Pounds 30m a year more on training than would be needed
if its employees had education up to German standards.
What binds these people together is an enormous sense of self-confidence
and, generally, of their own worth. Several have difficulty focusing on that
part of their contribution which is intended to examine their weaknesses.
The other factors are stamina and a sometimes astonishing dedication to the
job in hand. Mr Jon Foulds, chairman of the Halifax Building Society,
recounts that when he was at 3i, he started looking forward to Mondays as
soon as it got to Friday night. Surely, Mr Foulds, there is more to life
than that?

DEALING WITH WHITEHALL by Philip Connelly Century Business Pounds, 208 pages
EVERY BUSINESS feels the impact of government, through decisions on economic
policy, taxation, regulation and the like. Charities, pressure groups and
trade associations have long sought to win advantages and fend off
legislative threats. Yet only recently have businesses learnt to enter the
political arena to ensure that their interests are not harmed by political
decisions.
The political battle over the future of Westland was one of the first
occasions on which lobbyists were prominently working on behalf of the major
protagonists. But the practice is fast spreading - so much so that when the
Lord Chancellor proposed reforming the legal profession, the Bar Council
employed a lobbying firm to defend the interests of barristers.
Too often, however, businesses resort to lobbying only when a threat is
perceived, rather than keeping abreast of political developments and pushing
for favourable government decisions whenever their interests are affected.
Parliament and Whitehall remain closed books for many business leaders.
Lobbyist Philip Connelly sets out to remedy this in his guide to effective
lobbying. The book offers much sensible advice on how to find out what is
going on and influence the outcome. It also contains a wealth of information
on the government machine, including helpful guides to the responsibilities
of important government departments.
Certainly there will be businesses which can use this book to do a spot of
amateur lobbying (aided, no doubt, by the recent moves to open up the
mysteries of government a little more). An intelligent young public affairs
executive could use it to gather useful intelligence, though an up-to-date
copy of Dod's Parliamentary Companion would be advisable given the speed
with which the government machine changes.
But the none-too-subtle message of the book is that high-level expertise is
essential, especially if lobbying Brussels. Since only the largest firms can
afford to employ such expertise in-house, that inevitably means using
professional lobbying firms.
Unfortunately, these can be immensely variable in quality. Some do little
more than recycle information freely available to the public in reference
books and from the House of Commons Vote Office for the benefit of clients
who pay thousands of pounds a year for the service. A chapter on how to sort
out the wheat from the chaff in choosing a lobbyist would be a valuable
addendum to any subsequent editions.

SAMUEL BRONFMAN: THE LIFE AND TIMES OF SEAGRAM'S MR SAM by Michael A
MarrusUniversity Press of New England Dollars 35
AFTER READING this authorised biography of the leader of Canada's Jewish
community I am profoundly glad my paternal grandfather never got there as he
had intended. For in Canada - more than in most non-European countries -
anti-Semitism survived the Holocaust alive and well. As late as 1947 the
country's director of immigration was still talking of the danger of
'expanding non-assimilable racial groups', and you may be sure he was not
referring to any potential Gentile threat.
Bronfman's attitude to this ingrained anti-Semitism was typical of his
generation: he simply tried to conform the harder, to make even more
obsessive efforts to prove himself (and thus Jews in general) worthy of the
marvellous society in which he - quite genuinely in his case - felt honoured
to live. Younger generations would do well not to sneer at what must now
seem like Uncle-Tomism. Unlike Bronfman and the majority of the Jewish
community (in Britain and the US as well as in Canada) they can afford to
ignore the intermittent pogroms and endemic persecution in Tsarist Russia
from which Mr Sam's family fled in the last quarter of the 19th century.
The Jewish dimension - which was inherited by his son Edgar, now president
of the World Jewish Congress - is one of the most fascinating aspects of a
biography which, although authorised, gives a rounded, and thus pretty
'wartish', portrait of an extraordinary monster - 'Mr Sam,' founder and
inspirer of one of the world's dominant liquor groups, and the only one now
not controlled from Britain.
Allowing facts to speak for themselves is a good way of getting round the
difficulties and limitations inevitable with an authorised biography -
though it helps when the younger generation does not mind the author
describing what a terrible parent the founder was.
He was absent most of the time, on his weekly commute from the family home
in Montreal to New York, and when he was at home insisted on the combination
of strict formality and unreasonably high expectations which mar the
childhood of most children of obsessive high achievers; although they did
not have to endure the outbreaks of vicious and foul-mouthed temper which
regularly marked his dealings with underlings, they also seem to have been
received fewer of the spontaneous acts of kindness of which he was also
capable.
Mr Sam was driven, obsessive, and that meant being Number One in every walk
of life, above all in the drinks business, first in North America and then
throughout the world. A member of a large and ambitious family, which had
probably been in the drinks business back in Russia (Bronf-man means
whisky-man), he was at his most ruthless when coping with competition from
his elder brother, Harry. This was open enough: Sam even started one
fraternal letter: 'Hello opposition.' Harry was pushed aside after being
unlucky enough to be the fall guy in the family's inevitable brushes with
the law - Canada being periodically subject to waves of Prohibitionist
hysteria.
But Mr Sam was also obsessive about the quality of his products; he had an
excellent palate and rightly insisted, long before it became fashionable,
that the best, most honourable (as well as, in the long term, most
profitable) policy in the liquor business was to prefer quality to quantity:
Drink Less, but Drink Better, which in Mr Sam's eyes inevitably meant
drinking one of his up-market blends, like Lord Calvert, Crown Royal or
Seven Crown, for decades the world's best-selling spirit.
As so often in these cases a firmly-held policy was also exceedingly
convenient. After Prohibition was repealed in the US in 1934, Canadian
distillers found themselves with stocks of proper straight, malt liquor
which were totally inadequate to meet the demand. So they preferred to blend
the malts, the bourbons or the rye whiskies with neutral, mass produced,
grain spirit.
Mr Sam was perfectly sincere in his belief in the superiority of blends over
straight whisky. Unlike his great rival, Lew Rosensteil, of Schenley, he
ensured that his blends were properly matured: he was obsessive about
holding adequate stocks of maturing whisky which he would not release even
on the thirstiest of markets until they were ready, and one of his greatest
triumphs was the invention of Chivas Regal, the most successful premium
blended Scotch of the post-war years.
Unfortunately Mr Marrus does not give us enough about distillation
techniques and the reason for the supposed superiority of the Seagram
blends, and he is apparently unaware of the old monster's capacity to change
with the times. The biography does not recount how in the late 1960s Mr Sam,
always on the alert for opportunity, bought Augier, the oldest firm in
Cognac, and started to build stocks of old brandies with a view to launching
Cognac's equivalent to Chivas. He may have pretended that Cognac was a
blend, but it is fundamentally different from blended whisky.
Mr Sam died before the new brand was launched, and in the confusion
following his death - his firm was notoriously unorganised, everything
depending on the old man's iron whims - his sons brought in 'marketing men'
who did not understand the liquor business. It has been left to his grandson
to fill the enormous gap in the firm's portfolio by buying Martell for more
than Pounds 600m, expenditure which would have proved unnecessary had Mr
Sam's policy been followed. You can just imagine the old bugger shouting 'I
told you so' from the grave.

THE POWER OF THE MACHINE by R A Buchanan Viking Pounds 20, 299 pages
WHAT DRIVES the wheels of progress? The machine. What drives the machine?
Wind, fire, water, electricity, nuclear fission: even, in antiquity as in
poor countries today, the patient ox and the sweating labourer.
In this highly readable book Angus Buchanan reflects on the technological
revolution which has driven the last three centuries at an increasingly
furious gallop. This is an aspect of history which often gets ignored as we
hasten to read of political intrigues and great battles. But real historical
forces lie long and deep; as Buchanan shows, it is technology that shapes
civilisations.
A history of technology has to address itself to three issues. One concerns
the invention and development of technologies. It is difficult to fathom an
inventor's psychological processes, but it is a fair bet that they have to
be well-prepared, and faced with a problem, for ideas to spark.
Development of technologies is a more objective matter, and can be traced
historically. Here the first issue merges with the second, concerning the
spread of technology. Some hold that technological knowledge is transmitted
by travellers and traders, others that similar technologies arise
simultaneously but unconnectedly in different places. Both arguments can be
supported by historical evidence, but both offer puzzles.
The third issue concerns the social impact of technology. This is the sphere
in which technology makes its civilisation-transforming impact most felt.
Two examples illustrate the point. New agricultural technologies make food
more abundant, thus supporting population growth. This puts pressure on
social institutions, which have to change in response. A butterfly effect,
magnifying changes as they spread, flows outwards from the higher crop
yields in the fields.
Another example is military technology. When one state achieves superiority
over others, it exerts dominance; whether by conquest or influence, such
dominance changes relationships, and alters the flow of goods, wealth and
people around the world. About 1000 BC the Bronze Age gave way to the Iron
Age; the reason for the switch - once furnaces could be made hot enough to
work iron - was that iron takes a better edge than bronze. So weapons, and
axes for felling forests, became sharper; and they cut a new direction for
history.
Buchanan's main concern is with the period from 1700 AD. Since then
technological change has been extraordinarily rapid. The key is power. Power
is what makes possible any kind of making and doing, the stuff of
technology. So Buchanan begins the main part of his book with a discussion
of sources of power, from animals (including man) up to the internal
combustion engine and electricity. The importance of the 18th century as
marking a sudden acceleration in technological development is the advent of
steam power.
The idea of steam power was first mooted by Hero of Alexander in antiquity,
but it was only in the late 18th century, partly as a result of advancement
in natural science, that the idea became reality. Scientific enquiry had
offered two crucial discoveries: that the atmosphere has weight, and that a
partial vacuum can be created in a closed vessel.
It is a relatively simple matter to put these ideas to work. Place a freely
moving piston in a cylinder closed at the bottom and open at the top.
Introduce steam below the piston; condense it with a jet of cold water, thus
creating a partial vacuum, and atmospheric pressure will push the piston
down. Attach the piston to a beam to which other rods or wheels are
connected, and motion is imparted to them - to raise water, turn looms, pull
loads. The piston is raised again by the weight of the attachments to the
beam in the course of its revolution, and the process begins again.
Refinements to this simple device soon had whole landscapes of smoking
factories at work, producing goods to be whistled by rail to quaysides where
freighters lay ready to steam across the seas.
The economic and technological impulse of these developments led in an
accelerating path to other forms of engine based on more powerful and
flexible principles. Transport and communications provide examples of the
revolution which has taken place in the present century alone; but at a
cost, in pollution among other things, which makes Buchanan gravely doubt
whether it is sustainable.
From the sources of power to its uses, and from these to the effects of
technology on people, the state, and the future: Buchanan takes us on a
thought-provoking and instructive tour of the facts and problems.
He shows that anyone living reflectively in the complexities of the present
should wish to be soundly informed about technology, its history and its
meaning. His book enjoyably satisfies that wish.

JANE'S URBAN TRANSPORT SYSTEMS 1992-93 edited by Chris Bushell Jane's
Information Group Pounds 135, 591 pages
URBAN TRAFFIC congestion is not a new problem, but new solutions are being
sought.
Where once planners accommodated traffic growth by building more roads, in
many towns and cities this is no longer seen as environmentally acceptable.
As a result, public transport is increasingly coming back into its own.
However, as demand for public transport grows, so does the problem of who
should pay for it. Governments cannot afford to pick up the bill, and the
difficulties of obtaining developer contributions were highlighted earlier
this year when cash-strapped Olympia &amp; York, the developer of Canary Wharf
in London's Docklands, defaulted on its planned contribution to the cost of
extending London Underground's Jubilee Line.
The solution, according to Chris Bushell in his foreword to the annual
edition of Jane's Urban Transport Systems, is to charge motorists for use of
the roads and to apply the proceeds to the provision of better public
transport. This in turn might tempt more motorists to abandon their cars.
In practice, however, political realities have discouraged the widespread
application of this idea. Hence, this comprehensive guide to the state of
urban transport around the world highlights - in sometimes depressing detail
 -a widening gap between supply and demand, a situation which is likely to
persist as long as the nettle remains to be grasped.

MYTH, HISTORY AND THE INDUSTRIALREVOLUTION by D C Coleman Hambledon Press
Pounds 32, 225 pages
FIRST, A Cambridge High Table joke about Oxford: ask an Oxford economist who
invented the term 'Industrial Revolution' and the smart reply will be
'Arnold Toynbee, who got it from Marx.' Hardly hysterical, particularly
since it was Friedrich Engels in Die Lage Englands (1844) who used the term
repeatedly; but the wit uncovers arcane disagreement in recondite quarters,
the beginnings of a battle over business history.
The question which taxes DC Coleman throughout his ten selected essays
(1953-1989) is this: 'What is business history?' Myth, History and the
Industrial Revolution strikes at industrial, economic and business history
from several angles. These densely compiled essays are explorations in the
area, conceptual accounts and statistical feats, everywhere bowed with the
fruits of learning.
There are pieces on Adam Smith, Naval Dockyards Under the Stuarts and a fine
examination of 'Proto-industrialisation.' Coleman writes indirectly and
capaciously, spreading his knowledge. An essay on Marx refers to the English
Romantics, one on 'Gentleman and Players' dealing with business competence
in Victorian England touches on Castiglione and JH Newman.
His abiding concern with business history begins with the concept of the
Industrial Revolution, born of Romanticism and Revolution, widespread in
continental Europe but slow to reach England. Without it and its heroes,
whether theoreticians like Adam Smith or practitioners such as Josiah
Wedgewood, business history would not exist.
So, what is business history, and why write it? In two essays, 'Historians
and Businessmen' and 'The Use and Abuse of Business History', Coleman makes
his pitch. He has, after all, written a three-volume history of Courtaulds
and keeps a professional interest in supporting the stock.
Business history, as Coleman sees it, is the kind of book written by Charles
Wilson on Unilever (1954, 1968) and WJ Reader on Imperial Chemical
Industries (1975), both substantial works which deliver as much about the
business environment as about the respective companies. Coleman maintains
that we can use business history to learn from the past, just as we learn
from political or social history. He sees the company, including the
nationalised industry, as the fundamental unit of economic and social
history over the last hundred years.
But company history is not business history. Access to the records of a
company, bank or firm (lawyers, accountants, architects) invariably comes
only with the company's commission to write the house history; and that can
mean censorship and limitation. Forty years ago, most business history was
of this type. The gain to the commissioning company was, and continues to be
straightforward: where a commercial publisher wants a straight return on
investment by sales, a business commissioning its own history hopes for a
return in image.
So what can and do business historians write, if not company history? Since
Wilson's 1954 book on Unilever, academic business history has turned to
industries: steel, brewing, glass, shipping, insurance, banking. Business
history has none the less divided into anecdotal inside-house history, and
turgid academic texts, all narrative and no analysis.
What business history needs now is research and writing which understand the
most important organisational unit of the economy and which recognise lines
of business influence and tradition. As George Eliot said: 'The past still
travels with us from afar, and what we have been makes us what we are.'
Coleman advocates greater, freer access to company records together with
company sponsorship of research into specific issues (just as pharmaceutical
or engineering companies support academic research) in the hope that
business history will become part of the MBA curriculum: 'Those responsible
for education in business management will be failing the needs of their
subject if they continue to ignore the lessons of the business past.' The
discipline of business history still lacks a general introduction. There is
a worthwhile book waiting to be written.

Valley

<TEXT>
ACCIDENTAL EMPIRES by Robert X CringelyViking Pounds 16.99, 324 pages
ROBERT CRINGELY has heroes, villains and sweeping conclusions, appropriately
enough for the gossip columnist of a US trade magazine. Accidental Empires,
his idiosyncratic history of the US personal computer business, includes a
good measure of all three: it is subtitled How the boys of Silicon Valley
make their millions, battle foreign competition and still can't get a date.
His heroes are too honest for their own good. Mitchell Kapor, for example,
is founder of Lotus Development Corporation, and designer of 1-2-3, the
world's best-selling spreadsheet. A former disc jockey and transcendental
meditation teacher, the success of 1-2-3 left him fabulously wealthy and,
Cringely says, needlessly guilt-ridden: 'I think Mitch Kapor isn't happy
because he feels like an imposter . . . Imposters are people who feel they
haven't earned their success, haven't paid their dues - that it was all too
easy'.
Kapor spotted and exploited a unique opportunity. In the early 1980s he
believed that there would be a ready market for a good spreadsheet program
suitable for the newly launched IBM PC, and planned on selling Dollars 4m
worth of 1-2-3 in the first year. Sales in fact topped Dollars 53m (Pounds
30.9m) and Lotus grew to be one of the world's largest software houses.
Kapor found running a business less fun than starting one and left in 1986.
Cringely's villains start black and he paints them blacker. Bill Gates,
founder and chief executive of the US software company Microsoft, is his
principal target. Credited with a personal fortune of more than Dollars 7bn,
Gates is one of the richest people in the US but, most would agree, hard to
like. He is arrogant, charmless and possessed of an outsize business
aggression which has driven Microsoft to annual sales of more than Dollars
2.5bn but won him few friends on the way.
But this is merely the point at which Cringely begins to turn the knife. We
learn of Gates' scruffy personal habits, his meanness, his infantile
behaviour and so on and so forth. What did Gates ever do to Cringeley to
merit such treatment?
Here is his analysis of the origin of the personal computer business: 'The
game was started to satisfy the needs of disenfranchised nerds like Bill
Gates who didn't meet the macho standards of American maleness and so looked
for a way to create their own adolescent alternative to the adult world and,
through that creation, gain the admiration of their peers'.
Heroes and villains apart, Cringely's major conclusion is that US
manufacturers should forget the personal computer hardware business. Profit
margins are narrowing, other nations are catching up in the technology
stakes and the entrepreneurs and technical wizards who made the whole thing
happen are tiring of the struggle:
'Today, everyone who wants to be in the pc business is already in it . . .
The business is slowing down and this loss of energy is the greatest threat
to our computing future as a nation. Forget about the Japanese; their threat
is nothing compared to this loss of intellectual vigour,' Cringeley argues.
He believes the US should concentrate on the two remaining growth areas  -
microprocessors and software - where he thinks America still has a
technological lead. But his case is spoilt by the fact that much of this
book is filled with anecdotal evidence of amateurishness, greed and lack of
attention to quality which, he implies, permeates the US personal computer
industry.
The Japanese are already making startling progress in software. On this
evidence they will win hands-down on quality.

APPROACHING ZERO: DATA CRIME AND THE COMPUTER UNDERWORLD by Bryan Clough and
Paul Mungo Faber Pounds 14.99, 242 pages
COMPUTER FRAUD is estimated to cost UK and US banks and companies more than
Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.1bn) annually, yet 85 per cent of incidents are never
reported. Approaching Zero tracks the origins of computer 'hacking', from
its birth in the American sub-culture of the 1970s to a worldwide phenomenon
that recognises no national boundaries and, some believe, threatens the
high-tech foundations of modern society.
Written in a lively style by accountant and computer security expert Bryan
Clough and journalist Paul Mungo, the book explores the shadowy world of the
'programmers and technobrats' who use their skills and the telephone system
to circumvent computer access codes and passwords, sometimes just to leave
behind computer 'viruses' which can destroy data and can wreak havoc with
computer systems. The text is peppered with the colourful 'handles' or
aliases of hackers, many of which are straight out of the world of comic
books - men like Captain Crunch, widely acknowledged as the father of
hacking, Phiber Optik, and sinister gangs such as the Legion of Doom whose
members are committed to destroying computer system.
John Draper, alias Captain Crunch, once described hackers as the Silicon
Brotherhood. Membership of the Brotherhood is fluid - you are a member when
you know you are - and today probably comprises about 2,000 of the smartest,
most obsessive computer 'freaks' worldwide. In spite of sophisticated
security systems it seems that no computers are safe. As is well documented,
teenage hackers using cheap home computers have penetrated even the most
'secure' systems including those at NASA, NATO and the Pentagon.
The book provides an insight into what motivates these mostly young
high-tech outlaws. In some cases it is profit, sometimes it appears to be
the sheer excitement of digital vandalism, but more often than not the
hackers simply enjoy outwitting the computer security experts, usually
managing to stay just one step ahead of the law.
For some readers the narrative may appear too flippant. But there is a
serious underlying point to the book. Zero is when a computer system is
devoid of data, memory or function, and the authors suggest we are
'approaching zero' because the technology and means to wipe out computer
systems do indeed exist.

THE HISTORY OF BLACK MINEWORKERS IN SOUTH AFRICA: 1871-1948 by V L Allen The
Moor Press, Keighley, W Yorks Pounds 18, 491 pages
STUDDED WITH DIAMONDS AND PAVED WITH GOLD by Laurie Flynn Bloomsbury Pounds
20, 358 pages
ONE OF the most remarkable and fascinating aspects of the history of
Southern Africa is the story of the labour recruitment system which was, and
is, fundamental to the development and exploitation of the region's mineral
riches.
For many years the detail of this system remained - deliberately - obscure.
South Africa's black miners, drawn from all over the region, far beyond the
frontiers of the Union and then the Republic, were the unacknowledged
dynamic of the white economy.
Historians have been chipping away at the rockface of mining house secrecy
since the pioneering work of Professor Francis Wilson, and here are two new,
worthwhile though not unbiased, examples.
Professor Allen's first volume on South Africa's National Union of
Mineworkers is a perfectly good example of partisan history, not without
value at the margin. He is an expert on British mining trade unionism and
has in retirement switched his attention - exhaustive, sometimes rambling -
to South Africa where this first volume, finishing in 1948 (when things got
really interesting), has at its core the history of the development of the
WNLA and NRC recruitment networks with which the Chamber of Mines controlled
the flow of black labour to the mines on the Reef. It is not exactly light
reading, but beneath the old-fashioned Marxist approach there is much to
engage the attention of anyone interested in South African affairs.
If Professor Allen cannot expect to be an honoured guest at the executive
dining rooms in Main Street, Johannesburg, still less can the banned Mr
Flynn, whose Studded in Diamonds, Paved with Gold sets out to discuss why
80,000 miners have died in South Africa's mines in the course of this
century - 95 per cent of them black. It is an unapologetically partisan
indictment of South Africa's mining houses, apparently based on the author's
researches as a television reporter.
His personal involvement in the topic is not denied. His thesis is that
'since their origins under British colonial power, the mining houses have
had scant regard for human rights, and since the arrival in power of the
Nationalists in 1948, the companies have collaborated closely with the
apartheid State, voluntarily choosing to become entwined in its policies and
brutalities and augmenting these with many cruelties of their own . . .'
This is a jumbled, confused, badly-written book, but it makes a point. If I
were a PR man for Anglo, or JCI, or Gencor, or Rand Mines, or Gold Fields,
or Anglovaal, I would like to be able to answer him. I might find it
difficult.

FINANCIAL ENTERPRISE IN SOUTH AFRICA SINCE 1950 edited by Stuart Jones
Macmillan Pounds 45, 316 pages
A STROLL around the streets of central Johannesburg confirms one of the most
enduring truths - and cliches - about South Africa: the extent to which
First and Third Worlds exist alongside each other.
At the heart of the town lies Bank City, the new corporate headquarters of
First National Bank (formerly Barclays), spanning four blocks and breaking
new ground in corporate machismo. All around it, however, are thousands of
black street hawkers, selling their small wares - tobacco, sweets, fruit -
for cash, and operating beyond the sophisticated systems which banks like
First National offer.
Stuart Jones's book, consisting of 12 essays, is a competent exposition of
how this well-developed financial infrastructure evolved over the past 40
years. It includes monetary and fiscal policy overviews, a look at the
growth of indigenous institutions such as the Afrikaans bank Volkskas, the
development of oil, merchant banking and hire purchase sectors, and a look
at the growth of the stock exchange.
Although Jones himself contributes in an accessible and interesting fashion,
some of the other contributions are rather stolid and certainly only of
specialist interest. And while the book warrants a place on the shelves of
committed South Africa watchers, its utility would have been enhanced, given
the rapid pace of transition underway, had some effort been made to
synthesise the past and the future.
There are, for example, pregnant hints of disapproval about the
controversial subject of concentration of control on the Johannesburg Stock
Exchange, but no attempt is made to analyse the cogency of arguments about
pyramids and concentration, and to predict how this important issue will
develop.
Long lead times have also left the book curiously dated in parts. Thus the
chapter about monetary policy, for example, was completed before Dr Chris
Stals stook over as governor nearly three years ago. His single-minded fight
against inflation, and the political freedom he has been given to pursue
this difficult task, have arguably been the main economic features of the
recent past. You would not know it from this book.
Likewise, the chapter about the Development Bank of South Africa strikes the
wrong note by concentrating on its apartheid origins and close links with
government. Jones neglects the remarkable evolution of the past few years
whereby the bank has developed a considerable reputation as a source of
non-partisan developmental expertise, to the extent that the African
National Congress (ANC) has used it as a source of input in developing
economic policy. This new orientation was recently illustrated by the way in
which the nomination of ex-Finance Minister Mr Barend du Plessis as chairman
of the bank was scuppered through both internal and external pressure.
The book was also completed too soon to take adequate account of the
important Deposit Taking Institutions (DTI) Act passed early last year which
put banks and building societies on to the same legislative footing and
brought South Africa into line with international capital adequacy
requirements. This precipitated major rationalisation in the banking sector,
leading to the formation of ABSA, the country's largest banking group.
A related, curious omission is the decision not to write about the massive
growth of the life offices movement in South Africa during the 19802, when
their ability to provide real returns in an inflationary environment saw a
huge shift in savings flows towards them. Both on grounds of innovation and
influence - the manner in which they manage their huge funds is already a
point of political contention - this sector deserved attention.

THE CONSUMERIST MANIFESTO: ADVERTISING IN POST-MODERN TIMES by Martin
Davidson Routledge Pounds 35/Pounds 10.99, 217 pages
PERHAPS the only comfort to be drawn from the UK's recession is that it has
stemmed the avalanche of meretricious books about advertising, public
relations and marketing generally - Lord knows, there are enough of them
around. But useful books on advertising still manage to find a publisher and
fortunately that includes the The Consumerist Manifesto.
Despite a thoroughly opaque, misleading title - probably invented by a
public relations team which has not read the book but is desperate to find
an audience - The Consumerist Manifesto has appeared at a time when the
advertising world is still busily examining its own navel, wondering if its
immediate future will be as commercially appalling as its recent past.
Davidson's analysis of what advertising does and how it does it weaves a
sometimes inebriated path between academic and industrial sources. But he
does a good job of unpicking the ponderous anti-advertising moralisms of
left-inclined culture-watchers - such as Raymond Williams  - and usefully
reminds us that, after all, practitioners of advertising are often very
intelligent and have a powerful influence in contemporary society.
We ought to frame the kind of absurdity otherwise intelligent people commit
when they dabble in fields beyond them. Here is Umberto Eco: 'For a Milanese
bank clerk a TV ad for a refrigerator represents a stimulus to buy, but for
an unemployed peasant in Calabria the same image means a confirmation of a
world of prosperity that doesn't belong to him and that he must conquer.
That is why I believe TV advertising in depressed countries functions as a
revolutionary message.'
The irony is that such half-baked thinking is precisely what leftist critics
of advertising and consumerism normally accuse advertising of being
responsible for.
Davidson balances their miscomprehensions of the advertising process with a
challenging polemic as to the essence of contemporary society. We are all
consumers now, he argues: 'Consumption is now the basic mode for all
activity in our society, not reading, not using, not appreciating, not
participating, not producing but consuming . . . built into this is the
demand that the world accommodate us better, that we consume it more not
less; in other words we consume aspirationally.'
In other words, though Davidson does not make this point explicitly, we have
moved from being swayed by the unique selling point (USP) of the product to
being persuaded by its ESP, or emotional selling point, and the best
advertising, in the UK at least, has moved ground recently to reflect that
subtle but crucial socio-cultural change.
That is a useful insight which advertisers and advertising agencies are
increasingly grasping and exploring. To bemoan the cultural shifts which
underlie the move towards widening consumerist mentality, and to sneer at
advertising - the most visible expression of consumer aspiration, is to spit
into the wind.
The Consumerist Manifesto is a timely and, though sometimes quite
derivative, a very useful summary of most of the key intellectual issues
underlying the functions and methods of advertising, itself one of the most
complicated and powerful forms of human communication.

DISEASE-MONGERS by Lynn Payer John Wiley Dollars 22.95, 292 pages
AND YOU thought the NHS was bad. Here is a chilling new book from the US
which reveals a conspiracy by the money-grubbing health care industry to
convince basically healthy folks that they are ill, and slightly ill people
that they are at death's door. Lynn Payer, the former medical correspondent
for the International Herald Tribune, has written what is sure to be a
controversial best-seller. It is mandatory reading for Americans, but there
are some lessons for Europeans, too.
Ms. Payer's thesis is that the public is being over-diagnosed,
over-medicated, and over-operated upon, because tests, drugs, and surgical
procedures are big business. Since the demand for 'health' is infinite, the
industry (doctors, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies) can sell ever more
drugs and services, whether or not they are really needed. But to do this,
people must be frightened into believing they are not healthy (or could be
healthier). Ms. Payer calls this 'disease-mongering'.
The book cites a plethora of examples, including 'Lyme' Disease, Chronic
Fatigue Syndrome, chronic candidiasis, depression and 'stress tests'. In
each case, she documents how the problem has been hyped and exaggerated out
of proportion. Healthy people become unwell just by worrying whether their
tiredness is 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', which is itself simply a fancy name
for being tired. And doctors order huge numbers of tests and then prescribe
drugs for problems which could, in most cases, be cured by the body's own
processes.
Ms. Payer criticises the 'medicalisation' of normal events, such as
menopause and short height. As a result of huge media hype, Premarin (a
female hormone replacement drug) is the fourth most prescribed medicine in
the US. This drug may reduce the risk of osteoporosis and heart attacks, but
it also may increase the risk of cancer.
Women are being told they are crazy to refuse hormone replacement, even
though many would rather die of heart attacks than of breast cancer. And
similar panic has caused many children of below-average height to be treated
with growth hormones. But there is no evidence that these treatments produce
a taller adult; and some of those treated before 1985 developed terrible
side effects later in life.
The book also blasts the 'diseasing' of risk factors, such as high
cholesterol and blood pressure. As Ms. Payer points out, these conditions
are not diseases but indications of risks for heart disease. People with
slightly high cholesterol and no other risk factors may suffer more from
taking cholesterol-lowering drugs than they would from eating bacon. Another
scam: promoting mammography as a cure-all for breast cancer when it does not
even detect cancer in young women's' dense breast tissue.
Why is disease-mongering so successful? Ms. Payer offers several reasons.
Too many doctors (44 per cent more than in 1980) are competing for too few
insured patients. Doctors and hospitals are reimbursed for procedures, not
for outcomes. Fear of malpractice lawsuits encourages doctors to prescribe
too many diagnostic tests. The pharmaceutical industry has incentives to
develop and promote more drugs, especially for chronic and marginal
ailments. US advertising law permits drug companies to market products
directly to consumers. Popular health magazines hype risks with headlines
such as '80 per cent of US males at risk for premature death', and rely on
drug companies for advertising revenues.
According to the author, disease-mongering is responsible for much of
America's rocketing health care costs. Medical testing is a definite
villain. 'The only two mammals to remove blood regularly from other mammals
are vampire bats and humans,' says the book: the US spends Dollars 27bn
(Pounds 15.70bn) per year on 5bn to 10bn medical tests.
Even more troubling is the human cost of unnecessary treatment. Ms Payer
describes numerous cases in which perfectly healthy people fell ill and died
as a result of the side-effects of medical tests or inappropriate
medication.
This book will compel any reader to see that common sense, and the old
'ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure' philosophy, is right - most
of the time. It should also arouse a healthy scepticism of the health care
industry and the unholy alliance of interests in America. However, the book
suggests that the core problem is due to the health care system being too
business-like.
I would argue quite the opposite: if this were a business, the focus would
be on catering to the patient-as-customer. Which would produce better and
more affordable care, prompt treatment and a more humane system.

FT  29 SEP 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (11): The message from
Mercury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PHONE WARS: THE STORY OF MERCURYCOMMUNICATIONS by Keith Bradley Century
Business Pounds 16.99, 248 pages
THE STARTING point for this book is a vision of Mercury as a prototypical
company of the 1990s: a service sector business, operating at the forefront
of technology with a highly skilled workforce. Thus, as Keith Bradley points
out, its experience holds some clear lessons for modern management.
By and large his book concentrates on this aspect of Mercury's history. In
the process it acquires a focus which tends to underplay the regulatory
issues which have been so much at the forefront debate over British
telecommunications in recent years.
To be sure, the book does go into some detail about how Mercury was
conceived by government as a way of making BT more efficient. 'I invented
the mouse to make the elephant (BT) dance,' says Lord, formerly Sir Keith,
Joseph.
The author describes the frustrations Mercury met along the way. Defeat in
its attempt to sue the Post Office Engineers Union for obstructing Mercury's
inter-connection with the BT network was only avoided when BT almost as an
afterthought admitted that its employees had a job security agreement. A
public enquiry was needed in Manchester to prove its low-emission microwave
antennae were safe.
Closer to the author's heart, though, are clearly the management issues
which this pioneering company raises. There are many of them.
Its no-union policy, for example, was a commercial rather than a political
choice decision, he says, even if it was in keeping with the mood of the
time. The commercial rationale is rather complicated, however, and rests
partly on Mercury's recognition of its need to communicate effectively with
its staff.
Companies which fail to do so risk losing their best employees, and
personnel in high-technology industries are especially mobile. But the
drawback with using a union as a means of communication between management
and staff is the risk of demarcation disputes.
Instead Mercury chose to go for a determined attempt to foster such
communications through an elaborate system of team briefings. The hope was
that its remuneration policy and emphasis on training would help it retain
skilled workers, thus ensuring a service of the highest quality.
There is no doubt that these are important issues. One could wish, however,
that Mr Bradley would come to more definitive conclusions about their worth.
One senses reservations from time to time. He notes that, despite Mercury's
purported emphasis on good remuneration, his researches uncovered a
considerable dissatisfaction over pay levels.
Perhaps he does not want to belittle the fact that Mercury's story is one of
success against all the odds. Even so, one could wish he had been a little
less polite.

FT  29 SEP 92 / Money Markets: Markets uncertain
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RATES in the sterling cash market softened yesterday, but the market seemed
unwilling to take firm positions against the uncertain backdrop for base
rates and the UK economy.
Those who are looking for a short-term cut in base rates will watch several
events this week. One is the Bundesbank council meeting on Friday which may
bring a cut in rates to compensate for the slowdown in the German economy.
The other is the Labour conference in Blackpool: dealers wonder whether a
politically-motivated rate cut could spike Mr John Smith's first conference
as Labour leader.
But other dealers argued that a rate cut was unlikely for three reasons.
First, the combined efforts of the Bundesbank and the Bank of France have
meant that the French franc has probably evaded devaluation, taking the
pressure off the German central bank to cut rates.
Secondly, German call money was at a low level of 8.75 per cent yesterday
because of the huge number of D-Marks injected into the financial system by
the Bundesbank's interventions, forcing the German authorities to cancel
this week's 'repo' operation and making the case for a rate cut even less
likely. The cost of living in Bavaria also climbed 0.2 per cent in the month
to mid-September, creating a year-on-year rise of 3.9 per cent.
Rates in the sterling cash market were softer on thin trade, with the
3-month rate closing at 9 1/16 per cent on the offered side from a previous
close of 9 1/4 per cent. 1-month money closed at 9 1/4 per cent. A market
looking for a rate cut might have been expected to deal in 1 month money at
around 8 3/4 per cent.
Futures traders were much more bullish about the prospects for a rate cut:
the December contract closed at 91.82, 4 basis points up from its previous
close. Strictly speaking, this assumes that 3 month money in December will
be at 8.18 per cent.
After forecasting a shortage of Pounds 1.15bn, the Bank of England purchased
Pounds 1m of Band 1 bank bills at 8 7/8 per cent and Pounds 960m in a
repurchase agreement at 8 15/16 per cent. In the afternoon, the forecast was
revised to Pounds 1.15bn. The Bank purchased Pounds 175m of Band 1 bank
bills and provided late assistance of Pounds 20m.

FT  29 SEP 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar falls as franc rallies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR fell more than three pfennigs against the D-Mark on the foreign
exchanges yesterday as investors prepared themselves for a potentially poor
set of US economic indicators this week, writes James Blitz.
After a fortnight of turmoil in the European exchange rate mechanism,
trading in the major European currencies eased and dealers turned their
attentions once again to the dollar.
The French franc rallied to a close of FFr3.373 against the D-Mark, nearly 6
centimes above its floor. This suggested that the united stand of the
Bundesbank and the Bank of France had avoided a humiliating devaluation. The
Swedish central bank lowered its marginal lending rate to 40 per cent from
50 per cent as pressures on the Swedish crown eased, and the Belgian
National Bank cut its key advances rate by 10 basis points to 9 per cent.
By contrast, the dollar came under intense pressure as investors speculated
on whether there will be another cut in US interest rates this week in
response to poor economic data. The market's attention is fixed on Friday's
figure for the September non-farm payroll, which is expected to reveal a
sluggish underlying trend. As Mr Gerard Lyons of DKB International observes,
10 of the 13 US interest rate cuts that have been made since the beginning
of last year happened either on or in the days following a non-farm payroll
figure, while 2 were in the days before. The dollar closed more than 3
pfennigs down against the D-Mark at DM1.4510.
Now that sterling is floating outside the ERM, the currency is even more
sensitive to fluctuations in the dollar/D-Mark rate. Yesterday afternoon, it
slumped to a historic low against the D-Mark in US trading of DM2.5080 from
the previous low of DM2.5090.
The pound has been further undermined by the lingering uncertainty over the
course of UK economic policy and the contrasting calls on the European
continent to consolidate the harder core of the ERM. The pound closed in
London 3 1/2 pfennigs down on the day at DM2.51. Investors have tended to
think that there could be another sharp fall in sterling if it breaches the
DM2.50 level.
The strength of the French franc and fears over a two-speed Europe weakened
the higher-yielding currencies inside the ERM. The Irish central bank raised
its short term facility rate to 13.75 per cent from 10.75 per cent after
dealers reported that the Irish punt had touched its ERM floor against the
D-Mark of DM2.6190. The Irish punt later closed against the D-Mark at
DM2.6275. The Spanish peseta also weakened against the D-Mark, closing at
Pta70.31, close to its ERM floor against the D-Mark of Pta72.62.

FT  29 SEP 92 / Honduras and El Salvador plan talks to defuse tension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN WALKER
</BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE presidents of Honduras and El Salvador were set yesterday to begin two
days of talks in San Salvador, amid continuing tension in border areas
following a judgment on their common frontier this month by the
International Court in the Hague.
Mr Rafael Callejas of Honduras and Mr Alfredo Cristiani of El Salvador are
expected to establish a commission to deal with the fall-out from the
decision.
Although the judgment has been received peacefully - even with enthusiasm in
both capitals - people in some of the border areas awarded to Honduras are
reluctant to take Honduran nationality.
The feelings run highest in Nahuaterique, a stronghold of the left-wing
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front during El Salvador's 12-year civil
war. The FMLN has accepted the Hague judgment but proposed that Honduras
allow the residents dual nationality.
However, Honduran law will not allow foreigners to live within 40km of the
border.
Although Mr Manuel Pacas Castro, El Salvador's foreign minister, had
suggested that, because of the tensions, the Hondurans wait three months
before taking possession, the Honduran army has entered the recovered zones.
The judgment awarded 70 per cent of the previously disputed mainland area to
Honduras and 30 per cent to El Salvador. El Salvador was awarded the Island
of Meanguera in the Gulf of Fonseca, which it has occupied for many years,
but Honduras won a guaranteed exit to the sea and maritime rights over a
strip of the Pacific Ocean.
The ruling ended a dispute which began in 1969 when a World Cup soccer
qualifying game between the two countries triggered an uprising of the
Honduran population. In a few days about 300,000 Salvadoreans who had
spilled over into Honduras had been expelled.
The forced expulsion, tolerated by the Honduran military, prompted the
Salvadorean army to invade Honduras and inflict a humiliating defeat on the
Honduran army.
The four-day 'football war' cost 5,000 lives, bolstered the Salvadorean
military and set back the cause of central American integration for more
than 20 years.
The settlement is expected to support those on both sides arguing for a
reduction in military spending. It should also reinforce the normalisation
of Central American diplomatic and political relations.

JAPAN signed an agreement in Moscow yesterday for a Dollars 100m
low-interest loan to Russia, the Ministry of Finance said, Reuter reports

The loan from the Export-Import Bank, guaranteed by the Russian government,
will go to Vneshekonombank, the former Soviet foreign trade bank. It will be
used to finance imports of food and medical supplies, the ministry said.
The loan had been pledged in December 1990, as part of humanitarian aid, but
disbursement was delayed because of Russia's failure to pay interest on debt
owed to Japan. Japan has not made large-scale loans to Russia because of a
dispute over four islands off northern Japan.

FT  29 SEP 92 / French Socialists gain seats

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S ruling Socialist party has scored a double-edged political gain in
Sunday's senate election, by winning five more seats in the upper house at
the cost of seeing its majority in the National Assembly shrink further.
Four of the new Socialist senators, including Mr Pierre Mauroy, the former
prime minister, were deputies in the national assembly. Their seats will
remain vacant, because French electoral law prevents by-elections within a
year of legislative elections, due next March.
This quirky result comes just as the government faces the possibility of an
opposition motion of censure, possibly on the 1993 budget, when the two
houses of parliament reconvene on Friday.
In June the government fought off a censure motion on EC agricultural reform
by only three votes.
The Socialists' gains in the senate, which is indirectly elected, partly by
regional councillors, do not indicate any upturn in their current political
ill-fortune, but just a reflection of local election gains three years ago.

The 100 Group is the influential body which counts most of the finance
directors of the FT-SE 100 companies among its members, along with a number
of counterparts from leading private companies. Lawrence takes over the
chair from Hugh Collum, the finance director of SmithKline Beecham, when his
two-year period of office comes to an end.
Lawrence has been a member of the executive and technical committees of the
Group. Although asked recently to take over the chairmanship, he says he has
no idea how he was selected. 'It was quite a surprise and rather
flattering,' he says. 'Financial service companies are a minority on the 100
Group and may be perceived as not sharing the same values.'
Nonetheless, he says he has plans to advance the work of the organisation in
a number of different areas. These include the continued campaign for a
change in the legislation on advance corporation tax; and to make
submissions to both the Cadbury committee on the financial aspects of
corporate governance and the Goode committee on pension reform.
He also hopes to increase representation with the European Commission,
especially over the wide variations in international accounting requirements
across the EC.

THE COMPLETE BOOK OF BUSINESS ETIQUETTE THE ESSENTIAL GUIDE TO GETTING AHEAD
IN BUSINESS by Lynne Brennan and David Block Piatkus Books Pounds 8.99, 185
pages
IMAGINE TRYING to run a factory with 60,000 employees, required to produce
enough nails for one billion people. You cannot fire anyone, you cannot
raise wages, you cannot even quit (though you can be tossed back to
peasant-servitude for failing to meet the annual nail quota). Information is
scarce, spare parts are unavailable, and half the foremen cannot read. How
on earth do Chinese managers manage?
Malcolm Warner sheds some light on this mystery in his fascinating study,
How Chinese Managers Learn, the first book to examine management and
industrial training in China.
A Fellow of Wolfson College, Cambridge, Professor Warner traces the
development of management training in China since 1984, when the Central
Committee set the goal of creating 'a mighty contingent of managerial and
technical cadres'. The book examines the characteristics of Chinese
management and reviews the programmes put in place to train managers:
courses, curriculi, examinations, faculty, funding and links to industrial
enterprises and government institutions.
As Professor Warner points out, trying to teach one billion people to
produce things in huge enterprises is no easy task, not least in a country
where the Cultural Revolution wiped out a generation of managers and
trainers.
Nevertheless, the 1980s economic reforms forced China to accept that a
successful, productive economy requires a trained workforce. Since only 1
per cent of the Chinese population is admitted to higher education (the
figure is 9 per cent in India and 30 per cent in Japan), the task is
enormous. Moreover, the whole idea of training managers sits uncomfortably
with ancient Chinese traditions, such as absolute respect for one's elders.
So China embarked upon a quest to teach modern technological skills with a
Confucian twist.
Professor Warner describes (in painstaking detail) the various schemes that
have been instituted. There are senior executive training centres (for
managers of large factories) in six large cities: Beijing, Chengdu, Fuzhhou,
Shanghai, Tianjin and Wuhan. Universities conduct programmes ranging from
operations effectiveness and managerial economics to management of
pharmaceutical enterprises. The World Bank, western universities and other
western institutions participate in many of these programmes. There is even
a China-European Community Joint MBA programme, which the book examines in
depth.
The important question is whether all this training has made a difference.
The book suggests that results are mixed. Efforts to create a truly dynamic
managerial caste have been hindered by the Confucian element, which reveres
the instructor and expects passive subordination from the student. Professor
Warner writes that 95 per cent of senior managers pass the main examination
because it would be too embarrassing for the state to send them back home if
they flunked.
On the other hand, management training has become immensely popular in
China, attracting top-calibre students and professors. Every bright Chinese
youth wants an MBA these days. And with Guangdong Province growing at 15 per
cent per annum, perhaps we should send a few more Westerners to study over

HALLENSTEIN Glasson, the New Zealand men's wear chain, has reported a 70 per
cent rise in net profits to NZDollars 6.8m (USDollars 3.7m) for the 12
months to August 1, up from NZDollars 4.04m.
The directors said the new year had begun 'very well', with the company
overcoming poor weather which meant slow sales of spring fashions.
Despite this, sales for August and September were running 20 per cent ahead
of last year. However 'early season sales volumes are traditionally lower
than later months, making growth of this magnitude difficult to maintain
throughout the summer season,' they said.
Sales for the year advanced to NZDollars 123.01m from NZDollars 109.96m.

BURROUGHS Wellcome, the US subsidiary of Wellcome, yesterday announced it
had acquired the 50 per cent it did not own of Welgen Manufacturing
Partnership, a biotechnology manufacturing joint-venture with GI
Manufacturing of the US.
Wellcome is paying Genetics Institute, GI Manufacturing's parent company,
about Dollars 24m for the stake. Welgen will be incorporated into Burroughs
Wellcome's manufacturing subsidiary.
'Biopharmaceutical products and manufacturing play an important part in our
new product portfolio. This acquisition expands our company's capability to
pursue full clinical and commercial development of products produced through
bio-technology and manufacture them,' said Mr Philip Tracy, president and
chief executive of Burroughs Wellcome.
Welgen manufactures Wellferon, a treatment for hepatitis B and hairy cell
leukaemia at its West Greenwich, Rhode Island plant. The drug, which was
launched in 1986, is also being tested to see if it can alleviate the
condition of patients infected by HIV, the virus that causes Aids. It has
been studied as a treatment for genital warts and juvenile laryngeal
papillomatosis.
Wellcome expects to set up production of Campath-1H, a cancer treatment, at
the site. The drug is in phase one and two trials for the treatment of
Hodgkins lymphomas and rheumatoid arthritis.

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOODYEAR, the last surviving large US-owned tyre company, said it expected
to achieve third-quarter earnings higher than the Dollars 1.01 per share
recorded in the same period last year.
The Akron-based Goodyear, which also said its chief financial officer
resigned yesterday, forecast another quarterly sales record, with total
revenues coming at around the second quarter level of more than Dollars 3bn.
In the third quarter of 1991, Goodyear earned Dollars 59.1m on sales of
Dollars 2.8bn.
Goodyear said its improved third-quarter results had been helped by cost
containment, the successful introduction of new products, improved
productivity and a strengthened distribution network.
On Wall Street, investors seemed unimpressed at the prospect of only
slightly better third-quarter revenues from Goodyear. The company's share
price closed Dollars  5/8 lower at Dollars 58 3/8 after dipping to Dollars
57 7/8 .
Mr Oren Shaffer, the Goodyear chief financial officer, will meanwhile resign
from his position on Thursday 'to pursue other interests'.
He will be replaced by Mr Samir Gibara, a vice-president of strategic
planning and business development.
Goodrich, the aerospace and specialty chemicals company that in 1988 sold
off its tyre division, said its third-quarter earnings would be
significantly below market expectations.
The Ohio company said it was likely to report only a modest profit for the
quarter. Analysts had been expecting Goodrich to earn Dollars 10m, or 30
cents a share. But Goodrich said the earnings would be well below the second
quarter's Dollars 13.1m, or 43 cents a share.
Mr John Ong, chairman, said the specialty chemicals and polyvinyl chloride
businesses depended in large measure on the strength of the US economy.

FT  28 SEP 92 / Generator faces pressure to scrap contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is putting pressure on state-owned Nuclear Electric to cancel
some of its contracts for selling power to regional distribution companies.
The aim is to create more room in the market for electricity generated from
coal, and so ease the conclusion of British Coal's latest round of
contracts, which are due to be negotiated while it is still in the public
sector.
Although British Coal has agreed terms for new contracts with the power
generators, they still depend on the ability of generators to sell the power
on to the regional distributors.
The government's attempts to make space in the electricity market have
angered Nuclear Electric, which operates the 12 nuclear power stations in
England and Wales, and the distributors. It is still not clear whether the
tactic will succeed.
Neither the Department of Trade and Industry nor Nuclear Electric was
willing to comment, and Norweb, one of the distribution companies involved,
said it could not discuss commercial negotiations.
The contracts date back to December last year when Nuclear Electric held an
auction at which the distribution companies bid for short-term and long-term
supplies. They were signed at an average price believed to be 2.8p per kWh,
but the new coal-based contracts are being offered at between 3.2p and 3.5p.
Regional companies are therefore in effect being asked to buy costlier
power. Although they are allowed to pass all changes in their electricity
costs through to their customers, higher prices would still damage their
image and their sales.
The government may also be counting on driving a wedge between those
distribution companies which have nuclear contracts on what now appear to be
very good terms, and those which do not and therefore resent being obliged
to buy costlier power.
If the government persuaded Nuclear Electric to cancel the contracts, it
seems that the distribution companies would be told it was because of force
majeure.
The contracts are based on hedging arrangements, rather than direct supply,
and would not affect the capacity of Nuclear Electric if they were
cancelled. The company, which as a generator has about 20 per cent of the
market, is keen to demonstrate commercial independence.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISILLUSIONMENT with Labour's drift to the political centre is expressed in
composite motions to be taken at conference this week, signalling that the
party's increasingly marginalised leftwing is intent on remaining vocal.
Although these motions are certain to be defeated, they presage a less than
comfortable ride for the leadership in some debates.
The leadership's push to become 'pale imitations of the Tories or Liberals'
and to substitute 'show business for socialism' has 'now proved on two
occasions to be futile', asserts one of the most out-spoken composites.
It urges the party to 're-adopt and re-assert those policies which give hope
to those who fear for their homes, their health, their jobs, their
children's and their own futures'.
Where the party leadership does again look set for defeat, however, is on
defence, where a motion urges the party to reaffirm the commitment of past
conferences to cut defence expenditure to the average level of other west
European countries.
On employment policy, one motion calls on a future Labour government to
'repeal all anti-union laws', noting that the re-election of a Conservative
government in April meant 'the seventh round' of such legislation since
1980.

BRITISH FOOD manufacturers have maintained their profit margins and rates of
return on capital during the recession in spite of a sharp decline in
profits growth in the past three years, according to a survey of 112
companies published by The Grocer magazine, Guy de Jonquieres writes.
The survey, by OC&amp;C Strategy Consultants, finds that operating margins in
1991-92 averaged 7.1 per cent, slightly higher than in the previous year and
the same as in 1989-90. Return on capital, at 18.7 per cent, was the same as
in 1990-91, though below the 20 per cent achieved in 1989-90. But average
operating profit in the most recent year grew by only 4.2 per cent compared
with 3.4 per cent a year before and 17.9 per cent three years ago.

FT  28 SEP 92 / Michael Prowse on America: The twilight of foreign aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The news that Sweden is to cut its foreign aid budget sharply is, in its
way, almost as richly symbolic as the crumbling of the Berlin Wall.
The fall of the wall symbolised the collapse of communism and a radical
change in relations between the rich capitalist democracies and the
centrally planned eastern bloc. The paring of the aid budget in a nation
long renowned for its exceptional generosity symbolises a waning global
commitment to aid and the beginning of a shift in relations between advanced
countries and the other main component of the global order that emerged
after the second world war: the third world.
Aid fatigue was palpable at last week's annual IMF/World Bank meeting. The
bank is seeking donations for a new cycle of lending by the International
Development Association (IDA), its concessional finance affiliate. It had
hoped for a substantial increase in resources - to reflect the needs of nine
newly eligible countries (including some former Soviet republics) and the
cost of environmental pledges made at the Rio earth summit. But Mr Lewis
Preston, the bank's president, left in sombre mood, wondering whether even
the Dollars 18bn needed to maintain the current volume of loans would be
forthcoming.
Foot-dragging on IDA is part of a broader retreat from a postwar consensus
that rich countries had a duty to help the poor. Aid flows have stagnated
for a decade despite substantial growth of real output. Only five of the 20
richest countries have achieved the United Nations target of development
assistance equivalent to 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product. The ratios
in the US and Britain are far below target, at about 0.2-0.3 per cent of
GDP. In the richest 20 countries military spending is about 11 times greater
than foreign aid.
The retrenchment partly reflects severe budgetary strains in developed
countries. But the origins run far deeper. Nobody should be surprised that
the pressure to cut aid budgets has emerged so soon after the absorption of
communist countries into the capitalist order.
The two trends are not unrelated. Harry Truman, the architect of the US
'containment of communism' strategy, also laid the foundations for an
unprecedented expansion of official aid programmes. From a US vantage point,
one of the main goals of overseas assistance was always to help prevent the
spread of communism. Now that we are (almost) all capitalists, the
geopolitical case for aid has vanished.
Shifts in the intellectual climate have also played a role. Prominent
critics of aid in the 1960s and 1970s, such as the British economist, the
now Lord Peter Bauer, are still out of the mainstream. But their arguments
are no longer quite so controversial.
Aid has a somewhat devalued status: most economists now accept that the
creation of markets and the lowering of barriers to trade and foreign
investment are likely to play a bigger role in long-term development than
official assistance.
The risks attached to aid programmes are also better understood. Aid is
always support for particular governments rather than for poor people: if
governments are corrupt or inefficient, aid will achieve little.
Aid flows, moreover, while small in absolute terms, are often large relative
to the tax resources of third-world governments. By increasing the public
sector's political power, they may sometimes inhibit the emergence of
beneficial market and trade relationships.
The heady post-1945 expansion of foreign aid paralleled the growth of
welfare states in advanced countries. Now both are in retreat. Welfare is
often attacked for fostering 'dependency'. The power of this movement in the
US is evident in the reformist stance adopted by Mr Bill Clinton, the
Democratic presidential candidate. Mr Clinton argues that welfare has to be
seen as a 'second chance', rather than a way of life, and promises to stop
welfare cheques after two years if recipients do not accept training or
jobs. In the US, at least, foreign aid is perceived in a similar light: it
makes sense as an emergency response to disasters but not as a permanent
crutch.
The anti-aid arguments are often wrong-headed. But they show that aid
fatigue is a reaction to deep currents in contemporary life as much as to
temporary budget constraints. When Sweden embraces the market and takes an
axe to its own government, it cannot be expected to leave its aid budget
untouched. Other converts to the market feel the same way.
This climate of opinion presents a quandary for the World Bank and other
providers of well-managed programmes that offer real benefits for developing
countries. If the politics of welfare spending is any guide, the best way to
rekindle enthusiasm for aid is to convince donors that it will produce
lasting changes in behaviour.
The only reliable way is to impose tougher forms of conditionality: aid has
to be tied more directly to domestic reforms by recipients, including, for
example, the shift of resources from military to social budgets. Such
reforms may help convince sceptics that aid will not be wasted; but with the
post-cold war world being rebuilt on market principles, the going is likely
to be tough.

FT  28 SEP 92 / Justinian: Revival of trust in the law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUIS BLOM-COOPER QC
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No opening of the law year in recent times has revealed such a significant
facelift in the composition of the English judiciary as the one that begins
on Thursday. The recent double replacement of the Lord Chief Justice of
England and the Master of the Rolls - the two highest offices in the Supreme
Court of Justice - conveys the impression of a new judicial broom sweeping
through the dusty corridors of the Royal Courts of Justice in the Strand,
sufficient to restore public confidence in the administration of both
criminal and civil justice.
The arrival this year of four new Law Lords - enhancing the calibre and
liberal disposition of the final court of appeal - has made necessary a
number of replacements in and additions to the Court of Appeal. This
reflects a distinct break with the past, improving the prospects of sensible
and sustained legal reforms, and raising hopes that the esteem in which the
public has hitherto held its senior judges will be restored.
The postwar period of civil jurisdiction was dominated in the public's mind
by Lord Denning, now 93. Appointed a High Court judge in 1944 and promoted
to the Court of Appeal in 1948, he became a Law Lord in 1957. He returned to
the Court of Appeal in 1962 as Master of the Rolls, where he dominated the
court scene for the next 20 years.
It was an idiosyncratic domination, reflected in his large output of
judgments (he never allowed either of the two appellant judges to deliver
the first judgment of the court). Lord Denning asserted the need for judges
to be creative, to shape the law. For him, the doctrine of precedent was an
obstacle that should be brushed aside if he believed the previous case-law
stood in the way of individual or social justice.
The difficulty with Lord Denning was his strong personal opinions,
especially his moralistic attitude to the family and sex, and his overt
hostility to trade unions and to some elements of society. It was a remark
in 1982 in one of his autobiographical books that led to his undoing. He
made a racist comment about the composition of a jury in a case arising out
of riots in Bristol. He had to apologise, the passage in the book was
withdrawn, and he bowed out, the last of the octogenarians on the bench.
However Lord Denning's judicial brethren may have chafed under such a
maverick influence, he held sway by the sheer force of his genial
disposition and masterly court-craft. His literary style, moreover, was
attractive to the newspaper-reading public, so he was easily seen as the
embodiment of British justice.
Only the House of Lords in the 1960s and 1970s, under the leadership of the
greatest of our postwar judges, Lord Reid, kept English law on the smooth
path of legal development. Public law owes much more to the creativity of
Lord Reid than to the variable decisions emanating from Lord Denning. The
mantle of Lord Reid now falls appropriately on the recently reconstructed
House of Lords.
Following Lord Denning, Lord Donaldson's decade at the helm of civil justice
has been quietly remarkable. The parlous administration of the Court of
Appeal's workload during Lord Denning's period has been largely rectified.
The Court has been transformed from a one-judge band with two judicial
bookends, to a corporate body in which the Master of the Rolls has led a
team of 27 Lord Justices contributing to more stable, if unexciting,
jurisprudence.
Lord Donaldson, who formally retires on Wednesday, admits that he would have
liked to have handed over to his successor, Lord Justice Bingham, in a
tidier state. But he recognises that necessary reforms must be seen through
by a new Master of the Rolls. He himself would have had to retire in the
middle of such reforms. Lord Justice Bingham's appointment brings to the
office a jurist of the highest quality, something that has to some extent
been missing from civil justice.
The criminal appellate court has had a battering in recent years, more the
result of fundamental defects in the system than in its executants. Criminal
appeals immediately after the war occupied little more than a day a week for
the Lord Chief Justice and two puisne judges - today three divisions of the
court sit regularly.
In the 1950s Lord Goddard, a proponent of capital and corporal punishment,
was out of tune with postwar Britain. His successor in 1958, Lord Parker,
was the reverse. An outstanding and progressive lawyer, he began to shape
the growing criminal jurisdiction with efficiency. In 1971 Lord Widgery, who
was capable of absorbing complex material and delivering off-the-cuff
judgments with astonishing speed, nevertheless barely disguised his distaste
for this class of judicial work. (His prime expertise was in the field of
planning law, intellectually far removed from rape and robbery.)
By contrast, Lord Lane who retired this April, understood the world of
criminality and was an outstanding Lord Chief Justice, despite popular
belief to the contrary. His failing was to retain an Olympian aloofness,
which let him down badly during media criticism over a spate of miscarriages
of justice. Already his successor, Lord Taylor, has made a favourable public
impression through his obvious readiness to be open about the job of Lord
Chief Justice.
If we do not now begin to see a marked difference in legal approach and in
judicial attitude and style to contemporary legal problems, it will be
astonishing. Come the 21st century, English law should have recovered its
prestige, and should sit fittingly alongside the civilian systems of the
rest of the European Community.

FT  28 SEP 92 / Monday Interview: Monetarist with a mission - Patrick
Minford, the Liverpool University economist, talks to Peter Marsh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Norman Lamont has not had much time for day dreams recently. But in any
moments of reflection during the sterling crisis and its aftermath, swimming
before the glazed eyes of the UK chancellor may well have appeared the
craggy, combative features of Professor Patrick Minford.
If Mr Lamont has appeared to be playing a Macbeth-like role, fighting a
losing battle against the powerful forces pulling the pound down, then Prof
Minford has also played an important part, as the leader of the witches
haunting the Scottish regent with warnings of toil and trouble ahead.
For the past two years, the vociferous Liverpool University economist has
been stirring his cauldron of ideas, cooking up a stream of rebukes and
irreverent comments which have conspired to irritate the UK chancellor.
Prof Minford was one of the first UK economists to warn of a long recession.
And as the best-known member of the so-called Liverpool Six group of
monetarist economists, he has not been shy about repeating his view that
membership of the European Monetary System's exchange rate mechanism spelt
disaster for Britain.
Long disregarded by the mainstream in the Conservative party as a heretic,
Prof Minford is closely identified with the free-market views of Lady
Thatcher, the former prime minister, whom he served as an informal economics
adviser during the early 1980s. He is dismissive of many of the new
generation of Tory leaders, who he reckons have gone soft on public spending
and abandoned sound methods of running the economy based on monetary
targeting.
But with Mr Lamont having been forced to suspend the UK's ERM membership,
removing the central plank of his economic strategy, the frequently
controversial views of the 49-year-old professor have been given added
weight.
Sitting in his cluttered office in Liverpool, next to two scruffy suitcases
stuffed with economics pamphlets, the professor seems a long way from the
hurly-burly of the currency markets and the political maelstrom that has
followed the suspension of the pound from the ERM.
As befits his academic status, the Professor is keen to expound on a
spectrum of issues. He offers outspoken views on on a range of subjects from
Victorian workhouses - which he thinks were 'very enlightened for a time'
and which could be revived today as part of a plan to cut public spending on
welfare - to the populist Sun newspaper, an organ which he admires for its
free-market views.
Such opinions have given the professor a reputation as a kind of economics
rottweiler. However, he has a large fan club, including people on both the
right and left of politics.
Although the professor - whose thick black-rimmed spectacles and bubbling
manner give him the air of a 1960s rocket scientist - has a reputation for
irascibility and confesses to a lack of tact, he delivers most of his
comments with a smile and no little charm.
He even shows a few mild signs of pleasure, welcoming last week's 1
percentage point cut in UK interest rates to 9 per cent. But to speed the
UK's recovery from the longest peacetime recession since the 1930s, Prof
Minford thinks Mr Lamont could go much further, bringing credit rates down
to about 5 per cent and jettisoning any effort to peg the pound to the
D-Mark.
'From now on the exchange rate should be viewed simply as a market price -
no more important than the price of cocoa. We shouldn't spend any more time
worrying about it.'
As for his thoughts about Britain's decision nearly two years ago to enter
the ERM, no one can complain that the professor has lacked consistency. As
early as March 1988, Prof Minford wrote that for the UK to join the ERM
would 'expose the economy to great risk' due to a 'too sudden transfer to
German monetary conditions . . . and chronic foreign exchange crises
requiring interest rate surges'.
In terms of forecasts Prof Minford, even though he was no more prescient
than most other UK economists in warning of the late 1980s inflationary
boom, has judged the length and depth of the current recession much better
than most of his colleagues. In May last year, when the Treasury was talking
optimistically about growth of around 2.5 per cent for 1992, he said the
economy would expand by a meagre 0.1 per cent during that year. That may not
have been pessimistic enough. The latest forecasts, outlined last month in a
Treasury compilation of private-sector projections, suggest the economy will
shrink by about 0.6 per cent this year after a 2.4 per cent drop last year.
But the professor was widely considered at the time as a doomsayer.
Indeed last summer, Mr Lamont took the opportunity to tell the Liverpool
academic so to his face, during a frosty confrontation with Prof Minford in
the chancellor's office at the Treasury.
That meeting was one of the few occasions in recent years when Prof Minford
has had high-level discussions inside the Treasury - an organisation for
which he worked for three years in the early 1970s and for which he now has
immense scorn for 'making a complete cobblers' of the UK economy since the
late 1980s.
Yet his real battle is not just with Treasury mandarins, whom he says are
too remote from the outside world and are unnecessarily secretive, but the
whole of what he dubs Britain's intellectual establishment. By this Prof
Minford means people disposed to 'consensus building' and government
intervention.
He says he has in mind people such as Ms Sarah Hogg (head of the Downing
Street policy unit), Mr Howard Davies (director general of the Confederation
of British Industry) and Mr Michael Heseltine (the president of the Board of
Trade)
How did Prof Minford come to dislike the establishment so much? He had a
comfortable background (his father was a diplomat and the young Minford went
to Winchester College and then Balliol College, Oxford). Perhaps an early
hint of rebellion was the 13-year-old Minford's school speech during the
1956 Suez crisis, in which he argued, against the conventional line of the
time, that British military intervention was unjustified. 'I was destined to
be part of the establishment,' he says. 'Things just didn't turn out this
way.'
A big factor tipping him away from conventional thinking was his 1970s
research in economics. The research was conducted at the Treasury (which he
eventually left because he 'got fed up with sitting on committees rather
than doing research') and then at a series of academic institutes leading up
to Liverpool, where he has been since 1976. His studies led Prof Minford to
propose his own brand of economic theory, based on 'rational expectations'.
That boils down to saying that everyone involved in economic activity - be
they currency dealers, companies or consumers - makes intelligent
assumptions on the basis of available information about how factors such as
inflation will change in the future, rather than slavishly following trends
that are guided simply by what happened in the past.
Prof Minford combined this theory with firm views on monitoring the money
supply as a way of controlling inflation, in contrast to the then-Keynesian
orthodoxy of using fiscal policy to manage demand. Both ideas fitted in with
the market-based thinking of Tory leaders including Mrs Thatcher, whom he
first got to know at a dinner in 1978, a year before she took over as prime
minister.
In the aftermath of Mr Lamont's humiliating climb-down over the ERM, he has
received no phone calls from the Treasury asking for advice. The mere
suggestion seems so incongruous to the Minford mind that it makes him shout
with laughter. 'I am not really considered sound. I like the individualistic
way of doing things. I like to rock the boat.'

FT  28 SEP 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: Move to hard core
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING in European currencies this week will probably be dominated by the
debate over whether a hard core of currencies can now be formed around the
French franc and the D-Mark, writes James Blitz.
By the end of last week, the Bundesbank and the Bank of France seemed close
to winning their fight to avoid a devaluation of the French franc. Some
dealers still believe that there could be renewed pressure on the franc if
the Bundesbank does not cut interest rates again at its council meeting this
week. But, by Friday night, the franc had touched FFr3.38 to the D-Mark, an
important psychological break-through. The question now is whether France
and Germany will forge a harder currency bloc composed of the D-Mark, the
French franc, the Dutch Guilder and the Belgian franc. According to Mr
Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International in London, the ERM system
needs a credible realignment to survive the present crisis.
'The narrowness of the French 'Yes' vote has merely added to the markets'
scepticism about the prospects for monetary union, thereby further exposing
weaker currencies like the escudo the punt and the peseta,' he said. 'The
absence of a realignment has also resulted in the French franc coming under
intense pressure.'
There could be an argument for conducting such a realignment now. If the
D-Mark and the franc are seen to realign upwards against the weaker
currencies in the system, the pressure may be taken off the French currency
once-and-for-all. Such a move, however, could put new strains on the lira
and sterling, which were recently suspended from the system.

FT  28 SEP 92 / Derivatives: Stiff test for the banks' risk management
systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE past fortnight has provided a stiff test for the skills of banks active
in the swaps and other derivatives markets.
Has the huge cost of systems in recent years - built both to manage risk and
to make it possible to price complex financial instruments - been money well
spent? The answer is: 'Not entirely'.
The crisis in the European exchange rate mechanism has revealed some of the
weaknesses in banks' risk management systems for two reasons.
First, computer models developed from historical data have in many cases
been subjected to the most extreme market conditions they have yet had to
face. What looks fine on the laboratory bench does not always work so well
in practice.
'It was almost impossible to keep track with where you were,' said an
executive at one bank in London. 'Any arbitrage opportunity, where you are
talking about two or more instruments, became very difficult.' The speed of
events was one reason for this. Valuing derivatives portfolios takes
considerable computing power. 'The systems take a long time to crank out the
answers, and when they come, the market's changed,' said this executive.
The scale of the volatility also made it difficult to keep up with events.
Some banks discovered that the parameters built into their models simply
were not broad enough to cope with events. 'Any model can cope with 15 per
cent interest rates. What no models can cope with is 1,000 per cent rates,'
said an executive at another bank.
The foreign exchange markets, which saw the most active trading, are immune
from most of these problems. Dealers have less need for real-time
information, since they do not face the same difficulty in marking their
positions to market.
'In the heat of the moment you don't rely on the system to keep your
position - you keep your own,' said a risk management executive at National
Westminster. It isn't possible to trade in derivative markets in the same
way.
The second weakness in risk management that has been exposed in recent days
has been lack of liquidity in some financial markets. Managing risk is only
possible if there are markets and instruments available in which those risks
can effectively be laid off.
The sterling swap market, for example, was left high and dry on the day that
the currency left the ERM as the money markets dried up. The lack of a
liquid money market made it impossible to price a swap, or to value a
sterling swap portfolio, making hedging equally impossible. It was a case of
waiting for normal market conditions to return, and then hoping that your
bank came out as one of the winners rather than one of the losers.
It was highly timely that the International Swap Dealers Association should
have held a conference in London last Friday on risk management. Mr Michael
May, head of derivatives marketing at Westpac, was one of several speakers
to point to liquidity as an important concern: 'Is anyone brave enough to
say that the Ecu swap market will still be here in five years time?' The
experience of recent days has given senior managers in some banks - and
banking regulators - a taste of what extreme market conditions can do to
financial institutions' risk controls. The outcome was not catastrophic, but
that may provide scant consolation if allegedly foolproof systems failed to
cope. It is all reminiscent of the 1987 stock market crash. Then, so-called
'portfolio insurance' was meant to have eliminated the market risk from
holding securities. In practice, such promises of risk-free investing proved
unfounded.
One of the main things to come under scrutiny will be the volatility
assumptions built into risk management systems for derivatives. These are
built on historical data, which is used to project how instruments will
trade under most circumstances. They do not pretend to cover all market
conditions.
Most work on a 'confidence level' of about 95 per cent. That is, they are
based on the assumption that a particular instrument or market has traded
within a certain range at least 95 per cent of the time in the past, and so
can be expected to do so in the future.
The trouble is, 'worst-case' situations can be devastating when they occur.
Referring to the high confidence level used at Bankers Trust, Ms Marion
Robieson, head of product risk at Bankers Trust in New York, said at the
Isda conference: 'In practice, you almost never reach this level - except
when you grossly exceed it.'
How many senior bankers realise this - and are they happy to live with the
consequences, given the enormous volatility in financial markets
demonstrated recently?
Another risk management expert said: 'Senior management have to accept that
these are trading markets, and that not everything can trade within a 95 per
cent confidence level.' It may be, though, that the experts have failed to
get this message across.
There is certainly a lot of communicating that needs to be done in the
coming weeks. As Mr John McCormick, head of Bank of America's financial
engineering and risk management group in London, said: 'Senior management
will be asking, in the light of recent events, what we're doing here.' He
can be sure that Bank of America certainly will not be alone.

FT  28 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: A German strategy for Britain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THE more that he talked of his honour, the faster we counted the spoons.'
Which applies, rather obviously, to a British chancellor who talks of rigour
the day after he cuts interest rates. This could only too obviously be where
Mr Edward Heath came in. That is the future the markets are beginning to
discount, and no reader needs advice on how to hedge. Stay short of
sterling.
But suppose that it is different this time. Suppose that Mr Major, awakening
from his fantasy of European leadership, and Mr Lamont, free from playing
follow-my-leader, have learned from their experience. What reflections would
guide a rational man after such a shock?
'We're on our own,' might sum it up; but not in the smug John Bull sense Mr
Lamont so successfully employed to rally his back-benchers. On our own in
the sense that Britain has to establish its street credibility before it can
join the fast-track group in Europe; not as a result of joining before we
are ready. And on their own in the sense that they cannot lean on the
advisers who got them into this mess. They must make their own policy from
the ground up.
This is very difficult for men so comparatively young. They did not
experience the significant past; they must read about it in books, and they
do not have the time. (So if you find the potted version which follows
convincing, clip it out and send it to them.)
The strategic aim need not be changed: Mr Major wants to out-German the
Germans. He must hold on, though, to the new understanding of cause and
effect which emerged in the economic debate. You do not get strength by
suppressing inflation; you get a strong currency from having a strong
economy, and low inflation follows. The re-emergence of this truth could be
worth all the turmoil and humiliation, if we can hold on to it.
The two leaders of fast-track Europe ended the war devastated; both now have
quite impressive economies (though the German record has been gravely
blotted since re-unification), but they chose opposite routes to get there.
The French approach lay through a strong industrial policy - rather the
Labour line. This produced much technological excitement, but a long string
of disappointments and devaluations. In 1983, they moved over to the German
track, and have been painfully converging ever since.
The German approach, as much forced on them by isolation as thought through,
relied on the market. Inflation had left their currency as devastated as
their cities, and much undervalued overseas after it was reformed. The only
way to get rich was to earn foreign currency, legitimately or otherwise; and
so began more than three decades of export-led growth. The mark rose with
the trade surplus. This is also the strategy followed, sometimes
accidentally, by Japan, Korea, and currently by China and most recently by
Poland (with dawning success), and possibly Russia.
Britain now has an opportunity to follow these examples. The physical
economy is not devastated, simply under-sized; the country still needs a
structural transformation. The psychic economy happily has been laid flat:
union militancy and resistance to change went some years ago, and now we are
drying out from our long addiction to borrowing. For Britain, as for the US,
net exports are the only likely source of long-term dynamism.
The task is to revive the economy without reviving bad habits; in other
words, to keep a highly competitive exchange rate while containing
inflation, especially credit-led inflation. This approach might well appeal
to the schoolmaster in Mr John Major - 'if it isn't hurting, it isn't
working'. His anti-inflationary convictions are real; even, according to his
officials, obsessive. Given time, the market could do the rest; and Mr Major
has time. There are two problems. Mr Major is, for the time being,
politically too weak; and sterling is still probably too strong to motivate
a solid manufacturing revival. So even if you believe that we may have
stumbled into the best-proved strategy for growth, the financial posture is
the same: stay short of sterling. Not for ever, though.

FT  28 SEP 92 / UK Gilts: Slope of yield curve makes a sudden reverse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COGNOSCENTI of the gilt-edged market have had to blink hard in the past two
weeks, and not just because of the pound's dramatic exit from the European
exchange rate mechanism.
Another factor making the period stand out is that the gilt yield curve,
which has been downward sloping for virtually all the past 10 years, has
changed suddenly to move upwards, as a result of altered expectations about
interest rates and inflation.
Owners of short-dated bonds have seen the value of these financial assets
appreciate significantly over the past two weeks, while long maturing bonds
are now priced less attractively.
According to Mr Nigel Richardson at SG Warburg Securities, the trend should
continue in the coming months, with the result that yields for long-dated
bonds climb from around 9 per cent now to 10 per cent by autumn next year.
Behind such speculation is the changed perceptions about how UK economic
policy will be managed. With the pound outside the ERM - and the UK
government appearing to be in no hurry to seek re-entry - the central plank
of the Treasury's economic strategy has been shattered.
Without a fixed exchange rate target, Britain is reasonably free to cut
short-term interest rates with reference to little more than what seems
justified by UK economic conditions.
The chances are that base rates, which Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, cut
from 10 per cent to 9 per cent last week, will come down further to 8 per
cent by the end of the year and perhaps 7 per cent by mid-1993. Such
changes, so many industrialists and consumers hope, could stimulate a
recovery from the longest UK recession for 50 years.
The reasoning about changes in base rates explains why yields on short-dated
stock have come down. On Friday night the benchmark Treasury 8 3/4 per cent
bond maturing in 1997 had a yield of 8.38 per cent, nearly half a percentage
point lower than the previous week.
Its price was quoted at 101 7/16 , more than 1 1/2 points up compared with
the previous Friday.
Long-dated bonds, meanwhile, saw a rise in yields of roughly 20 basis points
(a fifth of a percentage point), with a corresponding decline in prices,
because of worries that over the next few years inflationary impulses will
be kept less in check, due to the absence of the ERM restraint.
Another aspect that has changed the picture for gilt investors was the large
Bank of England intervention on September 16 - Black Wednesday - in the UK's
vain effort to prop up the pound. The Pounds 10bn to Pounds 15bn estimated
to have been brought into the Treasury's coffers through the Bank's selling
of D-Marks from its currency reserves for pounds will now count towards the
public sector borrowing requirement, reducing the need to issue gilts.
That means, according to gilt market estimates, that the government needs to
issue only between Pounds 1bn and Pounds 5bn of gilts until the end of the
financial year on March 30 in order to fully fund the PSBR, assuming this
latter figure is about Pounds 33bn.
The Bank's strategy for the time being seems to be to concentrate on issuing
index linked gilts - it has sold Pounds 1.1bn of these bonds since the ERM
suspension - because of theories that such bonds should prove attractive to
investors in the event of a swelling in inflationary pressures.
The good news for gilt investors is that the lack of immediate need for the
Bank to issue large volumes of new gilts to fund the 1992-1993 PSBR  -
although it still has to worry about the borrowing requirement for 1993-94,
projected to be more than Pounds 40bn - should put a floor under gilt
prices.
However, on the other hand the feeling that inflation could turn out to be a
problem for the UK - if not in the immediate future, then in a year or so's
time - could make some investors decide that gilts are no longer such a good
bet as they have appeared in the past year, and switch more of their funds
into equities or non-sterling denominated bonds instead.

FT  28 SEP 92 / European Government Bonds: Prospect of mini-Emu sets markets
buzzing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WILL a mini-Emu arise from the ashes of the Maastricht treaty?
Certainly the prospect of closer economic and monetary union (Emu) between
the hard-core European currencies has set the bond markets buzzing, and some
market participants now regard a two-speed Emu as an attractive route to
follow.
The events of the last month have given the idea of a mini-Emu some
currency. In the run-up to the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty,
tensions within the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) of the European monetary
system (EMS) led to a forced devaluation of the peseta, while both sterling
and the lira pulled out and floated.
The turmoil continued last week after the French voted in favour of
Maastricht - but with only a very slender majority for the Yes vote.
As the weaker European currencies came under renewed pressure, Spain,
Portugal and Ireland tried to crush the speculators by introducing new
controls on capital or by tightening existing ones. But the French franc
managed to survive the week, thanks to heavy intervention by both the Bank
of France and the Bundesbank.
On Friday, Mr Alfons Verplaetse, the governor of the Belgian central bank,
was quoted as saying that monetary union between the five hard-core European
currencies could start immediately. According to Belgian radio, Mr
Verplaetse said Germany, France and the Benelux countries - Belgium, the
Netherlands and Luxembourg - were economically ready to start monetary
union.
Ever since the Danes rejected the Maastricht treaty on June 2, investors
have focused more closely on the D-Mark bloc and greatly reduced their
exposure to high-yielding European bond markets such as Spain and Italy.
Before the Danish vote, the prospect of European economic and monetary union
had convinced investors that they stood to make considerable gains as
inflation and interest rates in Spain and Italy converged towards German
levels. Denmark's rejection of Maastricht shattered investors' faith in the
convergence argument.
However, if a form of mini-Emu takes place now, investors in the hard-core
European currencies should see convergence towards German yields in the bond
markets. Mr George Magnus, economist at SG Warburg Securities, points out
that the first step towards Emu would be a move towards much narrower
fluctuation bands between the currencies.
'A necessary requirement is to fix even more strongly than before those
currencies which are able to fix' he said. The five countries involved would
have to issue a statement of intent to lock their currencies more closely
than before.
'In effect, Germany, France and the Benelux countries could eventually
hijack the single currency for themselves,' he said.
Yield spreads over German bunds for the other hard-core members would narrow
considerably. Traders pointed out that following Mr Verplaetse's comments on
Friday, the 10-year French-German yield spread fell dramatically. With the
formation of a mini-Emu, the spreads would fall further.
Mr Jeremy Hale, economist at Goldman Sachs, said: 'If the separate
currencies continued to exist but were irreversibly fixed, the risk premium
in Dutch, French and Belgian bonds would disappear and the bond yields would
converge.'
However, he added that in practice, French, Dutch and Belgian bonds would
probably carry a small residual risk premium reflecting worries that the
union might fall apart.

FT  28 SEP 92 / US Money and Credit: Attention on Wall Street returns to
domestic outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE currency chaos continues in a newly divided Europe, Wall Street has
diverted its attention from the implications of Maastricht back to the
domestic economic outlook and the presidential election.
These days only the most optimistic economists or spin doctors for the Bush
re-election campaign dare to place much faith in a short-term US economic
recovery.
Bond investors are steeling themselves for a Clinton victory and assuming
this will lead to the use of more fiscal tools to jump-start the US economy.
Translated into bond terms, that implies higher bond yields and lower prices
in the wake of a Clinton victory.
Early last week, US Treasury bond prices fell as a number of foreign central
banks liquidated some of their US holdings in order to raise cash for more
intervention in the foreign exchange market. However, by last Friday, the
familiar flow of discouraging US macro-economic statistics triggered a rally
once more, as speculation increased about the prospect of another ease in
monetary policy by the Federal Reserve.
On Friday the Treasury bond market rallied on the back of bad economic news
such as the Commerce Department announcing a drop in durable goods orders in
August, the third such drop in four months. Also influencing the market was
a decline in personal income in August and a 3.2 per cent fall in sales of
previously owned homes.
The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose by  21/32 of a point
on Friday, with the yield down to 7.35 per cent, compared with 7.41 per cent
last Thursday.
This week, the market will focus on the latest unemployment statistics, due
on Friday. Depending on what the jobs data says, many traders expect Mr Alan
Greenspan, chairman of the Fed, to look seriously at another cut in interest
rates. This could bring the discount rate and Fed funds rate, now at 3 per
cent, down to 2.50 per cent and 2.75 per cent respectively.
An indicator that the Fed could be inclined to ease before the presidential
election on November 3 seemed to come last week from pessimistic remarks
made by Mr Wayne Angell, a Fed board member who has been more concerned
about the return of inflation.
It is striking how many serious bankers and economists still worry about the
potential inflationary impact of a further rate cut when it seems apparent
that the US and other western economies are hurtling through the most
widespread deflationary cycle in years. But old anti-inflation prejudices
take some time to vanquish, even if they now appear unrealistic.
A word about buying US Treasury bonds ahead of the presidential campaign.
According to bond market watchers at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, the long
end of the Treasury market is likely to be dominated over the next five
weeks by the growing possibility that Mr Clinton will be elected.
This could initially drive rates upward. The same concerns are being
expressed at SG Warburg, where the view is that the five-year Treasury paper
 -rather than longer maturities - looks cheapest for the time being.

FT  28 SEP 92 / International Company News: Dow move linking prices to DM
'sustains margins'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOW, the US chemical company which last week said it was formally linking
its prices in Europe to the D-Mark, says customers will still be invoiced
and be able to pay in their local currencies. Prices billed will be
converted into the local currency at the D-Mark rate on the day orders are
received or regular orders placed. The action will sustain margins during a
period of exchange rate instability.
Mr Fernand Kaufmann, sales and commercial vice-president of Dow Europe,
said: 'Now with the ERM uncertainty, we have to adjust these prices to
restore the value of the D-Mark. We really need the D-Mark equivalent. We
cannot live off the devalued rate.'
Mr Michel Demare, assistant treasurer, said that unless Dow formalised its
D-Mark pricing policy, it would be sacrificing about 5 per cent on one-third
of its revenues. A substantial proportion of its production costs are in
D-Marks.
Four-fifths of the European company's trade is in ERM countries, with the
remainder in Switzerland, Scandinavia, the Middle East and Africa.

THE New Zealand high court has barred Sir Robert Jones, founder and former
chairman of property group Robt. Jones Investments (RJI), from trading
shares in the company.
This is the first time such an action has occurred in New Zealand, and
follows an application by the country's securities commission.
The court prohibited RJI from registering transfers of shares held by Sir
Robert or private companies he controls. Sir Robert recently said he held
13.82 per cent in the company.
The interim order, follows an earlier finding by the New Zealand Stock
Exchange's market surveillance panel that the company failed to inform the
market about share dealings during 1990 involving RJI, as well as its
employee unit trust and Sir Robert's private interests.
Sir Robert said he was 'delighted' the commission had acted. He accused the
stock exchange of mounting a 'kangaroo court' against him.
The high court injunction is the latest in a series of legal actions against
RJI and Sir Robert who on September 18 resigned as chairman of the company
he founded 10 years ago. It is now one of the biggest property investors in
Australia and New Zealand with a portfolio of buildings worth NZDollars
1.08bn (USDollars 598m).
Fay, Richwhite shareholders have voted overwhelmingly to accept the National
Australia Bank's bid for their company's 26 per cent stake in the Bank of
New Zealand.
NAB is offering 80 cents a share and 95 cents for each preference share. It
is expected to confirm the offer this week.

FT  28 SEP 92 / International Company News: Italian insurer prepares
privatisation policy - Lorenzo Pallesi, chairman of Ina, tells Haig Simonian
about plans for the state sell-off of his group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Topping virtually every list of Italian privatisation candidates is Istituto
Nazionale delle Assicurazioni (Ina), one of the country's biggest and best
known insurance companies.
Ina's main business is life insurance, in which it ranks second to Generali,
Italy's biggest insurer, on a group basis, and counts as the largest
operator as an individual company.
Through Assitalia, its quoted subsidiary, it also offers non-life policies,
while it owns 20.25 per cent of Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), the big
treasury-controlled bank, and 9.27 per cent of Istituto Mobiliare Italiano
(IMI), the Rome-based financial services group.
Total premiums amounted to L5,400bn last year, with L2,200bn stemming from
directly written life business and a similar amount from Assitalia, while
net profits were L19.9bn.
Misunderstandings about premiums and earnings indicate how much preparatory
work is necessary before Ina can sell its shares to the public. About L900bn
of its total premiums stem from cessations from other life insurance
companies, under a complex system dating back to Ina's foundation in 1912.
Although conceived as a state monopoly, similar to those in tobacco and
electricity generation, the idea never got off the ground.
After 1918, when big Trieste-based insurers such as Generali and Riunione
d'Adriatica di Sicurta came under Italian sovereignty, a looser alternative
was chosen.
In 1922, Mussolini imposed a sliding scale of quotas, obliging life insurers
to cede part of their business to Ina. From 40 per cent of all premiums in
the first decade, the quota fell in stages to a permanent floor of 10 per
cent after 30 years.
That system underscored Italian life insurance until just six years ago,
when reforms were passed in line with planned European Community
legislation, with compulsory transfers being phased out by 1994.
Mr Lorenzo Pallesi, Ina's chairman, explains: 'The aim was to guarantee
market stability and avoid damage to policy-holders if a company collapsed.
Although seeming unfair, the system was very attractive for all concerned.'
The sliding scale closed the Italian market to new entrants, put off by the
fact that they would only receive premiums on 60 per cent of their business,
while established rivals might already be down to the 10 per cent quota.
'It was cosy for everyone. The established companies kept out rivals, while
Ina enjoyed guaranteed growth at market rates thanks to an automatic stream
of business'.
Changing the requirement to cede premiums to Ina will be one of the steps
needed before privatisation. Mr Pallesi hopes Italian insurers will follow
other European markets and opt for self-regulation.
Ina's earnings are also deceptive. Superficially, last year's figure seems
paltry for a company of its size in a business where profitability is
normally high for big, mature players.
However, the final result masks a variety of factors. Foremost is the L303bn
paid in the special advance property tax, sprung on the industry last year.
Rather than amortising the amount over three years, as permitted under law,
Ina took the entire payment on its 1991 accounts.
Other factors explain the relatively modest net earnings of previous years.
'The state never saw Ina as a source of income,' says Mr Pallesi. 'As a
special form of state-owned company, it never had annual general meetings or
even shareholders. And it never paid dividends.'
As there was no need to distribute earnings - largely derived from
tax-exempt government bonds - Ina traditionally shifted a large part of
profits into reserves to minimise its tax bill. 'Our solvency margin is
between 4 1/2 and five times that required by law,' he says.
Only when facing the property tax in 1991 did the group refrain from
ploughing money into special reserves.
The second factor affecting profits is Mr Pallesi's policy, introduced in
early 1990, of redistributing earnings to policy-holders. Last year, the
company credited L135bn into policyholders' accounts, after L115bn in 1990.
So far, it is unique among Italian life insurers. Mr Pallesi explains the
strategy in marketing terms. 'Policyholders in the UK have many more rights
than in Italy. The market there is much more transparent. I believe this
will happen in Italy too, and we wanted to be the first.'
Taken before redistribution and transfers to reserves, Ina's earnings have
been consistently high. Last year, it made L460bn, a figure it hopes to
repeat in 1992.
Ina's transformation into a joint stock company last month shows changes are
already on the way. With the new Italian government scrambling for income,
Ina is no longer a special case but a vital source of funds for the
Treasury, now its clearly defined shareholder.
While Ina looks set to pay the Treasury dividends this year, private
investors may have a crack as early as 1993. Merchant banks have already
submitted exhaustive privatisation schemes.
The most common involves the flotation of a 'new' Ina, owned by the existing
group. While the parent company will continue its special functions for the
state, such as administering funds for insurance against organised crime and
export credits, the 'new' company will comprise the life insurance business
and Ina's stake in Assitalia.
The principle is clear, even if the details still have to be worked out.
'The question is not if to split, but how,' says Mr Pallesi. Necessary legal
changes will take between three and four months, he thinks. And a flotation
seems unlikely before certified 1992 accounts are ready by next May or June.
With the long summer break ahead, September 1993 looks the first possible
date for a stock market debut.
How much is Ina worth? Ina's total assets amounted to almost L22,000bn last
year. Its holdings include a sizeable property portfolio listed at historic
prices. 'Some assets are at one third or a quarter of their market values,'
Mr Pallesi claims. He puts a tag of between L10,000bn and L12,000bn on the
group, implying L1,000bn to L1,200bn for a first 10 per cent tranche of
shares, based on asset values alone.
Details of a possible flotation are 'up to our owner', he says. But he makes
two clear personal preferences. First, floating an initial stake should be
the prelude to the sale of majority control within four years, provided
there are guarantees such as a golden share to prevent a change of
ownership. The second is to bring existing policyholders into the
privatisation process. 'I'd like to see a simultaneous offer to
policyholders and the markets, with preferential terms to existing customers
based on the size of their current premiums.' With a marketing man's glint
in his eye, he adds: 'That way, it would be possible to encourage customers
to raise the size of their policies, and reward them at the same time.
'And in the end, it would create a virtuous circle by raising Ina's
profitability. It would be the first time privatisation in Italy could be
done in a truly entrepreneurial way.'

FT  28 SEP 92 / Branson may help rescue Dan-Air
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RICHARD Branson, founder of Virgin Atlantic Airways, may help to rescue
Dan-Air, the UK-based airline which was saved from collapse less than a year
ago.
Davies &amp; Newman Holdings, owner of Dan-Air, has requested that its shares be
suspended at 21p when the London stock market opens this morning, pending
the outcome of the talks with Virgin.
While ruling out a merger of the two airlines, both companies envisage
Dan-Air aircraft flying under the Virgin name, with Mr Branson participating
in a refinancing of Davies &amp; Newman by its institutional shareholders.
The idea is that Dan-Air would benefit from Virgin's retail and marketing
skills.
The airlines would remain operationally separate, although both see benefits
from co-ordinating Dan-Air's short-haul European network with Virgin's
transatlantic services. Mr David James, chairman and company doctor to
Davies &amp; Newman, denied weekend press reports that a deal with Virgin would
mean redundancies among the 2,350 staff of his Gatwick-based airline, saying
such a link-up would probably increase demand for staff.
Although Dan-Air forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 20m at the time of its
Pounds 49.3m refinancing last October, the airline is now expected to incur
a loss of Pounds 7m in 1992.
When Mr Branson made specific proposals on Thursday evening, Mr James
suspended his programme of meeting institutions, until the negotiations with
Virgin are completed. Mr Branson, who owns a majority of the private Virgin
Atlantic, will take a stake in Davies &amp; Newman only if institutional
shareholders support the plan.
Although Dan-Air's scheduled services have been doing well recently, the
charter side has suffered from uncertainty about the future of the airline.
Talks between Dan-Air and British Airways collapsed recently and Air France
has also declined to get involved. However, BA may be concerned to see
Dan-Air, which has six precious daily slots at Heathrow, link up with its
arch-rival, Virgin.
Mr James said he was hopeful that there would be a successful deal with
Virgin within the next two weeks: 'The chemistry is so good that it would be
to the benefit of British aviation.'

FT  28 SEP 92 / Weill starts another journey at Travelers: The Dollars 722m
move into insurance by Primerica and its chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When he was asked how negotiations for last week's Dollars 722.5m (Pounds
423m) deal between US insurance group Travelers and financial services
conglomerate Primerica had gone, Travelers chairman Mr Edward Budd said,
only half joking: 'Very efficiently.'
The remark drew a hearty laugh from Primerica's chairman, Mr Sanford Weill,
who was pacing around his midtown Manhattan office last Friday morning,
eager for the day's work to begin.
Only a few days earlier, the renowned financier had clinched the deal that
left Primerica holding a 27 per cent stake in the struggling insurer, which
in return got a huge injection of capital and, just as crucially, access to
Mr Weill's expertise in rescuing troubled companies.
A native of New York who still talks with a trace of a Brooklyn accent, Mr
Weill made his name in the 1960s and 1970s when he built up a small broking
operation into Shearson Loeb Rhoades. He sold the firm in 1981 to American
Express for Dollars 930m, at the time the most ever paid for a securities
firm.
After a brief spell with American Express, Mr Weill made an ambitious, but
ultimately unsuccessful offer to take a stake in 1986 in BankAmerica. Soon
after, he bought Commercial Credit, which he quickly merged with Primerica
to create a complex, unfocused financial services giant.
Mr Weill spent the next six years turning each of the group's businesses
around. He also found the time to attempt a merger between Smith Barney and
Shearson, and, reportedly, a takeover of Wall Street investment bank Kidder
Peabody.
Although his attempts to build a big-league broking house failed, Mr Weill
kept his eye on the ball where it mattered - at Primerica. 'Our company over
the last five years has seen its earnings grow at a compound rate of 25 to
30 per cent,' he says. 'Our dividends have been raised every year, our book
value has grown substantially every year, and our return on equity has
increased to something like 17 per cent, which we think is relatively good
in the businesses we're in. So we like what we're doing . . . we've been
running our business right, and funding our business right.'
Today, Mr Weill has a target for Primerica - he would like each of the three
operations to be producing twice as much profit in five years as it does
now. That could be difficult without acquisitions, and few doubt Mr Weill is
on the look-out.
He admits as much: 'Of the core businesses of Primerica, the areas where one
could grow externally as well as internally would be: buying a book of
business in the consumer finance business, or buying another company in that
business; adding another company in the brokerage business; or buying a
mutual fund company. Yet all of those are very very hard to do right now . .
. because the businesses are good, the cycles are good and people are doing
well.'
Mr Weill's reported attempt to buy Kidder was a case in point. He is said to
have pulled out of the talks because the price was too high. Although Mr
Weill does not mention any names, industry observers suggest a natural fit
for Smith Barney would be Prudential Securities, the broking arm of the
insurance giant, or possibly one of several smaller, regional brokerages.
While acquisitions must obviously excite the dealmaker in Mr Weill, for now
his energy is likely to remain focused on the task at hand - the
restructuring of Primerica Financial Services, and sorting out Travelers.
It took little more than two months for Mr Weill to agree to come to
Travelers' aid. So 'efficient' were the negotiations that they weathered the
disruption of Hurricane Andrew, which this year will take a big bite out of
US insurers' coffers, including up to Dollars 225m from Travelers.
Mr Weill was not blown off course. He saw in Travelers the opportunity to
buy cheaply into a company that he calls 'one of the great, well-known
financial brands in the US'.
The holding cost Primerica Dollars 19 a share, compared with Travelers' book
value of Dollars 40 a share, and by the end of last week Mr Weill was
already sitting on a handy paper profit, with Travelers shares trading at
Dollars 23.
Hurricane Andrew may even have made the Travelers stake more attractive. Mr
Weill believes the spate of recent natural disasters could herald the end of
the 'soft' property and casualty insurance underwriting cycle and push rates
up across the industry.
Travelers certainly needed the help, and there is little sign of complacency
about the task facing Mr Weill and Mr Budd.
Although it has already raised almost Dollars 700m during the year through
debt and equity sales, the insurer is struggling under the burden of
billions of dollars in bad commercial property loans made during the 1980s.
By the end of the second quarter Dollars 5.2bn in loans, or almost half of
Travelers property book and more than 10 per cent of the group entire
investment portfolio, was underperforming.
Travelers now has Dollars 1.4bn to help it through the property slump and
pay for a big restructuring. The Primerica deal has already done some good.
The Moody's ratings agency has said it will review Travelers' Baa1 rating
for a possible upgrade.
Mr Weill does not see the stake in Travelers as merely a sound investment.
Primerica has three core businesses - Commercial Credit, a consumer finance
company; Primerica Financial Services, which sells insurance and mutual
funds to middle-class families; and Smith Barney Harris Upham, a Wall Street
broking house - and benefits may stem from combining elements of them with
the Travelers name and its customer and product base.
Mr Budd says: 'The synergies in asset-gathering are very real. We're going
fifty-fifty with Gulf Insurance, the specialty property-casualty unit of
Primerica that fills a niche we don't provide for our agents. (Under last
week's deal, Travelers got 50 per cent of Gulf.) We will also work together
on asset-management and investing . . . there is a lot of opportunity to
cross-pollinate there.'
If such potential is realised, the Travelers deal will help maintain
Primerica's strong growth and enhance Mr Weill's formidable reputation.

FT  28 SEP 92 / Maxwell businesses 'ready for sale'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SALES of most of the remaining businesses controlled by the late Mr Robert
Maxwell are moving towards final preparation, according to accountants
working on different parts of the publisher's empire.
Plans for selling the principal companies in Maxwell Communication
Corporation - including Macmillan and Official Airlines Guide in the US -
are to be submitted by accountancy firm Price Waterhouse to the US and the
UK courts next month.
Separately, discussions are well advanced for the sale of British
International Helicopters, the remaining trading business in the network of
private Maxwell companies being administered by accountants at Arthur
Andersen.
Andersen expects to raise at least Pounds 50m from selling BIH, along with a
number of property interests and investments in Hungary and France. That
will only leave the majority shareholding in Mirror Group Newspapers.
Mr Mark Homan, one of the administrators to Maxwell Communication
Corporation at Price Waterhouse, told the House of Commons social security
select committee last week that the firm was 'making substantial progress'
on sales, in conjunction with its adviser JP Morgan, the US bank.
Administrators have been hampered by the highly unusual arrangement whereby
MCC is controlled by Chapter 11 proceedings in the US as well as
administration under UK insolvency law. This has caused much of the more
than Pounds 5m in legal bills incurred so far.
Another reasons for the delay has been difficulties in negotiating the tax
position of the companies.
Mr Homan has been reluctant to provide too much information on the expected
price of realisations because of commercial sensitivity. He has also been
concerned about creating a false market in the discounted trade of MCC debt.
He believes that up to Dollars 250m of MCC debt had changed hands since the
company went into administration.
But he said that MCC's assets in the UK apart from claims from third parties
were about Pounds 100m. The US assets were worth up to Dollars 1.1bn,
excluding receipts from the sale of Berlitz shares.

FT  28 SEP 92 / Shell metals business to emphasise mining side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Royal Dutch/Shell oil and gas group is to change the direction of its
loss-making Billiton metals and mining business said Mr Paul Everard, an
executive director of Billiton International Metals.
Billiton, based in the Netherlands, suffered Dollars 12m (Pounds 7m) net
losses last year which deepened to more than Dollars 35m in the first half
of 1992.
Billiton is to place 'a stronger focus' on its mining operations while the
trading and marketing business would underpin mining.
Billiton recently closed tin smelters in the Netherlands and Ireland and has
effectively put a 'for sale' notice on most of its other downstream
businesses. These include two in the UK: British Lead Mills and H J
Enthoven, which between them account for about half the secondary lead
production in the UK.
The group's TDF Tiofine titanium dioxide pigment company in the Netherlands
is for sale, as is Billiton's 35 per cent stake in the Aughinish alumina
refinery in Ireland.
Mr Everard said even if the 50 per cent-owned Budel smelter in the
Netherlands resolved environmental problems, its gas supply contract ended
in 1999.
He said that Billiton was considering whether it should withdraw from
ring-dealing membership of the London Metal Exchange and become an associate
member instead. Associates had all the benefits of LME membership without
taking the extra risk.

FT  28 SEP 92 / Economics Notebook: High-speed train to EMU begins to gather
steam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HIGH-speed European Monetary Union is the talk of the town in Brussels.
First came a mischievous speech by Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission
president; then some impromptu comments by Mr Alfons Verplaetse, governor of
the central bank in Belgium, who said on Friday that it was possible for
France, Germany and the Benelux countries to move immediately to a common
currency.
When Mr Norman Lamont, UK chancellor of the exchequer, meets his fellow
European finance ministers in Brussels today, he may well wonder how much
this talk of a 'fast-track' to economic and monetary union (EMU) is bluff, a
Franco-German ruse to calm the markets and pressure Britain into rejoining
the ERM. But how much it is a serious statement of intent?
Rumours of a secret Franco-German pact gathered steam after a private
meeting between Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Francois Mitterand, two
days after the lukewarm endorsement of the Maastricht treaty in the French
referendum. They grew in intensity as the Bundesbank and the Banque de
France joined forces to prop up the franc, and they reached a crescendo with
Mr Delors' remarks at a conference on the future of the European Community
Thursday night.
In a thinly disguised reference to growing British opposition to Maastricht,
Mr Delors said: 'If some countries are looking for alibis for delaying the
treaty, it may well be that others take the lead.'
Mr Delors' comments can be read several ways. At face value, he shares the
view of President Mitterand and Chancellor Kohl that political uncertainty
about the fate of the Maastricht treaty is driving speculation in the money
markets. Having put too much faith in EMU, the markets are now overreacting
to the impact of Denmark's rejection of the treaty. The aim, therefore, must
be to restore market confidence in EMU - without necessarily shrinking the
timetable for a common currency by the end of the century.
A second interpretation is that Mr Delors knows that Maastricht's goal of
monetary union for the Twelve by the end of the century - never likely - now
looks impossible. Sterling's withdrawal from the ERM accentuates the
division of Europe into two tiers, a northern club and a less prosperous
southern tier, including Italy, Greece, Portugal - and Britain. Now this
reality has sunk into the consciousness of markets, it makes a leap to
monetary union more likely.
In Brussels, there is plenty of high-powered thinking about how to proceed,
fast-forward, to EMU.
Mr Peter Ludlow, director of the Centre for European Policy Studies,
describes a package deal, whereby 'hard core' members of the EMS (Germany,
France, Benelux, and possibly Denmark) agree to reduce or even eliminate the
margins of fluctuation within the ERM. Decision-making on monetary policy
could be more collective, with the door held open to other EC members.
Lastly, the German authorities would agree to tighten fiscal policy to
relieve pressure on the Bundesbank, thus paving way for lower interest rates
and economic recovery in Europe.
One flaw in this analysis is that EC ministers ruled out narrower
fluctuation bands in the EMS in the run-up to the Maastricht treaty. The
tidal wave of speculation in the money markets in recent weeks makes the
room for currency manoeuvre more - not less - necessary when defending
existing parities. One informed EC official notes that speculation is likely
to increase - not decrease - in the second stage of EMU, before countries
lock into fixed exchange rates. 'The testing will never stop,' he says.
These make for strong technical arguments for accelerating moves toward EMU.
The trick is to make the package politically saleable - not just to
important southern states such as Italy who fear being left out, but also to
Germany, where popular fears of abandoning the D-Mark appear to be
increasing.
One suggestion is to create a European Central Bank on the lines of the
Federal Reserve in the US. To guard against political interference, the
'regional' heads of the central banks in France, Germany and Benelux would
agree that all decisions on monetary policy would require unanimity. The
Bundesbank could argue its independence was being protected, while offering
a notional voice to the French. Majority voting might come later.
A further argument in favour of such arrangements is related to the question
of enlargement of the EC. There is little secret that the Bundesbank views
Austria's and possibly Sweden's, accession to the community with pleasure
because it would most likely strengthen the hand of monetary discipline. By
contrast, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish accession to EMU is viewed as a
recipe for creating 'esperanto' money.
Yet EMU cannot be sold simply as a privileged club for the rich countries of
the north and east. The prospect of EMU membership has, after all, provided
invaluable 'political cover' for the poorer countries to take painful
measures to cut their budget deficits and restructure their economies. Thus
any moves to 'fast-track' EMU must explicitly hold open the door for the
admission of new members, EC officials say.
Where does this leave Britain? Assuming that Franco-German co-operation
succeeds in defending the parity of the franc against the D-Mark, the ERM
will have survived its baptism of fire. This makes it less likely that EC
states will listen to British complaints about 'fault-lines' in the ERM
which must be corrected. Moreover, a radical reform of the ERM does not make
sense for those Germans and French who see it only as a half-way house to
the real goal of EMU. Mr Karl Otto Pohl made this link during remarks at the
annual IMF-World Bank meeting in Washington last week. The former Bundesbank
president said only a multi-speed approach to economic and monetary union
now seems feasible. Dr Pohl's old joke that Germany and the Benelux
countries could form a monetary union 'tomorrow', should not be taken
lightly in London.

FT  28 SEP 92 / Finance ministers aim to boost confidence in ERM: Talks seek
to repair damage caused by speculators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EC FINANCE ministers hold talks in Brussels today aimed at restoring
confidence in the exchange rate mechanism and repairing the damage caused by
heavy speculation against weaker member currencies.
The meeting is expected to discuss the apparent success of the joint
Franco-German intervention in preserving the parity of the franc, as well as
the temporary exchange control measures introduced by Spain, Ireland and
Portugal to prevent funds flowing into the D-Mark.
Although these measures restored a semblance of stability to the ERM, there
are continuing doubts about the position of weaker currencies. These doubts
have fuelled speculation in the money markets about a possible ERM
realignment or a joint Franco-German initiative to form a group of
'hard-core' currencies to reduce the margins of fluctuation within the ERM.
In spite of denials in Bonn and Paris that such an initiative is being
contemplated, senior officials in both capitals have raised the prospect of
a 'two-speed' Europe if Britain delays ratification of the Maastricht treaty
on political and monetary union.
Mr Bertie Ahern, Irish finance minister, made clear yesterday that Ireland
was determined to stick with the hard-core bloc of France, Germany and the
Benelux countries, even if it meant raising interest rates to defend the
punt.
Mr Ahern told the Irish Sunday Independent that he opposed a two-speed
Europe: 'The idea of a fast and slow lane is not in anyone's interest.'
Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer and a strong defender
of the decision to float the pound rather than raise interest rates within
the ERM, will chair today's meeting.
The talks are billed as an important preparation for the meeting of the
European Council in Birmingham on October 16, called by Mr John Major, UK
prime minister, to discuss the future of the Maastricht treaty following its
lukewarm approval in the French referendum and the withdrawal of sterling
and the Italian lira from the ERM.
The Brussels meeting will provide a measure of Britain's isolation in the EC
following sterling's retreat. Mr Lamont seems certain to face questions
about the future of British economic policy and the UK government's delay in
ratifying the Maastricht treaty on European political and monetary union.
His charges, endorsed by Mr Major, that the ERM is tilted toward German
interests and proved defective during the recent sterling crisis, have
angered some of his European finance minister colleagues. They brought a
rebuke from German chancellor Helmut Kohl and four other European Christian
Democrat leaders on Friday who jointly declared that the ERM was 'not
deficient.'
The British presidency will use today's talks to present its latest thoughts
on the 'Delors II' package for increasing aid to the poorer southern states
such as Italy, Spain and Portugal, named after Mr Jacques Delors, president
of the European Commission. Other issues include measures to fight fraud in
the Community's budget, and a review of progress a proposal for a carbon
energy tax.

FT  28 SEP 92 / Italian bank said to have approved Iraq loans
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO FORMER executives of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) have
claimed that the bank's head office in Rome approved some of the more than
Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.9bn) of illegal loans to Iraq made during the 1980s by
the bank's Atlanta branch.
The disclosures contradict the central premise of the US government's fraud
case against Mr Christopher Drogoul, the former Atlanta branch manager who
may be sent to prison this week by a US federal judge.
The Atlanta prosecutors, backed by the Bush administration, argued no one in
Italy knew about the Atlanta operation and Mr Drogoul was the sole
orchestrator of the loans, which helped to finance President Saddam
Hussein's nuclear, chemical and missile projects. Yet two former senior BNL
executives have told the Financial Times there were at least eight different
mid-level and senior BNL colleagues in Italy who were involved in the
Atlanta loans affair.
Mr Arthur Wade, the chief US investigator in the BNL case, admitted under
questioning in court last week that the US Department of Justice had halted
a visit to conduct interviews with BNL executives in Rome. Mr Wade said no
US investigator in the case had travelled to Italy.
Both of the former BNL executives who gave the detailed briefings have asked
that they should not be named. One executive said that between 1987 and 1989
he directed to Mr Drogoul in Atlanta over five Italian companies seeking BNL
loans to back exports to Iraq. He said: 'We knew there was an open line of
credit to Iraq that was being run by our Atlanta branch. We were told that
the highest levels of BNL wanted us to give privileged treatment to Iraq.
'Baghdad was an important client of the bank. When the exporters came to us
in Italy, we arranged for Atlanta to open and confirm letters of credit for
exports to Iraq. Some of the loans were returned to Italy and approved and
countersigned.'
The former BNL executive, now in a senior position at another institution,
said there were seven other current and former BNL executives 'who know it
is simply not true that Mr Drogoul acted alone'.
Two mid-level BNL executives even met Mr Drogoul during visits to Baghdad to
work on the restructuring of previous Iraqi debts, which were repaid 50 per
cent in dollars and 50 per cent in Iraqi dinars, he claimed.
'BNL was the main payments mechanism for many US and European exports to
Iraq. We were told inside the bank not to worry too much about credit risk
because a large portion of the farm loans were being guaranteed by the US
government. There was also political cover in Rome for the bank,' he said.
In Rome three Italian senators have asked for a commission to be set up to
investigate the BNL-Atlanta affair.
Mr Giampiero Cantoni, the current chairman of BNL, said that once the
scandal came to light the bank's board was changed and his new
administration had made no attempt to cover up. He described any such
suggestions, made in court in Atlanta, as 'totally false'.

FT  28 SEP 92 / Swiss give go-ahead to SFr15bn rail tunnels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWISS VOTERS, often presented as stubbornly negative towards closer ties
with their European neighbours, yesterday endorsed a bold but expensive plan
for modernising trans-Alpine transport by a surprisingly large 63.5 per cent
majority.
Backing for the SFr14.9bn (Pounds 6.7bn) scheme in a referendum has defused
a row between Switzerland and the European Community over Swiss restrictions
on trucks driving through the Alps. It appears to auger well for a December
referendum on joining the European Economic Area, the enlarged free trade
area between the EC and the European Free Trade Association (Efta).
The Swiss also hope that the plan, for two rail tunnels totalling 50 miles
running south towards the Italian border, will be the forerunner of a
trans-European trend to transfer freight traffic from road to more
environmentally-friendly rail.
Acceptance by voters was also a pre-condition for Switzerland joining the
EEA. Pro-European Swiss leaders were worried that the EC's crisis over
progress towards political unity might have soured Swiss attitudes. But the
majority for the plan was more decisive than expected.
Uri, the canton beneath which the new Gotthard tunnel is to be built, was
one of only two small cantons where a majority opposed the plan. The other
was the smaller canton of Appenzell.
It is difficult to assess how much of an indication yesterday's vote is of
how the Swiss will vote in the EEA referendum. But the strong majorities in
the big German-speaking cantons suggest a warming towards European
integration.
The Swiss government made clear if the plan was rejected, the country would
be forced by its neighbours to dismantle its restrictions on juggernaut
lorries going through the Alps. Swiss voters also knew that rejection of the
plan would disqualify them from joining the EEA.
In another referendum yesterday, voters ratified by a 61 per cent margin a
proposal to abolish stamp duties on many securities transactions. The
financial community has been trying for years to get rid of the tax. Recent
job losses in the banking industry seemed to convince the government and the
people of the urgency for reform. All cantons had majorities favouring
abolition.

FT  28 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: UK banks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The clearing banks have been early and major equity market beneficiaries of
the devaluation. While the FT-SE has risen just less than 10 per cent, HSBC
and National Westminster are up 11, Lloyds 14 and Barclays no less than 21
per cent. Barclays' sharp rebound may reflect the reasonable assumption that
its final dividend, which was in doubt, is now secure. HSBC is helped by its
earnings power in Hong Kong dollars. For the rest, the underlying impulse
seems to be investor belief that banks are interest sensitive businesses
whose earnings should respond quickly to the government's change of tack.
That argument is, however, easily overstated. It would not do to count on UK
bad debt provisions falling especially quickly. The banks' fortunes are
heavily linked to the property market. It will take some time before lower
interest rates actually produce an increase in asset prices, restoring value
to the banks' collateral and floating their customers off the rocks.
Consider, too, that bankruptcies usually continue to run at high levels
after the cycle has turned. On top of that there is no reason to assume that
consumers or business will suddenly become less debt averse, allowing loan
demand to grow. The clearers are unlikely to see much organic growth in the
short run, while lower interest rates will reduce their earnings on their
free cash balances.
It might be different if the yield curve were yet more sharply upward
sloping. Then, as in the US, the banks could make easy money investing in
long-term government paper, an activity that ties up little capital. But
that would require base rates to fall a lot further, perhaps to 6 per cent,
which looks remote. The best that can be said is that the situation is not
getting worse, but results this autumn from TSB and Royal Bank of Scotland
could produce reminders of how many provisions remain to be made.

FT  28 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: UK utilities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in water and regional electricity companies outpaced the market by 50
per cent and 25 per cent respectively in the year to the end of August. They
have lost half this relative advantage since sterling was suspended from the
ERM. Some under-performance was on the cards anyway. Established utilities
usually trade on a yield premium to the market to compensate for their
relatively limited growth prospects. Water and electricity companies have
been benefitting from the loose regulatory framework under which they were
privatised. Thus there were expectations of respectable dividend growth up
to their first regulatory review in 1995, but the market was already just
starting to look beyond. Now the economy is liberated from German-style
interest rates, the promise from the water companies of real annual dividend
growth of 3-5 per cent up to 1995 looks, arguably, less enticing. Logic
suggests the yield premium should rise.
Both utility sectors, however, are now trading at a 40 per cent yield
premium to the market, levels last seen immediately before the general
election when renationalisation looked a distinct possibility. Since their
revenues are still linked to the inflation rate, it is not obvious why water
and electricity stocks have suffered absolute price falls while index-linked
gilts have surged ahead. Too close a comparison is dangerous, since, in
practice, fund managers rarely consider the two markets together.
That said, a 5 per cent fall in electricity shares and 6 per cent fall in
water stocks seem hard to justify - unless investors are simply going on
experience of how utilities perform in a rising market. Recent history is
hardly auspicious. In the bull market running up to 1987, both British
Telecom and British Gas traded to yield premiums to the market of 60 per
cent. This may have had more to do with the regulatory cycle than the market
cycle, but water and electricity are also facing the prospect of a tighter
regulatory environment. If they are also outpaced in terms of earnings
growth by the market, managements may be tempted to take bolder steps
towards building unregulated businesses. The more aggressively expansionist
of the water companies, such as Severn Trent, already trade at a yield
premium to the sector.

FT  28 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Europe's new horizons
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The 5 per cent fall in the German equity market last week owed as much to
reduced expectations of corporate earnings as to the gyrations of the
foreign exchanges. Recently estimates for next year's earnings growth have
been reduced to around 5 per cent. Germany's GNP is now expected to rise
only 1 per cent in 1993. The revaluation of the D-Mark against trading
partners such as Italy and the UK may lead to these figures being revised
down once more.
Worries about an erosion of Germany's competitive position provide another
explanation of its vigorous defence of the franc. While any benefit of
devaluation has often been squandered by countries with poor inflation
records, France has better anti-inflation credentials than Germany. It might
be expected to exploit any price advantage. Indeed, France has already
enhanced its competitive position over Germany since the last ERM
realignment in 1987.
Suggestions that the two countries are considering early monetary union thus
make commercial as well as, arguably, political sense. France wants to
protect its painfully-acquired credibility with the markets, Germany to
prevent a franc devaluation eroding its competitive position. But should
there be early currency union, German reunification costs may make the
experience painful. Annual government payments to the east could be as high
as DM170bn this year and may run on at a high level until the end of the
decade. With high money supply growth and lax fiscal control the fall in
German interest rates will be slow.
Clearly the French government bond market would benefit from moves towards
monetary union as convergence arguments reasserted themselves. Overall,
yields in the DM bloc might fall as investors moved into a large liquid
market with proven low inflation. But the equity markets would not fare so
well. The German market has a heavy weighting in capital goods companies
which would suffer in a prolonged downturn. And while France currently has
an inflation advantage, it is not yet clear that its economy is strong
enough for companies to take the strain in the longer term.

FT  28 SEP 92 / Letter: Misdirected blame for textiles job losses in UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BEN JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, John Bridge attacks the World Development Movement's campaign to phase
out EC quota restrictions on clothes and textiles from poor countries
(Letters, September 18) in the name of lifting British workers out of
poverty. He is on shaky ground.
Only last week the Low Pay Unit reminded us that many British clothing
workers are illegally paid less than even the pitiful minimum wage of Pounds
2.63 an hour, putting them in the consumer bracket hit most by the 5 per
cent hike in clothing prices caused by the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA).
Further, by blaming the third world for job losses he attacks the
politically easiest target, not the most economically significant. The
lion's share of textile and clothing consumed in Britain is made here or
imported from other developed countries. More than 80 per cent of our
textiles imports come from other rich countries, mostly other EC countries.
To the extent that imports are to blame for job losses (and most studies
show technological change and the level of domestic demand to be far more
important), we should look across the Channel, not the southern oceans.
Under the MFA, British consumers pay Pounds 1bn a year to allow the
government to enforce quotas against poor countries but not the rich. The
arrangement costs the third world Dollars 50bn annually - nearly as much as
all western aid put together.
Instead of penalising the third world with trade barriers, would it not be
better to redirect the costs of protection into modernising some of the
'antiquated' plant which Italian textiles giant Zucchi says deters it from
investing in Britain ('Zucchi keeps its head down on expansion', September
24)?

FT  28 SEP 92 / Letter: Arguments against monetary union underlined by
events
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr JORG SCHIMMELPFENNIG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Amid all the discussions following Britain's decision to leave the
exchange rate mechanism (ERM), the most central argument in favour of a
free-floating sterling seemed to have been forgotten: namely that it is in
the national interest of an economy losing its international competitiveness
to devalue in order both to stimulate exports and shift domestic demand away
from imported goods due to the shift in relative prices. The second effect
will, at the same time, help to limit the inflationary pressures arising
from the price rise of foreign inputs. The turmoil that has been seen will
in one or two years' time be hailed as the turning point for the British
economy, at least as long as the government does not succumb to calls for a
too early re-entry into the ERM.
European monetary union, if it had been in place already, would have done to
Britain exactly the same as German monetary union did to the east German
economy. By setting a too-high exchange rate east German competitiveness was
sent into free fall, drastically increasing unemployment. In Germany, one
might argue, any other exchange rate between the two currencies, and
especially a free floating one, was politically unattainable. In Europe, it
is not too late yet.
In contrast to what the German commissioner, Mr Martin Bangemann, said last
Wednesday, the past week did nothing but underline the arguments against
monetary union. Fixed (or semi-fixed) exchange rates are fine for stationary
(or almost stationary) economic environments, except that in these cases
they won't be needed anyway. Otherwise they are not just unnecessary, they
are damaging. And economic environments are changing.
When will economic policy advisers bother to have just one closer look into
what Adam Smith and David Ricardo wrote some time ago?

FT  28 SEP 92 / South Africa's third man rattles the troika: As de Klerk and
Mandela resume talks, Chief Buthelezi has served a reminder of the problems
ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi - every inch the Zulu prince in his
leopard-skin skirt and spear - rose to address yesterday's gathering of Zulu
warriors in Durban, he had only one message to deliver: that no deal on a
post-apartheid constitution can be made without him, and that he will
extract a high price from anyone foolish enough to try.
It was a sobering reminder of the central fact of South African politics:
that the country has not just two warring leaders, but three: Mr F W de
Klerk, the president, who represents most whites, many coloureds and
Indians; Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress
(ANC), who commands most black support; and Chief Buthelezi, who probably
has the support of a large chunk of the 7m-strong Zulu nation, and
represents, at the very least, a significant spoiling force.
Chief Buthelezi, whose public speeches have tended towards the hysterical in
recent weeks, made clear yesterday that he was enraged by Saturday's peace
deal between Messrs de Klerk and Mandela, by far the most powerful leaders
in this troika. Government, he said, was conniving with the ANC to stitch up
a political deal excluding other South African leaders (he is the only one
with significant support). They would do so at their peril.
It was a chilling spectacle: every one of the 7,000-odd men gathered at a
sports ground in the ANC-controlled KwaMashu township carried several
'traditional' weapons - the spears and clubs, sharpened sticks and hatchets
that are to be banned under an agreement reached on Saturday between the
government and the ANC. Mr de Klerk had tried to placate Chief Buthelezi by
arguing for a clause in the agreement permitting traditional weapons to be
carried for cultural occasions, with special permission from a judge. Chief
Buthelezi indicated what he thought of that concession: 'I will never ever
under any circumstances ever ask anybody for permission to carry a Zulu
cultural weapon.'
His supporters left the stadium after yesterday's rally - staged to
commemorate King Shaka, the belligerent Zulu potentate who subdued much of
southern Africa by war - in marauding bands, contained only with difficulty
by police. Local residents were terrified.
The rally was the culmination of a week of commemorative events for King
Shaka, during which Chief Buthelezi has warned of civil war with the ANC if
the movement carries out its stated aim of marching on the capital of the
Zulu homeland, Ulundi. He compared the planned ANC march with the 1879
British invasion of Ulundi - and promised a bloodbath. Zulu spokesmen said
they were ready for a new 'washing of the spears' at Ulundi.
In one sense, Chief Buthelezi's angry rejection of Saturday's peace deal
should come as no surprise: two key provisions of the deal - those covering
traditional weapons, and measures to fence off and patrol single-sex
township hostels (where Zulu inhabitants predominate)  - are directly aimed
at his supporters. Yet he was not present at the talks; and though the
government insists he was kept informed of their progress, his consent was
not sought before agreement.
His rejection of the deal highlights the fragility of both South Africa's
peace process and the deal struck on Saturday, which marked the resumption
of constitutional talks between the government and the ANC, suspended since
June. But it does not render the agreement meaningless. In the words of Mr
Zach de Beer, veteran leader of the liberal Democratic party: 'Inkatha is an
important organisation whose co-operation is highly desirable . . . However,
the work must go on whether or not Inkatha takes part.'
Nevertheless, Inkatha must be brought back on board, and that delicate task
will fall largely to Mr de Klerk, whose government created the KwaZulu
homeland as a 'self-governing state' (with Chief Buthelezi as chief
minister) and whose Treasury funds its budget. Because of those links, many
ANC leaders take the view that Chief Buthelezi will do as he is told by
Pretoria, being no more than a glorified South African civil servant.
But this ignores the fact that Chief Buthelezi commands significant
political support (at least in his home base of Natal) and, more
importantly, that Mr de Klerk relies on the politically conservative Zulu
leader to deliver as many as 1m votes to a moderate electoral coalition
headed by the ruling National party.
So Mr de Klerk can push the Zulu leader, but only so far. For the sake of
his own political prospects - and, many would argue, for the sake of
avoiding civil war - he cannot afford to alienate Chief Buthelezi totally.
To that end, Mr de Klerk has demanded in previous constitutional talks that
South Africa be ruled by a revolving presidency in the transition to full
democracy: three men - he, Mr Mandela and Chief Buthelezi - would rule in a
government of national unity, and there would be strong devolution of power
to give regional leaders like Chief Buthelezi a guaranteed power base. The
ANC rejects such a troika arrangement, and opposes anything but limited
devolution.
Now the ANC and the government have agreed to resume talks, this and other
problems will resurface. While the two sides claim to have made some
progress on constitutional issues in recent months (despite the fact that
contacts were officially suspended), bottom-line issues such as how to share
power are unresolved. Chief Buthelezi's performance yesterday underscores
such difficulties.
At least the ANC and the government have demonstrated a will to compromise,
which has absent recently. After four months spent trading insults and
blame, South Africa's two most important leaders are again trading polite
conversation - and political concessions. The government made costly
compromises on Saturday, which it had insisted only days before were
impossible. It agreed to release three ANC members who had killed white
civilians in terrorist attacks, and acknowledged that security force members
would have to admit crimes committed against the ANC before receiving
amnesty. The ANC, for its part, offered to re-examine its campaign of mass
protest action, which has seriously disrupted the economy and led to
violence.
Critically perhaps, South Africa enters the new round of negotiations under
heavy international pressure to settle. If nothing else, the past three
months' stand-off has achieved an expanded role for the international
community in monitoring violence, and new government openness to
international mediation.
But after two and a half years spent stumbling from massacre to massacre,
from breakdown to bust-up, South Africans will not easily be persuaded that
expressions of renewed goodwill between Messrs Mandela and de Klerk will be
enough to propel them past the many obstacles in the way of a democratic
South Africa. Now for the hard part.

According to its list of the country's wealthiest females, the Queen is only
the tenth richest and ranks well behind Christine Goulandris, a 44-year old

One thing is certain about the new decor of the dining room at the Institute
of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. Its construction must easily
have consumed every hour of the weeks during which the restaurant was closed
for refurbishment. Whether it was worth the wait is another matter.
A good few of the accountants - a breed not generally renowned for their
experimentalism - may find eating inside a psychedelic post-modernist
collage not exactly to their taste.
There are neo-classical white-framed mirrors at the entrance and a bizarrely
amateurish bas-relief with tortured figures on one wall. All around,
Magritte-style friezes of Grecian vases and paintings are interspersed with
panels of fake green marble and softwood. The centrepiece clinging to the
ceiling is best described as a squashed metal octopus with red ear-rings. .

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Have you noticed how many of the hot-shot builders of the last boom have
swallowed their pride and are re-emerging on the boards of far smaller
competitors?
The latest is Terry Upsall, who was on the point of floating Britain's
second biggest housebuilder CHB when Hanson took over its heavily indebted
parent last year. At 55, he has just been given a non-executive berth at The
Berkeley Group, headed by Tony Pidgley, whose ambition is to turn his
building firm into the most profitable in its sector.
Pidgley, who is 10 years younger than Upsall, has already befriended Roger
Lewis after he lost his job as chief executive of once high flying Crest
Nicholson, and made him his finance director.
Meanwhile John Swanson, who was ousted as chairman and chief executive of
Barratt last year, has been taken on as operations director of the much
smaller Tay Homes, and his deputy, John Cassidy, has re-emerged as finance
director of the private Wain Group.
Unlike most of the other casualties, Upsall lost his job through no fault of
his own. Hence his re-surfacing at Berkeley is particularly intriguing. At
Beazer he was used to running his own show and building more than five times
as many houses as Berkeley.
Hard to see how he can be content playing second fiddle to Pidgley, unless
he's being groomed as Berkeley's first independent chairman.

What better occupation for an out of work politician than being a chat show
host? Former Labour leader Neil Kinnock is to take over BBC Radio's Jimmy
Young show for a week in November, and there are rumours that David Mellor
might stand in on the Wogan show.
Brian Walden, the former Labour MP, has made a much bigger hit on TV than he
ever did in parliament, as has Robert Kilroy-Silk. Charles Kennedy, the
Liberal Democrat president and stand-in presenter on radio's 'Start the
week', is another MP who sometimes seems to be in the wrong business.
Will the prattling party now be joined by Labour's Bryan Gould? If he's
preparing to make his political exit, he should have no difficulty finding a
TV spot.
Besides being an accomplished reporter at Thames TV in the early 1980's, he
is said to have once turned down the chance of replacing Walden on Weekend
World.
Given that Gould's 54th birthday is only a few months away, a final career
as a TV personality is a tempting alternative.

FT  28 SEP 92 / Letter: Case against a referendum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CLAUDE RODRIGUE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I have returned from holidaying in France, shortly after the
referendum.
During my stay, I obtained a copy of the Traite sur l'Union Europeenne which
was issued to all electors and, being bilingual, I started to read the 62
pages of fine print, which might have made some sense to members of the
legal profession, but few others. I soon gave up.
I spoke to a number of people in widely differing walks of life, none of
whom had read the document, or knew anyone who had. Few really had a
considered opinion of the issue, and frequently were just expressing
disapproval of one or other of their party leaders (Mitterrand, Le Pen and
Marchais being mentioned most).
I hope Mr Major will continue to resist any pressure for a referendum in
Britain. We have had a general election this year; let us now leave the
decisions and negotiations to the representatives we have elected, and hope
that they justify our trust. I am sure of one thing, the man or woman in the
street is not competent to understand the intricacies and details of the
treaty.

FT  28 SEP 92 / Letter: No end to fundamentals of Swedish Model
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr ELIZABETH BAIGENT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Robert Taylor's statement that 'popular support for the all-party
agreement (in Sweden) suggests that the end of the old Swedish Model will
not be a cause for national mourning' ('The ERM and Maastricht: Sweden
unties welfare apron strings', September 23) cannot go unchallenged. The
most striking aspects of the agreement are that it is a collective agreement
which reflects consensus that all groups in society must share the costs of
tackling the nation's economic problems.
It is also striking that most Swedes lay the blame for the crisis at the
feet of bankers whose activities in the 1980s have been followed by a
banking crisis in the 1990s. These men (sic) are perceived to have been not
only incompetent, but also immoral in their greedy pursuit of speculative
wealth.
The Swedish decision to pursue a collective solution to problems perceived
to stem from individual greed hardly suggests an end to the most fundamental
aspects of the Swedish model. Rather it suggests a decisive rejection of
Thatcherite-Majorite policies of individualism based on political
confrontation and economic and social polarisation.

FT  28 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Europe must keep moving
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN EUROPEAN leaders meet at their emergency summit in Birmingham next
month, their task will be nothing less than to craft a crisis strategy for
the future of the European Community. Their formal agenda will be more
specific: the currency explosion which forced Britain and Italy out of the
Community's exchange rate mechanism, and the growing uncertainties over the
future of the Maastricht treaty. But the job of the summit will not be to
draft technical responses to technical problems, but to ensure that the
shock of the present crisis does not drive the process of European
integration right off the road.
The Birmingham summit will present a choice between two broadly distinct
strategies. The first is that all 12 member states should proceed together
along the path they have already mapped out together, which means ratifying
and implementing the Maastricht treaty. The alternative would be a strategy
of variable geometry, in which some of the member states would move ahead
down the road of economic and political integration more quickly than
others.
For political and psychological reasons, the traditionally orthodox strategy
is to be preferred, if it can be sustained. Not merely are all 12 member
states manifestly part of a European family of nations, but the Community's
institutional model has always been based on the premise that all member
states should normally take part in all joint policies on a basis of legal
equality. One consequence of this universalist system is that it gradually
reinforces the sense of shared interests; over the years, the 12 have
increasingly recognised that their common interests go beyond the narrow
specifics of their existing treaties; that is why they negotiated a treaty
as wide-ranging and far-reaching in its scope and ambitions as Maastricht.
More soluble
Ideally, then, the 12 would press ahead with the Maastricht treaty as
quickly as possible, and the British government would bring it back to the
House of Commons for ratification as soon as possible. This would still
leave the Danish problem unresolved, but it might become more soluble, one
way or another, after all the other 11 states had ratified the treaty; at
the very least the choice facing the Danish government and people would be
more clear cut.
The trouble with this orthodox strategy is that it is not at all clear that
it can be put into practice, and very doubtful indeed that it could be put
into practice as rapidly as circumstances demand.
Mr John Major, the British prime minister, has reaffirmed his commitment to
the treaty. But he has made clear that he will not bring it back to
Parliament until he knows how the Danes propose to deal with the problem of
their No vote. Even then British ratification may remain uncertain: it may
not be possible to get it through the House without causing a deep split in
the Conservative party, and Mr Major may not soon feel strong enough to face
that kind of struggle.
Second, it is not at all clear how the Danish No vote can be reversed in a
quick and painless way. If the rest of the Community were to offer
substantive changes of policy to Denmark, the treaty would have to be
revised, and ratification would have to start from the beginning again. If
there are no changes to the treaty, Danish voters have no reason to change
their minds.
Deeply damaging
In any case, the combined effect of the British and Danish factors will, at
best, be to delay the ratification of the Treaty for another year or so.
Such a delay now would be deeply damaging to the Community process. The
Danish and French referendums have revealed serious popular misgivings about
the Maastricht treaty, and the currency crisis has cast doubt on the
durability of the existing European Monetary System, to say nothing of the
future credibility of the Maastricht programme for economic and monetary
union. Europe's leaders must urgently come up with responses to restore
credibility to the Community process.
One option would be for an inner group of member states to move ahead
together more rapidly than the rest, for example towards economic and
monetary union in anticipation of the ratification of Maastricht. The treaty
expressly allows for such variable geometry, in which not all member states
would move to the single currency at the same time; and the present currency
crisis has obviously postponed any timetable by which Britain and Italy
could move to Phase 3.
In practice, any variable geometry initiative can only come jointly from
France and Germany. It was their leadership which was primarily responsible
for pushing the Maastricht negotiations to a conclusion, and it is their
political relationship which will determine the future dynamic of the
European Community. If they believe they can make a success of an
accelerated move towards monetary union, in association with the Benelux
countries, they should press ahead. What Europe can least afford right now
is a prolonged period of drift and uncertainty.

FT  28 SEP 92 / What's wrong with the Eurowets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Maastricht treaty and the European exchange rate mechanism have been
considered in two separate compartments. The first has been the concern of
foreign ministries; the second of finance ministries and central banks.
As a result, politicians and officials who want to establish their European
credentials, but dislike - or are indifferent to - the sound money
implications of present and proposed European monetary arrangements
('Eurowets' for short) are tempted to advocate the ratification of the
Maastricht treaty, after arrangements have been made to meet the concerns of
Denmark, but to leave the monetary side in abeyance. This is not, however, a
sensible distinction.
It may be that the Maastricht treaty is dead. Or it may be that the ERM will
break up beyond hope of resurrection. But on the assumption that both
survive - even if Germany and France also adopt a fast track towards
monetary union - the monetary and the political sides will have to be
brought together.
The Eurowets have a legal case. The exchange rate mechanism was established
in 1979 by a protocol between central banks outside the Treaty of Rome. The
ERM comes into the picture in relation to the transition to stage three of
full economic and monetary union (Emu). Countries will only be eligible to
take part in the latter, if they have been for two years within the narrow
band of the ERM without devaluation.
If monetary union is established at the beginning of 1997, the implication
is that participants will have to have been in the ERM in 1995 and 1996.
Given the difficulty of moving from being out in the cold to a rigid
adherence to the narrow band, a would-be participant would be well advised
to join the ERM under less restrictive conditions by 1993 or early 1994 at
the latest.
If Britain exercises the protocol which allows it to opt out of monetary
union, then there will be no obligation to rejoin the ERM. At this stage
however the question the arises: what is Maastricht for?
The makers of the Maastricht treaty envisaged a three-stage process with
stage one (in which we are already supposed to be) consisting of the ERM,
stage three marking the beginning of full monetary union and stage two as a
transitional one beginning in 1994. Many statements by governments and
central bankers have made it clear that all the main players are expected to
be in the ERM by that year and to move to narrow bands not long afterwards.
Countries like Portugal and Greece would, of course, be allowed to move at a
slower pace.
The ERM was established as a first step to monetary union. The Delors
committee was set up in 1988 with the express object of reviving the
project. Indeed Jacques Delors himself has always regarded Emu as the
central part of Maastricht and the main political vehicle for European
integration. The foreign policy and defence aspects were inserted at a later
stage, partly because the German government was not prepared to sign away
the D-Mark without progress towards a federal Europe.
Predictably, the wider provisions turned to be mainly foliage around Emu.
The provisions for a common foreign policy avoid majority voting and bypass
the Brussels Commission for the most important decisions. There will only be
a common foreign policy if Community countries can get their acts together
on issues such as Yugoslavia. But that was the case before.
I was always puzzled by John Major's insistence that the Maastricht treaty
was at least as valuable for what it leaves out as for what it contains. If
the UK opts out of both the Social Charter (as it should) and of monetary
union (as it should not) the treaty becomes an empty shell.
Its main advantage for the UK is that it provides a route by which a House
of Commons can one day join a monetary union. So long as Britain rejoins the
ERM or any successor arrangement, the hope remains alive. Otherwise, it
makes no difference whether parliament ratifies Maastricht or not.

FT  28 SEP 92 / Shaken Europe's pillar of strength: The EC's merger task
force has risen to the challenge of cross-border regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES and ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The lengthening shadows over the future of European integration have left
most Brussels Eurocrats in a far from festive mood. But Mr Colin Overbury,
head of the Commission's merger task force, is an exception. Not only does
he have something to celebrate; he even has his own stock of sparkling wine,
labelled Cuvee Merger Task Force.
After two years in operation, Mr Overbury and his 50-strong staff have come
a long way to win the confidence of previously sceptical European companies
and national competition watchdogs. They have convinced them that they are
up to the task of policing large and complex cross-border mergers.
Though some of the task force's recommendations - the basis for merger
decisions by the full Commission - have aroused controversy, it is widely
praised for a businesslike approach which has combined speedy handling of
cases with impartiality and open-mindedness.
Gaining credibility has been crucial both to the effectiveness of the task
force, and to Brussels' wider - and politically controversial - drive in the
past few years to make a liberal competition policy a central pillar of the
Community's economic development.
Competition is one of the few areas where the Commission may act without
specific authorisation from EC governments. But until a few years ago it
used its powers timidly, issuing decisions which often seemed more to
reflect dry legal theory than market realities.
Under Sir Leon Brittan, competition commissioner since 1988, and Mr Peter
Sutherland, his Irish predecessor, things have changed radically. Both men
have sought to transform policy from a reactive safeguard into a positive
force for creating and policing the emerging single market.
As well as winning expanded powers over mergers from EC governments Sir Leon
has cracked down on industrial subsidies, toughened scrutiny of state-owned
industries and challenged entrenched national monopolies in energy and
telecommunications.
His activism has won respect, if not always friendship. It has also inspired
countries such as Belgium and Italy, where competition law has been weak or
non-existent, to introduce national controls on cartels and mergers.
However, as the visibility and reach of EC policy have grown, so has debate
about its direction and exercise. Critics in countries such as France claim
it has already gone too far, while free-marketeers in Germany worry that
Brussels is not tough and independent enough.
This divergence underlines the delicate political balance on which the
Commission's authority rests. Uniquely among anti-trust bodies, the
Commission is charged with disciplining transgressors which are often not
private companies but sovereign governments.
Pressures to compromise arise not just because EC governments seek to
influence individual commissioners in cases involving sensitive national
interests. The Commission also cannot afford to antagonise too seriously
governments on whose support and goodwill it depends to promote other areas
of policy.
Brussels' ability to stick to its pro-competition line will be called into
question if national resistance to further EC integration - and the
achievement of the single market - continues to grow. For the moment, the
merger task force is counting on procedural efficiency and the quality of
its legal and economic arguments to weather the storm. All 120 cases it has
handled have been dealt with on time, and none of its recommendations has
been rejected by the full Commission or challenged in the courts.
Despite tight deadlines (see panel), Mr Overbury says the task force relies
on thorough analysis of the economic impact of mergers rather than just on
legal criteria. He encourages companies to discuss proposed deals with his
staff and, if appropriate, to modify the terms before they are formally
notified.
This streamlined and pragmatic approach contrasts with the more long-winded
and ponderous proceedings typical of other parts of DG IV, the Commission's
competition directorate, and some national merger authorities. Indeed, some
companies have deliberately structured deals so they fall within the task
force's jurisdiction.
But the fledgling policy is still feeling its way. This is partly because of
technical imperfections in the EC merger regulation, which Mr Overbury
concedes is 'full of warts, obviously the child of compromise at a very late
stage.'
For instance, Brussels still has difficulty deciding which joint ventures
should be vetted by the task force under the merger regulation, and which by
another arm of DG IV under Article 85 of the Rome Treaty, which employs
different criteria.
Some lawyers also complain that policy is unpredictable. Ms Diana Good, a
Brussels-based partner in Linklaters &amp; Paines, a London law firm, says the
task force makes too many 'experimental' decisions, by which it refuses to
be bound in the future.
Legally the most controversial innovation was the task force's objection
that the recent takeover of Perrier of France by Nestle of Switzerland would
create duopoly - or shared dominance - of the French mineral water market.
Most merger control experts agree that controlling duopolies is essential.
However, many question whether the merger regulation entitles the Commission
to do so, and whether it was proper to introduce the doctrine so abruptly.
Some think Brussels should follow US anti-trust authorities by publishing
guidelines setting out planned policy changes.
Mr Overbury rejects guidelines, saying they could prove too constricting and
send confusing signals to companies. But some lawyers think the Commission
is also reluctant to seek the necessary authorisation from governments for
fear of re-opening divisive arguments about the role of merger policy.
Officials insist that debate is already settled. Though France and several
southern countries originally wanted a merger policy which favoured
employment and creating European champion companies, they say the principle
that cases be judged solely by their effect on competition is no longer
seriously contested.
However, the solidity of the consensus has yet to be thoroughly tested,
since the Commission has blocked only one deal - last year's planned
takeover of De Havilland, the Canadian aircraft maker, by Aerospatiale of
France and Alenia of Italy.
Brussels' readiness then to brave French and Italian fury is cited by
officials as proof of its determination and independence. Yet the decision
also exposed the limits of the Commission's solidarity, splitting its 17
members and scraping through by a single vote.
In other cases, the Commission's bark has seemed worse than its bite. For
all its objections to duopolistic dominance in the Perrier case, its
decision left Nestle and BSN of France controlling three - quarters of the
French mineral water market and imposed what are widely considered minor
conditions on the deal.
Some lawyers think the task force's tight deadlines, which give third
parties only 10 days to comment on deals, may allow some questionable
mergers to slip through the net. Others believe the Commission is
deliberately treading carefully, lest an unduly harsh line stifle an
important force for EC economic integration and trigger political hostility.
'It's a fragile institutional situation,' says one.
The case for caution has recently been reinforced by rising resentment in
many countries towards meddling by Brussels. EC competition officials are
openly relieved to have avoided any contentious proceedings involving France
in the run-up to its referendum on the Maastricht Treaty.
Sir Leon has sought to calm the waters by declaring his commitment to
'subsidiarity' - the doctrine that decisions should not be made centrally if
they can be made nationally. In particular, he wants national courts to hear
more EC competition cases.
However, his enthusiasm is clearly tempered by reservations about how far
national bodies can be relied on to do the job. Europe as a whole, he says,
has yet to develop a 'competition culture' of the kind which has evolved in
Germany.
Precisely for this reason, some experts say, EC policy needs to be shielded
more effectively from political meddling. The argument has been made most
insistently by Dr Wolfgang Kartte, former head of the German cartel office,
who has called for an independent European competition authority, separate
from the Commission.
Sir Sydney Lipworth, chairman of the UK Monopolies and Mergers Commission,
has suggested that investigation of cases be entrusted to a special body,
independent of the Commission's prosecuting arm, which would be obliged to
publish its findings.
Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, is also said to favour an
independent competition agency on the grounds that it would insulate
commissioners from a source of bruising political conflicts. Sir Leon,
however, rejects all such proposals.
Constitutionally, competition policy must always be accountable to a higher
authority, he says. But to hive off policy to an independent agency,
answerable to the Commission or the Council of Ministers, would be an 'open
invitation' to those bodies to override the agency's every decision.
His argument is given some substance by the position of France. Since the De
Havilland affair, French ministers have seemed more favourable to the idea
of an independent agency, in the apparent belief that its powers could be
easily checked.
In the last analysis, the strength of Sir Leon's case will continue to
depend on his skill in winning arguments in the Commission. As one member of
the task force puts it: 'He's our Gary Lineker. We give him the ball and he
puts it in the net.'
However, goal-scoring may become steadily harder if the Commission's
increasingly defensive mood leads it to flinch from controversial decisions.
Nor is there any guarantee that Sir Leon, whose term as competition
commissioner is due to expire at the end of this year, will have a successor
as politically adept, forceful or committed to free-market principles.
Meanwhile, Sir Leon insists on being judged by results. 'No system is
perfect, though the case has not been made for the changes which have been
suggested,' he says. 'However, if the fundamental reason for change was that
the Commission's record showed it wasn't behaving responsibly, the balance
of arguments could shift.'

EUROPEAN COMPETITION POLICY: KEEPING CONTROL OF CONCENTRATION
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Main provisions of EC merger regulation:
 -Applies to 'concentrations' which involve companies with combined
  worldwide sales of Ecu 5bn and two or more companies with EC sales of
  Ecu 250m
 -Once notified by Brussels, deals are automatically suspended for three
  weeks, or longer if necessary
 -Merger task force has one month from notification to decide whether a
  deal is 'compatible with the common market'
 -If task force has 'serious doubts' about a deal, it launches a full
  investigation. Commission then has four months to decide whether to
  approve the deal, block it or insist on modifications

FT  28 SEP 92 / Arts: Mahler - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Thursday night, Yevgeny Svetlanov conducted the Philharmonia in Mahler's
Symphony no. 6, and in nothing else. There was no interval. Excellent idea]
 -the usual plan, with a very substantial work that doesn't quite fill an
evening, is to tack on some hors d'oeuvre, as like as not under-rehearsed.
The well-filled Festival Hall proved that Mahler audiences, at least, don't
require make-weights.
When Svetlanov's concert was first announced, one knew partly what to
expect. The symphony would be pretty loud, with the brass accorded special
prominence. It would be kept on a tight rhythmic rein, with no indulging in
ironic Viennese graces, and though it was sure to be a stern affair, it
would be innocent (for better or worse) of anything like Expressionist
hysteria. That was indeed how it was, but it was much more besides.
The Sixth is the one Mahler work, after his early Klagende Lied, that drives
relentlessly through to a black, despairing close. (The Ninth and Das Lied
von der Erde have 'tragic' endings too, perhaps, but compromised by
visionary hopes.) Though Svetlanov is a Mahler-lover of long standing, he
doesn't hear him with Austrian ears - alert for sentimental parody, twisted
echoes from the past, snuggly nuances. He took the symphony very straight,
holding firmly to well-judged tempi. If he left some intimate corners
unexplored (the Andante Moderato was a smooth, public affair, like
unemphatic Tchaikovsky), his instinct for overall proportions was unerring.
Many 'subtler' readings of the Sixth come apart at the main seams,
especially in the long, fiercely taxing Finale; the continuous thrust of
Svetlanov's Finale was seamless, and the outcome thoroughly satisfying.
Without theatrical tragedy-airs: but the Sixth is after all Mahler's most
cannily and compactly-built symphony, not an opera.
The Philharmonia brass - including seven trumpets, one more than Mahler
requested - were indeed prominent, but largely because they were
magnificent. Trumpets brilliant (triumphantly led by John Wallace), horns
secure and forthright, a brazen fist of trombones and a notably musical tuba
(John Jenkins): an aural feast, complemented by string-playing of fine,
impersonal energy. I regretted only the cow-bells, rendered here in an even,
quasi-electronic tremolo. Surely Mahler wanted irregular clanking, frankly
picturesque, distant sounds from untroubled life in the foothills, far
below.

Time was when it was fields of yellow rape which made the environmentally
concerned townie sound off. Now, it is the sight of fields deep in dock and
nettles which makes one hiss through clenched teeth, 'set aside'. BBC 1's
Panorama (9.30) analyses that ultimate affront to the Protestant work ethic,
paying farmers Pounds 84 an acre to let the weeds grow, plus the affront to
Darwinianism of keeping unprofitable Yorkshire hill-farmers in business.
Not, of course, that farmers are necessarily keeping afloat. If you can bear
to watch, 'Going Bust', on ITV's World in Action (8.30) is about just that -
the bitter experiences of those who have seen their businesses go down the
drain.
Out of Darkness, BBC 2's interesting series on African affairs, this week
looks north to Algeria (7.50). It examines the roots of the political and
economic crisis, which is fraught with menace for the EC's southern fringe.
A million Algerians died in the fight to win freedom from France, and
Algeria looked like a viable Islamic and socialist society as long as the
oil revenues were there. Now, since the murder of Mohammed Boudiaf in July,
Algeria's neighbours must hold their breath.

FT  28 SEP 92 / Arts: Katya Kabanova - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Glyndebourne Touring Opera launches its annual autumn tour in a new and
rewarding way. The home theatre, normally the launch pad, has been rendered
unusable by the current re-building programme, so the company set off
instead with a month-long sojourn at Sadler's Wells Theatre - its first-ever
in London.
This is a splendid venture. Too little opera of a non-metropolitan origin
has been reaching London recently; the programme of the tour - Katya
Kabanova, Figaro and The Rake's Progress - represents some of Glyndebourne's
most interesting work of the last decade-and-a-half; and Sadler's Wells,
though not exactly a lovable home-away-from-home, does offer the productions
a performing space generally in scale with their original dimensions.
The first opera of the tour, Katya, provides an additional source of
pleasure: historical appropriateness. In this same theatre 42 years ago,
under Rafael Kubelik's baton, Sadler's Wells Opera mounted the first British
production of the very same opera - the initial flourish of the enthusiasm
for Janacek that was eventually to lead to the current national Janacek
boom.
That Katya was performed, of course, in English translation. The single
cloud over Thursday's opening night came with GTO's dotty insistence on
having an almost entirely British cast prattle away in carefully-learnt
Czech while surtitles pour out overhead. In this of all theatres, and
operas, the need for the closest possible communication between singer and
audience should surely outweigh any ideological insistence on the purity of
the original language.
This factor has to be stressed, since it seemed the main cause of a lack of
communicative passion in an otherwise thoroughly well-studied,
seriously-addressed performance. Nikolaus Lehnhoff's 1988 production, in the
beautifully stark, bright-coloured designs of Tobias Hoheisel, offers an
unusually definite (if at times over-detailed) response to both the
bourgeois Russian location and Janacek's electrically vital musical idiom.
It creates a form of heightened operatic naturalism capable of charging the
work with new intensity - a form which then requires to be seized and filled
out by cast and conductor equally. On Thursday this task was tentatively
approached. David Angus's conducting of the GTO Orchestra was musicianly
(scoring carefully balanced, words impressively audible) but altogether too
cautious, too lacking in firmness of attack.
Most of the cast sing well - notably Timothy Robinson (a
more-than-promisingly sweet-voiced Kudryash), Adele Paxton (Varvara) and
Christopher Gillett (Tichon) - in a rather politely English way. The British
debut of the handsome French tenor Christian Papis (Boris) introduces us to
a fine, dramatically responsive singer who would be a godsend to our
companies in the right repertory: Gounod and Massenet, I feel, rather than
Janacek.
Susan Bullock in the title role has much of the desired freedom and
freshness of presence, and produces much tenderly floated soft singing;
under pressure she can sound edgy, overstretched. So far only Eiddwen
Harrhy, imaginatively cast as the most silkily venomous of Kabanichas,
achieves any consistent stoking of the opera's fires.
GTO at Sadler's Wells Theatre, September 24 - October 24, then in Plymouth,
Sheffield, Southampton, Manchester and Oxford until November 28

FT  28 SEP 92 / Arts: The build-up of Georgian Bath - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Georgian Bath is a work of art and like works of art, needs both love and
interpretation. A city conceived and designed like Bath should be seen whole
and yet understood in parts, just like a great painting. Recently an
important new institution devoted to furthering the understanding of the
city opened its doors.
The Building of Bath Museum is an intelligent new venture that occupies a
mid-18th century building that was formerly the Countess of Huntingdon's
Chapel. It stands above the raised pavement of The Paragon, north of Walcot
Street and east of The Circus and The Royal Crescent. The object of this new
museum, run by the Bath Preservation Trust, is to show how the Georgian city
was built.
Let me say at once that this new museum is extremely enjoyable to visit and
utterly engrossing. Like all the best museums, it is didactic without being
tedious. It is small and comfortable, and the architect for the adaptation
of this 1765 chapel, Michael Brawne, is to be congratulated on his
unobtrusive, economical and ingenious conversion.
The displays tell a complex story with clarity and precision. The city of
Bath that we see today, although it has Roman baths at its heart, is a
Georgian city that was planned and built within the century that spanned the
reigns of the four King Georges. Edinburgh, Dublin and London all have
Georgian architecture but Bath remains unique.
Although the city did grow with the arrival of Brunel's Great Western
Railway, and was ignorantly damaged by planners, philistines and architects
in the decades following the Second World War, it does still look like a
predominantly Georgian city. There are plenty of places in Bath where the
views are those seen by its original creators.
In the new museum, visitors are led through the construction of the city's
houses and on through the planning and growth of the city. I enjoyed the
first impressions - portraits of the major characters in Bath's development:
John Wood the Elder, Richard 'Beau' Nash and Ralph Allen. And Oliver
Goldsmith's writings about a typical day's pleasure in the happy valley
between Bath's hills, is both instructive and a joy to read. The flavour of
the spa and resort is distinctive and agreeable.
The flavour of the architecture is perhaps more difficult to convey. I was
impressed by the way one of the first exhibits explains what classical
architecture is, and what the language of columns and Orders really means.
You understand it was John Wood the Elder's sense of architectural history
that made it possible for him to envision a city of great classical
compositions in the undulating landscape. He was also intrigued by
pre-historic British monuments, and had a sense of the picturesque.
The exhibition demonstrates that the early builders of Bath had more than
just aesthetic vision: they were business men with an understanding of
leases and profit and, above all, they were completely cognizant of all the
practicalities of building.
One of the most fascinating facts that emerges about the building of Bath is
that the 18th century building craftsman was, at his best, virtually an
artist. Design at that date did not depend simply upon an architect's effort
on the drawing board. It was something that was understood by the best
craftsmen at his fingertips. The progeny of that rare and happy marriage of
skilled hand and educated eye is to be seen everywhere in Bath.
It is the craftsman's skill that prevents this carved and cut stone city
from being seen as something uniform and sterile. Everywhere, inside and
outside the houses, there are details and elements of elegant variety. The
broad consensus of English Palladian architecture to be seen provides the
measured frame for individual architectural interpretation.
It is possible to understand this variety clearly by a glance at the
splendid donation of carved wooden models of the facades of a whole range of
Bath houses. They have all the qualities of a room full of human faces.
The success of the assembly of all the houses and public buildings into one
unified stone city can be judged from the large model of the whole of
Georgian Bath. The visitor can also illuminate at the touch of a button the
chronological sequences of the city's development and to pin-point
individual buildings. There is not space to show the effect of new
developments on the precious fabric of the older city, but I was told that
from time to time displays about threats to the city will be shown.
There are many routes into an understanding and appreciation of architecture
and a popular one begins with an enthusiasm for interior decoration. There
are several detailed displays about plasterwork, joinery, the composition
and colour of paint and the disposition of furniture, that bring the
architectural story around to style and comfort. There is no doubt about the
elegance of life in the city, and the nature of the interiors helped to
shape a degree of formality and manners in the conduct of the long days of
pleasure.
The Building of Bath Museum is already deservedly popular. It is a newly-cut
key to the city, opening doors that will lead to the paths of love and
understanding through the glorious architecture. The eyes and brain are
stimulated in a way that immediately enhances any walk through Bath.
The Preservation Trust and the whole team responsible for this skilled
exercise in interpretation deserve great praise. It could be a precedent for
similar displays in other historic towns.

FT  28 SEP 92 / Arts: When the Kissing Stopped - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Theatre managers often wonder what visual improvements they can introduce to
make their theatres more appealing. My demands are simple: just put a river
beside your theatre, and I will be happy. If the river also runs under the
theatre, and if there are also a mill pond and an old mill wheel on display,
well, so much the better.
Last year, I fell in love with the small and exquisite Watermill Theatre,
just outside Newbury Now I have fallen for the somewhat larger (seats
approx. 212) Mill at Sonning, four miles outside Reading: as I arrived, a
heron flew slowly past. Such venues appeal to one's fantasy of traditional
England.
The title of the Mill at Sonning's current production, When the Kissing
Stopped, suggests, however, other kinds of England. The prurient England of
sex comedy, maybe; or the wistfully elegiac England committed to autumnal
resignation. In the event, the play turns gradually from the former into the
latter, and here lies its charm.
Morry and Brenda run a joke shop which is also a costume-hire and kissogram
business. They are an unlikely couple - he a relentlessly jolly and bawdy
prankster, she a demure, refined, grey-haired spinster. You soon learn much
about them; they become remarkably real characters. Their most striking
habit is that, despite their incongruities, they have frequent bouts of
play-acting in which, as other characters, they can talk about their real
selves in the third person and even address otherwise insoluble problems.
The play's sex-comedy aspect promises to flower when the shop is visited by,
first, Sarah and then her husband Laurence - separately. Sarah is quick to
begin a sexy flirtation with Morry; Laurence finds himself drawn to Brenda.
There are numerous farcical moments, with characters hiding and overhearing
infidelities, or entering to discover couples in compromising positions. But
this is not farce, because farce depends on panic - and these two couples
are beyond panic.
Stroke by stroke, Morry emerges as an amiably helpless charlatan; and Brenda
starts to reorder her life. The director, Ian Masters, deserves praise for
the naturalness with which all this is handled. Morry and Brenda are
excellently realised by Linal Haft (though a trimmer, sexier man would make
more sense of the plot) and Frances White.
There are passages when the situation hovers on the brink between laughter
and tears so effectively that the play gets deep under your skin. But
Jefferies cannot always keep the play on that level. It's not hard to see
how much more comedy could be made from the plot without sacrificing its
poignancy; and eventually it rolls downhill into limp sentimentality. The
most obvious flaw is Laurence, too much of a fairy-godfather to be credible.
Everything he does fits neatly into place - whereas what makes Morry and
Brenda interesting and unusual is that they are not neat.
The Mill at Sonning, Berkshire, until October 24

FT  28 SEP 92 / Economics: US figures take centre stage
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ATTENTION shifts to the US this week where a string of indicators on the
real economy is unlikely to provide much comfort for President George Bush,
as he steps up his campaign for re-election.
One of the most politically sensitive indicators - the non-farm payrolls -
is forecast to show a small fall, although the data will be distorted by
several factors, including the termination of around 150,000 jobs created
following the Los Angeles riots. Furthermore, September's data did not
benefit from the federal summer jobs programme.
This week's national association of purchasing managers index is likely to
add to the picture of a sluggish economy by confirming that manufacturing
industry in the US is experiencing a very weak expansion.
In the UK, official reserve figures for September, out on Friday, will give
some indication of the cost of supporting sterling ahead of Britain's
departure from the European exchange rate mechanism on September 16. At the
end of August the Bank of England's reserves stood at Dollars 44.4bn. The
reserves were drawn on heavily in September as the Bank intervened on the
foreign exchanges in an attempt to hold sterling at its then ERM floor of
DM2.7780.
The depletion will have been partly offset, however, by the proceeds of the
Ecu10bn borrowing announced at the beginning of the month. About half of
this was drawn in September, while overseas inflows associated with the
third instalment of the regional electricity companies' privatisation should
have brought in about Pounds 250m, according to some economists' estimates.
A number of inflation measures are due out in Germany this week including
import prices and provisional cost of living figures. These, as always, will
be closely watched for signs that inflationary pressures in the German
economy - which lie behind the Bundesbank's tight monetary policies - are
easing.
In August, the cost of living rose by 0.2 per cent on the previous month in
spite of a sharp fall in seasonal food prices. Rents and services inflation
continued to rise at a well above average rate with increases of around 0.6
per cent on the month. The annual rate of inflation in August was 3.5 per
cent, compared with 3.3 per cent in the year to July. Most economists are
forecasting a low month on month rise in September.
'The beneficial effects of the very strong D-Mark on import prices and
producer prices, along with continuing weak commodity prices should continue
to help contain inflationary pressures,' said Ms Ruth Lea, economist at
Mitsubishi Bank in London.
Other economic events this week follow. The figures in brackets are the
median of economists' forecasts, from MMS International, a financial
information company.
Today: Brussels, EC finance ministers meeting; UK, Blackpool, Labour party
conference begins. Continues until October 2. Japan, August retail sales
(down 1.8 per cent on year).
Tomorrow: UK, Q2 savings ratio (11 per cent), Q2 real personal disposable
income; France, consumer prices index (up 2.7 per cent on year); US, August

unemployment rate (7.7 per cent), University of Michigan September survey of
US consumer sentiment, August factory orders (up 0.1 per cent), August
factory shipments; Canada, July leading indicator (unchanged on month);
Denmark, trade balance excluding ships.
During the week: Germany, August import prices (down 0.5 per cent on month,
down 4.1 per cent on year), October industrial production (down 0.2 per
cent), German manufacturing output (down 0.1 per cent), provisional
September cost of living (up 0.3 per cent on month, up 3.6 per cent on
year); Netherlands, consumer prices index (up 0.5 per cent on month, up 3.5
per cent on year), Italy, August foreign reserves.

RESULTS DUE
FOR Sears, the retailing group behind such names as Selfridges, Wallis,
Dolcis and Olympus, the most interesting number at tomorrow's interim
presentation will not be the forecast profit figure of about Pounds 20m
before tax and exceptionals, but the size of the latter item and the fate of
the dividend. Opinion is split over whether the 1.525p payment will be held.
Having sold the menswear division and warned of an accompanying Pounds 82m
extraordinary charge, Sears will probably deal with its other problem
division, footwear, above the line.
One analyst estimated Pounds 40m to Pounds 50m of exceptional costs for the
restructuring of the British Shoe Corporation. Up to 300 of its shops may be
candidates for closure.
Forte, the hotels group, announces half-year results on Thursday with City
forecasts ranging widely from pre-tax profits of Pounds 25m to Pounds 40m,
compared with last year's Pounds 42m. Attention will be focused on the
prospect of senior management changes.
Although analysts do not expect any immediate word on the possible
retirement of Lord Forte, the chairman, the group might announce the
appointment of some new non-executive directors.
Results on Friday from Amstrad, the electronics and computer company, are
expected to show a loss for the year to June 30 of about Pounds 70m. The
company's PC business, which provides it with the bulk of its revenue, has
been battered as the industry's major players have been engaged in an
all-out price war.
Few will be surprised if the results are worse than generally expected. The
more difficult question is whether the company will pay a dividend or pass
it altogether. Even if a dividend of some sort were paid, it would not
substantially dent Amstrad's Pounds 100m cash pile and would help to
maintain some measure of confidence in the company.
However, given Mr Sugar's stated interest in buying back the shares at 30p
each, and the expected size of the company's loss, it is not surprising that
many analysts expect Amstrad to pass its dividend.

FT  28 SEP 92 / Management: Good intentions are not enough - Britain's
charities are big business but only a minority of trustees understand their
financial, legal and managerial responsibilities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Once upon a time, there was a Pounds 17bn-turnover business sector with
220,000 employees, full of companies run by people who did not know whether
or not they were non-executive directors.
This sounds like the beginning of a corporate fairy-tale; it is, however,
present-day reality for Britain's voluntary sector.
A survey into the training needs of charity trustees has made the remarkable
discovery that only one-third of volunteers serving on management committees
knew whether they were trustees of their charities. Since this year's
Charities Act has greatly strengthened trustees' legal responsibilities,
some are in danger of learning the answer to the question at their personal
cost.
Tomorrow, the National Council for Voluntary Organisations and the Charity
Commission will publish the findings of a working party which has examined
ways of increasing the effectiveness of trustees and management committees.
The report reveals widespread lack of awareness among trustees of their
roles and responsibilities, allied to uncertainties about how lay committee
members should interact with full-time managers.
There are an estimated 1m people serving as trustees of charities and other
voluntary organisations in Britain, and up to 3m members of management
committees. The voluntary sector over which they preside is going through a
period of extensive change.
Government encouragement of voluntary organisations taking over the delivery
of welfare services from the public sector, a shift from grants to a
contract-based funding system, pressures from corporate supporters for
efficiency, and straightforward competition between charities for funds, are
all propelling the voluntary sector towards a more businesslike management
style.
Trustees have wide-ranging legal, financial and managerial responsibilities
that have been fortified by the new act. They may be held personally
responsible if they fail in their duties.
But, as the working party's report points out, their liabilities are
increasing at the very time when - because of the shift towards a more
businesslike culture - their actual involvement in management could
decrease.
'Professional staff will be taking the lead role in contract negotiations
and contract management, and there will be a danger that trustees are simply
left to rubber stamp their decisions.'
Issues raised by the report concerning the relationship between charity
trustees and managers mirror the current debate in the private sector over
strengthening the role of non-executive directors.
Voluntary workers see a number of possible dangers in charities becoming too
powerfully driven by full-time managers. One is the risk that voluntary
organisations will lose sight of their social objectives, with professional
managers becoming over-concerned with winning service contracts in
competition with other organisations. Another is the straightforward danger
of fraud if trustees are not adequately equipped to scrutinise the
activities of full-time staff.
The report says that demarcation problems between trustees and senior
managers are a source of considerable tension in some charities, with
failure to sort out such problems a 'major source of breakdowns in effective
management and governance'.
To ensure that trustees are properly equipped for their responsibilities,
the report calls for radical changes in their recruitment and training. By
undergoing proper training and raising the profile of their role, trustees
would 'be encouraged to be assertive enough to scrutinise the management of
their organisations'.
A typical trustee is over 45 years of age, white, from a professional
background and is likely to be male. Members of ethnic minorities are
under-represented, but proportionately less so than white working-class
people.
This is partly because charities tend to recruit individuals who already
possess financial, managerial and similar expertise to their management
committees. But, argues the report, there is more to being a trustee than
simply possessing business experience or professional skills, and the sector
must find ways of broadening its recruitment base.
To widen the pool from which trustees are drawn, suggests the report, there
is a need for training in committee work, decision-making, communications,
negotiating and related skills to be made available before prospective
trustees join committees. There might, suggests the report, be scope for a
qualification in trusteeship.
Much of the existing training available to trustees is, says the report,
'inaccessible, inappropriate or ignored.' One explanation for its being
ignored is provided by the working party's survey of existing trustees -
while many agreed training was needed, they implied that it was more
appropriate for fellow trustees than for themselves.
Tact in the presentation of training activities, suggests the working party,
should help to overcome this problem. 'Although a trustee might be reluctant
to attend a training course for trustees, he or she might happily take part
in a strategic planning meeting, attend a briefing on charity law or
participate in the organisation's internal review.'
Large charities including Save the Children, Barnardos and Mind have begun
formalising the induction of trustees and committee members. But nationally,
only an estimated 20 per cent of charity trustees receive formal
introduction to the work of the organisations they join, with fewer than 15
per cent receiving training directly related to trustee work.
The working party wants to see a range of new training initiatives
developed, including a standard information pack for voluntary organisations
and expansion of developments like the voluntary sector management course
launched by the Open University last year.
It says the Charity Commission should play a leading role in trying to
persuade the government, local authorities and other funders to invest in
improved provision of advice, support and training for trustees.
Improved training alone would not necessarily broaden the base from which
most trustees are selected. To achieve this, the working party wants
employers to encourage trusteeship among their staff by offering paid
time-off - it compares this with organisations including British Gas, IBM
and Esso already allowing employees time off to serve as school governors.
It hopes the CBI, Industrial Society and Institute of Directors will promote
a campaign to explain the role of trustees and attract more recruits from
industry.
Some charities, like Barnardos, require trustees to give written
confirmation that they understand the responsibilities they are taking on
and such an approach is endorsed by the working party: trustees should, it
says, be encouraged to consider at least once a year whether they were
willing to continue in office.
'It is essential that trustees are aware of the responsibilities they are
taking on. Although they may delegate the work involved in these
responsibilities to paid staff, they cannot delegate or avoid the
responsibilities themselves.'
One trustee described the life-cycle of trusteeship to the working party as
follows. 'Start as an energetic ignoramus; make every possible mistake for
five years; leave as an exhausted expert.'
If the working party's proposals for better trustee training succeed, they
should at least help shorten stage two of the cycle.

FT  28 SEP 92 / Management: Tea and sympathy for under-valued personnel
managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN FURNHAM and DAVID PENDLETON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Why do so few chief executives come from personnel backgrounds? For most
service companies and in many in other sectors, the salary bill is the
single largest revenue expense, yet those whose principal function is
advising on human resource management rarely make it to the top.
Indeed, many of those who work in a broad range of companies are struck by
the relative powerlessness of many personnel professionals. This is the case
even in companies that have attempted to change the focus of the function by
creating 'human resources' departments.
The influence of the personnel function is generally highest in the large
bureaucracies which are more concerned with the faithful execution of
procedures than the achievement of results. But even the large regulatory
bureaucracies have recently been seeking to change their cultures towards a
greater focus on customer service.
Personnel people are frequently to be found at the confluence of three
streams of activity - administration, welfare and industrial relations.
However, each of these functions is, itself, changing. Administration is
becoming increasingly computerised, requiring less specialised knowledge of
procedures but more of systems. Welfare is seen as anachronistic and is
disparagingly characterised as 'tea and sympathy', though its function
remains important. Industrial relations has changed profoundly since the
days of pre-Thatcherite Britain.
Other reasons for personnel's apparent decline are more self-inflicted:
Personal attributes. Sensitive to the pain of others, conscious of the costs
of redundancy and sensitised to personal difficulties, personnel managers
are chosen, not for their tough independence, but for their caring personae
which may well count against them.
Reactive approach. Coming from an administrative background, some personnel
specialists have a detailed and reactive approach to work and find it
difficult to make a contribution to the creation of future strategy, even
when the creative use of human resources may make the most enormous
difference to a company's competitive strength.
Lack of information. Unlike colleagues in operations or finance, they
frequently lack an important source of management information which will
guide senior managers' decision-making.
Invisibility. It is frequently difficult or impossible to detect the effect
of the personnel department on an organisation. Most other departments'
effects are readily discernible and their impact is immediate.
If the personnel specialist has a role in the future, it is as an internal
consultant to line management. But, in order to play this role, specialists
will have to develop themselves.
First, as markets change, organisations need to change. Helping to develop
the organisation and its workforce requires a great deal of skill which it
would be legitimate for many line managers to seek in the personnel
function.
Second, personnel departments should be playing a role in devising tracking
systems to enable senior managers to keep in touch with the thoughts and
feelings of employees. Those who advocate Management By Walking About
suggest that managers will automatically discern what is important. But this
does not take into account the difficulties of tracking the mood of the
large, complex and multinational organisation.
Finally, there is a perennial need to use human resources creatively and
come up with increasingly compelling reward schemes which are not based on
contributing to salary inflation. Personnel departments need
performance-related strategies which are logical, coherent and integrated
both with other departments' plans and overall business plans.

FT  28 SEP 92 / Last dive for nuclear submarines: Options for discarding
ageing British vessels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE END of the cold war has brought a problem: how to get rid of the
stockpiles of unused weapons and military hardware.
The basins of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, more than three miles deep,
fissured with canyons that descend for a further seven miles, have often
seemed a tempting way out, particularly for troublesome nuclear waste.
Dumping low-level radioactive waste was common from the end of the Second
World War until 1982 when the London Dumping Convention, a worldwide treaty,
brought in a moratorium.
Rules on using the sea as a rubbish tip have continued to tighten - last
week saw the signing of two new treaties to curb Atlantic and Baltic
pollution. A regional and more strict version of the original London
convention, signed by 12 countries, extended the ban on dumping radioactive
waste by 15 years.
That means that if Britain and France, which must soon decommission nuclear
submarines and power stations, want to resume dumping after 2008 they will
have to convince their co-signatories it is safe.
Four of Britain's ageing nuclear-powered submarines are already out of
service. Conqueror, which sunk the Belgrano in the Falklands war, Warspite
and Courageous are languishing in Devonport dockyard in Plymouth, and the
oldest, Dreadnought, is in Rosyth, Fife. The highly radioactive fuel rods
have been stripped out of the hulks but a surrounding 30ft section still
remains contaminated, making conventional scrapping hazardous and expensive.
If the submarines were filled with concrete and scuttled where the Ministry
of Defence has been tipping conventional munitions, about 400 miles west of
Cornwall, they would sink to the hills of the Porcupine Plain on the seabed,
provided no air was trapped in them. As they are designed to dive only to
around 230 metres, it is likely that they would collapse under the pressure
of nearly three miles of water.
And then? Environmentalists fear radioactivity could gradually leak out. But
some scientists believe that would be unlikely, particularly if the hulks
landed near the mid-Atlantic Ridge. The jagged mountains running the length
of the ocean have been formed by rock pushing upwards, forcing apart the two
plates that make up the seabed, and widening the Atlantic by 2cm to 3cm a
year.
Professor Keith Clayton, head of the Department of Environmental Sciences at
the University of East Anglia, and an adviser on joint defence-environmental
committees, says: 'The Atlantic is by far the best place to put sub-marines.
If they go into the deep trenches it is possible they could be dragged into
the depths of the earth within some tens of thousands of years.'
It is clear that more research is needed on the effects of past dumping
before a permanent decision is made. The Department of the Environment it
has found that 'the effects have been benign'. But a fuller picture will
have to wait until next year, when the London convention will complete a
thorough study of post-war dumping.
Meanwhile, investigation of local horror stories is also starting. Officials
from the former Soviet Union suggested last year that up to 12 nuclear
submarines and three nuclear ice-breakers - possibly containing radioactive
fuel - had been scuttled near Finland.
Last week a joint Norwegian-Russian research ship reported that
radioactivity levels were lower than had been reported 10 years ago,
although it has yet to take samples nearer the coast of the former Soviet
Union. The International Atomic Energy Authority said: 'They have not yet
found anything unusual although this does not mean there will be no trouble
in the future.'

FT  28 SEP 92 / Staff at Bank 'bribed by BCCI'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Serious Fraud Office and the US authorities are investigating
allegations that at least two Bank of England officials took bribes from
senior executives of Bank of Credit and Commerce International during the
1980s.
After the collapse of BCCI last year the officials were the subject of an
internal inquiry by the Bank which found no evidence of wrongdoing. However,
it subsequently asked the SFO to carry out its own investigation.
A Bank of England official said yesterday: 'We are aware of these
allegations and have been for some time. When we first became aware of them
we investigated them exhaustively and found they had no substance
whatsoever. But in view of the seriousness of the allegations we referred
them to the criminal authorities.'
The Bank launched its internal investigation more than nine months ago after
it learnt that the allegations had been made to US investigators probing the
BCCI affair. They were later repeated to the inquiry chaired by Lord Justice
Bingham.
The allegations were made by an individual claiming to be on familiar terms
with a number of BCCI officials. The individual, who describes himself as an
accountant and former Pakistani military intelligence officer, is believed
to have told Mr Robert Morgenthau, New York district attorney, that in 1980
he saw briefcases filled with money being passed by BCCI executives to
middle-ranking Bank officials.
According to a senior US investigator, the alleged bribes may have been in
the form of both cash and sexual favours. He added: 'We have not been able
yet to either confirm or disprove these reports, but we hope the matter will
be resolved in the UK in a manner that will restore public trust in the
British central bank.'
The allegations came just days before the expected publication in the US of
a report by Mr John Kerry, a Democratic chairman of the Senate foreign
relations sub-committee which is investigating BCCI. The report is expected
to be scathing about the Bank's handling of BCCI.

FT  28 SEP 92 / Schools' opt-out rate is low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S campaign to persuade schools in England and Wales to opt
out of local authority supervision has so far made little impact, with only
50 schools planning to ballot on opting-out in the coming month.
Local education authorities are responsible for more than 21,000 schools in
England. Only 277 have opted out so far. That number rises to 440 if all
schools at some point in the opting-out process are included.
Mr John Patten, education secretary, is targeting secondary schools as the
most likely candidates for grant-maintained status, under which schools
receive a lump sum - often larger than that available from their local
education authority - determined by the Education Department and are free to
spend it largely as they want.
His statement last week that financial advantages for grant-maintained
schools would continue was a deliberate attempt to increase the opt-out
rate. But the education white paper, published in July, appeared to signal
an end to the incentives, except for schools in low-spending authorities,
and tight public spending will be a serious constraint.

THE RECESSION has bruised but not defeated private companies, according to a
survey of 1,000 owner-managers, published today by Pannell Kerr Forster, the
chartered accountants.
While 65 per cent claimed to work more than 50 hours a week and 44 per cent
described bank managers as having been 'distinctly unhelpful' in the
previous year, 64 per cent looked to improved performance for their
companies over the next. Job satisfaction was also relatively high: 57 per
cent said it had been 'fairly or highly satisfying' to run their businesses
in the past year.

FT  28 SEP 92 / Gains tax far too high, says think tank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAPITAL gains tax is 'seriously flawed' and the rate at which it is levied
should be halved in order to increase revenues, according to the Institute
of Economic Affairs, the free-market think tank, Emma Tucker writes.
Five analysts of tax systems say in an IEA pamphlet published yesterday that
the existing UK rate of 40 per cent - among the highest in the world - may
be more than twice the rate that would maximise government revenue.
'The tax yield from CGT in Britain would probably increase substantially if
the rate were cut to 20 per cent or less,' they write.
The IEA claims that every instance of a capital gains tax rate cut in the US
has been 'rapidly followed by a significant increase in capital gains
realisations and by higher taxes paid on those gains'. It accuses Lord
Lawson, who as chancellor was responsible for 1988 reforms of capital gains
tax, of ignoring supply-side arguments that lower taxes would boost activity
and hence revenue.
The pamphlet's authors argue that the taxation of venture capital is heavy -
even prohibitive - in the UK, a fact which gives other countries in the
European Community a competitive advantage.

FT  28 SEP 92 / Construction pay falls by up to 15%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PAY and conditions in Britain's shrinking construction industry have
worsened considerably since the spring. Starting salaries for some
architects have been cut by up to 15 per cent since May, according to a
recent study, Andrew Taylor writes.
A separate survey shows that some of the largest firms of architects,
consulting engineers and chartered surveyors cut staff by up to 30 per cent
in the year to the end of June.
The two surveys for Building Magazine show that construction companies in
southern England have been worst hit by falling wages and job losses.
Businesses that are replacing staff are doing so at much reduced salaries
according to a study by Montrose Construction Services, a recruitment firm.
The second study charts a big fall in white-collar employment by
professional firms such as architects and consulting engineers.

FT  28 SEP 92 / Prowse failed to pay Pounds 200,000 to pension fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KEITH PROWSE, the ticket, travel and hospitality company which collapsed in
September last year, failed to pay pension contributions worth more than
Pounds 200,000 in the five months before it passed into receivership.
Problems in identifying the missing money and a series of legal wrangles
over the pension fund have meanwhile prevented more than 300 Keith Prowse
employees from transferring their benefits elsewhere or gaining information
about their value more than 12 months later.
GRE, the insurance company which manages the pension monies through one of
its investment policies, has now received payments of Pounds 211,327 from
the government's redundancy fund to fill the gap caused by the lack of
employee and employer contributions from Keith Prowse last year.
The money was received after months of work in collating company records and
waiting for actuarial assessments of the size of the deficit in the pension
fund.
The pension fund was controlled by Keith Prowse, not managed by an
independent trustee.
The directors of the company at the time of the collapse were Mr Paul Burns,
Mr Devinder Anand and Mr Ranjit Anand.
Mr Malcolm Shierson, one of the receivers at Grant Thornton, the accountancy
firm, said he had already submitted the 'D-form' required by the Department
of Trade and Industry on the conduct of directors in the circumstances
surrounding an insolvency. He would not say what it contained.
He said it was quite common for companies to fail to pay pension fund
contributions in the months before a collapse, because the fund was 'always
an easy creditor not to pay'.
Meanwhile, Grant Thornton has recently begun the process of applying to the
court for the appointment of an independent trustee to take responsibility
for the pension fund.
Some Keith Prowse employees have complained about the delay in appointing a
trustee and with the lack of information of the state of the pension funds
they have been given.
Grant Thornton says that it had no power to act as pension fund trustee
itself and had delayed its court application on advice from Allen &amp; Overy,
its legal advisers, while the full details of position of the pension fund
were clarified.
Ms Ann Hearn, head of Grant Thornton pensions consultancy service, said the
1990 Social Security Act - which requires pension funds to appoint
independent trustees - covered all schemes constituted by trust deed, but
that the Prowse scheme was constituted instead by a board resolution and so
was not covered.
She said the firm was under no obligation to act on behalf of the pensioners
in appointing a trustee and could not under UK insolvency legislation act as
a trustee itself.
She said Grant Thornton was handling a number of similar cases of insolvent
companies which had no trust deed and no independent pension fund trustees,
which she believed highlighted the need for a change in the law to close the
loophole.

FT  28 SEP 92 / Clique of senior directors studied
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CRITICISM OF company exec-utives who take on too many directorships has not
deterred a small but influential group of businessmen from continuing to
serve simultaneously in a large number of boardrooms.
A survey published today identifies a clutch of top industrialists who are
paid to sit on six or more boards. The Cadbury committee on corporate
governance suggested that three directorships should be the optimum level if
executives were to make a proper contribution to the companies that employ
them.
The survey, conducted by Director magazine and Arthur Andersen Corporate
Register, says that although the typical director of a public company is a
52-year-old chartered accountant, some keep a boardroom seat well into their
80s.
The oldest public company director recorded is Lord Shawcross, at 90 a
non-executive director of Caffyns, the motor distributor. At the other end
of the scale, Mr Jean-Jacques Murray, at 26, is an executive director of
Nu-Swift, the fire protection and equipment company.
Professor Sir Roland Smith, whose 11 directorships last year made him one of
the busiest directors, has since been toppled from the British Aerospace
board and has quit two other chairmanships.
According to the survey, Mr Peter Ryan, 61, holds the highest number of
directorships. An engineer, he serves on the board of eight companies,
including three non-executive chairmanships - at Protean, Stag Furniture and
Torday and Carlisle.
Behind Mr Ryan come six men each with seven directorships, including Mr
George Duncan of Associated British Ports, and Mr David Haggett of Atkins
Group.
Five more directors, including Sir Robert Clark of Lowndes Lambert, Mr
Michael Davies of Bredero Properties and Sir Judson Day of BAe, each hold
six boardroom posts.
The survey also shows that The Daily Telegraph has the largest number of
non-executive directors, with 17 independent board members.
The average salary range of non-executive board members is, according to the
survey, between Pounds 15,000 and Pounds 18,000, for which directors are
usually expected to attend between 12 and 15 board meetings a year. Those
with special responsibilities, such as a deputy chairmanship or audit
committee membership, can expect to earn up to Pounds 30,000.

FT  28 SEP 92 / Generator pressured on contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is putting pressure on state-owned Nuclear Electric to cancel
some of its contracts for selling power to regional distribution companies.
The aim is to create more room in the market for electricity generated from
coal, and so ease the conclusion of British Coal's latest round of
contracts, which are due to be negotiated while it is still in the public
sector.
Although British Coal has agreed terms for new contracts with the power
generators, they still depend on the ability of generators to sell the power
on to the regional distributors.
The government's attempts to make space in the electricity market have
angered Nuclear Electric, which operates the 12 nuclear power stations in
England and Wales, and the distributors. It is still not clear if the tactic
will succeed.
Neither the Department of Trade and Industry nor Nuclear Electric was
willing to comment. Norweb, one of the distribution companies involved, said
it could not discuss commercial negotiations.
The contracts date back to December last year when Nuclear Electric held an
auction at which the distribution companies bid for short-term and long-term
supplies. They were signed at an average price believed to be 2.8p per kWh,
but the new coal-based contracts are being offered at between 3.2p and 3.5p.
Regional companies are therefore in effect being asked to buy costlier
power. Although they are allowed to pass all changes in their electricity
costs through to their customers, higher prices would still damage their
image and their sales.
The government may also be counting on driving a wedge between those
distribution companies which have nuclear contracts on what now appear to be
very good terms, and those which do not and therefore resent being obliged
to buy costlier power. If the government persuaded Nuclear Electric to
cancel the contracts, it seems the distribution companies would be told it
was because of force majeure.
The contracts are based on hedging arrangements, rather than direct supply,
and would not affect the capacity of Nuclear Electric if they were
cancelled. The company, which as a generator has about 20 per cent of the
market, is keen to demonstrate commercial independence.

FT  28 SEP 92 / Cadbury attacks old-boy network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COMPANIES should adopt an objective approach and appoint to their
boards more women and others from a wider variety of backgrounds, Sir Adrian
Cadbury said yesterday.
Sir Adrian is chairman of Pro Ned, the organisation which promotes the role
of non-executive directors. The body yesterday called on company chairmen to
abandon the 'old-boy network'.
Sir Adrian said shareholders are also entitled to full information about all
aspects of directors' pay, and standards should be openly debated and
agreed.
Writing in Pro Ned's 10th annual review, Sir Adrian said companies should
'look beyond the limited circle which the chairman and their boards normally
have in mind'. He said they would benefit by drawing on a wider pool of
talent, including divisional directors of leading companies, academics and
those with extensive management experience in the public and voluntary
sectors.
Mr Colin St Johnston, Pro Ned managing director, said a recent survey by the
organisation had shown that 86 per cent of senior business people and
investors were dissatisfied with the appointment process of non-executive
directors, and less than a quarter of companies prepared a job profile for
these appointments.
Sir Adrian said that selection should involve the board as a whole through a
nomination committee. He said the process should begin by discussing the
skills and experience which would complement those of existing executives.
He said one of the main themes running through the report issued earlier
this year by a committee on the financial aspects of corporate governance,
which he chaired, was the need for able, independent-minded, non-executive
directors. He stressed that non-executives were an integral part of the
board rather than having a separate existence.
Sir Adrian favours changing 'non-executive director' to the US term 'outside
director' - 'an accurate description without overtones'.

FT  28 SEP 92 / DPP demands strict time limits in fraud trials
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS BARBARA MILLS QC, director of public prosecutions and former head of the
Serious Fraud Office, yesterday called for radical action to tackle the
problems of long fraud trials.
She told the Bar's annual conference in London that the country could no
longer afford to live with the present system. Public confidence had been
badly damaged by the Blue Arrow and Guinness cases and needed to be restored
urgently.
Mrs Mills said time limits should be imposed on trials, with none taking
more than two months. 'There are some trials which advance nowhere day after
day,' she said. 'What are we doing wasting the public's money in this way?
This has got to stop.'
Trial judges should have the power to decide how much time should be spent
on each issue in a trial, Mrs Mills continued. Barristers should be limited
to half an hour on each issue. A simple fraud offence should be introduced
and the prosecution should be obliged to produce short indictments.
Plea-bargaining should be encouraged, Mrs Mills said. At the moment the
justice system achieved very little for victims of fraud. In the US
plea-bargaining had been instrumental in recovering millions of dollars for
victims.
She also proposed that prosecution and defence should be compelled to
co-operate in identifying the issues for trial by early disclosure of their
cases during pre-trial hearings. The intention behind the special pre-trial
procedure for fraud cases introduced by the 1987 Criminal Justice Act was
excellent, but did not work because it had no teeth.
Defendants who did not co-operate should not be allowed to give evidence and
cross-examine at the trial on issues about which they had not disclosed
their positions during pre-trial hearings.
Mrs Mills was supported by Mr Justice Henry, the Guinness trial judge. He
called for enforced pre-trial disclosure, for time limits, for trials to
begin with a summary of the issues by the judge and for the jury to have a
list of witnesses and a timetable.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, told the conference
the predominance of European law over national law was proving a growing
constraint on action to promote competition in the UK.
Trying to inject competition into the supply of beer following the 1989
Monopolies and Mergers Commission report, for example, was hindered by the
possibility of a conflict between beer orders under the Fair Trading Act and
an EC exemption on exclusive purchasing agreements. The UK also appeared to
be constrained by the exemption in action it could take to modify the
distribution system for cars. He criticised 'restrictive distribution
arrangements where the effect is to ban certain kinds of retail activity.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ANGOLA'S former civil war adversaries formally abolished their armies
yesterday, ending a deadlock which threatened this week's first free
elections in the country, Reuter reports from Luanda.
The MPLA government and former rebel movement Unita said in a joint
statement that troops would fall under the control of the new unified
Angolan Armed Forces.
It added that until a new government was sworn in the new national force
would be supervised by a mixed commission overseeing a May 1991 peace
accord. The commission comprises officials of the two parties and
Portuguese, US and Russian observers.
Some 40,000 men of the original 150,000 combined forces have yet to be
demobilised and the two sides had been deadlocked over the naming of a
commander for the new 50,000-strong national army.
But after a meeting on Saturday to break the impasse, President Jose Eduardo
dos Santos and Mr Jonas Savimbi, Unita leader, said generals from both sides
would be at the helm.
Diplomats said the formal abolition of the enemy armies was largely symbolic
but would contribute to calm before the elections, which have been marred by
campaign clashes that have claimed at least 40 lives.
Unita also pledged in a statement released last night to respect the right
of the 4.8m Angolans to a free and fair vote.
Unita, backed by South Africa and then Washington, fought against the MPLA
which set up a one-party state with Soviet and Cuban aid when Angola gained
independence from Portugal in 1975. The war killed hundreds of thousands and
ruined the economy.
Diplomats expect a close vote in the race for the presidency and 223-seat
parliament. Some 800 international observers - half from the United Nations
 -are scattered across the country to monitor voting.
Four Russian crew and 11 Angolan passengers died yesterday when a UN
helicopter used by election observers crashed in northern Uige province, UN
officials said. Only one person aboard, an Angolan, survived the accident.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH Korea's President Roh Tae-woo began a four-day visit to China
yesterday, another step towards Korean unification and an end to the cold
war in Asia.
The former ideological enemies are expected to discuss expanding trade ties,
the situation where China remains one of reclusive North Korea's few
remaining allies, and north-east Asia in general.
The president will hold talks with China's President Yang Shangkun, Premier
Li Peng and Communist party general-secretary Jiang Zemin.
Mr Roh's visit comes a month after Seoul and Beijing formalised diplomatic
relations. The two sides have lacked formal ties since the Korean peninsula
was divided after the second world war and communist China was founded in
1949.
Trade between China and South Korea has grown strongly in recent years,
despite the absence of formal relations.
Bilateral trade reached Dollars 5.8bn (Pounds 3.4bn) last year compared with
Dollars 3.8bn in 1990. It has already topped Dollars 6bn in the first half
of this year.
South Korean investment in China, which has a population of about 3m ethnic
Koreans in the north-east, is estimated at about Dollars 500m. These are
funds committed before diplomatic ties were forged, and investment is now
tipped to grow rapidly.
South Korea wants Chinese co-operation in solving the nuclear issue in the
Korean peninsula. China says it co-operates with the north's nuclear
programme only for peaceful purposes. It officially claims to favour the
removal of all nuclear weapons from the peninsula and of US troops from the
south.
Although South Korean business is happy to see the end of mutual hostility
which has put a brake on trade and investment growth in the giant Chinese
market, some economists warn of a threat to Korean export markets in
textiles and electronics because of China's low labour costs.
Chinese exports have exceeded South Korean exports for the first time this
year. In the first eight months of 1992, China exported goods worth Dollars
50.62bn, compared with South Korea's Dollars 49.24bn.

FT  28 SEP 92 / Kenya expects loans to resume
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN, Africa Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MULTILATERAL lending to Kenya, suspended for nearly a year, is expected to
resume shortly, Prof George Saitoti, the country's vice-president and
finance minister, said in London at the weekend.
Mr Saitoti, speaking after talks in Washington last week with the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, said that both institutions
had broadly endorsed Kenya's performance under a revised reform programme.
Although not all issues had been resolved, there had been sufficient
progress for the early release of blocked World Bank resources - 'about half
of the Dollars 300m (Pounds 175m) that has been held up', according to Mr
Saitoti.
"It's the best news since last November', said the minister, referring to a
Paris conference of donors, chaired by the World Bank, which suspended
lending to Kenya and called for political reform and more effective
implementation of the country's structural adjustment programme.
Shortly afterwards President Daniel arap Moi lifted a ban on opposition
parties and a general election is due to take place by next March.
At the same time the government began measures to reduce the budget deficit,
which was running at 6.7 per cent of GDP on an annualised basis, according
to the IMF in December 1991. This was well over the ceiling set under the
three-year structural adjustment programme, due for renewal in May this
year.
Although some bilateral donors, including Britain, believe that it is time
to review the Paris decision, the US has been more cautious, apparently
waiting for Mr Moi set a firm election date.
In April Kenya and the Fund agreed on what was called a 'shadow programme'
covering the period to January 1993. If the government meets performance
targets - notably the budget deficit and parastatal reforms - the final
tranche of the extended structural adjustment facility (ESAF) will be
released.
A combination of tax measures and spending controls, including a freeze on
civil service recruitment and cancellation of projects wholly government
financed has brought the deficit down substantially, said Mr Saitoti.
According to a recent Fund report, the deficit for the year from June 1991
was about 3.5 per cent. It is estimated to have been less than 1.5 per cent
over the period December 1991 to June 1992, at an annualised rate.
In addition, a parastatal restructuring and privatisation programme has been
agreed to with the World Bank.

THE Burmese military government has revoked the two martial law orders
giving regional commanders the right to try suspected opponents before
military tribunals.
The decrees, in force since July 1989, have been revoked 'in view of the
improved general situation in the country and in consideration of the
interests of the people', said a report on Rangoon radio.
The junta introduced the decrees to stamp out pro-democracy protests led by
opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel Peace Prize winner.
Other martial law decrees, including the banning of gatherings of more than
five people, remain in effect.
The government began freeing political prisoners after General Than Shwe
replaced ailing hardliner General Saw Maung as its leader, but many senior
opposition figures remain in detention.
The decrees were revoked two days after an administrative shake-up in which
commanders from the southern, central and northern military regions were
appointed ministers.

They said the UAE would demand the return of the Greater and Lesser Tumbs,

FT  28 SEP 92 / Presidential punches miss the mark: Bush's badly needed
turning point is continuing to prove elusive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TURNING points in elections anywhere are sometimes seen as they happen, but
are mostly perceived with the benefit of hindsight. All that can be said
about this US presidential campaign, now down to the last five weeks and a
day, is that President George Bush needs a turning point, desperately.
It is not easy to see where it could come from. The economy cannot save him
now, as every weekly, monthly, and quarterly number demonstrates.
Hammering Governor Bill Clinton as the mad taxman of Arkansas, also inclined
to let murderers out on the street before their time, is an exercise in
statistical futility, rendered suspect by Mr Bush's own sanctioning of the
second largest tax increase in US history two years ago.
Bashing his Democratic opponent for dodging the draft 23 years ago is not
resonating and, even if the country cared, is neutralised by continuing
allegations about what then-Vice-President Bush knew about the Iran-Contra
scandals, about which it may care just as little. Trying to paint Mr Clinton
as an Oxford-educated social engineer intent on recreating what had failed
in Warsaw, Prague and Moscow does not stick in these post-cold war days.
Mr Bush may be seeking to shed the albatross of 'family values' hung around
his neck by the far right. But he could not last week stop television
starting a new season of the drama Murphy Brown, whose heroine, an unwed
mother, was the object of Vice-President Dan Quayle's summer discontent.
This meant that the popular shows endlessly rehashed a debate that does not
work to Mr Bush's advantage.
If that were not bad enough, on Friday there was 'Magic' Johnson, the
HIV-afflicted basketball star and national hero, resigning from the
president's Aids commission with a blast at administration neglect of the
problem. Last night 'Magic' aggravated the injury by endorsing Mr Clinton.
'We can't take four more years of the Bush administration that we have now,'
he said.
Even the places where Mr Bush now chooses to campaign are themselves an
indication of desperation. To be sure, Michigan and Ohio, his weekend
targets, are competitive and important states. But last week he was tied
down in Mississippi and Oklahoma and tomorrow he will be in Texas, all of
which would a few months ago have been automatically slotted on to his side
of the political ledger.
Nobody has the foggiest clue what Mr Ross Perot will finally do. But if the
Texan billionaire damages anybody except, certainly, himself, by re-entering
the race or by what he says, the suspicion is that it will be Mr Bush and in
the states which he absolutely must win, like Texas and Florida, to retain
the presidency.
Some serious pundits, reeling off polling statistics from the Florida Keys
to the Puget Sound, are beginning to talk of a Clinton landslide, comparable
to President Lyndon Johnson's over Senator Barry Goldwater in 1964.
Many point to the fact that no candidate since Truman in 1948, when polling
was less sophisticated and the opposition over-confident, has been so far
behind so late in the campaign as Mr Bush now is and gone on to win.
Even personal experience, which should be inherently suspect, is becoming
hard to ignore. Last Thursday, your correspondent and a German colleague
went to Philadelphia to speak to a meeting of European chambers of commerce,
not exactly a Democratic hotbed. On the train back to Washington that night,
we compared notes and found that we had talked to only one person who
proclaimed himself a staunch supporter of Bush.
So what does Mr Bush do to retain his crown? It is increasingly hard to
believe that he cannot now agree to debate with Mr Clinton, if necessary on
his opponent's terms, which happen to be those of the independent bipartisan
commission in charge of presidential debates. This means a single moderator,
rather than a panel of inquisitive journalists. If there were two debates,
both formats could be employed.
The Bush campaign could also get more negative and seriously dirty. There
has been a sharper edge to some 'factual' commercials, mostly about
Arkansas, now flooding the air waves. The president, or more likely a
surrogate, may go so far as to accuse Mr Clinton of physical cowardice or to
'reveal' something or somebody more plausible than Gennifer Flowers on the
sex front. It is getting a little late to produce it and it will be harder
still to make it stick.
An October 'surprise' cannot be ruled out, though what it might now be is
anybody's guess. There may be some mileage in a Middle East peace agreement
before November 3, but the Arab vote is small and the Jewish vote inclined
to return to its Democratic base. Iraq's President Saddam Hussein has
virtually disappeared from the public consciousness.
Or Mr Bush could simply plug away at what he is doing now, in the hope that
what he is saying about the contrast between his anti-government
philosophies and Mr Clinton's belief in state power will eventually take
hold. He can invoke the patriotic spirit, and Mr Clinton's alleged lack of
it, at every turn. He can continue to shower money on valuable
constituencies such as defence and agriculture.
He can also go on laying into the Democrats in Congress like there is no
tomorrow, though they have been artful enough to lay some clever traps for
him by inviting him to veto popular bills such as those on family leave and
cable television regulation.
Some of the president's recent speeches have been more specific and
coherent, like the economics address in Detroit two weeks ago, which is a
tribute to the influence of the Baker team. Mr Bush himself does not seem
unhappy in what he calls his 'campaign mode'. It will only require one poll
narrowing the deficit with Mr Clinton to make him positively delirious and
to claim he has his opponent on the run.
But at the moment it is not working. And it is getting very late in the day.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush's hopes of kicking his re-election campaign back into
gear at the weekend seem to have been frustrated on at least four counts,
negating the impact of his whistle-stop train swing through the important
mid-western states of Ohio and Michigan.
Fresh accusations of his knowledge of the Iran-Contra affair have been made
by a former White House aide, Mr Howard Teicher, who said he briefed the
then vice-president three times in the middle of 1986 about the 'operational
details' of the arms-for-hostages clandestine scheme.
Mr Bush has insisted he knew none of the details until December. Yesterday
he said he had been 'totally forthcoming' about his role and suggested the
issue was being used to counter controversy about the draft record of
Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee.
Second, attention has been diverted to Dallas and to today's national
television, where Mr Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire, may announce whether
he is entering the race. Signs from the Perot camp were hopelessly
conflicting over the weekend, but delegations from both the Bush and Clinton
campaigns are to address a meeting of his volunteers in Dallas.
Third, national and local public opinion polls suggest Governor Clinton is
consolidating his double digit lead. A Time-CNN survey at the weekend had
him 12 points ahead, double the margin of earlier this month. Positing a
Perot candidacy still left Mr Clinton 11 points up, while other polls also
show Mr Perot's stature much diminished.
An ABC survey found Mr Clinton ahead in 30 states, with 346 electoral
college votes, and Mr Bush up in only 10, with 110 votes, with the balance
undecided. A total of 270 votes is needed to win.
Finally, Mr Bush was possibly embarrassed by the resignation from his
cabinet of Mr Edward Derwinski, the secretary for veterans' affairs. Mr
Derwinski was unpopular with the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the
ex-servicemen's association which had endorsed Mr Bush early in 1988 and
which may have made the departure of the secretary contingent on backing
this year.
Mr Bush's weekend message was that Mr Clinton would worsen the problems of
the middle class by higher taxation. His campaign claims Mr Clinton's plan
to increase taxes on the top 2 per cent (a couple earning Dollars 200,000 a
year and more) would be insufficient to help raise his targeted Dollars
150bn in new revenues. He would need to hit the top 8 per cent, earning
Dollars 60,000 plus a year, according to the Republicans.
Mr Clinton, in New England, countered by saying that Mr Bush 'has no
credibility on taxes, everything he says is wrong.' He contrasted the fact
that he had a plan, compiled with numbers from the Congressional Budget
Office, whereas the president 'just raises taxes on everybody.'
There was no breakthrough on the stalemate over the presidential televised
debates. The next one on the schedule, next Sunday in San Diego, now looks
at severe risk. There is even speculation now that for the first time since
1972 there may be none at all.

   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICAL tensions have risen sharply in Caracas, Venezuela's capital,
following an assassination attempt last Wednesday attributed to a radical
group, the 'Bolivarian Liberation Forces'.
The group has threatened to kill prominent figures, particularly politicians
which they identify as 'corrupt'.
The government of President Carlos Andres Perez has stepped up general
security, and press reports say that a number of public figures have
received telephoned death threats.
The government also closed down two radio programmes, apparently for
broadcasting opinions of callers who supported violent action against
corrupt public figures.
Through telephone calls and a communique to the media, the new radical group
said it was responsible for the shooting on September 23 of Mr Antonio Rios,
one of Venezuela's most important labour officials and a leading member of
the ruling Democratic Action (AD) party.
Mr Rios, who is also a member of the Chamber of Deputies, was jailed for
nine days earlier this month on suspicion of influence peddling, but later
released on his own recognizance. He is still under intensive care at a
Caracas hospital.
The president of AD, Mr Humerto Celli, at the weekend called for a strong
government hand in repressing radical actions, and the Confederation of
Venezuelan Workers, which Mr Rio headed until recently, has threatened a
violent reaction against its enemies.
The confusion and alarm caused by the shooting come at a difficult time for
the government, which faced five months of protests following an
unsuccessful military uprising last February 4. University and secondary
school students are expected to resume anti-government protests after
classes fully resume this week.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL's government and opposition spent a fevered weekend mustering their
forces in Braslia for tomorrow's historic congressional vote on the
impeachment of President Fernando Collor.
Leaders of the pro-impeachment camp sent out telegrams to party members
warning that the only acceptable excuse for not attending tomorrow's session
of Congress would be an obituary.
Representatives were assigned to monitor the movements of waverers and to
check the airport for congressmen leaving the city.
Mr Ricardo Fiuza, leader of Mr Collor's 'shock-battalion' of key supporters,
and Mr Lafaiette Coutinho, head of the state-owned Banco do Brasil, met
congressmen, apparently offering government funds and positions in
ministries and state companies for those prepared to back the president.
The opposition took some hope from a Gallup poll published yesterday,
indicating that 70 per cent of the population want Mr Collor to quit. Only 8
per cent approve of his government. However, 50 per cent of respondents also
rejected as a potential leader Vice-President Itamar Franco, who will take
over if Mr Collor is ousted.
The first test will come in today's session to discuss the impeachment. The
opposition must assemble 252 members to have a quorum.
Whoever wins, Brazil will have a new cabinet. Mr Collor's ministers have
reaffirmed that they will all present their resignations tomorrow and few
are expected to be reappointed.
However, even if he loses the vote and is thus suspended from office to face
trial by the Senate, Mr Collor has indicated he will not resign. His
spokesman said at the weekend: 'The word is not in his dictionary.'

FT  28 SEP 92 / Crisis revives Brazil's royalty: Support grows for return of
the monarchy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE HUNDRED and three years after the abolition of Brazil's monarchy, a
growing band of citizens wants to see a return to the days of empire.
Brazilians vote in a referendum next April on, among other things, whether
to restore the monarchy. Helped by the public outrage over the corruption
scandal surrounding President Fernando Collor and the country's stubborn 25
per cent a month inflation rate, a restoration campaign is gathering
support.
Political analysts think Brazilians are likely to vote for change, but in
favour of a parliamentary system, with the president becoming a figurehead.
However, many have been surprised by the growing support for the monarchy.
In the most recent opinion poll, 23 per cent supported the restoration,
compared to just 3 per cent a year ago.
A member of the royal family lecturing the Rio Chamber of Commerce on the
economic advantages of a monarchy received rapturous applause this month
from Rio de Janeiro businessmen as he blamed the presidential system for
inflation and corruption.
Dom Bertrand Orleans e Braganca, a more charismatic speaker than most
Brazilian politicians, spoke of the prosperity and international respect
that marked the 48-year-reign of Dom Pedro II, the second and last emperor
of Brazil - a title established in 1822 by his father, the son of the King
of Portugal, who declared Brazil independent.
Dom Bertrand was speaking for his older brother, Dom Luis, pretender to the
Brazilian throne were it to be restored. There is, however, a flaw in the
monarchists' campaign. The House of Braganca is divided: two of the
emperor's descendants claim the throne.
Dom Luis's rival is his uncle, 88-year-old Dom Pedro Gastao Orleans e
Braganca, patriarch of the House of Braganca and brother-in-law to King Juan
Carlos of Spain. Although Dom Pedro is directly in line as Dom Pedro II's
great-grandson, Dom Luis argues that Dom Pedro's grandfather gave up his
right to accession to the grandfather of Dom Luis in order to marry an
eastern European countess who was not of royal blood.
Characterised by his floppy grey Spanish hat, Dom Pedro divides his time
between Seville and Petropolis, a mountain city above Rio which was the
imperial summer capital. He has four sons and 14 grandsons, and his
supporters say that Dom Luis, who is 52 and a bachelor, is not fit to be
emperor because he has not produced an heir and has political connections.
Dom Luis is a member of an ultra-conservative Catholic organisation, Family,
Tradition and Prosperity, which he says is apolitical.
Family feuding has not hindered the move for a return to the empire.
Pro-monarchy propaganda has only been allowed since a constitutional
revision in 1989, and proponents include congressmen, prominent businessmen,
academics and even military officers. They can be spotted by tell-tale
crown-shaped lapel pins or emblems on their ties.
Much of the campaign's success is due to the achievements of Dom Pedro II.
After taking power in 1840 at the age of 14, he oversaw a rapid expansion in
the Brazilian economy, reducing dependence on sugar cane and diversifying
into rubber, coffee, tobacco and cacao. A promoter of science and education,
he was such an accomplished negotiator that US President Abraham Lincoln
apparently said he was the only man he would trust to mediate between North
and South in the American civil war.
By contrast, presidentialism has a poor record in Brazil. A leaflet produced
by the Parliamentary Movement for Monarchy (MPM) describes the republic as
'synonymous with lack of credibility of institutions' and catalogues its
progress as 'seven different constitutions, 12 states of siege, 19 military
rebellions, four deposed presidents and two long periods of dictatorship'.
It points out that, in the last 67 years, only one civilian president
finished his mandate. Mr Collor seems unlikely to improve the balance.

FT  28 SEP 92 / The birth pangs of a capitalist eastern Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE ARE, it has been said, lies, damned lies and statistics. Whether this
aspersion on the world's statistical organisations is justified, it is
certainly justified of the statistics produced by the late communist regimes
of eastern and central Europe. To these regimes statistics were instruments
of control and propaganda. As with the economies they purported to measure,
the legacy of that unhappy past lingers into a difficult present.
Nevertheless, statistics are needed, warts and all, because eastern Europe
is a region with a significant economic potential that is undergoing an
unparalleled transformation. This week's International Economic Indicators
do, therefore, contain the first in a quarterly series on central and
eastern Europe, derived from the Eastern European Statistical Bulletin
published by Business Strategies.
What these statistics describe is the fate of the old socialist industrial
economies. These have collapsed. Industrial output in Poland, for example,
fell by 45 per cent between early 1989 and mid-1991, as is shown in the
chart. The declines measured for Hungary and the Czech and Slovak Federal
Republic, though smaller than for Poland, were still huge by any normal
standards.
Equally evident is the appearance of open inflation. Poland's price level
has risen no less than forty-fold since early 1989. Nevertheless, Poland has
halted its hyperinflation, while the CSFR and Hungary have done better
still. In the latter two countries the inflation has been more a one-off
adjustment revealing hitherto concealed inflationary pressures than an
ongoing inflationary process of the kind that beset Poland. Meanwhile,
Bulgaria and Romania are both still in the grip of soaring prices.
What such figures reveal is suggestive. What they conceal is vital. They
conceal, for example, the fact most goods were unavailable at their notional
prices before liberalisation, at least without queueing for hours.
Similarly, the rise in unemployment shown in the table hides the fact that
many workers, though supposedly 'employed', were actually idle.
The data are obtained through three main channels. The first is the national
state statistical offices, which were originally an integral part of the
centrally planned economies. These offices were closely associated with the
old bureaucracy and its network of controls. The second channel is the
central bank of each country, the source of much financial information. The
third is international financial institutions, such as the IMF, the World
Bank and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).
Each of these sources has its particular advantages and disadvantages. But
the most important difficulties lie with the official statistical offices on
which everyone must ultimately rely.
Three big problems arise.
First, national accounts were historically based on the concept of net
material product (NMP), which excludes most of the service sector of these
economies. The GDP estimates now provided do not yet conform to western
systems of national accounts, though efforts are being made in this
direction.
Second, many indicators are distorted by the use of artificial exchange
rates.
Third and perhaps most important, the burgeoning private sector is still not
included in national accounts.
Despite these difficulties, it has been decided to present figures based on
the official sources rather than make what would inevitably be arbitrary
adjustments. In time, the data will get better. But they will probably get
better as slowly as the economies, which - at least in the cases of Poland
and the CSFR - are now showing some modest signs of recovery.
Yet these recoveries are vulnerable, as much to political as economic
events. Just how vulnerable is revealed by the table's division of the CSFR
into what are soon expected to be the Czech Republic and the Slovak
Republic, this division being certain to damage the initial economic
prospects of both, but particularly of Slovakia.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS: CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
This table presents the major economic statistics currently published on
six east European countries. Current price figures for gross domestic
product (GDP) or net material product (NMP) are in billions of
USDollars. Trade figures are in millions of USDollars. All are converted
from national currency units (NCU) at the exchange rate shown (NCU per
Dollars , period avgs). Constant price GDP or NMP growth is given as an
annual percentage change. Yearly and quarterly values for consumer
prices, wages and industrial production are in index form with 1991=100.
Monthly values are annual percentage changes. The unemployment rate is
shown as a percentage of the civilian labour force.

FT  28 SEP 92 / Iliescu set for re-election: Romanian ex-communist ahead of
democratic opposition

MR ION ILIESCU, the incumbent president of Romania, looked set for
re-election last night as exit polls indicated a 48 per cent vote for the
former high-ranking communist.
Mr Emil Constantinescu, his main rival, who represents Democratic Convention
(DC), a loose alliance of 18 anti-communist opposition parties, polled 33
per cent, followed by for Mr Gheorghe Funar, an anti-Hungarian nationalist,
with 10 per cent.
If the exit polls are confirmed by the final results later this week, Mr
Iliescu will face a second-round run-off for the presidency with Mr
Constantinescu on October 11. This is according to Romanian electoral rules,
which require an absolute majority of the country's 16m eligible voters for
victory in the first round.
But the biggest uncertainty now hangs over the new parliament, where voters
were faced with a choice among 91 political parties.
The exit polls showed that the Democratic National Salvation Front (DNSF),
which supports Mr Iliescu, would emerge as the largest single parliamentary
party with 27.5 per cent of the poll. But the DC, together with its ally,
the ethnic Hungarian party, which won 7 per cent of the vote, would come out
as the strongest single political group in both houses of the bicameral
parliament with 30 per cent of the vote.
The exit poll, organised by Irsop, a Romanian company, in collaboration with
Infas of Germany, accurately forecast the results of Romania's first
post-communist general elections in May 1990. Mr Iliescu then won 85 per
cent of the popular vote in what was essentially a plebiscite celebrating
the end of the tyrannical rule of Nicolae Ceausescu, who was executed with
his wife Elena on Christmas Day 1989.
The absence of a clear majority in parliament indicates that a possibly long
period of political horse-trading will now be needed before a new government
emerges. It will replace the current caretaker government headed by Mr
Theodor Stolojan, the non-partisan prime minister who has guided Romania
through a difficult year of institutional and market reforms.
Mr Stolojan's market-oriented reforms have won the support of the IMF, which
plans to send a follow-up team to Bucharest once the new government is
formed. The IMF has already agreed a new loan deal but will need to be
assured that the new government is capable old fulfilling the terms.
The new government will also have to convince the European Community that
Romania remains on track for signature of an EC association agreement on
similar lines to those already agreed with Czechoslovakia, Hungary and
Poland.

MR Dragoslav Kojic dreads the next few days. As manager of the Kluz textile
factory in the south of Belgrade, he will have to tell his 3,000 employees
that he is switching off the machines, turning off the lights, and closing
the gates.
The United Nations sanctions imposed on Serbia in May have beaten him. 'What
can I do? I cannot export. I have no more stocks. I have run out of oil. I
have no money to pay my staff,' he says.
Kluz is just one of many textile factories in Serbia which have been forced
to close or put their workers on half pay because of the sanctions. Indeed,
the textile industry is probably the sector hit hardest by the UN's trade
embargo.
This is because over the past two decades, the textile industry in Serbia
had built up excellent contacts with German and Italian companies.
For instance designers, such as Boss, sent patterns, colours, cloth, thread
and buttons to Kluz. In return, thanks to cheap labour and a highly skilled
work force, Kluz was exporting practically 100 per cent of its finished
product to its European partners. 'We relied totally on the export market.
Now this is closed to us,' said Mr Kojic.
Before the sanctions, Kluz was recording a monthly turnover of DM4m (Pounds
1.5m). It had paid off its debts of over DM100m, and was looking forward to
expanding. The sanctions have put paid to that.
'I am in contact with my German partners almost every day. My greatest fear
is that they might start looking for new partners if the sanctions last for
a long time. It is going to be difficult to recoup these markets,' says Mr
Kojic.
Outside Belgrade, the Serbian capital, the picture is grim.
Mr Gradomir Cvetkovic, general secretary of the Textiles Association of
Serbia, says the Serbian government is to set up a social fund for the
sector's workers.
Mr Cvetkovic knows that as winter approaches, and inflation continues to
soar, these benefits will not go far.
'The sector, which covers textiles, shoes and leather goods, employs 200,000
people, or about a quarter of the total labour force,' he explains.
'It was also the most successful arm of the Serbian economy. Between 60 and
80 per cent of the industry's total turnover was earmarked for the export
market. The sector accounts for 20 per cent of Serbia's total trade.'
About 60 per cent of the textile industry's turnover was exported to the EC,
and the rest to the US, eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Last
year, textile exports from Serbia totalled Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds 643.2m) and
imports Dollars 600m.
Both Mr Kojic and Mr Cvetkovic are pinning their hopes on Prime Minister
Milan Panic. Mr Cvetkovic says that if the sanctions are not lifted in a
month, he will find it difficult to support Mr Panic. Mr Kojic is less
optimistic: 'The sanctions will not be lifted for some time. Everybody knows
that. We must rally around Panic. He is our only hope, especially for the
business community here in Serbia. They identify with Panic because he is a
businessman,' he said.
But in Centrotextil, the top-heavy foreign trade organisation which
represents about 500 Serbian and Montenegrin enterprises, the mood is
stubborn, if not defiant.
'I do not trust Panic to help us,' says Mr Branislav Backovic, director of
the shoes and sports department. 'The main problem we face is oil. There's a
little coming in from Greece. It is not enough. But I know the Serbs. We
will sit this one out,' he says.
But managers like Mr Kojic and Mr Cvetkovic are more realistic. 'We have to
change the mentality of the Serbs. For years they have been indoctrinated
with communist nonsense and incompetence. What this republic needs is
managers and entrepreneurs, not bureaucrats,' says Mr Kojic.
Yet that view offers little succour to his workers in Kluz. Already, Mr
Kojic has closed down three other factories in Serbia. 'I do not know what
to tell them. The workers still trust me. But they have to face the
prospects of no work, a cold winter, and little to hope for. The months
ahead are not going to be easy for any of us.'

DEEPENING economic turmoil in Yugoslavia could catapult the inflation rate
to 21,000 per cent this year.
'If inflation is not stopped now, by January there will be a dizzying price
rise and panic buying, Latin American-style,' Mr Nebojsa Savic, a Belgrade
University economics professor, told Politika, the main Serbian daily.
Belgrade economists say the economic situation will deteriorate sharply. The
economy's downward spiral, precipitated by 16 months of war and the severing
of economic ties with the other former Yugoslav republics, was hastened by
United Nations sanctions.
Economics professor Ljubomir Madjar yesterday said Yugoslavia - Serbia and
Montenegro - 'has entered the realm of hyperinflation'. He believed huge
state spending coupled with reduced revenues would push inflation even
higher.
The truncated Yugoslavia is supporting a massive army and 485,000 refugees
from Bosnia and Croatia. Industrial production has fallen by 30 per cent.
Since sanctions, including an oil embargo, were imposed on May 31, at least
300,000 workers have been sent on compulsory holidays. Belgrade economists
estimate that only a quarter of the 2.2m workforce will be employed by the
end of the year.
Amid deepening economic deprivation, Serbia's ruling Socialists appear
determined to cling to power. The Serbian parliament last week voted to hold
a referendum aimed at cancelling state-wide elections set for November.
President Slobodan Milosevic is at loggerheads with Prime Minister Milan
Panic, who has pledged to stop the war in Bosnia and democratise Serbia. Mr
Milosevic is seen by the international community as the chief instigator of
the war and mounting international outrage at Serbian 'ethnic cleansing' in
Bosnia appears to have hardened his resolve to remain in power.
Against this background of economic collapse and battles in neighbouring
Bosnia, international mediators Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen visit Belgrade
today to discuss 'ethnic cleansing' by Serb forces of Moslems in Bosnia and
evidence of stepped-up air attacks.
After visiting Banja Luka, a Serb stronghold in northern Bosnia, on Friday
Lord Owen, the European Community envoy, said he and Mr Vance heard accounts
of 'systematic shelling' of 3,000 to 4,000 Moslem refugees who were driven
from Banja Luka south-east to Travnik.
Fighting was reported throughout Bosnia yesterday. SRNA, the Bosnian Serb
news agency, said 50 Serbs were killed in three days of fighting against
Moslem forces in Milici, north-east of Sarajevo. It also said Serb forces
seized control of Tjentiste, south-east of Sarajevo.
Reuter adds from Islamabad: Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic arrived in
Pakistan yesterday and called on the Moslem world to help his people.
Islamabad last month gave Bosnia a Dollars 20m (Pounds 11.6m) credit line, a
special grant of Dollars 10m and humanitarian assistance worth Dollars
400,000.

FRANCE'S Socialists built on past successes to gain five seats in elections
to the Senate (upper house) yesterday, Reuter reports from Paris.
Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy said the election of two cabinet ministers
in the poll for 103 seats - about a third of the house - made a government
reshuffle likely.
The Socialists won six new seats and lost one to hold, in total, 71 seats
and become the second largest group in the house behind the RPR Gaullist
party which lost one to retain 90.
But their gains did not challenge the house's overwhelming conservative
majority.
Mr Pierre Mauroy, former Socialist premier, Mr Michel Charasse, budget
minister, and Mr Jean-Marie Rausch, junior trade minister, were among the
newly-elected senators. The ministers have a month to choose between the
cabinet and their nine-year term in the upper house.
Mr Charasse, who is due to present the draft budget to the cabinet this
week, said he would choose his Senate seat.
French farm unions said yesterday they would demonstrate on October 14
against the government's failure to negotiate changes in EC farm policies.

<TEXT>
VIEWERS switching on to France's fifth television channel at 7pm this
evening will see Les Tambours d'Hiver (The Drummers of Winter), a
documentary made two years ago on the musical rituals of the Inupiaq
indians, an obscure tribe in Alaska.
Les Tambours d'Hiver is not simply another documentary intended to add a
sober touch to the soap operas and games shows that dominate French TV; it
is also the first programme on Arte in its role as France's newest national
television station.
Arte is an arts channel run by a Franco-German joint venture, which provides
one service in French and another in German but saves money by pooling
programme purchasing.
It will, or so the French government hopes, become a role model for a new
breed of European cultural channels.
For the past few months Arte's French service has been broadcast on the
fledgling cable television network. Today it moves to a new, permanent slot
on the fifth national channel, taking the place of La Cinq, the mainstream
TV station which went bankrupt earlier this year.
La Cinq enjoyed a brief burst of intellectual credibility for its current
affairs coverage during the Gulf war, but was best known in France for its
soft - and sometimes not so soft - pornographic programming. Arte, by
contrast, is unashamedly highbrow.
This evening's schedule is typical. Les Tambours d'Hiver is followed by a
documentary on Egyptology and Wings of Desire, an art movie by the German
director Wim Wenders.
A vintage episode of Monty Python's Flying Circus, the 1970s cult British
comedy, is thrown in for light relief.
Arte is coming on air at a difficult time. There is already fierce
competition for viewers among France's existing national channels and from
the dozens of stations on the struggling cable system. The competition
proved too much for La Cinq.
Meanwhile, Antenne 2 and FR3, the two state-controlled channels, are merging
part of their operations in an attempt to resolve financial problems.
So far Arte's management seems unabashed. Mr Pierre Andre Boutang, head of
the French service, claims his channel has one big advantage over its
competitors in that 'at last viewers will have the chance to see something
intelligent at prime time'.

FT  28 SEP 92 / The European Market: Brussels puts squeeze on the Dutch
cartels - Changes in a business culture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORD 'cartel' usually conjures up images of furtive meetings in smoky
back rooms, where deals and agreements are struck far from the authorities'
prying eyes.
In the Netherlands, however, the focal point of cartel-fixers is not some
secret rendezvous but the conference rooms, offices and corridors of the
Ministry of Economic Affairs in The Hague. It is here that companies,
business federations, agricultural product boards and retail associations
have traditionally sent details of their cartels for inclusion in a register
maintained by the ministry.
At last count the Netherlands had officially sanctioned more than 400
cartels. The exact details of the Dutch register are kept secret, but one
ministry official says the sectors involved form a broad cross-section of
the Dutch business community.
The cartels run the gamut from well-known agreements in the asphalt and
construction industries to accords governing the production and sale of the
lowly pearl onion. The agreements cover price levels, supply restrictions
and product ranges.
Another favourite is the arrangement adopted by many retailers around the
country: the by-laws of many shopping centres stipulate, for example, that
the tenants may include only one shoe shop - to protect the livelihood of
the sole purveyor of shoes in the complex.
However, the days of the Dutch cartel are clearly numbered.
Under pressure from the increasingly active competition policy being pursued
by the European Community, the Netherlands is preparing to start banning
three types of cartel practices from 1993 - horizontal price-fixing, market
share-out arrangements, and tender arrangements which allow prior
consultation among businesses vying for the same order.
'Traditional, defensive cartels will run into a red light,' according to Ms
Yvonne van Rooy, state secretary for economic affairs. 'But the green light
will continue to be given to positive and offensive cartels.' Beneficial
cartels, she said last week in a speech to a Rotterdam conference on the
future of cartel policy, were ones designed to offer early, temporary
protection to companies seeking to launch new technologies.
Surprisingly, perhaps, for a country which is a keen exponent of European
integration and harmonisation, Dutch cartel practice has always been
fundamentally at odds with that of the EC and most of its EC partners.
The Netherlands, with its traditional emphasis on achieving consensus and
avoiding conflict, has fostered a business culture in which companies, trade
unions, government bodies and industry associations engage in constant and
close consultations. The country has no anti-trust authority, preferring
instead to emphasise self-regulation whenever possible.
Under a Dutch law of 1957 - issued at the height of post-war reconstruction,
when co-operation among business was seen as the fastest route to economic
strength - cartels are permitted unless they are deemed to be
counter-productive. Under the EC Treaty of Rome of 1958 cartels are banned
in principle, although rare exceptions may be permitted.
This dichotomy surfaced early this year when the EC fined 7,000 Dutch
builders for operating a 12-year-old cartel at the tender stage of building
contracts. The cartel was conducted openly and appeared on the government's
register of officially-condoned agreements, but the EC ordered it to be
ended. An appeal by the Dutch construction industry is working its way
through the European courts.
The cartel enabled builders to compare bids and then decide among themselves
which company should be the 'designated bidder' for a particular building
project. The chosen candidate was required to ensure that the ultimate price
of the building project included sufficient funds to reimburse the
unsuccessful builders for the cost of drawing up their bids and producing
supporting documentation, such as blueprints.
Builders, retailers and industrialists in the Netherlands bristle at the
suggestion that the country is a cartel paradise. They believe cartels are
just as prevalent in other countries but take place outside government
control, making them more damaging.
The construction industry, for example, regards its now-outlawed cartel as a
'transaction structure' which provided for fair and efficient bidding
without inflating building prices.
Mr Frans van Waarden, a Dutch sociologist at the University of Konstanz in
southern Germany and a defender of cartels, believes 'cartels are nothing
other than a form of decentralised regulation compared with the centralised
regulation provided by governments'.
Be that as it may, the Dutch government has served notice it will start
prohibiting entire categories of cartels next year, to bring the Netherlands
into line with the EC.
By the mid-1990s the ministry's closely guarded cartel register is expected
to have shrunk to just several dozen entries, from well over 500 at its
peak.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian government faces a concerted push over the next two weeks to
replace its policies, and probably most of its ministers.
Mr Arkady Volsky, head of the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs and
one of the most powerful figures in the centrist Civic Union bloc, said at
the weekend that the government's programme was 'advantageous only to the
International Monetary Fund'.
He said the Civic Union would in the next 10 days present a programme
entitled Liberal Reforms and Strong Power, proposing administrative control
of the market and the creation of a 'Euro-Asiatic' union of six or seven of
the members of the Commonwealth of Independent States.
The centrists' tactics, to propose a return both to a modified command
economy and a scaled-down union, is a direct challenge to the government of
Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister, which came to power to institute
rapid market reform in a Russia shorn of former union entanglements.
The publication of this new programme - backed by many of the parliamentary
parties, business groups and trade unions, and co-led by General Alexander
Rutskoi, the vice-president - will coincide with the meeting of the CIS
heads of state in Bishkek, capital of Kyrgyzia, postponed from last Friday
to October 9.
Meanwhile, Mr Andrei Nechayev, the economics minister, warned at the weekend
that oil production - the export lifeblood of Russia - would drop next year
to about 340m tonnes from an estimated 397m this year, and possibly as low
as 320m tonnes. Exports would fall from about 60m tonnes this year to about
45m tonnes, he said.
Reuter adds from Moscow: The central Asian state of Turkmenistan will renew
gas supplies to Ukraine after the two former Soviet republics resolved a
six-month dispute over pricing, Interfax news agency said yesterday.
Turkmenistan will supply Ukraine with 8bn cubic metres of gas in the last
quarter of 1992 and 28.4bn next year. Ukraine will unblock supplies of food
and other products suspended in February.

FT  28 SEP 92 / Spanish cabinet agrees tough budget to curb public spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN'S Socialist administration is preparing to mount its most determined
effort in 10 years in government to curb public spending after approving a
draconian 1993 budget at the weekend.
Caught in a fierce currency market attack on the peseta and waning popular
support at home, and facing an election in, at most, 12 months, the cabinet
has been forced to agree to demands by Mr Carlos Solchaga, the finance
minister, that central government spending will increase only 3.7 per cent
next year, a fall in real terms.
Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez has never before sanctioned such tough
spending plans and has probably been persuaded to do so by the need to
demonstrate to foreign exchange markets that Spain is serious about tackling
its runaway deficits - so far this year the government has spent just short
of double its 1992 budget - and to keep credible Spain's insistence that it
will be among the first countries to join a European Monetary Union.
The draft budget slashes defence spending by 9 per cent and forecasts growth
next year of about 1 per cent. Civil service pay is to increase by less than
the forecast inflation rate of 4.7 per cent.
Inflation this year, Mr Solchaga said in announcing the measures, would end
at about 6.4 per cent.
The minister's budget will test the unity of the Socialist party, whose
polls show it is losing its parliamentary majority. Election campaigning has
already begun, with both the Socialists and the leading regional parties in
the Basque country and Catalonia - the government's most likely partners in
any coalition - trying to distance themselves from one another.
A Catalan demand in particular - that Madrid hand over to the regional
government nearly 20 per cent of tax revenues collected in the state - is
threatening to poison the political atmosphere further.
In the meantime, the government is trying desperately to head off any
possibility that France and Germany try to form a group of core EC countries
to proceed with political and economic union without Spain.
Mr Solchaga will ask fellow EC finance ministers meeting in Brussels today
to stick together and to agree on ways to end turbulence in the currency
markets.
Spain has already devalued the peseta by 5 per cent in the past two weeks
and is thought to be willing to participate in a further realignment of
Exchange Rate Mechanism parities in order to avoid having to leave the ERM.
Capital controls imposed by the Bank of Spain last week, to try to freeze
speculation in the peseta, failed to lift the currency far off its ERM
floor.
An agreement in Brussels this week, said Mr Solchaga at the weekend, 'may or
may not imply a realignment but we cannot go on like this and time is
running out'.

FRESH storms moved across southern France yesterday, leaving three people
dead and several missing, AP reports from Paris.
But the rains eased before reaching regions battered last week by the
deadliest floods on record in France.
Authorities said the worst damage from the new storms occurred in the
departments of Aude and Pyrenees-Orientales, close to the eastern part of
the French-Spanish border.
Rivers swollen by torrential rains overflowed their banks. In the Aude
village of Rennes-les-Bains the floodwaters smashed a home, killing a
65-year-old women and sweeping away two other people.
Floodwaters a metre deep were reported in parts of the city of Narbonne.
The national weather service had warned that severe storms could hit much of
south-east France yesterday, but in most areas rain was too light to unleash
any new flooding.
Flash floods on Tuesday in the south-central departments of Vaucluse, Drome
and Ardeche killed 38 people.
Vaucluse authorities yesterday lowered their estimate of missing people from
40 to 15, saying the others had been accounted for.
Officials said 150 homes in Vaucluse had been destroyed or seriously
damaged, and 12 bridges washed away.
An overall valuation of the damage has not been released, but insurance
companies have already arranged for payments totalling about FFr980m (Pounds
112.38m).

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH and Spanish objections are still preventing adoption of a provisional
accord on value-added tax and excise duties across the EC. But British and
European officials in the Commission are optimistic a deal will be struck in
the next few weeks.
Britain, which holds the EC presidency, had hoped the two countries would
drop their reservations to the package by today's meeting of EC finance
ministers.
To avoid rekindling the five-year political debate, the UK is aiming for
technical agreement among national officials on outstanding points. The
whole package of eight directives could then be rubber-stamped at any
meeting of ministers.
A British diplomat said after last week's meeting of officials: 'We're
making progress, and the signs are quite good.'
Finance ministers nearly reached unanimity on the package in July. It would
impose, for example, a minimum binding standard VAT rate across the
Community and lay out a framework for duties on tobacco, alcohol and mineral
oils.
EC officials say formal adoption is essential to the single market. But they
do not believe delays at this stage will hold up the opening of barriers, as
Community VAT rates are in line with requirements of the package and a
number of member states are preparing to introduce legislation based on the
main points of the July agreement.
The principal stumbling blocks are still French calls for a nominal 'control
levy' on wine and Madrid's wish to bring the duty on British sherry into
line with that imposed on the Spanish product. The Netherlands is also said
to have voiced concern about VAT on the repair of shoes and clothes, but the
Commission and presidency are not going to add new problems to the existing
French and Spanish reservations.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN trade unions have protested to the European Commission at the
withdrawal of a grant to help unions organise meetings on European works
councils.
Unions have received Ecu14m (Pounds 11m) in the current year for organising
such meetings, and had assumed that the payment would be repeated annually
for several years. But the budget for 1993 drawn up by the Commission
contains no provision for this.
Union leaders such as Mr Franz Steinkuhler, leader of the German IG Metall
union, fear this might represent a more general retreat from the social
dimension of European integration.
The works councils, designed for informing and consulting workers on
corporate strategy, have been established in about 20 EC-based
multinationals and unions are pushing hard to set them up in many more.
In 1992 unions received about Ecu50m from EC institutions or through the
financing of union-friendly institutions.

FT  28 SEP 92 / Airlines aim at accounting benchmark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD AIRLINES will agree this week to set up a task force to develop
international accounting guidelines to improve and harmonise financial
reporting in the airline industry.
The move follows a joint survey by the International Air Transport
Association, the Geneva-based organisation grouping more than 200 airlines,
and KPMG, the world's biggest accountancy firm. It revealed wide disparities
in the accounting policies and financial disclosures of airlines.
The Iata task force will be announced in Paris tomorrow. It will examine the
possibility of establishing a benchmark of international accounting
standards to make it easier to compare and measure the financial performance
of different airlines.
KPMG says this approach will avoid cutting across national accounting
policies that are enforced in various countries.
Mr Frank Harding, head of KPMG's transport industry group, said the survey,
which considered the accounting practices of 25 of the world's leading
airlines, highlighted the need for a harmonised approach.
'As the airline industry becomes increasingly global with more strategic
alliances and more moves towards privatisation, it is imperative to improve
financial reporting,' he said.
One obstacle to an airline contemplating cross-border capital or investment
transactions is the wide divergence in accounting policies and disclosure
requirements in various countries, the report argues.
Airlines are currently scrambling to forge partnerships and acquire equity
stakes in other carriers to strengthen their competitive position in a
global market.
Among the growing number of airline partnership deals, British Airways
acquired last week a 49.9 per cent stake in the French regional airline TAT
for Pounds 17.25m. It has also agreed to invest Dollars 750m (Pounds 438.5m)
for a 44 per cent stake in USAir, the sixth largest US carrier.
The substance of airline financial statements often varies significantly
from country to country and even between airlines operating within the same
country, the report notes.
There is, however, a general trend towards international harmonisation of
accounting standards and several professional and regulatory bodies have
included the issue on their current agendas.
The financial community is also placing greater emphasis on airline
financial statements in lending policies as a result of the financial
problems sweeping airlines caused by the sharp recession in the industry.
'Improvements in financial reporting will assist airlines in persuading
financiers and investors to provide debt and equity finance at a time when
this is becoming increasingly difficult,' says Mr Harding of KPMG.
The survey found widely differing approaches in such important areas as the
way airline fleets are financed and accounted for; how aircraft are
depreciated and to what residual value; accounting for foreign exchange
gains and losses; and levels of disclosure in income statements for
depreciation and finance costs.

THE determination of the Amato government to introduce a tough austerity
budget for 1993 will be tested this week as trade union protest gathers
momentum and the political parties seek to impose amendments.
Mr Giuliano Amato, the Socialist prime minister, repeated over the weekend,
in even stronger language than before, that he would resign if the budget
was watered down.
But the trade union leadership, encouraged by last week's support for
rolling regional four-hour general strikes to protest at proposed welfare
cuts, looks set to call a nationwide stoppage early next month. This week
there will be more regional general strikes, with the promise of other
stoppages in specific sectors.
At the same time both the Christian Democrat and Socialist party bosses,
central to the stability of the fragile four-party coalition government, are
pledged to submit changes to soften the impact of the budget on their
electorate.
The 1993 outline budget proposes to raise L93,000bn (Pounds 43.7bn) in new
revenues and spending cuts. The protests focus on proposals to make the
first real cuts in the system of public welfare established after the war.
The government is proposing to cap pensions payments as part of a wider
reform to extend the pensionable age to 65 and limit the level of state
funding. A big shake-up of the health service is also on the books.
Mr Amato says the present welfare state - generous and inefficient - risks
bankrupting the economy.
In an interview in the daily La Repubblica yesterday, Prof Amato warned
bluntly: 'We are in an extremely difficult situation. The government has put
before parliament measures it deems both adequate and indispensable. If
parliament says they are not indispensable and cuts them back, it is clear
at this point that neither the government nor parliament is capable of
getting out of this storm. Thus it is useless to stay on because there is
nothing left to do.'
Last week Mr Amato said he intended to put the 1993 budget to a vote of
confidence in parliament to speed the debate and concentrate politicians'
minds on the disastrous state of Italy's public finances. Both the
government and the Bank of Italy recognise approval of the budget is
necessary before the lira can return to the European Monetary System, from
which it withdrew, along with sterling, 11 days ago.

FT  28 SEP 92 / Italy pressed to probe alleged beef fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A ROW is developing within the EC over the apparent failure of Italy to
pursue vigorously evidence of a Common Agricultural Policy fraud.
British customs investigators are understood to have told EC officials of
their growing frustration with the apparent refusal of their Italian
counterparts to move against a company engaged in a suspected fraud
involving EC subsidised beef intended for the CIS.
The suspicions of EC investigators were aroused earlier this year when
traders reported difficulty in selling beef in European markets because of
competition from cut-price products.
In May, UK customs officers seized a consignment of 180 tonnes of Irish
beef. The beef, found in a warehouse in the port of Runcorn near Liverpool,
was about to be sold within the UK at just below prevalent market prices,
although it had been exported to Italy for processing and canning for
delivery to the CIS at a heavily subsidised EC rate.
In recent weeks, UK customs has investigated a number of UK companies in
connection with the sale of the beef, but have ruled out criminal action
against any of them. Instead they have passed on documentation and other
evidence to EC inspectors and Italian officials which in their view should
have led to early action against at least one Italian company.
'We believe there is enough to act on, and the Commission is of the same
view,' one customs official said. Italian officials are believed to have
visited the company concerned but have so far refused to launch a formal
investigation or make any arrests.
According to EC and customs officials, the suspected fraud is typical of a
growing problem as farmers and exporters cheat the taxpayer under the Common
Agricultural Policy.
An EC report last month estimated that nearly 600 new cases, involving more
than Pounds 100m, were uncovered by the 12 EC states last year. The problem
is identified in a report went to British MPs and tabled for a House of
Commons debate next month.
According to the Commission, the UK reported the largest number of cases -
131, worth over Pounds 8m, of which Pounds 2.5m has been recovered. The
largest amount appeared to be in Italy, where Pounds 70m was discovered but
only Pounds 4m recovered.
Ten days ago, Italy and France called for increased co-operation between EC
members to fight organised crime in Europe under the banner of the
Maastricht Treaty.
According to UK officials however, EC states disagree over how to translate
this commitment into the arrest and conviction of suspected criminals,
partly because of inconsistent judicial procedures.

FT  28 SEP 92 / Close race in NEC ballot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OUTCOME of elections to Labour's ruling national executive committee
will be announced today with Mr Bryan Gould reportedly locked in a close
three-horse race with Mr Tony Benn, the veteran leftwinger, and Mr Tony
Blair, the shadow home secretary.
Unconfirmed reports in Blackpool suggested last night that Mr Neil Kinnock,
the former leader, and Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, are set to
cruise home in the annual ballot.
But with only one vacancy - left by the outgoing Mr Gerald Kaufman - that
would mean at least one other occupant of the seven-member constituency
section must fall out.
Speculation on the eve of the conference was that Mr Benn, second to Mr
Kaufman, who came last in 1991, is the most vulnerable. But some also
believe that a strong challenge from Mr Blair, a newcomer, means that Mr
Gould, who came fifth last year, could also lose his seat.
Although the outcome of the voting will have little influence on the overall
political composition of the national executive - it is firmly supportive of
the leadership - it will be closely perused as an indicator of the mood in
the constituency parties.
If Mr Gould, who suffered a humiliating defeat in the race for the
leadership, is knocked off by Mr Blair, it will consolidate the position of
the pro-Maastricht loyalists close to Mr Smith's leadership.
A defeat for Mr Benn would also be regarded as ending an era for the left
wing. In recent years he and Mr Dennis Skinner, the leftwing MP for
Bolsover, have formed a two-man 'rejectionist' front, voting or tabling
motions opposed to the leadership's policies.
Mr Gould's resignation from the shadow cabinet yesterday should have little
bearing on the race as constituency delegates are, in theory, bound by
ballots completed some time ago.
Nonetheless, with European issues now provoking a schism in the party,
analysts will be carefully assessing the consequences of the results on
policy positions to be taken by the national executive in coming months.
The election last year of Mr Kaufman, a well-known rightwinger, was widely
seen as a consequence of the introduction of a one-member-one-vote balloting
system and the influence of television, both of which are thought to favour
those with the most media exposure.

FT  28 SEP 92 / Party 'lost touch' in the south-east
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DETAILED analysis of Labour's dismal general election performance in the
south-east offered a warning last night that the opposition cannot rely on
the government's problems to bring a decisive change in its electoral
fortunes, Philip Stephens writes.
The study, published by the Fabian Society, indicates that Mr John Smith
must oversee a radical shift in his party's policies and values if it is to
achieve the breakthrough in the south-east needed to defeat the
Conservatives.
Written by Mr Giles Radice, Labour MP for Durham North, and based on
research in five marginal constituencies in the south-east, it argues that
the election result demonstrated that Labour had lost touch with the
'aspirant' working class whose support is vital to ensure election
victories.
It confirms other post-election research showing that Labour's tax and
spending policies proved a fatal weakness in the 177 southern England seats
outside London. It won only 10 of those seats.
Labour was seen as the party of uniformity, which would stifle the ambitions
of home and share owners, while the Conservatives successfully cultivated
their image as that of 'opportunity' and 'choice'.
As a move towards change, Mr Radice suggests abandonment of the Clause 4
commitment to public ownership.

FT  28 SEP 92 / Supermarkets vie to fill up tanks as well as trolleys: An
increase in shopping around for petrol is worrying oil companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES and NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPETITION between Britain's supermarket chains has found a new
battleground. No longer content just to fill shopping trolleys, they are
vying increasingly to fill petrol tanks as well.
Indeed, their campaign has been so successful that it has started to nettle
the oil companies, which now sense a growing threat to their dominance of
petrol sales.
'Motorists, whether sensitive or insensitive to petrol prices, are shopping
around as never before,' says Mr Bruce Petter, director of the Petrol
Retailers' Association, which represents about half the UK's 18,000 service
stations.
Supermarket petrol stations have been springing up as rapidly as the
out-of-town superstores to which most are attached. According to Petroleum
Review, the industry journal, there were more than 660 stations attached to
supermarkets at the start of this year, almost twice the number two years
earlier.
The stations at supermarket sites sell petrol at between 5p and 15p per
gallon cheaper than the branded oil company outlets - although in areas
where several supermarkets compete the difference can be more than 20p. So
far, the supermarkets have captured between 12 per cent and 15 per cent of a
sluggish market. They are hungry for more.
Tesco, with 151 petrol forecourts, plans to add a further 20 in the next 12
months, as does Safeway, which operates 37 sites. J. Sainsbury, with 100
forecourts, plans 30 more next year and believes it could eventually raise
the total to 200.
Mr Michael Rosen, Sainsbury's director of non-food sales, believes
supermarkets could together account for a quarter of all petrol sales in
five years. That would exceed the 20 per cent now held by Esso, the market
leader.
Such forecasts are questioned by some oil industry experts, who say
difficulties with planning permission and the distance of many supermarket
sites from main roads may slow their expansion. But no one disputes that the
supermarkets have become an important - and probably permanent - force in
petrol retailing.
Publicly, the oil companies affect nonchalance towards this trend - partly
because they have encouraged it. Burdened with excess UK production and
refining capacity, most have been glad to find new customers. Privately,
however, some are starting to sound worried, accusing the food retailers of
'cherry-picking' business from a few large sites.
'The supermarkets don't view petrol as an essential service. We do,' says
one oil company. 'We have 2,500 sites. Some are in remote places which make
little money and where distribution costs are high.'
Food retailers say they make a profit on petrol by buying bulk supplies at a
discount and sharing retailing costs with their supermarket operations. But
some people in the oil industry complain they have an unfair advantage
because they do not have to carry expensive stocks.
One large oil company is pressing the Department of Trade and Industry to
even the balance by compelling supermarkets to meet an EC requirement that
suppliers selling more than 50,000 tonnes of petrol a year should carry 66
days of stocks.
But the retailers appear unperturbed. Tesco is understood to be arranging
for its suppliers to hold stocks for it. Sainsbury, which claims already to
sell more than 50,000 tonnes of petrol a year, says the government has
exempted it from stockholding.
Although supermarkets began selling petrol more than a decade ago, their
emergence as a serious competitive threat dates back to the surge in
international spot market prices which followed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in
August
By holding down retail prices, the supermarkets increased their share of
sales in the following six months from 6.8 per cent to 11 per cent. Once the
short-lived oil crisis ended, they held on to their market by cutting prices
faster than their established competitors.
The recession has also helped. Traditionally, many of their customers have
been private car owners who pay for their own petrol. However,
cost-conscious employers providing company cars are starting to set petrol
allowances at the prices charged by supermarkets.
Whether the supermarkets are succeeding in their original purpose of
attracting more food shoppers is questionable. Safeway reckons 40 per cent
of customers at its petrol stations do not shop at its adjoining stores.
However, that is little consolation to their rivals in the oil industry.
The latter are counting on features such as improved facilities, forecourt
shops and 24-hour service to win back business. But many supermarkets now
offer similar attractions: Safeway has installed car washes at half its
sites and has begun opening some 24 hours a day.
Whether open hostilities will erupt is a topic of keen debate among petrol
retailers. But perhaps it need not come to that. Oil companies in Belgium
and France have recently eliminated some of their supermarket competitors by
buying their petrol-retailing businesses, re-equipping their forecourts and
restoring prices to more 'normal' levels.
'The oil companies can match the supermarkets price-for-price if need be,'
says Mr Petter. 'If it came to slugging it out, I guess they would win.'

<TEXT>
THE RESIGNATION of Mr Bryan Gould has set in motion little-used party
machinery for a by-election to the shadow cabinet.
When parliament returns next month, Labour MPs will be entitled to put their
names forward for the position in a contest that will be substantially
different from the usual election procedure.
Unlike normal elections in which all 18 shadow cabinet seats are disputed,
the by-election will be closely analysed as an indicator of the
parliamentary Labour party's mood on European Community issues.
Mr Ron Davies, the MP for Caerphilly who narrowly missed election this
summer, confirmed last night that he would run.
But with regional 'slates' and other trade-offs unlikely to play a
substantial role in the election, Mr Davies is by no means a certain winner.
One long-time analyst of Labour's internal machinations commented last night
that the election would be 'a beauty contest, pure and simple'.
Others expected to challenge for the post include Mr George Robertson,
Labour's European spokesman and a passionate supporter of the Maastricht
treaty, and Mr Martin O'Neill, who until the party's election defeat in
April was shadow defence secretary.

FT  28 SEP 92 / Meeting of minds behind Smith's strategy: Emma Tucker
identifies members of the 'academic panel' that advises MPs on policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Messrs John Smith and Gordon Brown stand up this week to address the
party conference, Labour's hotch-potch of economic advisers will doubtless
breathe a sigh of relief that it is not their task to defend the pound's
recent upheavals.
One of the gurus has been there before. In 1967, when Mr Harold Wilson, the
then prime minister, devalued sterling, Mr Andrew Graham was assistant to
the cabinet's economic advisers. Long associated with the Labour party, the
Oxford economics don now works part-time as the convener of a group of City
and academic economists who gather on an irregular basis to exchange views
and give advice to Mr Smith and Mr Brown.
The approach differs from Mr Smith's predecessor Mr Neil Kinnock, who relied
almost solely on the advice of Mr John Eatwell, a Cambridge don, now on his
way to the Lords as a Labour peer.
'The objective of the group is to get in different ideas,' says Mr Gerry
Holtham, one of the group's City members. 'John is a lawyer and likes to
weigh the evidence.'
But the name most closely associated with Mr Smith is that of Mr Graham.
Sympathisers describe him as a pragmatic, realistic economist in tune with
the modern party, while adversaries stick to the label 'old-fashioned
Keynesian'.
Undergraduates, taught by the 50-year old windsurfing enthusiast at Balliol
remember his dismissal of Conservative economic policies as 'all this
monetary nonsense'.
Mr Chris Allsop of Oxford, another member of Labour's 'academic panel' - as
he prefers to call it - says the group is united by pro-European sentiment,
even if it represents a range of views.
Mr Gavyn Davies, chief economist of Goldman Sachs in London, who was tutored
by Mr Graham at Balliol, is at the end of a phone for instant clarification
or explanation of City manoeuvrings. Mr Holtham of Shearson Lehman, the
investment bank in London and Mr Neil MacKinnon, who recently moved to
Citibank are also included at the meetings.
The group also includes a number of rather tight-lipped academics from
Oxford, Cambridge and the London School of Economics. These include Mr
Allsop, Prof Meghnad Desai, professor of economics at the LSE, and on an
even more informal basis, Mr Ian Begg, Mr John Wells and Professor Wynne
Godley from the Department of Applied Economics at Cambridge.
It is early days for Mr Smith as leader and whether he expands his coterie
of advisers remains to be seen. Meanwhile, another meeting of the 'panel'
has been called for next month, giving Labour, like the government, the
opportunity to come up with a brand-new economic strategy.

FT  28 SEP 92 / Brown to keep up pressure over ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GORDON BROWN, the shadow chancellor, has re-affirmed Labour's medium-term
objective of returning Britain to a system of 'managed exchange rates'.
However, he may today face pressure from delegates for an economic policy
which takes advantage of Britain's suspension from the exchange rate
mechanism to loosen monetary policy still further in order to promote
economic revival.
Mr Brown insisted yesterday that Labour would not advocate Britain's return
to the ERM until an industrial policy along continental European lines was
in place.
He also demanded reform of the mechanism, saying it was necessary to enhance
co-operation on exchange rate management between the European Community's
member states.
But, in spite of Labour's past opposition to devaluation, he is likely to
face pressure in today's economy debate for cuts in interest rates in order
to kick-start the economy even if that results in a further fall in
sterling.
Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union and past
supporter of an ERM realignment, warned yesterday that without a
2-percentage-point cut in borrowing costs by the end of October there would
be more 'massive redundancies' by Christmas.
'If the 2-percentage-point cut pushes the pound down by a few more pfennigs
then so be it,' Mr Edmonds added. 'The important thing is the relieve the
burden of debt on industry.'
Mr Brown said Labour would also seek international collaboration to inhibit
foreign exchange speculators whose activities have provoked turmoil across
Europe. In his introduction to today's debate - bought forward from
Wednesday to keep up the pressure on the government - Mr Brown will tell the
conference that the government has failed to fulfil its manifesto commitment
to deliver an economic recovery.
Mr Brown will use his speech to demand that Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, explain his policy to the public, and to outline Labour's
strategy for reviving the economy.
The composite motion on the economy, which was backed by the party
leadership yesterday, warns that Britain's economic problems will worsen if
the government continues to refuse to 'intervene constructively'. The motion
calls for co-operation between 'social partners' including a dialogue
between industry, unions, financial institutions and government.

FT  28 SEP 92 / Rebel's lost cause brings about his predictable exit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NO ONE was surprised by Mr Bryan Gould's decision yesterday to quit the
shadow cabinet. More of his colleagues than will admit it publicly will
lament his departure from the opposition front bench.
After his defeat by Mr John Smith in July's leadership election Mr Gould was
offered the health or education portfolios - two of the most important for
Labour in opposition.
Instead he opted to shadow the unfortunate Mr David Mellor at National
Heritage. His friends judged, rightly, that Mr Gould had decided that his
career in the new Labour team would be short.
Throughout the leadership contest it was obvious that his views on Europe,
on the exchange rate mechanism, and on economic management could not for
long be contained within the orthodoxy of Mr John Smith's shadow cabinet.
In the wake of sterling's retreat from the ERM and the Yes vote in the
French referendum on Maastricht, his criticism of Labour's support for the
ERM and the treaty had become increasingly strident.
He was briefly silent after the shadow cabinet last week agreed a common
position. But by then he had decided to resign, delaying the decision only
to avoid overshadowing Mr Smith's parliamentary debut against Mr John Major.
His clash with the leadership was not new. After a starring role in Mr Neil
Kinnock's election campaign in 1987, he found that antipathy towards
European federalism and his espousal of reflationary policies clashed with
the party's desperate quest for respectability.
The rise of Mr Gordon Brown and Mr Tony Blair in Labour's embrace of the
market and Europe saw Mr Gould shifted outside Mr Kinnock's kitchen cabinet.
He opposed the decision to back ERM membership at what he termed a
'ludicrous' rate and in effect to support the government over Maastricht.
Free yesterday of the constraints of collective responsibility, Mr Gould
displayed the depths of that antagonism. He was scathing about Maastricht as
a 'breathtaking and audacious attempt' to ensure that bankers rather than
politicians gained permanent hold over Europe's economies. The ERM had been
revealed 'for what it aways was - just another means to try to defy economic
reality'.
Many in his party regard such views as eccentric. Mr Roy Hattersley, the
former deputy leader and another of Labour's serious political thinkers,
urged him yesterday morning to give up his 'championship of lost causes'.
Others, possessed still with the search for respectability, regard him as
damaging and dangerous. If his resignation is followed today by defeat in
the annual elections to the national executive, the 53-year-old MP for
Dagenham will face a long spell in the political wilderness.
But still others will agree with the judgment offered by Mr Hattersley
before yesterday's events: 'Mr Gould is by intellect, temperament and
training the shadow cabinet member most qualified to argue Labour's
ideological case.'

FT  28 SEP 92 / Major fights split on Europe: Government hopes for treaty
ratification may rest on 'subsidiarity' deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR faced renewed divisions within his cabinet over European
integration yesterday amid signs that the government's hopes for
ratification of the Maastricht treaty now rest on an EC-wide agreement to
devolve more authority from Brussels.
As the government sought vainly to re-establish a semblance of unity around
its European policy, ministers said that a declaration underwriting the
principle of 'subsidiarity' could be signed at the Edinburgh summit in
December.
The declaration, which would be attached to the Maastricht agreement, would
give substance to the brief reference in the treaty on the need to
decentralise decision-making.
Mr Major, who will press the idea in separate meetings on Wednesday with Mr
Francois Mitterrand, the French president, and Mr Poul Schluter, the Danish
prime minister, hopes the commitment will reassure enough Tory waverers to
allow him to press ahead with ratification.
The ministers said that the need to persuade Denmark to reverse its No vote
to Maastricht and the mood of public opinion throughout the Community should
persuade EC leaders at next month's emergency summit in Birmingham to give
the British presidency a mandate to draft such a declaration.
But the scale of Mr Major's task in filling the policy vacuum left by
sterling's enforced departure from the exchange rate mechanism was
underlined by the discordant notes sounded again yesterday by ministers and
senior Tory MPs.
Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, appeared to accept that
Britain's reluctance to set a time-frame for sterling's return to the ERM
could prompt an inner-core of countries based around Germany and France to
establish a fast-track to monetary union.
But, speaking on ITV's Walden programme, Mr Howard insisted that 'British
interests' would be paramount in deciding the government's stance. He added:
'If others choose to go at a different pace and choose to put in place
arrangements which are not suitable to us . . . we must take our decisions
on the basis of what is best for the British people.'
Those comments, along with a statement that sterling's re-entry to the ERM
would be considered only after the mechanism had been reformed, jarred with
enthusiastically pro-European statements by two other ministers.
Mr John Gummer, the agriculture secretary, told BBC Radio: 'There is no
future for Britain in some sideline. We are in the centre of Europe and we
intend to stay there.'
Disputing Mr Howard's comment that the suspension of ERM membership offered
opportunities for Britain, Mr Gummer said that the real issue was whether
the government wanted to be buffeted by the effect of strong economies and
currencies with no say in the decisions shaping events.
That view was echoed by Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, the Foreign Office minister
responsible for Europe, who said that failure to ratify Maastricht would be
a 'humiliation' for Britain.
But Sir Marcus Fox, chairman of the influential 1922 committee of
Conservative backbench MPs, was among a succession of senior Tories ready to
cast doubt on support for both Maastricht and the ERM.
With other opinion polls showing the strength of feeling against European
integration, there were also calls from a number of MPs for the government
to 'get a grip' on its strategy.

FT  28 SEP 92 / Gould quits shadow cabinet to oppose Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BATTLE over the Maastricht treaty finally engulfed the Labour party
yesterday when Mr Bryan Gould shattered the leadership's fragile truce on
Europe by quitting the shadow cabinet.
His resignation from the post of heritage spokesman - on the eve of the
party's annual conference in Blackpool - boosted growing opposition to the
leadership's pro-Maastricht policy.
It also cast a pall over the conference that senior party officials had
hoped would capitalise on Conservative disarray on Europe and rally support
to Mr John Smith in his first appearance as leader.
Senior party figures and union leaders last night expressed open anger with
the timing of Mr Gould's decision, arguing that he had seriously underminded
Labour at a moment when the Conservatives were on the defensive.
Mr Gould's widely anticipated resignation frees him to act as standard
bearer for those opposing any return to the exchange rate mechanism and to
head the growing campaign for a referendum on the Maastricht treaty.
In an exchange of letters with Mr Smith, he said he no longer felt able to
reconcile his 'strongly held views on the economy and the future of Europe'
with his obligation to uphold collective responsibility for shadow cabinet
decisions. 'I am accordingly, and with deep regret, obliged to resign from
the shadow cabinet,' he wrote.
In reply, Mr Smith, who trounced Mr Gould by a ratio of nine to one in the
leadership election this summer, acknowledged that in the light of the
'clear decision taken by the shadow cabinet on policy towards Europe' it was
impossible for him to stay on.
The resignation came amid mounting evidence that Labour MPs are increasingly
divided over the party's response to the Maastricht treaty and Britain's
suspension of its ERM membership. The official stance - similar to that of
Mr John Major - rejects any resumption of the Commons debate on the
ratification of Maastricht until the Danes have clarified how they plan to
proceed.
Labour also opposes a return to the ERM until an industry policy is in place
and agreements are reached with other EC countries on reforming the system.
However, Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said yesterday that Labour
supported a system of 'managed but flexible exchange rates' and rejected a
free-floating pound.
Evidence of Labour MPs' disquiet emerged in a poll of 100 MPs conducted by
the BBC's On The Record programme. A total of 42 opposed ratification of the
treaty, 19 wanted amendments and only 25 backed the pact. Forty six backed a
referendum with 44 against.
Today, the conference will debate a resolution demanding a referendum. By
allowing the motion, which is certain to be defeated, Labour leaders hope to
undermine future attempts by MPs to press for a plebiscite.

FT  28 SEP 92 / Concern grows for future of troubled council insurer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Department of Trade and Industry is closely watching the slow progress
of rescue talks for Municipal Mutual Insurance, the troubled insurer owned
by UK local authorities, amid concern about its survival prospect.
The worries about MMI - the UK's ninth largest general insurer - have
intensified since the circulation of a negative assessment by Touche Ross,
the accountancy firm, and speculation that talks between MMI and its
prospective partner, La Garantie Mutuelle des Fonctionaires (GMF), are
foundering.
The French insurer is part of the Eurosafe consortium of European insurance
companies.
Mr Brian Wright, who became MMI's chief executive in May, yesterday denied
reports that the merger talks had collapsed.
'I am going to Paris this week to continue with these discussions,' he said.
The talks were protracted because the transfer of MMI's business was
complex. 'We have to ensure the transfer is effected in the best way to
protect the interests of policyholders.'
MMI ran into difficulties because claims by councils in 1990 and 1991 proved
far greater than expected, partly because of a big rise in arson attacks on
schools and a growing tendency among individuals to take legal action
against local authorities.
Its net assets declined from Pounds 287.9m at the end of 1990 to less than
Pounds 5m at the end of 1991.
The prospect of MMI's collapse, unless it quickly agrees a takeover, is
viewed with concern by local councils. If the insurer foundered, it is
unlikely that their claims would be met in full. MMI insures over 80 per
cent of local authorities.
Local authorities are not protected by the safety net of the Policyholders
Protection Act, which safeguards policyholders in the event of an insurance
company's default.
MMI announced in July that it was in talks with GMF.
The Department of Trade and Industry, which regulates insurers, said
yesterday that it was premature to speculate what would happen if a merger
was not agreed.
'We understand an agreement was reached in principle between MMI and GMF in
July,' it said. 'The department has been closely in touch with negotiations
ever since.'
However, the report by Touche Ross, which was commissioned by the
associations for county, metropolitan and district councils, is believed to
say that the DTI will insist that the group ceases trading unless the
takeover with GMF goes ahead quickly.

The peseta moved from the bottom of the European Monetary System's grid to
the top last week after Spain protected its currency by imposing exchange
controls. The peseta then returned to the bottom after Spanish share prices
collapsed in the wake of the move. The central banks' determined defence of
the French franc helped it join the ranks of the strongest currencies. The
top four currencies are in a position to move quickly towards monetary
union, while those below could adopt a slower timetable. Samuel Brittan,

The chart shows the member currencies of the exchange rate mechanism
measured against the weakest currency in the EMS's narrow 2.25 per cent
fluctuation band. In practice, currencies in the narrow band cannot rise
more than 2.25 per cent from the weakest currency in that part of the
system. The Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo operate with 6 per cent
fluctuation bands.

FT  28 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Assurance for investors and creditors -
Auditors' involvement in half-yearly statements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Casual readers of at least two sets of half-year results released this month
might easily have thought they had been given a sneak preview of the
full-year figures six months too early.
The error would not have been caused by the size of the figures themselves,
but by the fact that there was so much financial information available.
A growing number of companies are providing more detailed half-yearly
information, with divisional or geographical breakdowns of profit, or
information on their balance sheet.
But Guardian Royal Exchange, the insurance company, and Guinness, the drinks
group, have gone several steps further. Their interim reports resemble more
closely the financial statements in an annual report, even to the extent of
including a statement from Price Waterhouse, auditor to both companies.
Their results for the first half of 1992 are presented with a profit and
loss account, geographical break-down, and also a full balance sheet.
In addition, both have a full cash flow statement in accordance with the new
Financial Reporting Standard.
The figures presented in either case are unaudited. But they are accompanied
by a letter from Price Waterhouse to the directors of the company, which
says the firm has 'reviewed' the figures
The PW report says the review was not conducted in accordance with auditing
standards, and did not involve visiting operating locations or verifying
assets and liabilities.
It principally meant understanding the process involved in preparing the
financial information, applying analytical procedures to the data, and
quizzing the management.
It concludes: 'In our opinion, the half-yearly financial information has
been prepared with due care and using accounting policies consistent with
those adopted  .. in the statutory financial statements for the year ended
December 31 1991.'
GRE states that it provided greater interim financial information in line
with the recommendations of the Cadbury committee on corporate governance.
'We had done the work internally, and we were quite happy to take up the
Cadbury suggestion,' says Mr James Morley, finance director.
The statements were easy to assemble because GRE has long asked its auditor
to conduct an interim review, discussing factors such as the financial
information collected, technical issues and accounting policies adopted.
'We believe that having a half-year numbers review makes a lot of sense,'
says Mr Morley. 'You can get into very esoteric arguments about whether
having a review saves costs at the year-end audit. But the costs are
certainly justified by the benefits.'
The same message comes from Mr Andrew Allner, financial controller at
Guinness. 'We have taken a close interest in corporate governance and it
came up in discussions with our auditors,' he says.
It is no coincidence that both companies were audited by PW. Mr Graham Ward,
a partner in the firm has been among those in the profession actively
supporting auditor scrutiny of both interim and preliminary announcements.
Mr Morley supports the idea of the PW comment. 'It gives shareholders some
anchors to what's been done. It is quite an important statement.'
Mr Allner adds: 'It gives the shareholders the feeling that the numbers have
been reviewed by someone independent and objective. We think it's a good
thing and would like to think other companies would do the same.'
Mr Quentin Humberstone, the lead engagement partner at PW for GRE, says: 'It
seemed a logical extension that because we're doing the review, we should
say something about it. We put our pen where our work was.'
He says the firm took considerable time deciding on the wording since there
was no precedent and no guidelines That same wording was mirrored in for
Guinness.
He stresses that the PW comment is addressed to the directors, and offers
none of the safeguards of the audit report in the annual accounts.
However, Mr Ward adds: 'There may not be a legal obligation, but once our
name is associated with the accounts, there is an implication that a degree
of care has been taken. There is an assurance value.'
At a time when both gearing and short-term cashflow are among the chief
concerns of investors and creditors, it comes as no surprise that the extra
balance sheet and cash flow information has been widely welcomed.
However, Mr Morley says that 'interestingly' he has heard no comment on the
auditor's statement. Perhaps that reflects uncertainty over what
significance it really has. After all, without any mandatory requirement, it
is unlikely that companies disagreeing with their auditors will publish it
It also remains to be seen whether, if other companies follow the lead of
GRE and Guiness, a comment without the legal obligations of a full audit
will provide any reasonable guarantee that the interim accounts really
represent a 'true and fair' view of the financial position.

<TEXT>
Ardagh, the Dublin-based glass producer, made pre-tax profits of IPounds
4.21m, or Pounds 4.38m, in the 53 weeks ended June 30 1992.
That compared with IPounds 4.98m for the previous year, and the directors
considered it satisfactory in the light of the pressures on volumes and
margins.
Sales for the 53 weeks totalled IPounds 32.5m (IPounds 32.8m), while trading
profit came through at IPounds 3.43m (IPounds 4.11m).
Earnings per share were 11.18p (12.39p) and the final dividend is 2.39p for
a total of 3.115p (3p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
National Home Loans, the mortgage lender and consumer finance group, is to
merge its treasury and finance operations under the control of Mr Nigel
Terrington.
The merger reflects the reduced size of the company. Mr Terrington's
appointment follows the resignation of Mr Tony Moir, a leading figure in the
company since its establishment in 1986, as finance director.
In July NHL reported losses of Pounds 85.9m after making bad debt provisions
of Pounds 79.4m, and passed its dividend.
Mr Jonathan Perry, chairman, denied that Mr Moir's departure was linked to a
boardroom row. 'It is arguable that there is not the necessity for both
posts,' he said.

FURTHER REDUCTIONS in operating costs and the benefits of the convertible
preference rights issue a year ago enabled William Jacks, the motor dealer,
to make a small profit in the half year ended July 31 1992.
It made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1,000, compared with losses of Pounds
601,000 for the corresponding half year and with Pounds 850,000 for the full
year.
The overall car market had not yet shown signs of real recovery, but the
corporate sector had been 'quite resilient' and certain franchises were
benefiting from excellent new models, the company said.
First half turnover was held at Pounds 21.2m. Operating surplus rose from
Pounds 126,000 to Pounds 443,000, and interest charges were cut to Pounds
442,000 (Pounds 704,000). Losses per share, after preference dividend, were
0.96p (5.56p).

FT  28 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Sphere raises Dollars 4m and wins its
independence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPHERE, the California video game company controlled by the late Robert
Maxwell through a Liechtenstein charitable trust, has won its independence.
The fast-growing company that has produced popular games, such as an F-16
flight simulator, has raised Dollars 4m from new investors for additional
marketing and development and buying out shares formerly held by Swico, a
charitable trust which was in effect its parent.
Earlier this year it emerged that Sphere, which trades under the name
Spectrum HoloByte, appeared to be a private Maxwell company beyond the reach
of Arthur Andersen, administrators to Mr Maxwell's private interests.
The negotiations over the future of Sphere have involved Arthur Andersen. As
a result in return for the Swico shares Dollars 2.3m was paid into an escrow
account and a further provision of Dollars 4m in preferred shares set aside
to cover any further unexpected liabilities.
Before the re-financing package was put together all Maxwell appointees to
the company were removed.
Mr Gilman Louie, president and chief executive of Spectrum HoloByte, said:
'This financing positions the company to work with our new partners in
bringing products and technologies to the industry.'

FT  28 SEP 92 / UK Company News: MCC accountants on final chapter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCOUNTANTS are nearing a final chapter in their disposal programmes of the
assets in the Maxwell business network, more than ten months after they were
first appointed.
Price Waterhouse has been handling the 400 companies - most of them
non-trading - within Maxwell Communication Corporation. Realisations so far
have totalled Pounds 59m, including companies such as Panini, Nimbus,
Macdonald, MBCG and MCPC. Professional fees have totalled Pounds 15m to
date.
There have been no MCC realisations so far in the US, where the majority of
the assets are. Mr Mark Homan, one of the joint administrators, has said he
wanted to avoid a fire sale; the businesses are also self-sufficient in
cashflow and ahead of projections.
Accountants at Arthur Andersen are administrators to the private Maxwell
business empire. This also includes about 400 companies, the vast majority
being non-trading.
There were 55 trading businesses identified, of which 52 have been sold,
generating Pounds 110m. These include the European newspaper, AGB and some
other market research companies. Income has been offset by Pounds 2m in
trading losses and costs, and estimated professional bills of Pounds 11m.
Two businesses have been closed, leaving one - British International
Helicopters - to be sold, along with property assets and overseas
investments, which should in total realise at least another Pounds 50m.
The Office of Fair Trading has cleared the way for bids from four of the six
serious contenders.
In addition, the firm still has to determine the point at which to sell the
majority shareholding in Mirror Group Newspapers, but appears to be in no
hurry to do so.
Mr John Talbot, head of insolvency at Andersen, said he is getting to the
point of liquidating a number of the companies now held in administration.

FT  28 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Tepnel for USM with Pounds 28m tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TEPNEL Diagnostics will join the USM on Wednesday through a placing of 4.58m
ordinary shares at 120p to raise a net Pounds 5.16m. At that price Tepnel is
valued at Pounds 27.5m.
A biotechnology company based at the University of Manchester Institute of
Science and Technology, Tepnel has developed diagnostic testing systems
there which are designed to 'meet growing consumer and legislative demands'
for detecting the presence of residual antibiotic or other contamination in
foods and of viral and bacterial conditions in blood.
Mr Harold Morley, chairman and chief executive, said the risk period was
over and Tepnel's products were now at the point of commercial exploitation.
The scientific team is led by Dr Stephen Minter. In food diagnostics, the
company has developed the FARAS (Food Antibiotic Residue Analysis System)
test which requires one test for 16 answers, rather than the current 16. The
milk industry will be the first market to be addressed.
In medical diagnostics, a series of probes screen the particular DNA
patterns of specific diseases. Here the National Blood Transfusion Service,
which currently runs tests for HIV I and II, hepatitis B and C and syphilis,
is the initial target market.
The company said that advantages over the current testing techniques include
no false results, test results in 60 minutes and the identification of
latent, as well as active, viral diseases.
The placing by Allied Provincial Securities, represents 20 per cent of
Tepnel's enlarged share capital.

FT  28 SEP 92 / People: Gregory's new chapter at Pentos
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Clive Gregory is returning to Pentos, the booksellers and office equipment
retailers - to the same position he left ten years ago. He will be group
finance director, and will replace Patrick Hooper, whom Gregory recruited in
1977. Hooper moves to 'another public company' shortly to be announced.
In the meantime, Gregory has been chief executive of greenhouse and
conservatory manufacturer Halls Homes &amp; Gardens, a management buyout company
he took out of Pentos in 1982, and floated on the USM four years later.
The company has just gone into receivership, following the loss of its
biggest customer, B&amp;Q. Gregory, however, left last November, when he says he
had done all he could do in terms of cost cutting and asset reduction. 'It
was set reasonably fair then,' he contends. But Halls Homes &amp; Gardens'
market has been particularly badly hit by the slump in consumer confidence -
even if Pentos company secretary Mark Jenner admits to buying a conservatory
from the company this year.
Gregory, 49, who says he thinks he has aged ten years in the last decade
while Terry Maher, 56, the combative Pentos boss, has advanced 'only about
seven years', is returning to a very different business. In 1982 books were
only one, if the largest, of six divisions among activities such as
engineering and construction. Since then Pentos has built the Dillons and
Athena networks and acquired Rymans. Gregory has been reacquainting himself
with Pentos in the past six months by advising on the integration of Wilding
Office Equipment, as well as a small MBO of the parts of Wilding, acquired
earlier in the year, that Pentos did not want. When it was apparent Hooper
wanted to leave, the company says it engaged in a full executive search, and
then chose Gregory.

Maurice Oberstein (left), the New Yorker who became one of the British music
industry's most prominent figures, is to retire as chairman and chief
executive of PolyGram UK at the end of the year. He will be replaced by
Roger Ames, currently managing director of London Records, a joint venture
with PolyGram.
Oberstein, 64, came to the UK in 1965 to work for CBS Records as chief
manufacturing engineer. He became chairman of CBS Records in the UK in 1978
and chairman of the UK arm of PolyGram in 1985. During his seven-year stint,
PolyGram UK's market share rose from 15 to 24 per cent.
Oberstein is chairman of the council of the British Phonographic Industry, a
post he held from 1983 to 1986 and to which he was re-elected last year. He
will remain a member of PolyGram International's management team,
responsible for Australia, New Zealand and Canada.
The Trinidad-born Ames worked for EMI UK before joining PolyGram's Phonogram
division in 1979. Since 1983 he has been managing director of London
Records, which he owns jointly with PolyGram and Tracey Bennett. Under his
leadership, London Records developed such acts as Bronski Beat, Bananarama
and Fine Young Cannibals.

OVE ARUP &amp; PARTNERS HIGHWAYS GROUP has been appointed by the Department of
Transport (Eastern Region) to carry out the design and construction
supervision of the widening of the M25 between Junction 23 - South Mimms and
Junction 28 - Brentwood.
This section of 40 kms joins the A1(M) to the A12 and includes two tunnels,
Holmesdale and Bell Common, and the M11 intersection.
The scheme is to widen the M25 to dual four lanes while keeping new
construction within the existing fence lines. The programme is in two phases
with the aim of having the first section in operation in the autumn of 1996
and the total scheme finished by the autumn of 1998.
Ove Arup &amp; Partners International, in association with WS Atkins, has been
appointed by the Ministry of Public Works, Kenya, to undertake the
preliminary design of the Olenguruone-Silibwet Road. The project is funded
by the ODA.
The six-month project is for the preliminary design of the upgrading of 60
kilometres of road on the southern side of the Mau Forest in Kenya.
Any work on this road has significant environmental and ecological impact
and these will be key factors in assessing the upgrading of the road.
The brief is to provide an all-weather single carriageway road through this
rural area which minimises the environmental impact.
Such rural roads are essential for the growth of the local economy by
providing year round access to the local urban areas.

David Allday, 53, is taking early retirement as chief executive and deputy
chairman of BRIDON, the maker of wire rope and other engineered products.
He joined the group in May 1987 from the engineering group AE, which had
been taken over by T&amp;N. He has had to grapple with decline in all of
Bridon's main markets: construction, mining, fishing and offshore oil and
gas.
John West, the chairman of Bridon as well as of Dalgety, explains that 'he
has had to push water uphill and he has had enough.'
Because Allday chose to go - he was not pushed, West says - there was no
great severance payment, even though he had about two years of his contract
to run.
West, who takes on some of Allday's relinquished responsibilities, says he
is looking for a replacement with marketing and sales flair, as well as
knowledge of the engineering industry.
He said the situation at Bridon as 'fairly well under control'. A sevenfold
improvement was recently reported in its first-half pre-tax profits to
Pounds 700,000.
Brian Clayton, managing director for Europe, will be responsible for
day-to-day executive decisions.

GERMAN police said yesterday a fire that on Friday gutted a building

human hand, but could not say yet whether neo-Nazi arsonists were guilty,
Reuter reports from Berlin.
However Mr Ignatz Bubis, chairman of the Central Council of Jews in Germany,
was certain neo-Nazi militants torched the barrack in Oranienburg, north of
Berlin.
He demanded the barrack be restored and said any failure by politicians
firmly to oppose neo-Nazi violence would encourage militants to step up
their attacks.
'It is a disgrace for Germany that a memorial for murdered Jews is burned
down,' the Jewish leader said in Bonn.
There were no immediate statements from Bonn politicians on the incident.
Police said their investigation had established the fire was started by
somebody either by accident or on purpose. Final results would be released
today.

FT  28 SEP 92 / Block votes are fair, says Morris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEADER of Britain's largest union yesterday warned Labour to resist
pressure for rapid moves to cut its links with the unions amid dispute among
leading trade unionists on the future of the block vote.
Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the TGWU general union, said yesterday
he backed the move to cut the block vote from 90 per cent to 70 per cent of
conference votes, but added that it should remain more or less in its
existing form.
Trade unionists are not yet agreed on the size of the cut to make in the
block vote. 'It seems to be the season for 'hip-shooting' but we want to
resist that because the future of the Labour party is more important than
one day's headlines,' Mr Morris said. He said block votes were 'fair votes'.
A review group on links with the unions is due to report to next year's
conference. It is unlikely that a single member of that review group
supports a complete break in the relationship. However, there is a consensus
emerging in favour of removing union influence from electing the Labour
leader and from the selection of local candidates.
The principal dispute remains how far to reduce the influence of union votes
at the conference. Yesterday the AEEU engineering and electrical union,
which is at the opposite end of the argument from Mr Morris, proposed
cutting the union vote to 31 per cent, increasing the constituency vote to
46 per cent and giving MPs and MEPs 20 per cent between them.
Under the AEEU plan, unions would get one vote for every 10,000 members who
pay the political levy, but eventually the size of the union vote would
depend on the number of individual party members in a union.
Separately, the GMB general union repeated its plan to cut the block vote to
50 per cent and put forward a plan to allow union members who pay the
political levy to become 'associate members' of constituency Labour parties
with a role in selecting parliamentary candidates.
Mr John Edmonds, GMB general-secretary, expressed scepticism about the
AEEU's plan to reform the block vote. 'I understand that this (the AEEU
plan) is a working document within the AEEU and I think that is how it
should be regarded,' he said.
A composite motion on union links, backed yesterday by the national
executive committee and to be debated by the conference on Wednesday,
expresses 'strong support for the continuation of the party's links with the
trade unions' and regrets 'ill-informed and malignly intentioned criticisms
of the trade union/Labour party link'.
But, while recognising the financial contribution of the trade unions to the
Labour party, the motion calls for 'structures to be as democratic as
possible to encourage greater involvement of individual party members and
levy-paying members of affiliated organisations'.

six months

<TEXT>
ISTITUTO Bancario San Paolo di Torino, the big Italian bank which floated
part of its shares this year, raised gross operating profits before
provisions and depreciation by 22.8 per cent to L710bn in the first half of
this year. The trend in earnings, which were ahead of budget, had continued
into July and August, it said.
Loans rose by 11.5 per cent to L92,500bn, with the rate of growth partly
held back by the bank on credit grounds. Deposits rose by almost 14 per cent
to L104,500bn, with the biggest increase coming from the bank's domestic
clients.
Stet, the stock market listed holding company for Italy's state-owned
telecommunications activities, reported virtually static group pre-tax
profits of L1,566bn in the first half to June, against L1,546bn a year
earlier.
The result came in spite of a 12.5 per cent rise in turnover to L12,526bn.
Mr Biagio Agnes, Stet's chairman, judged the results satisfactory, but
warned of growing uncertainties owing to the troubled state of the Italian
economy.
Stet made no profits forecast for the full year, but said that earnings
should be in line with the net L1,413bn made in 1991. However, profits would
be affected by the additional taxes and special measures planned under the
government's severe 1993 budget.
The group predicted an 11 per cent rise in sales for the year and maintained
investment spending, which amounted to L4,632bn in the first half.

GENERALI, Italy's biggest insurance company, raised parent company premiums
by 9.2 per cent to L3,927.7bn in the year to July, writes Haig Simonian in
Milan.
The rate of premium growth was half that in the corresponding period last
year, with the fall stemming partly from the decision to weed out
unprofitable business, while growth in life premiums remained
'satisfactory'.
Group premiums rose by 13.4 per cent to L7,256bn, net of exchange rate
changes, while fully consolidated aggregate premiums rose by 15.3 per cent
to L11,184bn.
The company forecast that underwriting income this year should improve from
the difficulties of 1991. However, it warned that earnings, while likely to
be affected by the economic problems facing many clients and volatile
financial markets, would benefit from extraordinary gains, as in 1991.

Calling all discerning tea-drinkers. What do pianist Richard Clayderman and
autumnal flush muscatel Darjeeling Silver Tips have in common?
The answer is marketing whiz David Hutton. As one of the founders of
Tellydisc in 1979, he had the dubious distinction of launching Clayderman on
an unsuspecting public. Now he is trying to reincarnate the East India
Company, founded by Royal Charter in 1600 and dissolved in the wake of the
Indian mutiny of 1857.
Together with Harrogate merchant Tony Wild, who had the same idea
independently, he has gained permission to use the historic company's coat
of arms, and the two are planning a range of products including spices,
booze and fashion-goods.
But the first venture, just set up, is a subsidiary specialising in teas,
with appropriate guidance from the archives. As well as reviving the
original recipe of Earl Grey, the co-directors have located a Sri-Lankan
estate established by the ancestral company in the 1840s, where the almost
forgotten Silver Tip - hand-rolled and sun-dried whole tea leaves - is again
in production.
The least we can hope is that the results are less syrupy than Clayderman.

FT  28 SEP 92 / Leading Article: The problem of too much energy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WE HEAR little about a world energy shortage these days, at least compared
with the era of oil shocks. The World Energy Congress, which has just
concluded its triennial deliberations in Madrid, estimates that there is
enough oil to last 44 years, enough gas for 57 years and enough coal for
several centuries. Moreover these estimates take little account of the role
that technology could play in improving both the supply of energy and the
efficiency with which it is consumed.
The picture is complicated by the fact that the fastest rates of economic
growth in the coming decades may well occur in third-world countries where
energy efficiency is lowest. But against this, the former communist
countries should make substantial offsetting efficiency gains. Even when the
oil and gas do begin to run out, the WEC believes that sufficient strides
will have been made to improve the environmental acceptance of both coal and
nuclear.
Barring the unforeseeable, this portends plentiful and relatively cheap
supplies of energy. The WEC does not expect the price of oil to rise much in
real terms before the end of the first quarter of the next century, when the
exhaustion of known reserves begins to loom. Opec continues to look like an
organisation fraying at the edges.
This is a comforting outlook for the energy consumer. But the prospect of
abundant energy also has its darker side. It provides little incentive for
the energy industry to diversify sources of supply and develop new fuel
types. The longer the energy market remains secure, the stronger will become
the tendency to draw on a narrow range of cheap and convenient fuels - as
now in the UK with the shift to natural gas at the expense of coal. A
sharper element of uncertainty would produce more hedged energy policies.
Although the emergence of a shortage would quickly push up energy prices,
this might be too late for the long lead times needed to bring about changes
in the energy balance.
Another concern must be that cheap energy will remove the stimulus to
technological innovation, and that the sharp gains in energy efficiency
triggered by the Opec oil shocks could peter out. Similarly, energy at its
present oil- dictated price is too cheap to warrant wide-scale development
of new forms of energy such as wind and solar, even though these may be
needed in the longer term.
But the sharpest problems are likely to arise in the mounting tensions
between energy and the environment. If the WEC outlook is correct, the
energy market will not generate enough pressure to reduce consumption,
produce cleaner fuels, and encourage a shift towards renewable energy forms.
Quantifying environmental benefits and costs is anything but an exact
science, but increasingly governments will have to weigh these calculations
as rigorously as possible. The energy/environment balance is one that will
need to be struck politically, whether through tighter regulation or,
preferably, via the price mechanism using taxes.
Although industrialists and consumers in a recession-hit world will be
grateful for WEC's comforting message, there is a growing constituency for
higher energy prices in a world of traffic jams and dirty powerstations
where global warming is becoming a matter of strong public concern. As the
world shifts towards a greener agenda the case for a costlier energy
structure becomes more compelling. In the context of the 30 years over which
the WEC is looking, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that more energy
taxes will have to come.

Many of those killed in the crash late on Saturday were believed to be
middle-ranking army, navy and air force officers attending a Nigerian
Command and Staff College course at Jaji, in northern Kaduna state, and some
of their instructors.
'The plane nose-dived three minutes after take-off into a swampy area,' said
an official in Abuja, the capital. It was heading for Kaduna.
It was Nigeria's worst air force crash since independence in 1960.
Boycotts and fraud charges soured the final round of Nigeria's presidential

Police arrested at least 50 people on electoral malpractice charges during
Saturday's polls in 10 states, boycotted by nine of the 12 Social Democratic

FRAUGHT negotiations over financing for a new DKr8.5bn (Pounds 859m) airport
terminal at Copenhagen are expected to start in the next few days between
Scandinavian Airlines System and Copenhagen Airports, the state-owned Danish
airports authority.
Neither Copenhagen Airports, nor SAS, which wants exclusive use of the new
terminal, appears willing to pay for the building. The terminal is planned
to have a capacity of between 15m and 20m passengers a year. The airport,
the main hub of SAS's traffic system, has an annual capacity of 15m but at
present handles only 12m passengers a year.
Mr Peter Hoeland, managing director of SAS Denmark, said: 'We do not see
ourselves as airport investors. No airline, apart from Alitalia, is
investing in airports. We expect the airports authority to do this.'
SAS has recently presented Copenhagen Airports with its plans for the highly
sophisticated and automated terminal which could make Copenhagen more
attractive to transit passengers. SAS wants the airport to become northern
Europe's main hub. It is at present Europe's 8th largest in terms of
passengers.
Mr Neils Boserup, chief executive of Copenhagen Airports, said: 'Only SAS
can justify an investment of DKr8.5bn. The proposed terminal is so advanced,
it's not a building, it's a machine. An airline might be able to afford it,
but we can't' Copenhagen Airports made pre-tax profits of DKr169.2m on
turnover of DKr1.2bn for the 15 months to December 31 1991. SAS reported
pre-tax profits for the first six months of 1992 at SKr502m on turnover of
SKr16bn.
Mr Boserup is proposing an alternative terminal for use by all airlines.
This building, which he describes as modern but more conventional than SAS's
plan, would add about 7m passengers a year to existing capacity and would
cost about DKr2bn. He said that if the SAS terminal was not started during
the next year, he would go ahead with the alternative plan. An investment of
DKr8.5bn might cast a shadow over the future of Copenhagen Airports, which
is due to be partly privatised.

FT  28 SEP 92 / Buthelezi pulls Zulu party out of S Africa peace talks

<TEXT>
CHIEF Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Zulu Inkatha Freedom party,
yesterday withdrew his party from talks on a new South African constitution,
throwing into doubt prospects for the early installation of a multiracial
interim government.
In a fiery speech at a rally in honour of Shaka, the 19th century
militaristic Zulu king, Chief Buthelezi insisted Inkatha 'will not be bound
by decisions reached in bilateral negotiations between the government and
the African National Congress'.
Only hours earlier, Mr FW de Klerk, the South African president, and Mr
Nelson Mandela, president of the ANC had ended three months of acrimony by
committing themselves to putting an interim government in place as soon as
possible. At a peace summit held outside Johannesburg on Saturday, they
agreed to resume constitutional negotiations suspended since June.
Addressing the crowd gathered in KwaMashu, a township on the outskirts of
Durban, Chief Buthelezi said Inkatha and the KwaZulu government, which he
heads, 'are not marginalised', adding 'and it's my sincere hope that we will
not have to prove the reality of the statement'.
Police said a woman was shot dead and six people were wounded by Inkatha
supporters heading home from the rally. One Inkatha member was stabbed on
his way to the meeting.
Chief Buthelezi accused the ANC of indulging in Yugoslavia-type 'ethnic
cleansing' and 'anti-Zulu racism' in seeking action against migrant worker
hostels. The government and the ANC agreed at the weekend that some hostels
would be fenced and patrolled by police, but the Zulu leader said hostel
inmates would tear down fences 'with their bare hands if needs be'.
He rejected restrictions on the carrying of dangerous weapons, also agreed
at the weekend, saying any attempt to impose them on the Zulus would lead to
more violence. He threatened Inkatha would boycott any elections held in the
present climate.
The Zulu leader's withdrawal damped the euphoria of Saturday's agreement
which Mr Mandela said he hoped would send a 'signal of hope' to South
Africans. 'We have begun today to rescue our people from (the) chaos' of
seemingly endless violence, he said.
Mr de Klerk, too, pledged rapid progress toward a post-apartheid
constitution, and underlined this promise by making big concessions on
issues such as the release of political prisoners and on his demand for a
general amnesty for security force personnel. As part of the deal, three ANC
guerrillas convicted of terrorist crimes against white civilians are to be
freed later today, along with self-confessed racist killer Barend Strydom,
who killed seven blacks in 1988.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Residential Property: A tale of two chateaux
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO CHATEAUX among the many now on the market serve to illustrate the
contrast in styles of such properties between the north and south of France.
Representing the north is Chateau Saint Josse, built in 1840 in a village
five miles from Le Touquet, on the Channel coast. It is a white,
sharp-angled building with steeply-pitched grey-tiled roof and an even
steeper pitch to the tower at its side. It has dormer windows and pale blue
shutters and front door.
It comprises 16 rooms on three floors. Some 6,000 sq ft of stables and
outbuildings come with the property and nine areas of walled gardens.
Representing the south is the listed Chateau d'Allemagne, in Provence.
Originally a defensive fort in the 12th and 13th centuries, it was later
enlarged and converted into a home. Stone buildings, one castellated,
surround a courtyard. There is elaborate carving over the top floor windows.
This chateau has six bedrooms and numerous reception rooms on its five
floors. Now 'fortified' by five circular towers, it looks as romantic as the
other looks businesslike.
Both have British owners, and both properties are on the UK market at
similar prices. For Chateau Saint Josse pounds 950,000 is sought (tel:
0638-712799); Chateau d'Allemagne is about pounds 1m (through Hamptons
071-493-8222).

FT  26 SEP 92 / Residential Property: Tempting prospects in a Swiss market -
As Britons gear up for their skiing holidays, Audrey Powell considers the
resort properties available in Switzerland and France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AUDREY POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIFFERENT nationalities shop for their ski resort properties at different
times of the year. The British it seems, take an interest in buying from
September. So should they begin looking at the well-built, spacious but
pricey Swiss offerings?
Buying opportunities in Switzerland are still limited for the foreigner,
although you are told that since that country's application to join the EC
restrictions 'are loosening a little.' But any slackening of buying rules
seems to be only at cantonal level. Even so, it is worth seeing what is on
offer.
Villars, in the canton of Vaud, which allows purchases by foreigners, is a
long-established Swiss resort attracting intermediate skiers. The merging of
two major developers there - both family companies which have been in the
business for years - has produced a single company with a wide selection of
property for sale.
Examples are a first-floor chalet apartment with balcony, in a private park,
on a piste, at pounds 165,000, or a duplex with three bedrooms, on the top
floors of a chalet, at pounds 202,000. Both are ready for immediate
occupation.
In another chalet, Villars keeps to the chalet tradition with its new
building, one-bedroom apartments go from pounds 133,000. These are near the
centre of town but within walking distance of skiing. They should be ready
by Christmas.
There are apartments in the Chalet Bristol, across the road from the
aparthotel Bristol. Those in the Chalet are for normal freehold purchase,
with no obligation to let, but owners can make use of the hotel's
facilities.
Studios in the Chalet Bristol start at pounds 52,000, one-bedroom apartments
at pounds 173,000. These properties are among those available from the
London offices of David de Lara (081-749-2188) or solicitor Osbornes
(071-485-8811).
The British have always enjoyed the Bernese Oberland, and Wengen, perched
above the valley of Lauterbrunnen, is easily accessible by train from Geneva
and Zurich.
Buying a property in the resort has been more problematical, says Simon
Malster, of Osbornes. But in the course of acting for a client attempting to
purchase a chalet there, he found a property 'which I believe to be uniquely
available to foreign buyers.'
It is an hotel which closed and is being converted into large flats. Near
the station - important, as Wengen is a traffic-free town - the balconied
apartments with their long-ranging views sell at pounds 165,000 (for two or
three bedrooms - the floor area is the same).
Verbier, in the canton of Valais, provides an example of the difficulties
outsider's may face in the Swiss market. In a referendum four years ago it
was decided that no more sales to foreigners would be permitted.
Subsequently that decision was reversed. Since, demand for property by
foreigners has been so great that both last year's and this year's quotas of
foreign authorisations have been used.
Purchasers interested in resale property there are unlikely to get
permission until the beginning of next year.
'There are some excellent properties available, but the situation and
standard of finish, affect the price. Thus a new one-bedroom apartment could
be between pounds 100,000 and pounds 200,000,' he says. For those with a
budget of pounds 400,000 there are large apartments and individual chalets.
If you want to go upmarket you could look to Gstaad, in the canton of Bern.
It is expensive, exclusive and picturesque and offers plenty to entertain
the non-skier.
The 25-year old Chalet Petunia, with views of meadows and mountain ranges
from its terrace and three balconies, is available. There are five bedrooms,
four bathrooms, two reception rooms. The basement could be made into a
self-contained flat. There is a double garage and garden.
The centre of the village and ski slopes are a few minutes' walk away,
although a four-wheel drive vehicle is advisable in winter. Its British
owner has been letting the property and says between pounds 55,000 and
pounds 60,000 a year can be obtained, two thirds of this between December 20
and March 20. Aylesford, in Zondon (071-351-2383) is inviting offers around
pounds 1.6m.
Arlette Adler, of Villas Abroad (Properties) in London (081-891-5444) has
her own lists of ski resort homes - many resales among them.
She takes a rather cynical view of the Swiss sector. When it comes to
changing the buying rules, she suggests, 'haste has never been a Swiss
malaise.'
Adler adds: 'Confusion still reigns in the various departments of the
cantons.' Properties sold in Champery (Valais) 14 months previously had
still not had their authorisations ratified, although they had been granted.
'This means that they cannot be completed before a notary, nor can they be
entered in the land registry. Nor, may I add, has the buyer had to pay for
them ..'
The most important development, predictably, has been the resale market.
Numbers of foreign owners who bought Swiss properties more than ten years
ago cannot sustain the mortgage and upkeep of a foreign property.
But, one man's disaster is another's bargain and bargains there are.
There were some 'truly remarkable opportunities' among quality properties. A
four-bedroom chalet on three levels in the Valais, with a full-size dance
studio (the owner taught dancing) was available for pounds 240,000. In
Fribourg a chalet with integral flat, the whole totalling eight rooms, was
on offer at pounds 358,000.
At the other end of the scale, in Valais, a small studio apartment could be
bought for pounds 24,000. A two-room apartment on the slopes of an extensive
linked ski area was available for pounds 57,000 and one with three rooms,
for pounds 83,000. All were furnished.
The exchange rate had had its effect, too. An owner who bought a two-bedroom
apartment at Leysin, in the Vaud, at pounds 133,000 ten years ago, had it on
the market, furnished, at pounds 88,000.
In French ski resorts there are no complications about a foreigner's
eligibility to buy.
Zigi Davenport, of Alpine Apartments Agency, in Leominster, Hertfordshire
(05447-234) says she is almost embarrassed to admit that the market has been
good and with the bulk of buyers British.
'Last year and the first six months of this year we have been incredibly
busy, with an enormous increase in demand and actual sales, particularly in
the more traditional resorts with easy access to Geneva and the lakes.' Many
clients were now buying in the Alps for year-round holiday use, appealing to
all age groups.
'True, demand is for chalets or larger apartments. The British have never
liked the small 'rabbit hutch' type. A few years ago many French developers
built far too many studio and one-bedroom apartments, to the detriment of
the resort or village,' says Davenport.
At Morzine , for example, the commune would no longer give planning
permission for very small apartments, while builders of quality properties
in the Haute Savoie were in demand, with buyers waiting for any resales.
Chalets for sale in Megeve began at pounds 200,000 and went up to pounds 1m.
Apartments in the renovated Hotel Beau Site close to the golf course were
good value at pounds 129,000 for three bedrooms with terrace, says
Davenport. La Clusaz chalets close to the piste, now started at pounds
140,000.
Chamonix was a draw to tourists worldwide and its property prices were
rising with demand from Italian buyers. Chalets at Les Houches went from
pounds 120,000 but for something special, in a good setting, with views of
Mont Blanc one had to pay pounds 260,000 up.
A final thought with the investor in mind. A complete apartment building,
close to the centre of Les Gets, comprising 17 units and 14 garages, is for
sale at about pounds 900,000. It has nearly all-year rental income. An
alternative option would be to sell most of the apartments and keep the top
floor as a penthouse, suggests the agency.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Residential Property: Bargains where brick and stone meet -
Gerald Cadogan looks at what is available among the dreaming spires of
Oxford and in the pretty countryside nearby
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS IS a buyer's market for big houses and also for fine city homes in easy
reach of the country. One of the more attractive area to begin the search is
Oxfordshire: along the Thames valley, the M4 corridor and in Oxford, the
city of dreaming spires. In spite of the popularity of the country, there
are bargains to be had.
Oxford governs life in the south half of the county and along its borders.
That often puts a premium on house prices but the area has many attractions.
Communications, schools and medicine are excellent. The university has its
dons glad to be invited to dinner away from other dons. There are plenty of
places for walks and expeditions and rich art and music. In Oxford, the
touring opera companies fill the Apollo Theatre and outside the city
Garsington Opera gives a glimpse of how Glyndebourne was in the 30s.
Trains for commuters to London are quick and buses cheap and frequent. The
M4, M40 and A34 lead to the airports and every part of England.
There is a lively life outside the university - though you may soon find
your conversation dominated by talk of schools or of the traffic jams when
it is time to collect the little darlings. It is hard to find the old sense
of a county town in Oxford: some of it is now to smart - Liberty in the High
Street - and some too tatty, such as the fast food outlets.
Among the most appealing properties are the Victorian Gothic houses of North
Oxford even though many are semi-detached. They are solid, spacious family
houses with gardens awash with pink spring blossom. But one must be patient.
Whole houses are rare on the market as many have become university offices,
language schools or flats.
Two examples are on the market. Knight Frank &amp; Rutley (0865-790077) offer 12
St Margaret's Road, in red brick, at pounds 325,000, and Cluttons
(0865-793900), 3 Warnborough Road, in yellow brick, at pounds 345,000.
A smart flat on a long lease at 165 Woodstock Road, is on sale at pounds
265,000, with John E Wood (0865-311522). Wood also offer a house in Park
Town. This was North Oxford's first development, built in 1850s in yellow
brick and stucco and in the Classical style. The house, 53 Park Town, needs
refurbishment but pounds 270,000 is a good price for the best address in
Oxford - if you are not head of a college and in the usual handsome house
with the job.
Oxfordshire straddles the border between the brick land of southern England
and the stone of the rest of the country. From Henley, in the south-east
corner of the county, through the Vale of the White Horse, to Wantage and
beyond, and up to Abingdon, almost all the houses are brick, although a few
are half-timbered wattle and daub. Knight Frank &amp; Rutley in Hungerford
(0488-682726) are selling two such farmhouses near Wantage. But in the hilly
ground north of Oxford, where the Cotswolds cut up to the Cherwell valley,
stone rules.
Stonehill, near Abingdon, with 27 acres, barns, swimming pool and tennis
court, at pounds 780,000, from Cluttons, is a brick house at its grandest.
So is the stuccoed Blackstone House, in the splendidly-named village of
Brightwell-cum-Sotwell, four miles from Didcot (35 minutes by train to
Paddington). Cluttons are agents and the guide price is pounds 550,000.
Near Henley, Savills (0491-579990) are selling the brick and half-timbered
Rotherfield Grange with 226 acres of farm for around pounds 1.5m. The house
has elaborate security. A ring fence surrounds it and you enter through
'electronically operated wrought-iron gates' monitored by closed-circuit TV.
Nearby is the Glebe House (a Victorian rectory) at Dunsden, where Wilfred
Owen, the World War I poet, once lived. Savills and Lane Fox (0734-845757)
offer the house at pounds 500,000.
Place Manor in Streatley is on the market for pounds 25,000 less. It is an
attractive half-timbered and brick building nestling in the Thames valley.
The house is on sale with Strutt &amp; Parker (0635-521707). Nearby Westbury
Farm at Purley, seems to be the only place in the country that makes a good,
full-bodied English red wine. Aspirant vintners, here is your chance at
pounds 650,000 (through Savills). The house also has fishing lakes stocked
with trout.
In the stone belt, Jackson-Stops (0285-653334) offer the Milk House at
Purton, between Swindon and Cirencester at pounds 197,500. It is a dream of
a thatched cottage which sits by a stream.
Two attractive houses in Burford are on the market. The 19th century
Waterloo Farmhouse at Fulbrook has stabling and paddocks and is ideal for
hunting with the Heythrop, it is being handled by Strutt &amp; Parker in
Moreton-in-Marsh (0608-50502). Ladyham, on the market for pounds 700,000
with Jackson-Stops, or Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, has a long frontage on the
river Windrush, which meanders through the garden. It has 18 acres of river
meadow.
Fans of Iris Murdoch, the novelist, or of her husband, John Bayley, the
critic, may be attracted to their old house, Cedar Lodge, in Steeple Aston,
a large village above the Cherwell, that has suffered from noise from Upper
Heyford air base, but the USAF leaves soon. It is a fine house in spruce
state, hardly recalling the days when Professor Bayley would mow a path to
the front door for the lunch guests. Cluttons offer it at pounds 485,000
and, nearer Oxford, the Old Vicarage at Cassington at pounds 535,000.
At Chadlington, in the Evenlode valley, the manor, currently a country house
hotel, is going at pounds 930,000 (Knight Frank &amp; Rutley) and could continue
as a hotel or revert to being a family house. Pool Farm, at Stratton Audley,
near Bicester, has a more surprising business on its 260 acres. It is the
headquarters of the London Rally School. John D Wood offer it in lots for a
total pounds 735,000.
Chandlings Manor, by Bagley Wood, on the hills south-west of Oxford, is a
pleasure dome of extreme opulence built by Farid Wakim, sold in 1990 for
over pounds 5m and in 1991 for pounds 2.5m and now on offer for pounds
1.95m, from Savills in London (071-499-8644). Where else can you get a
casino, indoor and outdoor swimming pools, rifle range, squash court,
cinema, floodlit gardens, stables and garaging for 21 cars, and much more in
the most expensive taste, at such a snip of a price? The dons will come out
in droves to marvel. The desert-tented drawing room calls to mind the lines
of Matthew Arnold in The Scholar Gipsy: 'on the skirts of Bagley Wood, Where
most the Gipsies buy the turf-edg'd way Pitch their smok'd tents.'

<TEXT>
LEADERS OF the TGWU general workers' union yesterday officially confirmed
plans for a merger with the GMB general union.
The formal announcement follows months of speculation about a courtship
between the two unions, which have a combined membership of 2m across
British industry.
Mr Bill Morris, TGWU general secretary, said: 'There is a clear industrial
logic for the T&amp;G and the GMB to work towards a merger.'
Mr Morris said he hoped the merger would take place far sooner than Mr John
Edmonds, GMB general secretary, has suggested. Mr Edmonds said he did not
expect to see the two unions still separate at the end of the century.
The announcement is a response to the financial difficulties all unions
face. The TGWU last year spent Pounds 11m more than its income.
Unions in the rail, coal and electricity industries are considering a joint
campaign to protest against what they see as threats to jobs - from
privatisation, pit closures and generating electricity from gas.

LEADERS of the TGWU general workers union yesterday officially confirmed
plans for a merger with the GMB general workers.
The formal announcement follows months of speculation about a courtship
between the two unions, which have a combined membership of 2m across
British industry. The move will be welcomed by employers who see union
amalgamations as a means of simplifying collective bargaining agreements.
Mr Bill Morris, TGWU general secretary, said: 'There is a clear industrial
logic for the T&amp;G and the GMB to work towards a merger.'
Mr Morris said he hoped the merger would take place far sooner than Mr John

The announcement is a response to the financial difficulties all unions
face. The TGWU last year spent Pounds 11m more than its income. The move has
also been prompted by a rash of mergers between other unions, some of which
threaten the 1.1m-strong TGWU's 60-year reign as Britain's largest union.
The AEU and the EETPU recently merged to form the AEEU electrical and
engineering union with 980,000 members. Next year Nalgo, Nupe and Cohse, the
public-sector unions, will merge to form Unison with 1.5m.
TGWU leaders also announced they would no longer take part in beauty
contests, in which companies rather than workers decide which unions should
have representation rights. This follows the GMB saying that it would also
shun such competitions. Unions in the rail, coal and electricity industries
are considering a joint campaign to protest against what they see as threats
to jobs - from privatisation, pit closures and generating electricity from
gas.
The main unions understood to be involved are the TGWU and GMB general
unions, the NUM and Nacods miners' unions and the RMT, TSSA and Aslef rail
unions.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Italy approves sale of Efim subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian government yesterday approved the sale of the first company in
the Efim group, placed into voluntary liquidation in July, selecting SIV,
the state industrial holding's glass-making subsidiary.
At the same time the government agreed to place all Efim's aluminium
production operations, the group's biggest loss-makers, into one company.
SIV has 25 plants in Italy and abroad employing 5,200 employees and accounts
for 22 per cent of the European car industry's glass market. Its 1991 sales
totalled L732bn (Pounds 343.82m) turning in a small L3.7bn net profit.
However, the recession in the European car industry is understood to have
forced SIV into losses at the time Efim was placed into liquidation.
The decision to proceed with the sale appeared an attempt to signal the
government's desire to accelerate the winding up of Efim whose losses for
the current year could reach L2,000bn. But SIV is also the least politically
sensitive of Efim assets and the privately owned Varasi group has a 5 per
cent stake with an agreement dating back to 1989 giving it option to buy an
eventual 51 per cent.
The government's decision to merge all Efim's aluminium interests gave no
hint as to what operations, if any, might be closed. Nor has there been
clarification on the fate of either Augusta, the loss-making helicopter
company, or the companies in the Breda group, specialists in mass transit
systems and considered Efim's jewel.
On Thursday Mr Alberto Predieri, the liquidator, told parliament two month's
scrutiny of the holding's books revealed total debts of L17,500bn.

FT  26 SEP 92 / ICI-Du Pont deal hangs in balance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE outcome of the European Commission anti-trust inquiry into the asset
swap planned by Du Pont of the US and Imperial Chemical Industries was in
the balance last night, after a meeting of senior officials broke up
inconclusively.
Commissioners' advisers, who must suggest to their political bosses how they
should vote on the deal at next Wednesday's Commission meeting, were unable
to decide yesterday whether it should be blocked, waved through, or approved
with strict conditions.
The deal involves ICI swapping its worldwide nylon interests for Du Pont's
acrylic business and Pounds 250m in cash. The German fibres factory is one
of three European plants which will be transferred to Du Pont.
The inquiry is emerging as one of the most complex and difficult yet handled
by Brussels under the two-year-old EC merger regulation.
'Everybody agreed that this was a borderline case,' said one Commission
official after yesterday's four-hour meeting, which he said was conducted in
a good spirit.
Two weeks ago, the Commission's own merger task force suggested the
commissioners should block the deal because it would give Du Pont a dominant
position in nylon carpet fibre. The official later indicated the deal was
unlikely to be blocked outright.
Sir Leon Brittan, EC competition commissioner, has provisionally agreed a
compromise solution with the two companies. This would involve Du Pont
sharing the German fibres factory it intends to buy from ICI with a
competitor. Related operations - such as research and development - would
also be shared.

<TEXT>
GREAT Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company, one of the biggest US supermarket
operators, saw quarterly profits slide for a second consecutive quarter.
Net income for the second quarter ended September 12 was Dollars 7.64m, or
20 cents a share, compared with Dollars 14.5m, or 38 cents a share a year
earlier. Sales declined less dramatically, to Dollars 2.43bn in the latest
quarter from Dollars 2.65bn a year ago.
For the first six months, A&amp;P's underlying net income fell to Dollars 30.4m,
or 80 cents a share from Dollars 50.7m, or Dollars 1.33, the previous year.
The company, which is 53 per cent owned by Germany's Tengelmann group, took
an Dollars 89.2m provision in the first half of this year to cover potential
losses on its equity stake in Isosceles, which owns the UK Gateway grocery
chain.
The write-off, and one-time accounting items, contributed to a net loss in
the first half of Dollars 149.8m, or Dollars 3.92 a share. There were no
significant extraordinary items in the same period of 1991.
A&amp;P's results are still reflecting general food price deflation and strong
competition in the supermarket industry. The company said unemployment and
lack of consumer confidence had also hurt sales. In addition, the company's
exposure to weak markets in Ontario, Canada and the New York city area has
hit profitability.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Time flies for 90-minute patriots: The Scottish National
party remains optimistic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE MONTHS after coming down to earth with a very hard bump, the Scottish
National party's bruises have almost healed.
With an eye to the general election, last year's conference slogan promised
Scotland would be 'Free by '93'. In the event, it won two seats fewer than
its tally before the election - in spite of increasing its share of the
vote.
At this year's conference in Perth, the SNP is gearing up for a long, hard
slog to 1996 or beyond, but it is still looking forward to eventual success.
'I think the party has drawn a line on the election,' says Mr John Swinney,
one of the main authors of the four-year plan presented to the conference
yesterday.
A full post mortem was carried out immediately after the election, and its
findings have been incorporated into the plan. The chief goal is to win a
mandate for independence at the next general election, but there are interim
goals, such as pushing for a referendum between now and the EC summit in
Edinburgh in December, and making a strong showing in the European elections
of June 1994.
The message of the plan, and of many of this week's speeches, is that the
party cannot afford to waste any time.
'We misjudged how much we would have to do to reassure the public to go with
us,' says Mr Swinney. 'We started campaigning too late in the day on
independence, we didn't cultivate the ground as well as we should have to
make people either believe us or understand what we were talking about.
'We need to build confidence, build an independence lobby, build discontent
with the union, build far greater motivation among the electorate to vote
for the SNP and to vote for independence.'
The plan concentrates on organisational and financial strategies, not policy
issues. In all the post mortems since April, there appear to have been no
admissions that SNP policies may have had some part in their electoral
defeat. The poor showing is blamed on lack of money and organisational
skills - and, in some cases, on the voters.
Some senior members have been unable to hide their frustration with the
apparent fickleness of the electorate. High ratings in the polls before the
election translated into only three parliamentary seats.
Mr Jim Sillars, the former deputy leader, earlier this year called Scots
'90-minute patriots'. At the conference his words were echoed by Mr Iain
Lawson, SNP industry spokesman, who called Scotland a 'numpty' (stupid)
nation and said that maybe Mr Sillars had credited Scots with 89 minutes of
patriotism too many.
Such anger is understandable after the disappointment of the election
result, but the headlines after Mr Lawson's speech are not going to win many
votes.
The other message of the plan is that the party has woken up to the
importance of money.
The SNP is at a severe disadvantage to the Labour and Conservative parties
in that it has no traditional financial base of business or union donations.
So far it has looked to its members, relying on many gifts of small sums.
The four-year plan makes tapping of new sources of funding both the target
and fuel of a sustained public-relations offensive.
In spite of the relentless optimism and forward-looking stance of most of
the speeches, there is an unmistakable feeling at the conference that the
party still needs to take stock and decide on its political orientation.
Tension between moderate left-of-centre and harder-left factions of the
party was revealed during Thursday's debate on whether the SNP should define
itself as a party 'in the mainstream of the European social democratic
tradition'.
In one sense, all SNP policies apart from independence will be irrelevant
and potentially divisive for the foreseeable future. If the SNP ever gets
the chance to negotiate independence, it would immediately resign and call a
general election in which it would be one of several parties competing to
govern Scotland.
But much as the SNP would like to turn every election into an independence
referendum, the public has shown itself unwilling to vote on single issues.
The mood of delegates at Perth is remarkably cheerful given the outcome of
the election, for their party, but conference delegates are dedicated,
committed activists rather than average members.
The SNP has promised to take its message to the people with an autumn of
street campaigns in favour of a referendum and against water privatisation.
The level of enthusiasm shown on wet November days in Glasgow shopping
centres will be a better indicator of whether the party has the stamina to
carry it through the next few years than anything seen in Perth City Hall
this week.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Receivers called to City PR company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STREETS, one of the oldest financial public-relations companies in London
has closed, and receivers have been called in by Royal Bank of Scotland.
The action brought to an end nearly 180 years at the forefront of public
communications in Britain. The company was set up by Mr George Street, a
colleague of Mr Charles Barker, another leading figure in the
public-relations industry.
Staff cleared their desks at lunchtime yesterday after being told that the
company would not be able to pay September salaries and expenses. Mr Mark
Reilly, representing receivers Clarke Whitehill, said the 43 employees would
receive their statutory entitlements when the investigations were complete.
Meanwhile, Citigate, another public-relations company, moved to snap up the
direct and financial marketing divisions of Streets for an undisclosed sum.
Citigate has been expanding, most recently with the purchase of Charles
Barker Advertising from Corporate Communications, which went into
receivership last month.
Streets is believed to have left debts well into six figures. Mr Reilly said
the receivers hoped to recover between Pounds 750,000 and Pounds 1m from
debtors. But the total might not meet all the obligations.
Streets was once London's largest financial PR company, employing 150 people
in 1987. However, it has suffered difficulties since the departure of
several senior executives, who set up Citigate.

Creditors of British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings, the financial services group

losses by its leasing subsidiary, Atlantic Computers, are to be given a
second payment.
B&amp;C Holdings' creditors will each receive a payment of Pounds 110m,
amounting to 5p in the pound, bringing the total they have received so far
to 10p in the pound.
Creditors of B&amp;C Group Finance, who were paid 14p earlier in the year, are
also to receive a further payment in early October, though the
administrators have not said how much it will be.
Both groups have fared badly compared with the creditors of British &amp;
Commonwealth Merchant Bank who have now been paid a total of 78p in the
pound.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Airbreak Leisure loses CAA licence as shares are suspended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, PETER PEARSE and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIRBREAK LEISURE, the tour operator, yesterday had its licence revoked by
Britain's Civil Aviation Authority. The company is expected to be placed in
administration this morning.
Airbreak said last night that Mr David Buchler of Buchler Philips was
negotiating with several interested parties and hoped to conclude the sale
of the majority of the business this weekend.
Airbreak said it was covered by a Pounds 3.97m CAA bond and the 12,000
holiday-makers currently abroad, mostly in Greece and Cyprus, could continue
their holidays. It said of those who had booked and paid for future
holidays, some would be able to go as planned while others would receive a
refund.
All Airbreak customers due to leave the UK last night were told to report
for their flights as normal. However, 50 customers due to fly to Tenerife
from London's Gatwick Airport were last night able to board their flights
after paying an additional Pounds 189 each.
Airbreak, whose brands include Next Island, Peter Pan Travel and Suntan
Tours, specialises in holidays to Greece, Cyprus and the Canary Islands. It
is licenced to carry up to 111,626 passengers annually.
Airbreak's shares, traded since August 1991 on the Unlisted Securities
Market, were suspended yesterday at 3 1/2 p.
On September 15, Airbreak reported interim pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.92m
and warned about the full-year outcome.
Mr David Lewis, chairman, blamed discounting in the tour market and
'unexpected problems' in Sunsail International, bought for up to Pounds 8m
in January and now for sale.
He tendered his resignation this month, a move he described the next day as
a 'gesture' which was not accepted by the board.
Sunsail International, which charters yachts in the Mediterranean, the
Caribbean and Thailand, had a separate CAA bond and was not affected by the
withdrawal of the Airbreak licence
Airbreak came to the USM soon after the collapse of Mr Harry Goodman's
International Leisure Group, which resulted in a sharp rise in business for
other tour operators.
Scott's Greys Travel, a coach tour operator based in Darlington, County
Durham, has ceased trading and steps are being taken to place it in
liquidation. It specialised in short breaks to Euro Disney, Amsterdam and
other continental and UK destinations.
Mrs Sue Constable, a fair trading officer with Durham County Council, said
yesterday the company was not a member of the Association of British Travel
Agents, so clients faced losing their money.

Correction (published 28th September 1992) appended to this article.
MORE than 1,000 staff at National Westminster Bank have voted for industrial
action over compulsory redundancies, the Bifu banking union said yesterday.
The union has called for an urgent meeting with the bank, and if the dispute
is not resolved staff based mainly in Manchester branches will begin an
overtime ban on October 1.
NatWest, the second-largest UK bank, said customers would not be affected.
The bank, which has a workforce of 102,000, said the action would not 'alter
the compelling business reasons which make necessary the reduction in
staffing levels'.
NatWest announced in April that it would shed 4,000 jobs this year including
1,900 in its UK branches. The bank rejects Bifu's accusation that its
methods of selecting staff for redundancy are unfair.
Almost 300 staff voted in favour of the action, while almost 250 voted
against. NatWest said 12 other groups among its 5,000 staff based in
Manchester had also been balloted with most voting against action. Bifu
members will demonstrate in Manchester today.
CORRECTION
NEARLY 300 members of the Bifu banking union employed by National
Westminster Bank in the Manchester region have voted for an overtime ban
over compulsory redundancies, and not more than 1,000 as reported in
Saturday's FT. The vote against was almost 250.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Germany steps up pressure over Eurofighter project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY has stepped up its confrontation with Britain over the Pounds 20bn
European Fighter Aircraft by threatening to withdraw from development work
as early as next February.
By serving formal notice, Bonn is increasing pressure on Britain, Italy and
Spain to agree to abandoning the current aircraft and designing a lighter
one instead.
In June, the German government announced it would not take part in
production of the current design EFA, but said it would continue with the
development phase. About Pounds 3bn of the Pounds 8bn earmarked for
development has still to be spent.
Notification of the German move came in a letter from Gen Jorg Schonbohm,
state secretary responsible for armaments, to Mr Jonathan Aitken, the
British defence procurement minister.
The letter formally initiates a dispute process foreseen under the 1988
memorandum of understanding covering EFA development. This process entails
an initial three-month consultation period, after which a partner must give
a further three months' notice if it wants to withdraw.
Although the letter is dated September 16, Germany is backdating the start
of this process to August 4, when the four defence ministers last met in
Madrid. This was described as unacceptable by British officials, who
yesterday confirmed receipt of the letter.
The British officials said that if Germany abandoned the development
programme - due to last until 1999 - it would be contractually obliged
either to continue paying its share of expenditure or to carry the cost of
transferring work to the other partners.
The threat of withdrawal undermines British hopes of going ahead jointly
with an aircraft substantially the same as the partners have been working on
up to now.
British Aerospace, which this week announced a first-half loss of Pounds
129m, is heavily dependent on obtaining EFA production work from 1996. It is
estimated that programme would involve up to 40,000 British jobs.
Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, has already put pressure on his
Italian and Spanish counterparts to support a halt in development, with
remaining funds being switched to a new project.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Brooke is surprise successor to Mellor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POLITICAL career of Mr Peter Brooke, the former Northern Ireland
secretary, was unexpectedly resurrected last night when he was appointed
successor to Mr David Mellor as national heritage secretary.
The announcement avoided a government reshuffle at the end of a traumatic
week for Mr John Major and promotes a senior politician who, on past form,
is unlikely to fuel cabinet rows over European and economic policy.
Mr Brooke left the cabinet after the general election to launch an
unsuccessful attempt to win the Commons' Speakership.
His immediate task includes the future of the BBC's Royal Charter, the
introduction of the new national lottery and policy on privacy and press
regulation.
Mr Brooke acknowledged the work of Mr Mellor in setting up the National
Heritage department and said: 'It is a very large gap to fill.' The freedom
of the press was 'an important part of our national heritage'.
Earlier, Mr Mellor - a victim of relentless pressure from tabloid newspapers
during the summer over his affair with an actress and a free holiday he
received - said he had been the author of his own misfortune.
He told the Commons: 'There was no question of any impropriety and I hope
that I can leave office with that fact very clearly established.'

FT  26 SEP 92 / Bank intervention saves franc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUNDESBANK and the Bank of France seemed close to winning their battle
to avoid a devaluation of the French franc last night as the currency rose
sharply against the D-Mark.
However, the franc's improved performance on the foreign exchanges
encouraged dealers to test the strength of sterling once again, forcing the
pound to a record low against the German currency in European trading.
The German and French central banks were said to have undertaken light
intervention on the foreign exchanges yesterday morning, buying francs, as
the currency rose above FFr3.40 to the D-Mark. The franc closed at FFr3.3860
to the D-Mark, nearly 1 1/2 centimes up on the day.
In late New York trading, the French currency was trading even higher, at
FFr3.3825, which some analysts hailed as a psychological breakthrough for
the central banks. However, some dealers took a cautious view, suggesting
fund managers have not yet reversed their decisions to sell francs this
week.
The franc and other European currencies were partly supported by an
announcement from the European Commission in Brussels that emergency
exchange controls imposed by Spain, Ireland and Portugal are compatible with
EC law.
Yesterday, the commission broke its self-imposed blackout on comments about
the financial markets with a terse two- sentence statement on the legality
of the measures.
The comments helped to lift the Spanish peseta away from its ERM floor of
Pta72.62 against the D-Mark, to close at Pta69.67. The Portuguese escudo
closed at Esc89.35 to the D-Mark, above its ERM floor of Esc92.33.
However, sterling, suspended from the ERM last week, fell to DM2.5090 in
European trading. It recovered to close 0.5 pfennigs down on the day at
DM2.5450.

FT  26 SEP 92 / EC leaders warn UK over ERM re-entry: Call for reform of
monetary system rejected by European partners

<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl of Germany and four other European leaders last night
warned Britain it will have to negotiate with its EC partners on a suitable
parity for sterling, should it wish to re-enter the European exchange rate
mechanism.
After talks in Brussels, the leaders also rebuffed the British government's
calls for reforming the ERM and declared they were determined to press ahead
with monetary union for all 12 EC members and ratification of the Maastricht
treaty, 'if possible by the end of the year'.
Mr John Major, the British prime minister, has blamed 'fault-lines' in the
ERM for the withdrawal of sterling. He intends to present a case for EMS
reform at the European Council summit in Birmingham next month, but last
night's meeting of influential Christian Democrats in Brussels suggests he
will get a frosty reception.
The meeting was a gathering of Christian Democrats from across the
Community. It included Mr Kohl, Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers,
Luxembourg prime minister Jacques Santer, Greek prime minister Constantin
Mitsotakis and Belgian prime minister Jean-Luc Dehaene.
Mr Wilfred Martens, the former Belgian prime minister, speaking on behalf of
his colleagues, said: 'The EMS is not deficient. You have to accept the
logic of the system. Sometimes a realignment is necessary.'
In a joint 10-point statement clearly aimed at Britain and Italy, which also
withdrew from the mechanism, the leaders said the EMS 'should be maintained
and its rules applied correctly'.
Italy has pledged an early return to the EMS, but Mr Major told the British
parliament this week that: 'I do not believe that we shall be able to go
back into the mechanism soon or into the same mechanism we left'.
Mr Martens confirmed that the joint statement meant that Britain would have
to renegotiate terms of re-entry into the ERM. The UK would also have to
take into account its real competitiveness - something which, he implied,
the UK had failed to do when it decided unilaterally to enter at DM2.95 to
the pound, a level which many judge to have been to favourable to sterling.
Earlier Chancellor Kohl warned in a speech to the Bundestag that no European
country could 'go it alone' without putting their monetary and economic
stability at risk.
In a thinly veiled reference to British ambivalence to the Maastricht treaty
and its withdrawal from the ERM, Mr Kohl declared: 'No-one in Europe - and I
repeat, no one - should labour under the illusion that he is in a position
to go it alone.'
The Chancellor won support from Germany's leading political parties for
moving ahead as planned to ratify the Maastricht treaty by the end of the
year.
On arrival in Brussels, Mr Kohl dampened recent speculation of a possible
Franco-German initiative to accelerate moves European monetary union and
form a club which would include the Benelux countries.
Earlier yesterday it was announced that Mr Major would hold bilateral talks
with Mr Francois Mitterrand, the French president, sometime later this week,
but no date seems to have been fixed.
The summit of Christian Democrat leaders from Belgium, Germany, Greece,
Luxembourg and the Netherlands rejected talk of a 'two-speed' Europe. In
their joint statement, the leaders said that 'all EC member states' needed
to take the necessary measures to meet the strict criteria for monetary
union laid down by the Maastricht treaty.
Mr Martens pointedly reminded journalists at a news conference that as a
member of the EMS, Belgium had taken 'courageous' steps in 1982 and agreed
to devalue the Belgian franc. By taking these measures, Belgium had regained
its competitiveness and its credibility as a member of the EMS, he said.
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the Bundesbank, warned earlier this week
that Britain would have to bargain before re-entering the ERM.
During the Bundestag debate, Germany's leading political parties showed
unusual unity and agreed to meet the December deadline for treaty
ratification. set in Maastricht last year.
However a member of the central council of the Bundesbank warned that
European union could not be achieved as was scheduled before the end of the
century.
Although Mr Nolling was expressing a personal view, his intervention on the
day the Bundestag and the Bundesrat met to start ratification debates
suggests continuing tensions over European union between the hard-headed
pragmatists in Frankfurt and politicians in Bonn.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Shirayama set to win fight for County Hall as LSE bid fails
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE acrimonious battle over the future of London's County Hall appeared to
have been won yesterday by Shirayama, the Japanese developer, after the
government rejected the rival bid from the London School of Economics.
Shirayama said it would now apply for planning permission to convert County
Hall, the Thames-side former home of the Greater London Council, into a
600-bed hotel to open by 1996.
However, it referred to the 'adverse economic factors' surrounding the deal,
which would necessitate 'an extremely cautious and cost-conscious approach'
to the development. 'We must rebuild the confidence and enthusiasm amongst
the various people concerned, including the financial community,' it added.
Yesterday's decision has not, therefore, put County Hall's future beyond
doubt.
Shirayama's scheme for County Hall may also run into trouble with the London
borough of Lambeth, planning authority for the site. But given his support
for the Shirayama bid, Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, can be
expected to override any planning difficulties.
The LSE, Britain's leading social science university, had wanted to relocate
to County Hall from its cramped premises in Aldwych, in central London.
Its director, Dr John Ashworth, said he was 'dismayed' by the decision,
which puts on ice his plan to double the LSE's graduate numbers within three
years.
The LSE is particularly annoyed that the Universities Funding Council, a
government appointed body, refused to support its proposal. The UFC said it
was concerned at the financial viability of the LSE's Pounds 65m bid for the
site.
On the basis of a report by Touche Ross, the consultants, the UFC said the
deal might load the LSE with a cumulative Pounds 40m deficit over eight
years - whereas the LSE had projected the deficit as persisting for half as
long.
The LSE's bid enjoyed strong cross-party support.

FT  26 SEP 92 / ITN faces cash crisis over lease on offices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDEPENDENT Television News faces a growing financial crisis because of the
failure to let most of its new headquarters in central London.
The television news organisation, owned by the ITV companies, is facing a
deficit on the lease of the building that could rise to Pounds 25m over the
next five years.
The deficit could lead to further calls for cash from the ITV companies when
some are facing severe pressure as a result of the recession and the
prospect of paying larger amounts for new franchises.
The problems stem from moves by the ITV companies in 1987 to try to make a
profit by deciding that ITN should rent its entire building. The shortfall
has nothing to do with the efficiency of the news service which has been
tightened up since the admission earlier this year that costs had been
underestimated by Pounds 9.8m. The ITV companies covered the shortfall.
The problems over property, which are unlikely to improve because of the
recession in the property market, could be more difficult to solve.
Three ITN shareholders - Thames, TVS, and TSW - have lost their franchises
and it is not clear how they will react to being asked to fund what is
likely to be a continuing shortfall. New companies such as Carlton
Television and Meridian, which are not at the moment ITN shareholders, are
unlikely to want to pay for deficits resulting from decisions taken before
they even applied for their franchises.
In the 1990 Broadcasting Act the government insisted that 51 per cent of ITN
should be held by companies that are not ITV broadcasters by the end of
1994. At the very least the uncertainties could make it difficult to find
new shareholders at an early date.
Some senior ITV executives now wonder whether it will be possible for ITN to
find any new shareholders at all in time for the government's deadline.
Central London is awash with unlet office space, and although ITN has
managed to find some tenants it is believed they have had to be given
generous rent-free periods.
However, talks are believed to be going well between ITN and the ITV
companies about a new five-year contract to supply television news.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Rules eased on sale of non-cat cars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT plans to give car dealers and manufacturers an extra year to
sell at least 40,000 new cars built without pollution-curbing catalytic
converters.
The move arises from a collapse in the market for new cars which has left
the industry with excessive stocks. in effect, it ends any prospect of the
non-cat cars being offered at bargain-basement prices before the end of the
year.
Under an EC directive introduced in in the middle of last year, registration
of new cars without catalytic converters is scheduled to become illegal
throughout the Community after this year. However, subject to certain volume
restrictions, the government now plans that their sale should be allowed
until the end of next year.
With sales of new cars in the UK and to a lesser extent some continental
markets this year falling well below predicted levels, the UK industry some
weeks ago joined France, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and Greece in
seeking extra time to sell its remaining models without catalytic
converters.
The EC Council of Ministers recently acknowledged the difficulty with an
amendment allowing member governments to relax the rules.
Without the resulting extension throughout next year, manufacturers - many
already incurring substantial losses - faced either selling the cars at even
deeper discounts than those already being made, or registering them without
real owners and selling them as used. One rumour current before the
government's rescue proposal was that such cars might be destroyed to
prevent them from undermining the market further.
Under the scheme, the extension will apply only to non-cat cars built
between August 1990 and the beginning of this month.
Each manufacturer's sales of such vehicles will also be restricted to not
more than 10 per cent of its total sales this year.
The government estimates, however, that there will be only enough cars
without the converters left unsold after January 1 to account for around 3
per cent of next year's total sales, or just over 40,000 cars on a market
which is widely expected to reach a total of 1.6m.
FORD, the leading UK vehicle maker, has warned union officials that it has
too much capacity in the UK. It has told them that sales of its Fiesta and
Escort/Orion cars and light vans are expected to remain low.
It has also warned them that without action 'this reduced demand would lead
to ..a worsening cost position which would put at risk new-product and other
investment programmes'. The company is already cutting capacity at its UK
assembly plants by about 20 per cent.
Ford said yesterday that 'the situation could deteriorate even further'
forcing the company to shed more jobs than the total of more than 1,500
announced on Thursday.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Playing the game will be more important than winning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS not always easy to appreciate that a week of sporting trial by
strength and skill lay ahead for the competitors registering in London
yesterday for the World Corporate Games.
Some were in peak physical shape in their track suits and trainers, but
others were way past retirement age, and a few clearly had a weight problem.
These are no ordinary games, however, and the height of skill and fitness is
not the main requirement. Unlike the pretence at the Olympic Games, taking
part rather than winning really is what matters.
About 6,000 people from a dozen countries will be competing in 22 sports at
venues in the London area, including tennis at Wimbledon and Queen's Club,
golf at Wentworth and soccer, basketball and track events at Crystal Palace.
The largest corporate entries come from British Airways - one of the event's
main sponsors - IBM and Midland Bank. But among the 450 teams are also one
from a London restaurant entering three Bangladeshi badminton internationals
and a group of warders from Brixton prison.
Competitors are arranged in age categories from the under-30s to the
over-60s, (there are 150 of those), with an open class for athletes of any
age who wish to compete at the top level. There are no qualifying standards
 -the system of age categories is intended to give sportsmen and women the
chance to compete against others of similar ability.
Teams are split into championship divisions based on the number of
participants, from Division 1 for teams of between one and five athletes to
Division 8 for those with more than 200.
The games started in San Francisco in 1988 as a way of involving
organisations in team events, and were held there again in 1989, in Hawaii
in 1990 and Lille, northern France, last year. They will be held in Malaysia
next year and South Africa in 1994.
There have been grants to the games of Pounds 100,000 from the Foundation
for Sport and the Arts and Pounds 50,000 from the Sports Council.
Some companies, including British Airways, the official carrier for the
games, give substantial support to their teams, and others including IBM,
Merrill Lynch and Abbey National provide kit and tracksuits with the company
logo. The majority of companies are meeting half the cost, with participants
funding the rest.
So what is in it for the organisations that enter? Most say the games are an
excellent way of building company morale and team spirit, and they also
generate visibility for companies competing in their corporate liveries.
Competition for the most striking kit at the opening and closing ceremonies
can be as fierce as any contest on the sports field.
As well as sport, the games will provide a business forum next Wednesday
when a conference on the management of change in the 1990s, led by Sir John
Harvey-Jones, former chairman of ICI, will be held in the City.

FT  26 SEP 92 / FT deputy chief executive to retire
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RICHARD McCLEAN, deputy chief executive of the Financial Times, is to
retire next July after 38 years with the group.
Mr McClean originally joined the advertisement department and became the
first advertisement director to reach the FT board, later taking
responsibility for circulation sales and marketing as well as advertisement
sales. He subsequently became managing director.
He developed the 'No FT . . . no comment' slogan and was one of the guiding
spirits behind the newspaper's expansion programme from its first printing
in continental Europe to the US and Japan.
Mr David Palmer, chief executive, said yesterday that Mr McClean had told
him some time ago of his intention to retire in his mid 50s and to do
something completely different.
'While I shall greatly miss the breadth of his experience and the depth of
his support after his departure, I am delighted that he will continue to be
with us for another nine months,' Mr Palmer said.
Mr David Bell, now advertisement director, will become managing director of
FT Newspaper next July. He will be responsible for the FT's day-to-day
operations and for its financial performance. Mr Tony Blin-Stoyle will
become advertisement director.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Cost of some calls abroad set to fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHARGES FOR phone calls from the UK to Australia, Canada and Sweden are
expected to fall following the government's announcement yesterday of more
competition on these routes.
A new form of competition, known as simple resale, will allow operators to
lease international circuits in bulk from British Telecommunications and
Mercury Communications and resell services.
Customers will be able to access the resellers' services via the public
telephone network - that has not been permitted under the more restricted
form of resale allowed since last year.
Simple resale is expected to be an economic proposition because prices of
international calls are considered to be well above costs in spite of
pressure from regulators which has resulted in significant cuts.
Large business users are expected to be the main beneficiaries. But there
could be a knock-on benefit for domestic customers if BT and Mercury cut
their charges in response to competition.
The Department of Trade and Industry has so far authorised only Australia,
Canada and Sweden for simple resale competition because it believes that no
other country has a sufficiently open regulatory regime for international
communications.
But Mr Edward Leigh, the trade and technology minister, said he hoped he
would be able to open up more routes to competition.
Industry analysts believe the DTI will authorise resale to the US - the
busiest destination for international traffic from the UK - after a meeting
to be held next month by the US regulatory authorities at which relaxed
regulation on international competition is likely to be agreed.
Australia and Canada each account for 3 per cent of the UK's outgoing
international traffic while Sweden accounts for 2 per cent, according to the
London-based International Institute of Communication. The US accounts for
19 per cent.
The DTI said it had awarded the first licence for international simple
resale to ACC Long Distance, a US company which plans to start a service to
Canada in the first quarter of next year.
Four other companies which plan to provide international resale as well as
domestic services - Ionica, WorldCom International, National Network and
Millicom - are also having licences to resell services processed.
Expectations of increased competition in international telephone traffic
affected the share price of Cable and Wireless, the telecommunications
group, which has substantial international business.
The shares dropped 5 per cent to close at 582p.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Rolls-Royce drops plans for new model
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROLLS-ROYCE Motor Cars, the loss-making subsidiary of Vickers, has been
forced to postpone indefinitely the costly development of a generation of
new models in the face of mounting financial problems and Vickers' failure
to find a 'strategic partnership' for the troubled business.
According to Sir Colin Chandler, Vickers' chief executive, the company had
made 'intensive efforts' to find a partner for the Rolls-Royce Motor Cars
operations.
It had failed to make any deal, however, most importantly because of the
'continuing uncertainty' of the business.
Sir Colin said that Rolls-Royce Motor Cars would be unable to press ahead
with development of a new model generation in the present business climate,
but would seek to 'evolve' its present cars.
The latest round of 950 job cuts announced this week for its Crewe plant are
aimed at reducing the company's break-even level to around 1,400 cars a year
from 2,800 in 1990. Sales of Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars have plunged from
a peak total of 3,300 in 1990 to 1,723 last year, and are forecast to total
between 1,250 and 1,350 for the whole of this year.
'Our policy for this business is to continue to make use of the brand name
and trade from this new break-even level,' said Sir Colin. 'We will try to
sell profitably from that level for the next two to three years. We will
continue product development on an evolutionary basis. We think that will
work. There is an awful lot of customer loyalty.'
He said that Vickers had reached 'a fair bit of depth' in negotiations with
'one or two partners', but there had never been 'a concrete figure offered'.
The most serious discussions have been with BMW of Germany.
Postponement of the development of a new product generation is a serious
setback for the company.
The company had expected that the present Rolls-Royce/Bentley chassis
platform would be replaced early in the second half of the 1990s. That would
have maintained its present 15-to-17-year model life cycle, which is two to
three times the industry norm.
Sir Colin said would-be partners also faced problems in their own luxury car
businesses. 'It is the wrong time to be trying to negotiate a partnership,'
he said. He expected further negotiations, however. 'It has not gone away.
When markets come back, I am sure that negotiations will resume.'
Vicker was no longer 'actively trying to sell' the Rolls-Royce business,
however. Sir Colin said: 'We think we can run it profitably.'

FT  26 SEP 92 / Contemplating a gamble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR EDDIE JONES has a sheaf of papers on his living-room table. They are the
details of a suggestion from Rolls-Royce Motor Cars that he take voluntary
redundancy.
He is one the 950 people Rolls-Royce would like to see depart by the end of
the year. 'I think I will be tempted to go,' he said. 'It's a bit of
gamble.' A bit of a gamble financially, because there are not many jobs
available in Crewe, Cheshire, which has long been the Rolls-Royce company
town.
In a reversal of the usual pattern, he will be following in the footsteps of
his sons, now both in their 20s. They were both Rolls-Royce apprentices: one
took voluntary redundancy, the other was made compulsorily redundant.
Mr Jones continually referred to Rolls-Royce as 'we'. Old habits will die
hard for a man who has spent nearly 30 years in two spells with the company.
'I was just 20 when I went into Royce's for the first time,' he recalled.
'It was a hive of activity then. There was a lot more built in-house. I went
in prepared to take anything.'
The style of management has changed over the last few years. 'They're
treating us like mushrooms - keeping us in the dark and feeding us bullshit.
'The whole atmosphere in the factory when I first started there was totally
different. . . you could get hold of a manager and he knew something about
it (the way the car worked and how it was put together). They've got this
theory now that managers are there to manage men and not to manage the job.
It doesn't work. You get people coming in from outside - from all sorts of
managerial jobs - and they just don't know the product.'
Once, he said, people were proud to work for Rolls-Royce, but the recession
seems to have taken its toll on morale. 'The way we've been treated over the
last couple of years, the loyalty is just not there any more. It's just a
place to go and earn money.'

FT  26 SEP 92 / Ford warns of over-capacity in the UK
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ford, the leading UK vehicle maker, has warned union officials that it has
too much capacity in the UK.
The company has told white-collar unions that 62 salaried jobs must be cut
in the UK in addition to the 1,487 hourly paid jobs that are to be cut by
the end of the year.
Sales of its Fiesta and Escort/Orion cars and light vans were forecast 'to
remain low', said the company.
It has warned the unions that if it did not take action 'this reduced demand
would lead to . . . a worsening cost position which would put at risk new
product and other investment programmes'.
Ford is cutting capacity at its assembly plants in Dagenham, east London,
and Halewood on Merseyside by around 20 per cent, and production levels at
its component plants will also be affected.
It warned that 'the situation could deteriorate even further' forcing the
company into more cutbacks.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Visit aims to ease Sellafield fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNION OFFICIALS at the Sellafield reprocessing plant in Cumbria will meet
other trade unionists and ministers when they visit the Irish Republic on
Monday.
The three-day visit, funded by the GMB general union and British Nuclear
Fuels, the state-owned operator of the plant, is part of an attempt to
counter opposition from the Irish Republic to the reprocessing plant.
Five officials from the GMB, the largest union at Sellafield with 3,000
members, will meet union officials and politicians from both sides of the
Irish border.
The Sellafield delegation includes a shop steward from the complex which
controls discharges of cooling water with traces of radioactivity into the
Irish Sea.
The aim of the visit is to achieve a better understanding of grassroots
Irish opinion on Sellafield and to correct mis-apprehensions. 'There's been
a lot of misinformation given to them,' said Mr Nick Johnston, GMB branch
secretary.
Mr Johnston said he did not believe the delegation was taking on
management's job of disarming opposition.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Prime ministers set 'final' deadline for Ulster talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TALKS on Northern Ireland's political future were given a 'final' extension
of seven weeks by the British and Irish prime ministers yesterday after they
reached a compromise to avert the collapse of the negotiations.
Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds managed to resolve a dispute between
the two governments over the timing of the next Anglo-Irish
inter-governmental conference - which unionists have insisted will mark the
cut-off point for the separate talks on Ulster. The conference, originally
expected next week, will now be held on November 16.
The deal gives a breathing space for participants in the Ulster talks, who
include representatives of the British and Irish governments as well as
unionist and nationalist leaders. But it does nothing to lessen the
compromises that will have to be made by all sides if an agreement is to be
reached.
So far any agreement on how Northern Ireland should be governed is at best
sketchy. Unionists remain concerned about the republic's constitutional
claim to the province and the Rev Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party
has withdrawn from the talks until the claim is on the table for discussion.
It is not clear if he will return when talks resume in Belfast on Wednesday.
But Mr Peter Robinson, deputy DUP leader, last night said it was up to
Dublin to take some 'realistic' action over its constitution if the talks
were not to fail before the dealine the Irish had 'openly and publicly' set.
Mr Major and Mr Reynolds became embroiled in the row after British and Irish
ministers failed to reach agreement in Dublin earlier this week. The two
prime ministers agreed there would be no more extensions to the Ulster
talks.
The Irish government sought an early date for the inter-governmental
conference, fearing that otherwise the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement, under
which the meetings are held, would be devalued. However, unionists insisted
that the separate Ulster talks could not continue once it was reactivated.
They demanded suspension of the Anglo-Irish pact before they would begin
talks.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Ill-health spreads in wake of explosion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PUBLIC HEALTH authorities have been notified of 129 people developing
various symptoms of ill-health after Monday's fatal explosion and fire at
the Hickson and Welch chemical plant in Castleford, West Yorkshire.
Most of those affected are Hickson staff, firefighters and other members of
the emergency services involved in the accident. Their symptoms include eye
and skin irritation, breathing problems, nausea and vomiting. Three workers
in the plant were killed and 14 injured directly.
Wakefield Health Authority is also contacting members of the public 'who may
or may not be connected to the incident and who have reported similar
symptoms'.
Dr Alison Evans, the authority's public-health director, said last night:
'The possibilities of a chemical or infectious agent, or both, being
responsible for these symptoms are being actively investigated, and nothing
has been eliminated from the inquiry at this stage.'
But Dr David Fyfe, Hickson and Welch managing director, said tests had shown
no evidence of chemical poisoning as a result of the accident. Dr Virginia
Murray, a toxicologist from Guy's Hospital, London, who is investigating the
symptoms, believed they were consistent with a gastro-intestinal infection
such as food poisoning.
One possibility is that large amounts of dirty water from the River Aire,
sprayed on to the site to put out the fire, could have spread infection.
Meanwhile the company is continuing to investigate the cause of the
explosion with the Health and Safety Executive.
The only parts of the factory damaged on Monday were the nitrotoluene
distillation column where the fire started and an adjacent control room and
office block. Production of other chemicals had returned to normal, Dr Fyfe
said.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOSTER'S LAGER, the UK's number two brand, has produced and paid for cinema
advertisements which are devoted mostly to another product.
The first 40 seconds of the 60-second advertisements, now running in London
cinemas, are devoted to Haagen-Dazs ice cream. The two brands are owned by
different companies.
The advertisements appear to contravene what has been regarded as a basic
law of brand-image advertising - to get your product noticed early and
often.
The advertisement shows a semi-naked couple eating Haagen-Dazs ice cream.
The man goes to the refrigerator and chooses a can of Foster's lager instead
of more Haagen-Dazs. The background music is replaced by a televised
football commentary. The woman disapproves.
Foster's motivation for the advertisement is to be associated with success.
The UK standard lager market has been eclipsed by the success of premium,
up-market brands. Haagen-Dazs - owned by Grand Metropolitan - has won a 20
per cent share of the UK dairy ice-cream sector since it was launched last
year.
Mr Jeff Dale, marketing controller for Foster's, said: 'We needed to hit
people between the eyes'.
Foster's spends Pounds 16.5m annually on marketing the brand in the UK. Its
joint advertisement with Haagen-Dazs will run in cinemas until Christmas.
'The Foster's drinker is a person who shows a no-worries attitude to life,'
said Mr Dale.
'We show the drinker in a no-worries situation. The good thing about cinema
advertising is that you have a captive audience of 18-to-35-year-old
drinkers.'
Haagen-Dazs is happy with its free advertising: 'It's important in terms of
setting the scene that people do believe for 40 seconds that it really is a
Haagen-Dazs ad, and the consequence is that we get a free show,' said Mr
Justin King, managing director of Haagen-Dazs UK. 'Spoof ads as a genre are
well-understood by the UK consumer.'

FT  26 SEP 92 / Deal near on extra BSkyB channels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television broadcaster, is close to
a deal that would bring at least three more television channels within a
single subscription package on the Astra satellite system.
The deal would involve scrambling and then charging for Sky One and Sky
News, the two remaining Sky Television channels for which no charge is made.
The three new channels that would go on Astra if the deal is completed are
Discovery, a channel based on documentaries; Bravo, a classic film channel;
and The Children's Channel. All come under the banner of United Artists
Programming.
The aim would be to create a new subscription package for viewers which
would contain at least five channels and which would cost perhaps Pounds
2.99 a month.
The new method of charging would be introduced in a year and would mean that
the pattern of satellite television would resemble cable television where
customers buy a basic package of channels and can then chose individual
premium channels such as those showing recent films.
It is possible that UK Gold, the new general entertainment channel soon to
be launched by Thames Television and the BBC - which is backed by Cox
Enterprises of the US - could also join the new package. However, talks on
that are believed to be less advanced.
The deal would allow other cable and satellite channels to use the existing
'smart card' charging system developed by Sky. The new policy is also a
recognition that, although satellite channels are interested in advertising
revenue, subscription revenue is always likely be more important.
BSkyB is a consortium in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a
significant stake.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Rifkind limits role of Bosnia troops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE JOB of the 1,800 British troops being sent to Bosnia-Hercegovina will be
to escort relief convoys and not to establish 'corridors of safety' through
areas under bombardment, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, assured the
Commons yesterday.
He confirmed that their primarily humanitarian role, carried out under the
authority of the United Nations, would be escorting convoys to areas hardest
hit by the conflict resulting from the break up of Yugoslavia.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, who opened the debate, led MPs from
all parties in condemning the atrocities inflicted on civilians in Sarajevo
and other centres.
Mr Hurd, expressing a personal view, maintained that military action by land
or air against those responsible would have been 'morally justified', but
acknowledged that the most likely outcome would have been increased
casualties and not an end to the conflict.
He suggested that further efforts should be made to secure agreement in the
UN for a ban on all military flights over Bosnia-Hercegovina - which would
significantly restrict the activities of Serbian forces. 'We are considering
what kind of 'no-fly zone' would make sense.'
A warning by Mr Tom King, the former defence secretary, about the dangers
which would arise from any escalation of the role envisaged for British
troops was strongly endorsed by Mr David Clark, shadow defence secretary.
Mr Rifkind emphasised that the task of the British troops would be to escort
convoys carrying urgently needed medical and food supplies. They would also
escort detainees released from internment camps.
Mr Rifkind emphasised that the task of establishing safe corridors would
require the deployment of manpower on a scale 'vastly greater than at
present contemplated'.
In military terms it would amount to a commitment 'far more substantial and
worrying' than would be appropriate.
The minister confirmed that the rules of engagement applying to British
troops would ensure that they were able to defend their lives and the lives
of those for whom they were responsible.
Mr Hurd made a cautious response when urged to authorise the release of
Iraqi assets held by Britain to secure the release of British subjects
imprisoned in Iraq.
He described the sentences imposed on Mr Paul Ride and Mr Michael Wainwright
for minor immigration offences as 'grotesquely severe'.
Mr Hurd explained that the release of assets subject to claims by British
interests could lead to 'quite serious trouble' and would be a difficult
road to tread.
Mr Michael Meacher, shadow minister for overseas development, who has
recently visited the famine areas in Somalia, called for more decisive
action to relieve hardship there.
He said Britain should use its positions as president of the European
Community and a permanent member of the UN security council to press for the
deployment of 10,000 to 20,000 troops to secure supply depots and
distribution lines against brigands.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA'S Congress has approved the privatisation of the national oil
company Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales (YPF) ending one of the most acrid
political disputes since the adoption in 1989 of radical free market
policies, John Barham writes from Buenos Aires.
After more than a year of wrangling, the government won the vote only by
distributing patronage and political favours in grand style.
YPF is the largest company in Argentina - reporting 1991 sales of about
Dollars 5bn - its oldest state company and the centre-piece of the
state-controlled economy that the government of President Carlos Menem began
dismantling after coming to office in 1989.
Argentina will now become the first Latin country to sell its oil company, a
move still resisted even by the free-market trailblazers, Chile and Mexico.
Provincial governments will receive 39 per cent of YPF equity to cancel
debts owed by the federal government and 10 per cent will be held in trust
for the employees. Then, the government will begin selling off its 51 per
cent stake in tranches on the local and international financial markets.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE International Monetary Fund (IMF) took a step towards its goal of global
membership this week as the republics of the former Soviet Union lined up to
sign the Washington-based institution's articles, George Graham writes from
Washington. But the IMF's 173rd and newest member is a republic of much
older vintage: the tiny mountain enclave of San Marino.
San Marino has something in common with Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and
Azerbaijan, which just beat it to the tape in signing the IMF articles. From
1978 to 1986 it boasted the only communist government in western Europe, and
earlier this year, it ousted the former Communist party, which changed its
name in 1990 to the Progressive Democratic party, from the governing
coalition.
Unlike the former Soviet republics, however, San Marino's economy seems
unlikely to cause many sleepless night for the IMF staff.
Mr Clelio Galassi, secretary of state for finance and the budget, says the
government's finances are in balance, with no public debt - the first tenet
in the IMF's economic doctrine.
Nor does Mr Galassi expect to have to borrow from the Fund.

FT  26 SEP 92 / US pollsters seek clues from the past: Truman and Major won
from behind; why can't Bush?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNOR Clinton never really had much of a chance in the election of '92.
He was a bit parochial, inexperienced and taking on a reasonably popular
incumbent. Some southern and border states liked him, but it was never
enough.
That Clinton was George, the Democratic-Republican governor of New York, the
year was 1792, and his opponent was Vice President John Adams. Clinton later
served two terms, from 1805 to 1812, as vice president, but the precedent of
200 years ago does not run much beyond the coincidence of surnames and
gubernatorial jobs.
More recent precedents are being sought for this year's race. Since the war,
five seem particularly popular points of reference - the US elections of
1948, 1976, 1980 and 1988, and the British election held last April. Each
hold hope, in some cases embraced by both President George Bush and Governor
Bill Clinton, for this year's outcome.
Mr Bush has made much of the 1948 comparison with Harry Truman's
come-from-behind victory over the complacent Governor Thomas Dewey,
forgetting that Truman was a Democrat and the 'do nothing' congress that was
the object of his discontent was run by Republicans.
But the wind was taken out of that proposition by some acid comments by
Margaret Truman Daniel, the late president's daughter, who could find
nothing in common between her down-to-earth father and the patrician Mr
Bush. Equally, Mr Clinton has also invoked the memory of Truman and, though
he may be nervous about his current lead, he is not acting complacently.
1976 has messages for both sides. The obvious comparison is between a
southern technocratic Democratic governor, not initially well known,
starting the home stretch well ahead of an incumbent, though unelected,
Republican president but in the end managing only a narrow victory. With,
presumably, a debate again in the offing, it is salutary to remember
President Gerald Ford's critical mistake in a San Francisco debate, about
Soviet hegemony over Poland, because he was at the time catching up fast.
In 1980, Mr Carter had a Middle East triumph (Camp David) under his belt but
was not generally well regarded and was saddled with the hostages in Iran
and an economy in a mess, all of which except the hostages apply to Mr Bush
today. But that race was very tight (which this year's is not at present)
until the only debate of the campaign, in which Ronald Reagan decisively
reassured a sceptical public that he was not as extreme as some of his
statements implied. Mr Clinton could nail down this victory in debate in
similar fashion.
The lesson of four years ago is principally that character assassination can
work. But the hatchet job on Mr Michael Dukakis was launched not long after
the Democratic convention, whereas this year the Bush campaign, for all its
assault on Mr Clinton over the draft, has been tardy in coming up with the
same sort of tightly focused, negative attack advertising.
The difference is that Mr Bush might have won anyway in 1988, when the
objective circumstances of the election, especially the state of the
economy, were far more favourable to him. Also, Mr Clinton may be an easier
target on personal grounds, but is much more resilient and combative than
the passive Mr Dukakis.
Much has been made of this year's British precedent. The principal
attraction, from a Republican standpoint, is that both the polls and the
media, which had freely predicted a Labour victory, were confounded.
However, the British election featured more than two main parties, which,
unless Ross Perot gets back in with a vengeance, is not a complication in
the US.
However, there are other points of comparison. Both economies were
performing badly; both incumbents led parties in power for over a decade;
both opposition leaders had dragged their leftish parties into the centre
and had policy proposals to 'soak the rich' through higher taxes.
On the other hand, Mr John Major was a relatively new face, which President
Bush is not, while Mr Clinton is and Mr Neil Kinnock was not. Mr Clinton has
also had the wit to set his plans for higher taxes, whatever Republicans may
charge to the contrary, at a far higher income level than the British Labour
party.
Still, in painting Mr Clinton as 'a social engineer' educated in that cradle
of foreign socialism, Oxford University, Mr Bush is borrowing a leaf from
the Tory book, while conveniently not mentioning that both he and Mr Clinton
also attended Yale. The name of the game is to scare the more affluent
suburban populace about the challenger. In the British case, targeting the
south of England, it worked, but the US is a much bigger place.
A common thread of the US electoral comparisons is the insider-outsider
contrast. Harry Truman, though president, campaigned in part against the
Washington establishment, as did candidates Carter and Reagan and Vice
President Bush.
Though he has spent the last 26 years on one government payroll or another,
Mr Bush this year is also running against Washington, not only its Democrats
but even its civil servants, whom he heads and whose pay he would cut if he
does not fire a third of them. Mr Clinton, however, is a believer that
government can, and should be, good. He may have started his long run as an
outsider but he increasingly looks like the reverse, not surprisingly since
government, though not in Washington, has been virtually his only career.
The final point of comparison is the state of the economy in the election
years. Some economists, such as Professor Ray Fair of Princeton, have
political models which show that economic performance is always the greatest
determinant in presidential elections. Until the summer, most of them tended
to point to Mr Bush's re-election.
In 1948, the state of the economy was not a decisive millstone for President
Truman. In 1976 the US was emerging still slowly from the 1974-75 recession,
enabling Mr Carter to coin the term 'misery index' (the sum of inflation and
unemployment) - which Mr Reagan tellingly turned against him in 1980, when
it had doubled. Four years ago, the expansion was still proceeding. This
year recovery remains a mirage, as it was in Britain in April, and still is.
In 1792, of course, nobody had the nerve to run against George Washington.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Sarajevo airlift suspension stays: Resumption of relief
flights must await assurances on security
</HEADLINE>

THE UN yesterday said the suspension of humanitarian airlifts into Sarajevo
would continue. The announcement coincided with a fact-finding mission by
international mediators Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen to Banja Luka, the Serb
stronghold in northern Bosnia, amid escalating violence and reports of
ethnic cleansing.
In Geneva, UN aid officials said the airlift into Sarajevo could not restart
because governments believe conditions are too dangerous.
The suspension is preventing delivery of essential supplies and materials
needed to avert what officials fear may be thousands of deaths from hunger
and cold during the freezing winter months.
The 19 governments previously involved in the airlift say they want further
assurances on security from the warring factions in Bosnia-Hercegovina
before agreeing to resume relief flights. The flights to the Bosnian capital
were halted on September 3 after a missile shot down an Italian aircraft.
Mr Vance and Lord Owen travelled southeast from Zagreb, the Croatian
capital, to the Bosnian border and drove with Mr Radovan Karadzic, the
militant Bosnian Serb leader, to Banja Luka, 38 miles south.
The two men held private talks with local Moslem and Croat leaders. Their
visit followed allegations of a Serb massacre on August 21 of 200 Moslem men
and youths. Lord Owen, the European Community envoy, told reporters: 'We
want to find out what indeed happened.'
The reports said Serb police shot dead the Moslems near Travnik, 90 miles
south of Banja Luka, after they had been released from a detention camp.
During their brief visit to Banja Luka, run by some of the most militant
Serb nationalists, the mediators also met a Serb general and Mr Jovo
Kupresanin, the extremist mayor who is believed to have been involved in
reprisals against Moslems and Serbs opposed to his rule. The mission was
prompted by mounting concern over a spate of recent bomb attacks and
shoot-outs in the city and surrounding villages. Croats and Moslems make up
about 30 per cent of the area's population of 195,000.
Meanwhile, Belgrade radio reported fighting between Serb forces and mainly
Moslem Bosnians in Sarajevo and throughout much of Bosnia.
Leaders of the three Bosnian communities signed undertakings a week ago
designed to assure the safety of relief flights and convoys, but they have
not been acted on. The airport at Sarajevo remains a battle zone.
Ms Sylvana Foa, for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, said the future
of the airlift was still 'very much in doubt'. However, while recognising
the dangers to aircraft and crews, there was an urgent need to deliver
supplies to the 450,000 people trapped in Sarajevo.
Ms Foa said aid agencies had a maximum of six weeks to transport heavy
materials, such as plastic sheeting for shattered windows, to Sarajevo
before winter set in.
The extra 6,000 UN troops approved by the UN Security Council are not due to
arrive in the region for up to eight weeks. Ms Foa said UNHCR convoys
travelling on mountain roads from the Croatian port of Split were supplying
less than a quarter of Sarajevo's daily food needs of 200 tonnes.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Economic recovery in US falters: Figures show broad weakness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A CROP of economic reports yesterday made grim reading for the Bush
administration. Orders for durable goods, personal incomes and home sales
all fell last month, underlying the fragility of the sluggish US economic
recovery.
New orders for durable goods fell 0.1 per cent following a 2.7 per cent
decline in July, the Commerce Department said.
The weakness was broadly based, with declines in primary metals, industrial
machinery and electronics. The overall drop would have been larger but for a
4.2 per cent increase in the volatile transport sector.
New orders for non-defence capital goods - regarded as a reliable guide to
trends in private investment - fell 3.7 per cent, after a decline of 5.4 per
cent in July.
Personal income fell 0.5 per cent last month but the figures were heavily
distorted by Hurricane Andrew, which reduced rental incomes, damaged crops
and cut wages.
But for hurricane damage, personal income would have risen by 0.7 per cent
last month, officials claimed. Personal consumption spending fell 0.1 per
cent last month, before allowing for inflation, underlying the weakness of
consumer morale.
The housing market also remains sluggish. Sales of existing (as opposed to
new) homes fell 3.2 per cent last month, despite a decline in mortgage rates
to the lowest levels for 20 years.
Analysts remain apprehensive about the outlook for housing despite a report
this week of a freakish 10 per cent rise in housing starts last month.
Long-term interest rates have begun to rise again in recent weeks, forcing
up the cost of mortgages.
The Senate yesterday rejected President Bush's plan to allow Americans to
direct that 10 per cent of their taxes be used for deficit reduction, AP
reports from Washington. Opponents said it could shut down the federal
government.
The Senate defeated the proposal, advanced by Mr Bush at the Republican
convention last month, by 58 to 36.
'This is the magic potion that will destroy the federal government' by
requiring a new series of virtually across-the-board spending cuts every
year, said Sen Robert C. Byrd. He called the plan 'another brain-dead easy
fix that eviscerates our future'.
The chief sponsor, Sen Bob Smith, said if all taxpayers accepted Mr Bush's
challenge the Dollars 333bn deficit would be eliminated and the budget
balanced within five years.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Ukraine unveils fresh reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   KIEV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Ukrainian government yesterday unveiled its latest economic reform
programme amid acrimonious inter-ministerial quarrelling.
The plan, which industrialists and some government economists have attacked
as a reversion to central planning, is likely to meet even stiffer criticism
when the government asks for parliament's approval next week.
The programme was hastily revised this week in response to initial
objections but remains a patchwork combination of reformist and reactionary
measures.
The plan calls for an acceleration of Ukraine's stalled privatisation
programme and a reduction in the country's runaway budget deficit.
But it also heralds a return to centrally dictated prices and wages and
renewed administrative control over state enterprises, which account for 96
per cent of the Ukrainian economy.
The programme has come under fire from Mr Viktor Penzennyk, one of the
government's economic advisers, who characterised it as 'a return to a
centrally-planned economy'.
Ukrainian industrialists, enjoying a chaotic independence since the collapse
of the Soviet Union, are equally enraged.
'The programme is a return to the old order,' said Mr Valentin Landik,
manager of a refrigerator factory in the Donbass region. 'Once Moscow gave
all the orders. Now they wish to re-create the central planning system in
Kiev. The only difference is the bureaucrats in Kiev are even less competent
than those in Moscow were.'

FT  26 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Irish eyes are smiling at the punt
in their pockets
</HEADLINE>

   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IRISH national pride has undergone an unexpected and unprecedented boost in
the past week. Sterling's abandonment of the exchange rate mechanism has
meant that for the first time since the Irish punt broke parity with
sterling in 1979, the pound in an Irishman's pocket is worth more than one
in an Englishman's in London or an Ulsterman's in Belfast.
Players of slot machines on the Dublin-Holyhead ferries can finally feel a
stir of satisfaction rather than disappointment on discovering that the
jackpot payouts include mostly 10p and 50p pieces which have a harp and
'Eire' stamped upon them on them instead of the queen's head.
Neither will British Telecom any longer have to suffer losses on the tens of
thousands of Irish coins stuffed into its call-boxes every week.
But national pride has quickly been displaced by practical economics. While
everyone else around the world is still selling sterling, the Irish are
buying it faster than Dublin's banks can supply their branches.
According to Mr Larry O'Connor, a spokesman of Allied Irish Bank in Dublin,
one of the country's biggest clearing banks, 'there has been a 200 per cent
increase in demand for sterling in the past two weeks. Branches normally
stock up with foreign exchange on Monday for the week. Last Tuesday many had
already sold out of sterling.'
Similar reports have come from the other main clearing banks. Some branches
have had to ration their sterling balances, making maximum cash payments of
Pounds 200 over the counter.
Mr O'Connor said: 'Many people have been coming in off the street to buy
sterling, so we have endeavoured to look after our own customers first.'
Sterling was yesterday trading at around Pounds 1.04 to the punt, its lowest
rate ever against the Irish currency.
For many people planning holidays, weekend breaks on the mainland or
shopping sprees in Belfast, sterling's devaluation has added 10 per cent to
the available budget. Sterling has never been so cheap, and expectations of
a realignment of the punt have therefore fuelled an unprecedented demand.
At the Stena Sealink ferry group, which operates services from Ireland to
the UK mainland, an official said: 'There has been an appreciable upsurge in
bookings for our short-break trips in the past week. It could be as high as
double the normal level. We are also anticipating a increase in bookings in
the lead-up to Christmas as a result of the devaluation.'
Shopkeepers just across the border in Newry and Derry, Northern Ireland,
also report a surge in shoppers travelling up from the Irish Republic to
take advantage of their sudden once-off increase in wealth.
Foreign exchange traders in Dublin say there has also been a big increase in
sterling demand from businesses, as Irish importers seek to take out forward
positions in sterling. Some 40 per cent of Ireland's imports are sourced in
the UK.
Most people in Ireland therefore seem to be seeing Britain's distress as
Ireland's opportunity. As Mr Ian French, managing director of Hamilton
Osborne King, one of Dublin's leading estate agents, said yesterday, 'In
times of financial upheaval such as these, it is important to recognise the
opportunities that can be created. The current strength of the punt against
the sterling makes property prices in the UK an extremely inviting
opportunity for Irish investors and developers interested in the UK market.'
They might be well advised to move quickly, though. Money market rates
surged to 25 per cent in Dublin yesterday, 14.25 percentage points above the
base rate. The pressures for realignment are growing.

FT  26 SEP 92 / French prison officers strike ends: Paris rescinds
suspension notices
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S prison officers are set to return to work today after the French
government's offer of concessions yesterday aimed at ending their
fortnight-long industrial dispute.
The Justice Ministry has succumbed to pressure to rescind the suspension
notices against striking warders, the officers return to work.
The dispute has crippled France's jails since the murder two weeks ago of a
warder at Clairvaux during a shoot-out in which seven prisoners escaped. The
Clairvaux shooting, the latest in a series of violent incidents in the
over-crowded prison system, sparked demands from officers for more staff and
better protection against dangerous inmates.
Mr Michel Vauzelle, justice minister, immediately promised to review
staffing levels. But early last week, when the warders' unions broke off
negotiations, he exercised his right to suspend striking officers, who as
public servants have no right to stop work.
The dispute has weakened since its peak when it affected more than 140 of
France's 182 jails. However, riot police and military squads are still in
place at a number of prisons. There have also been intermittent go-slows and
demonstrations at jails where staff have already returned to work.
Throughout the protest the government has been embarrassed by television
footage of inmates rioting at strike-bound jails.
Yesterday's offer to scrap the suspensions has persuaded most of the
striking officers to return to work. Warders at Clairvaux will go back on
Monday. The main prison unions, including Force Ouvriere, have agreed to
resume negotiations over long term staffing arrangements. However, one
union, the UGSP-CGT, is still threatening to boycott the talks.
The French government has agreed to reform its controversial new driving
licence system which sparked the bitter lorry drivers dispute that caused
chaos on France's roads this summer.
Mr Jean-Louis Bianco, transport minister, yesterday confirmed that the
government intended to implement most of the recommendations of the Roche
Commission, which was set up to review the licence system.
The Roche proposals favour retaining the government's original concept
whereby drivers forfeit points from their licences for offences, but makes
the system more flexible by awarding between six and 12 points to each
licence with drivers losing one to four points depending on the severity of
the offence.

A ROW broke out yesterday over German plans to celebrate the 50th

Critics say the celebration on October 3 in the former rocket base of
Peenemunde is in poor taste, because the supersonic V2 killed thousands of
British civilians, while 20,000 concentration camp inmates died making it.
The organisers say the V2 - whose inventor, Werner von Braun, later headed
the US space programme - was 'the first step into space'.
Germans protested in May when Britain erected a statue to Gen 'Bomber'
Harris, who initiated the carpet bombing which destroyed Dresden and many

FT  26 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Spain considers easing restrictions
</HEADLINE>

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of Spain, chastened by the tremors in domestic equity and debt
markets that followed its reintroduction of capital controls to protect the
peseta, was yesterday considering easing the restrictions.
The impact of the measures was 'huge and far greater than we thought', said
Mr Luis Linde, director general of the bank's foreign department. 'This
allows us to introduce a degree of flexibility.'
From Wednesday domestic and foreign institutions trading in pesetas have
been required to match loans with an equivalent sum deposited, interest
free, at the Bank of Spain. This triggered the biggest fall in domestic
stock markets since 1986 and a 4 per cent drop in the price of the 10-year
government bond, whose yield rose by nearly a full point to 13.5 per cent.
'We were acting against speculators. The measures were brutal and we
recognise that a lot of other investors have been hit,' Mr Linde said.
Analysts said the effect owed a lot to misunderstandings among financial
instititions over the full impact of the measures, but that these were to a
great extent caused by the confused wording of the Bank of Spain's circular
announcing the restrictions.
Mr Linde said the measures would remain in force for 'as short a time as
possible, perhaps just a matter of days.'
Relaxations under consideration include exemptions for currency operations
dealing with imports or to balance company books and a lowering of the
obligatory deposit, proportional to amount of foreign currency held, that
domestic institutions have to make with the Bank of Spain.
Mr Carlos Solchaga, economy minister, meanwhile said Spain wanted to avoid
'at all costs' a two-speed Europe, but 'if there must be two speeds for
monetary union, then Spain must be be in the top speed.' He was speaking
after a cabinet meeting that approved a highly restrictive 1993 budget and
proposed a freeze on public sector salaries next year.

FT  26 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Stronger franc sees off danger of
more exchange controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STRONGER performance of the French franc on currency markets yesterday
suggests that the reimposition of capital controls in the European Community
is unlikely to spread beyond Spain, Ireland and Portugal.
Earlier this week, there were fears that the European Monetary System might
become dependent on controls for its survival as first Spain and later
Ireland and Portugal imposed restrictions to prevent funds flowing into the
D-Mark.
But yesterday, as the European Commission ruled that the three countries'
exchange control measures were compatible with European law, Italy denied
that it had any plans to follow suit. The apparent success of the joint
Franco-German intervention to preserve the parity of the franc sharply
lowered expectations that France would restrict the free movement of funds
beyond its borders.
Although European policy makers have been dismayed at the way large-scale
movements of short-term capital have undermined parities and government
policies in countries such as Italy, Britain and Spain, events over the past
week have done little to support the idea that exchange controls are the
answer to the problem.
The controls imposed this week have caused damage to the EC as a whole and
the countries that imposed them. Unless repealed soon, they could threaten
the EC's policy for creating a single market in Europe by the end of this
year.
The Spanish experience this week also served as a warning to other EC
nations. Spain's decision to force domestic banks to match loans to foreign
investors by depositing an equal sum, interest-free, with the Bank of Spain
sent the country's stock and bond markets into a tailspin on Thursday. The
stock market fell to its lowest level since early 1986 and government bond
yields moved to their highest ever levels.
According to Mr Gerald Holtham, chief economist of Lehman Brothers
International in London, the Spanish move probably made foreign investors
'just as cross' as if the currency had been devalued for a second time in
the crisis. As a result, the Spanish government will in future have to pay
foreign investors a risk premium to finance its deficits.
UK officials yesterday made clear that Britain would not re-impose foreign
exchange controls. This determination should act as a further barrier to the
spread of controls in Europe. The authorities in Rome and Paris are
conscious that London and Frankfurt would be the beneficiaries of any move
to impose controls.
Italy, for example, was studying whether to impose controls similar to those
introduced by Spain when the lira first came under speculative attack two
weeks ago.
According to senior monetary officials in Rome, the discussions were
overtaken by events and and the Italian authorites, bowing to market
pressure, opted for devaluation as 'the lesser evil'.
Opponents of capital controls received strong backing this week from Mr
Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund.
'Any step back to real controls is a step backwards, a regressive step,' he
said in Washington.
The US Treasury also made clear yesterday that the call by Mr Nicholas
Brady, the treasury secretary, for a study by the Group of 10 countries of
global capital flows and their impact on the world monetary system was not
intended to encourage the introduction of controls.
A senior US Treasury official said the US had been 'very sorry' to see Spain
and Ireland impose controls. Commenting on the proposed study, he said: 'We
want to look at the power of the markets and we need to know more about the
new instruments. But the study is not intended as a step towards
re-regulation and we would strongly resist any move towards the reimposition
of controls.'

FT  26 SEP 92 / Russia says its budget revenues are exhausted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

   MOSCOW, FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA's central bank warned yesterday that the country's budget revenues
were exhausted, largely because of a big fall in tax income. Foreign experts
in Moscow last night confirmed this.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister, told parliament on Tuesday that
the deficit was Rbs800bn - though the central bank said the figure was
Rbs950bn.
Mr Arnold Voinikov, the central bank's first deputy chairman, said yesterday
that either the government must tightly limit its expenses, or the bank
would be required to give it further credits which parliament would have to
agree. The central bank has had to finance the rapidly increasing deficit,
and is aggrieved that the government blames it for being the sole cause of
credit expansion.
He rejected the statement made earlier this week by Mr Gaidar that the bank
should concentrate only on financial policy, saying that a stable currency
was only possible in a stable economy and that 'if the bank closes its eyes,
as it is asked to do, to the fall in production, especially in those areas
producing necessary goods, then I for one will resign'.
Mr Voinikov also denied government claims that the bank had been responsible
for fuelling inflation because of unilateral granting of credits to
commercial banks and enterprises - saying that of the nearly Rbs1,400bn
injected into the economy in the past few months, all but Rbs76bn had been
spent by agreement either with the parliament or the government.
David Waller adds from Frankfurt: Dresdner Bank, Germany's second largest
bank, yesterday urged government creditors of the former Soviet Union not to
forgive any part of the debt outstanding when they meet next week.
Mr Bernhard Walter, a main board director of the bank, urged that banks and
governments should pursue a full rescheduling of debt over the long term,
but said that any debt write-offs would be 'counter-productive'.
Write-offs would deter badly-needed foreign investment, he argued, as they
had in Poland where creditor governments had forgiven part of outstanding
debts. Hungary had been more successful in attracting investment because it
was committed to repaying its debts, Mr Walter said.
He said that capital payments would probably be rolled over for another
three months following the expiry of the existing 90-day rollover on
September 30.
The Paris Club of government creditors is meeting the day before.
Mr Walter also reiterated Dresdner's call that interest payments on loans to
the former Soviet Union should be paid in roubles, on condition that these
roubles could be converted into holdings in property or other assets.
The total ex-Soviet debt is believed to be more than Dollars 80bn (Pounds
46.7bn), of which Dollars 6bn-Dollars 7bn is owed to private sector banks.
Although Russia and other republics are formally committed to meeting
interest payments, banks and governments received only Dollars 170m of a
total Dollars 1.2bn interest which was due in the first five months of the
year.

FT  26 SEP 92 / International Company News: Fortis and La Caixa join forces
in Spanish market

FORTIS, the Dutch-Belgian insurance and banking group, is to link with La
Caixa, Spain's biggest financial institution, in a Pta23bn (Dollars 217m)
deal to service the Spanish insurance market.
The deal is the latest in a series of cross-border agreements between
Spanish banks and north European insurance companies. It follows last
month's 'bancassurance' deal between Axa of France and Banco de Bilbao
Viscaya.
Spain will become the third principal European insurance market for Fortis,
which is jointly owned by Amev of the Netherlands and AG of Belgium.
'Our other European subsidiaries will remain and we will try to develop them
as well, but if we are talking about a third large country with premium
income comparable to the Netherlands and Belgium then we are now talking
about Spain,' said a Fortis spokeswoman.
She said Fortis and La Caixa, a Barcelona-based savings bank, would
concentrate on organic growth in Spain until it matched the Dutch and
Belgian operations, rather than looking for further acquisitions in Spain.
Fortis is to pay Pta23bn for its share in a new 50-50 joint venture which
will own 80 per cent of VidaCaixa, the Spanish bank's life insurance arm,
and 80 per cent of SegurCaixa, the non-life operation.
The balance of shares in VidaCaixa will be directly owned by La Caixa, and
in SegurCaixa by Fortis.
The two parent companies will also share ownership of AgenCaixa, the Spanish
sales organisation.
La Caixa, which is chaired by International Olympic Committee president Mr
Juan Antonio Samaranch, has been expanding into non-savings business
recently.
Fortis said yesterday that it would provide the expertise in designing life
and non-life products, while La Caixa would contribute its knowledge of the
Spanish market.
VidaCaixa's life insurance premium income for 1992 is forecast to exceed
Pta100bn, and SegurCaixa's non-life income should reach Pta5bn.
If two existing Fortis subsidiaries in Spain are added to the new holding
company then the combined premium income there should exceed Ecu900m,
(Dollars 1.2bn), compared with premium income of Ecu2.4bn from Fortis's
Belgian and Dutch operations.

FT  26 SEP 92 / International Company News: Olivetti losses deepen to
L93.4bn in first half

OLIVETTI, the troubled Italian computers group, deepened its losses to
L93.4bn (Dollars 74.6m) in the first six months of this year from L73.7bn in
the corresponding period last year, owing to the continuing turbulence in
the world information technology industry.
Sales fell by a further 5 per cent to L3,748bn from L3,943bn, while net
operating profits dropped by more than 23 per cent to L33.9bn.
In an attempt to strengthen its management team, the company announced the
appointment of Mr Corrado Passera, formerly managing director of the
L'Espresso publishing group.
L'Espresso is controlled by Mr Carlo De Benedetti's Cir holding company.
Mr Passera will become joint managing director alongside Mr De Benedetti,
who will continue in his position as chairman.
Olivetti shares fell in expectation of the news, announced after the market
closed, with a L33 drop to L1,682.
The company blamed the fall in earnings and sales on the continuing problems
in the computers sector caused by over-capacity and fierce price
competition.
Prices for personal computers had fallen by 40 per cent in the six months -
almost the same decline as for the whole of 1991, it said.
Although Olivetti, in common with other computer manufacturers, has been
cutting costs, the L188.9bn reduction in its cost base had proved
insufficient to counter the effect of falling product prices.
The company again stressed the strength of its balance sheet, and its
ability to ride out the continuing crisis in the industry.
Moreover, it repeated its strategy of meeting its problems by pushing
through a policy of reducing its break-even level and forging new alliances
with other complementary producers in order to reduce expenditure on
research and development and accelerate the time taken to introduce new
products.

FT  26 SEP 92 / International Company News: Telekom hopes for DM20bn from
partial flotation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
DEUTSCHE Bundespost Telekom, Germany's state-owned telecommunications
utility, hopes to raise DM20bn (Dollars 13.4bn) from a privatisation sale on
international markets, Mr Helmut Ricke, chief executive, said yesterday.
However, the flotation would not be possible before 1996 at the earliest and
less than 50 per cent of the company would be sold.
Unveiling a plunge into a DM124m loss for last year compared with a net
profit of DM1.25bn in 1991, Mr Ricke gave the first tentative details of a
privatisation plan which has been hanging fire for several years.
However, leaders of the opposition Social Democrat party have recently
abandoned their objections to the sale of state assets, and fallen broadly
into line with government plans for a wide-ranging privatisation programme.
This is also expected to include the state's majority holding in the
Lufthansa airline.
The results released yesterday were distorted by the inclusion in the
accounts for the first time of operations in eastern Germany and a tax
charge of DM317m, compared with DM70m last time, and increased transfers to
the federal reserves and 'equalisation' payments to cover losses in the
state postal and banking authorities.
While sales rose to DM47.2bn from DM40.6bn, operating profits edged down to
DM7.13bn from DM7.31bn.
Mr Ricke said the burden of investment in the east had brought Telekom to
the limits of its capacity. Last year it installed 550,000 new connections
in the former East Germany and invested DM5.5bn.
Total investment in the current year, when sales are expected to top DM50bn,
is expected to reach DM30bn, with around DM11bn being spent in the east.
Longer term, Telekom is aiming for sales of DM80bn in 2000 and a reduced
workforce which will help it achieve international productivity standards.
German carmakers expect production to decline in 1993 and export markets to
shrink, according to the German Automobile Association (VDA), Reuter
reports. However, the VDA said the industry's performance this year could
match or slightly exceed last year's record output.

IMASCO, the tobacco, retailing and financial services group, is succeeding
in turning round its Hardee's fast-food operation in the US after two years
of poor results.
Mr Purdy Crawford, chairman, said new management at Hardee's had costs under
control and had caught up with the competition in key marketing areas.
Hardee's is expected to record operating earnings of Dollars 100m in 1994,
in line with the best years of the 1980s.
Mr Crawford played down the potential impact of high loan-loss provisions by
Canada Trust, Imasco's financial services subsidiary, as a result of the
long recession.
Overall, he said, Imasco was 'on course for a year of good earnings growth.'
For the first half ending June 30, profit was equivalent to CDollars 1.21 a
share, up 16 per cent from a year earlier.

MR WENDELIN Wiedekin, currently head of production at Porsche, was yesterday
voted, with the unanimous backing of the supervisory board, as successor to
Mr Arno Bohn as chief executive of the luxury car company.
The supervisory board met yesterday two days after the surprise announcement
that Mr Bohn was leaving Porsche because of differences of opinion over
business policy.
Mr Wiedekin will take over the job from next Thursday.
Yesterday's statement gave no clue as to the business differences which have
led to Mr Bohn's departure, but it is likely that more comprehensive
explanations will be forthcoming from both Porsche and Mr Bohn next week,
after the latter has formally severed his ties with the company.
Porsche said also that as an export-driven company, its sales would be hit
hard by the appreciation of the D-Mark in recent weeks.
The previously agreed cost-cutting measures would be introduced as quickly
as possible, the brief statement said.
During the current financial year Porsche is planning to cut more jobs than
the 550 it shed last year.

FT  26 SEP 92 / International Company News: Stolzenberg denies Castor loan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR WOLFGANG Stolzenberg, the German-Canadian financier who controls Imry
Merchant Developers, a UK property developer, has strongly disputed evidence
of a CDollars 93m (USDollars 75.60m) loan to Imry, from a bankrupt Montreal
company, whose creditors face losses of hundreds of millions of dollars.
The row over the alleged loan to Imry has come to light with the collapse of
Castor Holdings, the Canadian company which is at the centre of a tangled
international property finance empire also controlled by Mr Stolzenberg.
Imry was taken private in a highly-leveraged deal in 1989. Mr Stolzenberg
last year bought out other investors as part of a restructuring in which
Barclays Bank increased its loans to the Imry group to more than Pounds 400m
(Dollars 680m).
Castor's creditors, who are mostly banks and wealthy individuals in Germany
and Switzerland, have raised numerous questions about the collapse of the
company, which specialised in high-risk mortgages and construction loans in
the US and Canada.
According to accounting registers reviewed in Zug, Switzerland, by auditors
Peat Marwick, the loan to Imry was channelled through Castor's wholly-owned
Rotterdam-based subsidiary, CH International (Netherlands) BV. Peat Marwick
acted as a 'co-ordinator' for Castor while the company was under court
protection earlier this year, prior to being put into receivership.
According to Peat Marwick, the registers also indicate that roughly the same
amount was deposited with Castor's subsidiary in Curacao by Bristol
Holdings, a company believed to be connected with Imry.
Peat Marwick has been unable to verify the legality of the documents it
reviewed. Its report was not cleared with Castor's management.
However, Mr Neil Stein, a Montreal lawyer representing Castor's directors,
said he has been assured by Mr Stolzenberg as well as various Imry directors
(whom he declined to identify) that 'they are unaware of any amount of money
being owed by Imry to Castor or any of its subsidiaries.'
Mr Stein said Mr Stolzenberg is drafting a letter to Castor's bankruptcy
trustee which will flatly contradict the Peat Marwick finding. Mr Stein said
he expects to receive further details next week of Mr Stolzenberg's dealings
with Imry.

FT  26 SEP 92 / International Company News: Pirelli reports profits
turnround
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PIRELLI, the Italian cables and tyres group, has returned to profit with net
earnings of L77bn (Dollars 61.5m) for the first half of 1992 after a loss of
L105bn in the same period in 1991.
However, the figures are not directly comparable with those for 1991 owing
to the change to historic from current cost accounting and the consolidation
of the accounts of some subsidiares on an equity rather than global basis.
Pirelli warned that 'the significant deterioration' in market conditions
would make it difficult to maintain the current earnings trend. While net
profits this year would 'foreseeably' be positive, the improvement would
essentially be due to extraordinary gains.
The upturn this year stems from both tyres and cables, confirming the
current recovery in the tyre industry after cut-throat competition in the
past. Pirelli's resources were further depleted by its abortive bid for
Continental, its slightly bigger German rival, which collapsed last year.
The profits turnround was due to heavy restructuring, with an 8.4 per cent
drop in staff to 61,465, cost cutting, improved productivity and lower
capital spending. Earnings were also boosted by substantial, but
undisclosed, capital gains on divestments.
Pirelli said its tyre and cable operations were close to break even at the
net level, implying that extraordinary items comprised all its interim net
profits. So far, three of the seven units of Pirelli's diversified products
division, which were put up for sale in 1991 to strengthen its balance
sheet, have been sold.
Pirelli warned of a 'difficult' second half for both cables and tyres, with
the boost from a devalued lira being countered by higher interest rates. But
it did not expect this month's currency movements to have 'major effects' on
its results.
Sales, adjusted for disposals, rose by 2.9 per cent to L4,252bn, with a
particularly strong increase in tyres.
Operating profits surged to L179bn from L170bn, in spite of a 30 per cent
rise in depreciation to L276bn under a revised policy for write-downs.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Exorcising the demons
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS WEEK the Bundesbank, the tabloid press and the speculators vied with
each other for pride of place in the government's new demonology, as
sterling plumbed further depths and Mr John Major shed the unfortunate
heritage secretary Mr David Mellor from his cabinet. Yet the weakness of the
government and its excuses were simultaneously exposed by the impressive
French attempt to tough it out with the markets. After massive intervention,
the franc was well clear of its floor in the exchange rate mechanism by the
end of the week. What it is, you might conclude, to have Chancellor Kohl and
the Bundesbank on side, though that is not a lesson that Mr Major and his
chancellor appear anxious to take aboard after their undignified exit from
the ERM last week.
A two-speed Europe was always implicit in the convergence criteria of the
Maastricht treaty. It is now likely to become more explicit, as the
Eurosceptics' pet demon Mr Jacques Delors hinted on Thursday, with a hard
core of countries moving towards monetary union. But at what cost to other
European aspirations, such as the Single Market?
One of the more striking financial developments of the week was the
re-introduction of exchange controls in Spain, Portugal and Ireland in
response to huge speculative flows. Yesterday officials in Brussels
confirmed that this did not contravene EC law. The wider worry, though, is
that if the measures prove other than temporary, they might be construed as
a serious blow to the 1992 programme in which the abolition of controls
played a key part.
Yet the countries that have chosen to retreat into this form of financial
protectionism are responding all too logically to the pressure of events.
The Bretton Woods system, to take an obvious parallel, did not operate
without exchange controls. They were an important prop in a fixed exchange
rate system where one leading country, the US, pursued its own monetary
policy without undue regard for the other participants. Unless the
peripheral countries were prepared to accommodate the policies of the
central country, they needed the protection of exchange controls to prevent
speculators exposing divergences in policy.
Early warnings
The ERM has operated on the same asymmetrical basis, with Germany occupying
the central role. Since early 1987 the member countries sought to avoid
realignments; and they were prepared to pursue that goal without the
exchange control prop despite warnings from prominent members of the banking
community about the potential difficulties.
It was easy enough to accommodate the policies of the Bundesbank for the
first four years of the experiment. But then unification substantially
raised the cost of doing so, as German fiscal policy loosened. Meantime real
exchange rate appreciation in Italy and Spain left the lira and the peseta
looking overvalued; arguments raged about the sustainability of the sterling
parity and the disinflationary thrust of the British government's policy in
a protracted recession.
One-way bet
After their heavy losses in the 1980s, the banks were initially reluctant to
run big speculative positions against the weaker currencies. But when it
became clear that intervention to support the lira was on a scale that posed
a threat to the German money supply, the bankers scented a one-way bet.
International fund managers who had invested in Europe on the assumption
that the ERM parities would hold felt obliged to hedge against devaluation
in the weaker currencies. And when it emerged that a slanging match had
developed between the British and the Germans, folk memories of a comparable
battle between the US and Germany before the Bretton Woods system collapsed
in the early 1970s suggested that there was risk-free money to be made by
taking on the central banks.
There are costs to Britain's exit from the system, even if the chancellor,
Mr Lamont, seems decreasingly aware of them. But those costs, happily, are
unlikely to include the nightmare envisaged by the trade secretary, Mr
Michael Heseltine, who sees Britain as a potentially less attractive place
for inward investment in the wake of the debacle. After the devaluation
Britain is a potentially more profitable place from which to attack the
European market and one whose domestic growth prospects have greatly
improved. Over the long term, flows of capital are driven precisely by
perceptions about the strength and weakness of the underlying economies.
The one thing that might lend support to Mr Heseltine's thesis is the
possibility that competitive devaluations and the reintroduction of exchange
controls will so blunt the political impetus behind the Single Market
programme that Europe itself might become a less attractive place for
outsiders to invest. It is a thought that Tory Eurosceptics should ponder
before inflicting further damage on a weakened government as it approaches
the European summit on October 16.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Man in the News: The Tories' chief whip - John Smith
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If Mr John Smith's rave reviews are to be believed, the ancient and all but
moribund art of parliamentary oratory may just be making a comeback,
rejuvenated by the unblinking eye of television.
Can Labour's fortunes be revived by similar means?
Until Thursday's emergency debate on the economy, the growing view among
commentators was that the Conservative party's civil war over Maastricht had
rendered four-times defeated Labour all but redundant.
The 'end of party politics' thesis, tacitly reinforced by the media's
increasing tendency to sideline Labour's spokesmen, had, instead, turned the
Tory Euro-sceptics into Her Majesty's government's de facto, if unofficial,
opposition.
But that is to reckon without the character and capabilities of the new
Labour leader: in short, the importance of being Mr John Smith.
Curiously, for a place that makes the unpredictable commonplace, nothing
that occurred in the Commons chamber this week came as much of a surprise.
Mr John Major made a virtue of the Dunkirk spirit and retreated bravely
under fire. Mr Smith proceeded in his debut as opposition leader to
demonstrate the formidable debating skills for which he has long been known.
With easy confidence, at times smiling, at others solemn, he raked the Tory
frontbench with a potent salvo of observations ranging from outright
ridicule, through wry sarcasm to withering contempt.
His chief charge was incompetence. Television audiences, not to mention the
Labour backbenches, witnessed the impact as his shots, mercilessly directed
at the hapless prime minister, found their mark.
Three times Mr Major took the unusual and risky step of rising from his
bench to interrupt his accuser. Three times the Edinburgh advocate ensured
that the prime minister was firmly returned to his seat like an unreliable
witness whom the jury at home could safely afford to ignore.
Mr Smith's demeanour at the despatch box appeared to intimidate his Tory
opponents from making any running with the most damaging charge - that he
had firmly backed continued ERM membership and opposed devaluation.
Long-time Commons' watchers claimed that, though it was a vintage
performance, Mr Smith has proved a more powerful prosecutor on previous
occasions. Many cited his celebrated demolition of Sir Leon Brittan during
the Westland affair or the debates where he left no less a figure than Mr
Nigel (now Lord) Lawson, whitefaced on the government bench.
But to Labour's foot-soldiers and, indeed, some Tories, such nit-picking did
not contradict the most salient fact: for the first time in 13 years - since
Mr (now Lord) Jim Callaghan stepped down from the leadership in 1979 - the
Conservatives now face a confident, heavyweight opponent.
With Labour's annual conference opening tomorrow in Blackpool, a reminder of
his debating skills is timely. Mr Smith's leadership was well past its
honeymoon phase by this week. Despite his crushing victory in the July
leadership election, critics within the party were suggesting that his
public appearances had been lacklustre if not 'laid back'.
Genuine fears existed among senior party figures that a less than adequate
debut in the Commons could trigger a return to factionalism, with the left
openly opposing the right-wing leader's stance on the European issues. Some,
not least his rival for the leadership, Mr Bryan Gould, were openly
suggesting that his firmly pro-Maastricht, anti-devaluation, anti-referendum
position was simply wrong.
But by raising morale this week, the Labour leader has guaranteed himself a
smoother passage at Blackpool than he might otherwise have expected. He has
also vindicated, in many minds, the cautious strategy that has drawn
criticism in some quarters of the party.
This 'softly, softly' approach has reinforced his supporters' claim that a
non-confrontational style of party management is also having an impact in
its highest forums.
Members of the national executive committee have remarked that Mr Smith's
interventions on policy issues have been restrained and understated,
lowering the tension that Mr Kinnock's 'back me or sack me' manner used to
generate.
'Neil was like a nervous street-fighter,' one NEC member recalls. 'Smith has
the confidence to say little and let things pass him by because he feels
secure about his arguments and positions.'
A similar message emerged from this week's shadow cabinet. First, the leader
listened patiently to the arguments of the pro-referendum minority. He then
pointed out why he disagreed, that a majority were with him, and the
importance of the principle of cabinet responsibility.
Calmly adding that, while he had welcomed a debate, it was now time to apply
that principle, he then asked if anyone disagreed? 'There was silence,' a
witness relates.
This behind-the-scenes example of what Mr Smith likes to call, in a
characteristically legalistic phrase, 'analytical reasoning and persuasive
exposition', has been employed to good effect elsewhere.
In an unreported meeting with senior union leaders 10 days ago, he swiftly
dispelled the potentially damaging impact of a speech Mr John Edmonds, the
GMB leader, made at the TUC conference, advocating devaluation. The Labour
leader simply explained that Edmonds' view was not the party line and
requested that the barons adjust their rhetoric accordingly. There was no
dissent.
Quietly too, Mr Smith has strengthened his grip on party policymaking,
ensuring that he will chair a new Joint Policy Committee that will, in
effect, filter out those deemed unhelpful on Labour's voyage back to the
polling booths.
None of this, of course, diminishes the mountain Labour has to climb. The
charges against Mr Smith, that he is a plodder, that he lacks imagination,
that he naively believes in the 'one last heave' solution to Labour's
electoral ills, are far from answered.
But the prime minister now knows that at every Question Time from now to the
next election, he runs the risk of playing the punchbag and handing Labour a
twice-weeky telly-opportunity for the evening news bulletins.
The end of party politics has been postponed.

In the 84 years since the first powered flight in Britain, there have been
few moments when one could feel confident about the commercial future of the
UK aircraft industry.
This is not one of those moments. On Wednesday, British Aerospace announced
half-year results so bad that the stock market wiped another 43 per cent off
the already depressed value of its shares.
In reaching that verdict, investors were stigmatising an entire industry:
BAe is the repository of the UK airframe industry's history, the inheritor
of the traditions of such companies as Hawker Siddeley, Gloster, de
Havilland, Blackburn, Armstrong Whitworth, English Electric, Bristol and A V
Roe.
Foremost among those traditions, alas, has been a persistent inability to
make money on the sale of commercial aircraft. The profits of BAe's military
sales are matched, with eerie precision, by the losses of its civilian
aircraft. 'For every Pounds 1 made by the military division, the civil
aircraft division loses 96p,' BAe said this week.
The contrast between the two arms of the business has rarely been so stark,
but it has always existed. The government's Plowden report of 1965, which
laid the foundations of the industry's current structure, summed up the
post-war story in mandarin's prose:
'British civil aircraft of the new generation of advanced jets have failed
in general, in spite of their technical qualities, to realise the commercial
expectations with which they were launched.'
That judgment is as true today as it was 27 years ago. BAe's half-year
figures tell the story: its 146 regional airliner lost Pounds 167m; its
turboprops Pounds 111m.
The stock market has tended to blame the company's recent poor performance
on the distractions offered by its acquisitions in the 1980s - a Dutch
construction business, a property developer, Rover cars. Sir Raymond Lygo,
BAe's managing director in the 1980s, says much of the trouble lies in the
attitudes fostered during four years in state hands in the 1970s.
But the roots of BAe's difficulties go back much further. In 1918, says the
economic historian Keith Hayward*, the British aircraft industry was the
largest in the world: 122 companies producing 1,250 aircraft a month. When
the war ended, such huge output was unnecessary. The government kept a core
industry alive by spreading orders out, job by job, among favoured
companies, 'the family'.
The industry remained highly fragmented; even when five companies merged to
form Hawker Siddeley in 1935, they retained their independent design and
production centres, each scrambling for the 'penny packets' of orders the
government offered.
As a result the industry had no expertise in mass production; when
rearmament was necessary, much of the manufacture of aircraft was farmed out
to other companies. Two-thirds of all Spitfires, for example, were built in
factories run by the Morris motor group.
Design - sometimes brilliant design - was the companies' raison d'etre;
there was no cadre of middle-level engineers, production managers and cost
accountants. There were design triumphs - the Spitfire fighter, the
Lancaster bomber, the Gloster Meteor jet fighter - but little attention was
paid to the mundane task of simplifying production. The Spitfire took 13,000
man-hours to build, while the Messerschmitt 109, its German rival, took
4,000.
As long as the government was prepared to pay for this style of industry
with cost-plus contracts, the companies could prosper. After the war,
however, with much of continental Europe's aviation industry destroyed,
British companies were poised to exploit the newly emerging market for civil
airliners.
One such attempt was the de Havilland Comet, the world's first jet airliner,
which made its maiden flight in 1949 and entered service in 1952.
Technically, the Comet was a success. Commercially, it was a failure - not
just because of two fatal crashes in its early years, caused by the
inadequate state of scientific knowledge about metal fatigue, but also
because it was the wrong size to appeal to US airlines, the largest group of
potential purchasers. The Boeing 707, a later entry, was the decisive
victor.
The pattern was already clear: military contracting made money, civilian
production - with the exception of the Vickers Viscount - lost it. Hawker
Siddeley, the only airframe maker to steer clear of civilian business in
this period, was twice as profitable as its rivals.
By the late 1950s, the government had decided to cut its defence spending.
It encouraged a series of mergers, creating two big airframe groups: British
Aircraft Corporation and Hawker Siddeley's aviation division. In the merger
process, said one participant, 'tough and astute tycoons' fought over
company names and fine print. 'But at the technical and engineering levels
it all took place with scarcely a ripple.'
Perhaps that was the problem. There were no technical ripples because the
individual centres of operations - 19 in BAC, 10 in Hawker Siddeley Aviation
 -remained intact, working on individual projects, among them the Concorde.
This was the industry on which the Plowden committee reported. It concluded
that the hope of competing with Boeing was already an empty one: 'We do not
think it will ever be worthwhile for a British manufacturer to embark alone
on a new long-range aircraft, or on any new aircraft that is particularly
large and complex.' Collaboration with overseas companies would be
necessary, the aim being to promote a European aircraft industry.
Most important, the industry was so hampered by second-guessing by the
government that only a degree of state ownership would allow it to
re-establish operational freedom. 'The majority of the committee feel that
over half the equity should be in government ownership to achieve this
purpose.'
Nothing came of this suggestion for another decade. In the meantime, the
emphasis on Concorde and the Jaguar strike aircraft squeezed out other
potentially worthwhile projects, such as an enlarged version of the BAC 1-11
airliner. There was one stroke of luck: BAC won a contract to supply
aircraft to Saudi Arabia, which has become, in later years, BAe's lifeline.
In 1977, the Labour government nationalised the airframe makers, merging
them to form British Aerospace. The new company joined the European Airbus
project, for which Hawker Siddeley had already been making the wing with
great technical success. By joining as a full partner, BAe opened itself up
to a share of Airbus's losses. And in making this decision, the government
rejected the less glamorous but arguably more commercial alternative of a
link with Boeing.
Though the change to a Conservative government soon took BAe back into the
private sector, there was little integration of the business. Sir Raymond
Lygo says that a policy of spreading work around the group's many sites -
the logical successor to the 'penny packets' of pre-war days - continued.
The 146 regional airliner, which Hawker Siddeley had cancelled in
pre-nationalisation days, had been reinstated during the state-owned years.
Decisions were made on internal political grounds: to keep the balance
between BAC and Hawker Siddeley. There was still a prevailing 'cost-plus'
mentality; and though in 1989 the civil side of the business made a profit,
it was clear that there was no crock of gold at the end of the rainbow.
With the military budget also under pressure, crocks of gold would have to
be found elsewhere: in property development, or in buying the Rover car
business cheaply from the government. These were the stratagems to which Sir
Roland Smith, chairman between 1987 and 1991, turned his attention. They
proved ill-timed: Arlington Securities, the property developer, was bought
at the top of the market; and Rover cars was not the bargain it appeared.
Both have been losing money recently.
With cash running short a year ago, a mishandled rights issue led to Sir
Roland's departure, and the arrival as chairman of Mr John Cahill, formerly
chief executive of BTR.
It was Mr Cahill's first set of interim results that the stock market
greeted in such a hostile fashion this week. His decision to take a Pounds
750m charge for reorganisation costs, coupled with a sharp deterioration in
the group's operating performance, left the market unhappy. Investors were
also nervous about a plan to solve the 146 problem by putting it into a
joint venture with Taiwan Aerospace.
BAe's future is unclear. So are the conclusions to be drawn from its story.
Is it simply part of the long decline of British manufacturing industry? Is
it a qualified success story now fallen on hard times? Or is it a
straightforward case of industrial mismanagement?
The long-decline theory relies in part on familiar arguments about a lack of
commercial culture among British engineers and of an engineering commitment
among British financiers. Britain had an over-sized aircraft industry at the
end of the war; it was inevitable that it would lose ground over the years.
Government policy interfered too much, or too little; at any rate, it was
unsatisfactory. Dedicated people tried hard; but there were bound to be more
defeats than victories.
The second view - that BAe has been a qualified success - stems from the way
that the group has been able to retain a range of design and project
management skills. The group remains a formidable repository of
technological depth.
Some of its products - such as the 125 executive jet - are commercial
successes; on the military side, it is highly competitive internationally,
as its continued ability to win business from Saudi Arabia shows. Overall,
the UK aerospace industry has been holding on to its world market share. BAe
remains a vital technical contributor to the Airbus, a European success
story. Temporary financial problems at BAe should not, on this argument, be
allowed to tarnish this.
On the third view, those achievements merely serve to emphasise the
management weaknesses of the company and, before that, of the industry. The
group as a whole has suffered from weak financial controls and has never
achieved the transformation to world-class standards of cost and quality
that Rolls-Royce has undergone. Its dependence on military business for its
profits has blinded the company to the need to design products to meet
customers' needs. Until Mr Cahill's arrival, the group was run by
administrators, or politicians, or engineers, or theoreticians - not real
businessmen.
All three views probably contain part of the truth. For anyone who grew up
with the Comet and the Meteor, however, all three contain mingled sadness
and frustration.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Urbane Brooke aims for patient progress: Mellor's unexpected
successor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN he was Northern Ireland secretary, Mr Peter Brooke once leaned out of a
large window overlooking Horse Guards Parade in London. He watched the
crowds dispersing in the fading evening light after a ceremonial display of
troops Beating the Retreat.
'Isn't that picture just like a Canaletto?' he asked the guests he was
entertaining.
Few at Westminster yesterday regarded the traditionalist, slightly-fogeyish
Mr Brooke, 58, as a natural choice as heritage secretary and the job of
overseeing the eclectic world of the arts. He has not deliberately
cultivated an image as a man of aesthetics.
His reputation is more as a gracious, if unremarkable, former Treasury
minister who fared badly as party chairman but somehow defied expectations
to bring Northern Ireland's feuding political leaders to the negotiating
table.
Mr Brooke nearly fell from the cabinet in January after singing 'Oh my
darling Clementine' on an Irish television chat show only hours after an IRA
bomb had murdered seven civilians in County Tyrone. He finally left the
cabinet for the backbenches after the general election - deliberately, in
order to contest the election for the Commons speakership, Downing Street
revealed yesterday. He failed in his bid.
But Mr Brooke's style of politics is not narrow-minded or ideological. He at
least tries to cultivate an artist's eye.
He interests are listed in Who's Who as 'churches, conservation, cricket,
pictures and planting things'.
Mr Brooke's greatest strength is probably his patience, exemplified by his
frequently protracted deliberations with Northern Ireland's political
leaders. His style is to persuade, not provoke.
He is unlikely, for example, to seek a confrontation with either the BBC,
whose future lies largely in his hands, or with the competing interests
anxious about the forthcoming national lottery.
Perhaps most surprising is the prime minister's decision to bring Mr
Brooke's back into his cabinet.
Although a senior Downing Street official described the two as 'old
friends', they are not political bedfellows. Mr Brooke is a conservative
with a small 'c' and gently paternalistic by character.
But Mr Major appears to have been impressed by Mr Brooke's performance at
the Northern Ireland Office. Mr Brooke is also loyal - any tension between
the two has never surfaced publicly.
To a prime minister facing a cabinet embroiled in near-public splits over
European and economic policy, a senior politician who can be trusted to back
the official line in areas outside his department is a valuable ally.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Divisions over Europe highlight Tory disunity: The PM's
possible strategy to avert fratricide within his party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS not the fault-lines in the European exchange rate mechanism which will
preoccupy Mr John Major this weekend. As he reflects on the past few
bruising days for his government, the prime minister's first concern will be
the fractures in his party.
It was Mr John Smith's forensic demolition of the government's handling of
the sterling crisis which caught most of the headlines. But it is the
simmering discontent - and implicit threat of revolt - from the Tory
backbenches which hold the real perils for Mr Major.
The careful Tory coalition for pragmatic Europeanism which he so
painstakingly constructed from the wreckage of Mrs Margaret Thatcher's
departure is beginning to crumble. The prospect that the Conservative party
could tear itself apart over Europe for the second time in two years can
longer be dismissed as fantasy.
It is too early to be apocalyptic. Just as it is possible to see the mines
strewn across Mr Major's path as he seeks to reconstruct credible policies
on the economy and Europe, it is possible also to see the escape routes.
Mr Major is at present shattered by the shock of the pound's retreat from
the ERM. Backbench MPs, dragged back from their holidays to be gleefully
derided by an opposition they trounced in the April election, are muttering
about the need for something called leadership.
In reply, ministers remind the critics that the prime minister has shown
little else, and that he has the political acumen and personal skills to
bridge the divisions in his own party.
But some of the mines look certain to explode. The succession of events
leading from the No vote in the Danish referendum on Maastricht through
sterling's departure from the ERM to the narrow Yes vote in the French poll
have proved a fertile recruiting ground for his party's Euro-sceptics.
Mr Major's achievement last year was to shrink the support for the
Euro-sceptics to a core group of about 20 to 30 irreconcilables. The
dissidents could then be branded a splinter rather than a split.
But the events of the last few months have swelled the numbers. More than 60
Tory MPs yesterday signed a Commons motion demanding the government abandon
any thought of a return to fixed exchange rates. The list, which may attract
another dozen or so names, provides a reasonable proxy of the strength
ranged against all things pro-European.
The prime minister has acknowledged that strength. The conditions set for
sterling's eventual return to the ERM reflect in part genuine anxieties over
how the mechanism works.
But they also reflect Mr Major's judgment that a decision to re-tie sterling
to the D-Mark before a recovery in the domestic economy is in place would
provoke a powerful revolt. So too does his decision in effect to postpone
the Maastricht ratification process until early next year.
So Mr Major is playing for time. His assessment runs as follows. The next
few months will see all of Europe's leaders struggling to find an
accommodation which brings Denmark back to the Maastricht fold. That may
prove impossible and the treaty will collapse, averting the need for a
confrontation in the Conservative party. If an accommodation is found then
it will be on lines - commitments to decentralisation and the disavowal of a
common defence and policy - which could help win back the 'soft'
Euro-sceptics.
In parallel, the relaxation of Britain's monetary policy should trigger the
economic recovery needed to restore more general confidence on his
backbenches.
It is credible strategy - and probably the only one. The question is whether
Mr Major will have time to implement it. While the pressure from his party
is to stall, if not to abandon, Maastricht, Mr Major's European partners -
including the German chancellor Helmut Kohl - are determined to press ahead.
What Sir Leon Brittan, EC commissioner, refers to as the 'recurring
nightmare' of an inner core of European nations making decisions which
profoundly affect the UK but over which the government has no influence has
returned.
It was that nightmare that prompted the Conservatives to ditch Mrs Thatcher.
It still horrifies prominent cabinet ministers such as Mr Douglas Hurd, Mr
Michael Heseltine and Mr Kenneth Clarke.
And, for all the noise now being made by the Euro-sceptics, the relegation
of Britain to Europe's second division is no more acceptable now to most in
the Conservative party or to the majority in the cabinet than it was two
years ago.
The enthusiasts for Europe are for now keeping their counsel in the hope
that Mr Major's strategy will deliver his party for the second time in a
year. The alternative is another civil war.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Serious river pollution cases decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of serious river pollution incidents in England and Wales fell by
41 per cent to 386 last year because of 'tough and rigorous control
measures', the National Rivers Authority said yesterday.
In its annual report the pollution watchdog said the total number of
pollution incidents in 1991 had been 22,469 - an increase of 8 per cent on
1990.
It blamed the rise in the total number of incidents on a 12 per cent jump in
the number of times sewage was reported to have leaked into rivers.
The NRA, created in 1989 ahead of the privatisation of the water and
sewerage companies of England and Wales, has won a reputation as a
confrontational regulator.
It carried out 356 prosecutions in 1991, and secured a conviction in 90 per
cent. Fines against offenders ranged up to Pounds 200,000.
Of the 'major' or serious reported incidents in 1991, a quarter were from
farm pollution, a quarter from sewage, 22 per cent from industrial, 20 per
cent from oil and the rest unclassified.
'Major' incidents are defined as those where there could be a persistent
effect on the water quality or where the conditions of licences for
discharging are breached.
One of the main reasons for the drop in major incidents was that the number
of serious farm pollution incidents fell 60 per cent from 239 to 99.
The Severn Trent region of the NRA covering central England, which includes
much agricultural land, had the highest proportion - 22 per cent - both of
total incidents and serious incidents.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Government cancels Pounds 75m relocation of prisons HQ
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday announced the cancellation of a Pounds 75m project
to relocate the headquarters of the Prison Service to Derby because of
public spending pressures.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, said that, faced with important demands
on resources to finance and equip the police and expand and refurbish
prisons, he would 'not be justified in spending large sums of money on a new
headquarters building'.
The government had intended to locate up to 2,000 civil servants in a new
450,000 sq ft building at St Mary's Wharf, Derby. About 60 per cent would
have moved from central London, Croydon, Birmingham and Corby, with the
remainder new staff recruited locally.
Contracts were awarded in the spring, and site work on what would have been
Derby's biggest office development had already begun.
Mr Clarke said yesterday 'tens of millions of pounds' would be saved by
cancellation of the project. However, the home office could not say what
cancellation charges the government may face by withdrawing at this late
stage.
Hyperion Properties, the main developer, said yesterday it was 'commercially
covered' against the cancellation. Directors of AMEC, awarded the Pounds 57m
building contract by Hyperion, will meet to consider the position next week.
Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, said he would demand a full
explanation from Mr Clarke. 'He must tell us whether it is true that over
Pounds 11m has already been spent on the project and he must publish full
details of any penalty clause.'
Mr Nick Brown, leader of Derby City Council, is due to meet Mr Clarke next
Wednesday and will urge him to regard the project as postponed rather than
cancelled. 'If the government decides to go ahead with the relocation in the
future, we should not have to go through the process of bidding for it all
over again.'
However, Mr Clarke's decision raises doubts over whether the project will
ever be revived, certainly on its current scale.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Markets with exotic appeal - Once
ignored, now they are in demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMERGING markets are one of the investment fashions of the moment. Hitherto
ignored areas such as Latin America suddenly are attracting international
investors.
There can be some disagreement about what constitutes an emerging market,
but these countries are found mainly in south-east Asia, Latin America and
southern parts of Europe. Their attraction is that economic growth tends to
outstrip that of the industrialised world, while their economies are being
liberalised and opened up.
As Fund Research puts it in a new report: 'Although emerging markets account
for 13 per cent of the world's GNP, and perhaps 80 per cent of the world's
population, their market capitalisation is only 6 per cent of total world
capitalisation and they probably represent only around around 0.5 per cent
of institutional investors' total portfolio holdings.'
For the private investor, the only real way of tapping the potential growth
of these markets is via a unit or investment trust. These fall into three
categories of fund; single country, regional and global.
Single country funds offer the riskiest ride. The markets can be very
illiquid, with managers able to buy only a few shares. In Colombia, for
example, 82.5 per cent of the market's capitalisation at the end of June
consisted of just 10 stocks.
If a unit trust manager is forced in such markets to sell shares to meet
redemptions, he might have to accept fire sale prices. This will affect
performance adversely. And whereas an investment trust manager can escape
these problems, the investor in such a fund can be faced with the alarming
swing from premium to discount.
Many single country funds, listed in London but based offshore, have had
particular problems with discounts. A recent analysis by Olliff and Partners
shows that the average discount in the sector is 35 per cent.
Regional funds offer the investor some protection against these problems but
are not immune. A region's markets can rise and fall together, even if
economic performance is not in sync. Fund Research says: 'Falls across Latin
American countries have given the appearance of a correlated decline,
whereas this effect was exacerbated by a general withdrawal of hot money
from overseas investors.'
The Latin American Investment trust was the best performer of all investment
trusts in 1991, but is down by 18.6 per cent over the year to September 1.
Global funds should, in theory, offer less volatility. While the individual
markets are highly volatile, research seems to indicate that a basket of
such investments is no more risky than a mainstream stock market such as the
UK. A basket of stocks should offer a better return, too.
Now, alarm bells ought to sound whenever someone claims they can achieve a
higher return at no extra risk. But enthusiasts claim emerging markets are
'inefficient, allowing you to pick up attractive assets at bargain prices.
On the other hand, a global fund manager has an enormous range of countries
and potential investments to analyse. The sheer scope of the task could be
defeating.
So, returns can vary enormously. There are six emerging market investment
trusts, of which the best performer over three years was Templeton, with an
impressive 70.4 per cent. But the worst performer, New Frontiers
Development, lost 28.1 per cent.
Among unit trusts in the field, the best performer has been Prosperity
Emerging Markets, which is second in the international growth sector over
five years with a rise of 27.6 per cent.
But private investors should remember that any equity investment involves
risk and should be entered only for the long term - which means at least
five years. Most experts would agree that emerging markets should represent
only a small proportion of a private investor's portfolio.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Deadline nears for BES relief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEADLINE for carrying forward BES tax relief from the last tax year is
October 5. The rules are complex but provide opportunities for those who did
not shelter any funds from tax last year.
Only half, at most, of any investment you make now can be carried back to
1991-92; even then, there is a limit of Pounds 5,000. Thus, if you invest
Pounds 5,000, only Pounds 2,500 can be carried back; if you invest Pounds
45,000, just Pounds 5,000 can be carried back.
This autumn's BES season has been overshadowed by the arrival of
non-recourse loans from banks which sponsor schemes. These have been of no
use to standard-rate taxpayers so far, but allow top-rate taxpayers to get a
return after a year.
But supplies of the two schemes offering such loans, sponsored by Close
Brothers and Johnson Fry, are now exhausted. Three more conventional
contracted-exit companies are still available; these are Accumulus,
sponsored by Terrace Hill Capital and with a bank guarantee from Standard
Chartered; Cavendish Wates, sponsored by Smith &amp; Williamson; and Airways
Assured II.
Scottish solicitor Neill Clerk is offering some more esoteric schemes.
Unchained Growth II has covenants from developer Laing Homes and managing
agent Graham Harvey - although not from any large financial institutions -
to pay Pounds 1.40 in five years for every Pounds 1.00 invested now.
Reversionary Gains IV is aiming to raise Pounds 2m to buy home reversions
from the elderly.
Meanwhile, a trading company called Spirit of 1992 is aiming to raise Pounds
750,000. The company will produce whisky on the Isle of Mull and aims to
wind up within six years. There are no guarantees, and trading companies are
inherently more speculative than property BES companies.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Doctors' dilemma on tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOCTORS may face a taxing problem. Since the beginnings of the National
Health Service, GPs have been classed as self-employed and taxed under
schedule D, even though some of their circumstances might suggest relegation
to the less generous schedule E.
Dr Joe Neary, a Cambridgeshire GP, experienced what he saw as a challenge to
the tax status of GPs when he applied for approval of a profit-related pay
scheme for his four employees. 'I got a negative response from the Revenue,
based on the argument that the enterprise of general practice is entirely
government funded,' he told a medical magazine, adding: 'I saw no point in
chasing it through the courts as this might be counter-productive if GPs'
schedule D tax status was questioned.'
Instead, Neary told the Financial Times, he went through his own political
channels. He made informal contact with Gillian Shephard, the employment
secretary who is MP for Norfolk SW. She confirmed what the Revenue had said.
The profit-related pay issue became academic for him as, in the event, his
first year in practice yielded far less than expected. But he says that if
he nets a profit next year of more than Pounds 42,000, the national intended
standard, he will pay staff bonuses reflecting their extra dedication. Since
his scheme will not have been approved, however, the staff will have to pay
tax on the performance-related payments.

Sears, the retailing group behind such names as Selfridges, Wallis, Dolcis
and Olympus, the most interesting number at Tuesday's interims will not be
the profit figure of about Pounds 20m before tax and exceptionals, but the
size of the latter item and the fate of the dividend. Opinion is split over
whether the 1.525p payment will be held.
Having sold the menswear division and warned of an accompanying Pounds 82m
extraordinary charge, Sears will probably deal with its other problem
division, footwear, above the line. One analyst estimated Pounds 40m to
Pounds 50m of exceptional costs for the restructuring of the British Shoe
Corporation.
Forte, the hotels group, announces half-year results on Thursday with City
forecasts ranging widely from pre-tax profits of Pounds 25m to Pounds 40m,
compared with last year's Pounds 42m. Attention will be focused on the
prospect of senior management changes. Although analysts do not expect any
immediate word on the possible retirement of chairman Lord Forte, the group
might announce the appointment of some non-executive directors.
Results on Friday from Amstrad, the electronics and computer company, are
expected to show a loss for the year to June 30 of about Pounds 70m. The
company's PC business, which provides it with the bulk of its revenue, has
been battered as the industry's major players have been engaged in an
all-out price war.
The company might cut or pass its dividend. Even if one were paid, it would
not dent Amstrad's Pounds 100m cash pile. However, given Alan Sugar's stated
interest in buying back the shares at 30p, and the expected size of the
company's loss, many analysts expect the dividend to be passed.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Making the most of investing abroad -
The best ways to take advantage of financial opportunities outside Britain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FALL in the pound's value has highlighted the attractions of overseas
investment for British investors. Not only is there the possibility of a
windfall gain in the case of a sterling devaluation, but overseas bond and
share markets often can outperform their UK equivalent.
So how does an investor venture abroad?
Currency funds
These invest in foreign currency money market instruments, and so offer a
return which reflects the general level of interest rates in the overseas
country. Earlier this week, for example, Rothschild's Deutschemark fund was
yielding 8.6 per cent, the peseta fund 11.86 per cent, and the dollar fund
just 2.23 per cent.
Caution is needed, though. There are no hard and fast rules in foreign
exchange markets, as the past few weeks have shown. But a good guide is that
the higher a country's interest rates, the weaker the currency. So, the
higher yield available from a peseta fund might easily be cancelled out by a
decline in the currency.
Conversely, those UK investors who switched into a dollar fund a few weeks
ago, when the exchange rate was Dollars 2 to the pound, had to accept a very
low yield. But they have already made a capital gain of around 17.5 per
cent.
Currency funds can be used to postpone tax, which is payable only when money
is brought back to the UK. So, money can be left to 'roll-up' within the
fund, compounding at the gross rate. An investor paying tax at the higher
rate, and who expects to retire in a few years, might use a fund to postpone
tax until he retires and drops to a lower tax band.
Bond funds.
Non-British investors traditionally have held a good part of their
investments in bonds, but the concept has been slower to catch-on in the
traditionally inflation-ridden UK.
The appeal of an international bond fund is that interest rates should fall
(and bond prices, therefore, rise) as the world economy tries to escape from
recession. The investor might also benefit from any depreciation in the
pound. Of course, the two effects could cancel out each other. Bond prices
might fall, even if the pound declines, and a bond rally could be offset by
sterling appreciation.
The long-term performance of such funds has been only moderate to date. The
nine funds that have been running for five years have achieved an average
growth (with income re-invested) of 19.9 per cent, a performance beaten
easily by a building society although far superior to international equity
growth funds.
But some experts believe that the 1990s will be the 'decade of the bond,' so
returns might improve (see page VI for fund launches in the sector this
week).
Equity funds
If you want to invest in overseas shares, you have a very wide choice. There
are 166 unit trusts in the international growth sector, a further 19 classed
as international equity income, 125 North American funds, 132 European, 88
Japanese, 106 Far Eastern and eight Australasian. In addition, there are 45
international investment trusts, 22 European, four North American, six
Japanese, 26 Far Eastern, and a further six concentrating on 'emerging
markets' (see article below).
But the caveat which applies to bond funds is even more apposite for
equities. Stock market movements can be both rapid and substantial - and can
wipe out a currency gain easily. A UK investor might have decided correctly
in August 1990 that the yen was due to strengthen against sterling. But if
he had backed that hunch with an investment in Japanese equities, the 40 per
cent fall in the Tokyo stock market would have wiped out his 15 per cent
currency gain.
The risks and rewards are greatest with a single country fund. The average
Australasian unit trust, for example, fell 40.1 per cent over the five years
to September 1. But the Gartmore Hong Kong fund showed an 106.7 per cent
gain over the same period.
A broadly spread international equity fund should reduce the volatility  -
although the 1987 crash showed that the world's major stock markets were
quite capable of all falling together. Indeed, international growth unit
trusts failed to live up to their name in the five years to September 1 -
the average fund in the sector fell by 15.9 per cent, and only 13 of 103
showed any gain at all.
International general investment trusts did rather better with an average
gain of 12.6 per cent, helped by a narrowing of the discount over the
period.
When choosing an overseas unit or investment trust, there are two important
factors to consider. One is income. Other markets traditionally have traded
on a lower yield than has been available in the UK. At the beginning of
September, the average yield on European investment trusts was 1.7 per cent,
and 0.9 per cent on Japanese trusts, compared with 6 per cent on the average
UK general trust.
The second factor is the personal equity plan rules. Trusts committed to
keeping 50 per cent or more of their assets in the European Community
qualify for the full Pounds 6,000 PEP allowance. But other trusts -
including the biggest in the sector, Foreign &amp; Colonial - qualify only for a
Pounds 1,500 allowance.
Some readers may want to invest directly in overseas equities. This can be
cumbersome, with brokers forced to impose additional charges to reflect
settlement costs and dividend collection procedures. But Fidelity launched a
specialist service recently for those interested in overseas investment,
with a minimum commission of Dollars 38 for US stocks and Pounds 100 for
European equities.

FT  26 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Economic and election
uncertainty hit Dow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
MORE BAD economic news and renewed uncertainty about the election battle
left US share prices sharply lower across the board yesterday, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 37.55 at 3,250.32,
although above its lows for the day when the index had registered a 50-point
loss. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended down 4.13 at
414.35, while the Amex composite shed 2.45 at 378.49 and the Nasdaq
composite fell 8.73 to 577.20. Turnover on the New York SE was 216m shares.
Although bond prices staged a strong recovery, and yields fell, A series of
poor economic news set the tone for a weak opening to trading. The biggest
surprise was the 0.1 per cent decline in August durable goods orders, which
followed a big rise in July and defied analysts' expectations of a similar
increase for August.
Particularly worrying was the new five-year low for unfilled orders. Until
backlogs begin to increase again, companies will not hire new workers, said
analysts. This has serious ramifications for consumer spending. The latest
data on personal spending showed it fell by 0.1 per cent in August,
alongside a 0.5 per cent drop in personal income. Those figures, plus a 3.2
per cent drop in August existing home sales, prompted concerted selling.
Among individual sectors, drug stocks were hit by the latest press reports
on government plans to introduce new regulations to control rising
healthcare costs. Investors fear the regulations could reduce corporate
profits. Leading the way lower were Merck, down Dollars 2 at Dollars 43 1/8
, Schering-Plough, Dollars 2 3/8 lower at Dollars 57 1/4 (despite a broker's
upgrade), Pfizer, down Dollars 4 3/8 at Dollars 74 3/8 , Bristol
Myers-Squibb, Dollars 2 1/8 lower at Dollars 63 3/4 and Johnson &amp; Johnson,
Dollars 2 7/8 weaker at Dollars 47 5/8 .
Insurance stocks were mixed after hectic gains, on Thursday inspired by
hopes that losses from Hurricane Andrew could end the property and casualty
insurance industry's price slump and drive rates higher.
AIG added rose another Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 102 1/4 , as did Travelers
(already buoyed by favourable reaction to the recent Dollars 722.5m
injection of capital by Primerica), up Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 22 7/8 . SCOR
US rose Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 16 1/8 after announcing it would take an 89
cents a share charge in the third quarter to cover hurricane losses but
reassuring that overall earnings would be positive. Aetna held steady at
Dollars 40 3/4 , but profit-taking dropped General Re Dollars 2 3/4 to
Dollars 99 3/4 .
Medical Care America plunged Dollars 33 to Dollars 25 after the company
warned third quarter earnings would be comparable with the 45 cents a share
earned a year ago after one-time charges of 44 cents a share.
Canada
TORONTO Stocks ended the week on a losing note, following most major world
markets. The Composite Index lost 25.12 points at 3,385.49, down about 60
points on the week.
Declines led advances 309 to 214 with volume at 24m shares. All but one of
the 14 stock groups ended lower.
Industrial products were off 1.16% and financial services lost 0.98%.
Consumer products and mining were down moderately, with gold and energy
stocks flat.

FT  26 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets: Singapore slumbers in mood of
despondency - The market is in the slow lane
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brokers are a breed not known for shyness. But in Singapore these days
market analysts are reluctant to talk, at least publicly.
The coyness is due to an ongoing investigation by the island republic's
Internal Security Department into how second quarter growth figures were
leaked to a local newspaper in advance of official disclosure. Brokers, as
well as journalists and civil servants, have been among those questioned.
'It was difficult enough to sell Singapore stocks before this happened' said
one broker. 'The market will come back eventually but now it is all pretty
grim.'
From a year high at the end of January of 1,546, the Straits Times
Industrial Index (STI) has lost nearly 12 per cent so far this year and at
one stage at the end of August plunged below the 1,300 mark, seen as a
danger level by many locals. A slight, short-lived rally earlier this month
did little to lift the overall mood of despondency.
In trading yesterday the STI put on 14.43 to 1,339.75 in volume of 62.5m
shares.
Singapore continues to seem lethargic in comparison with the performance of
other regional markets. Not so long ago Singapore vied with Hong Kong for
regional market supremacy. But over the past year trading volumes in the
island republic have stagnated at about Dollars 100m per day while Hong
Kong's have soared to more than Dollars 700m per day.
With a recent spate of large privatisations in Malaysia, Singapore has also
lost its position as number one bourse in south-east Asia to Kuala Lumpur,
where total market capitalisation is now almost double the island
republic's.
Ask why Singapore has been such a laggard and market analysts scurry round
for definitive answers. The government remains highly sensitive to any
criticism of economic performance. Though the controversial second quarter
growth figures, at 4.7 per cent, were lower than anticipated, overall
performance is still creditable, given that Singapore's main export markets
are simultaneously in the economic doldrums.
Interim company profits, particularly of Singapore's four big banks and the
shipyards which together tend to dominate the market, were, like the
official growth figures, generally lower than expected.
There is concern about excess liquidity in the system, and the government's
strategy in accumulating massive savings. A widening gap between wage and
productivity growth and the rise of the Singapore dollar against its US
counterpart are seen as factors which could seriously effect export
competitiveness.
'Nothing specific is driving equities down; it's just that there is a
general lack of interest in the market here at the moment,' said one broker.
'It's not really a question of which stock to sell, more a general 'sell
Singapore' sentiment. When news of the second quarter figures came out, many
foreign fund managers used them merely as an excuse to clear out of
Singapore and go elsewhere.'
It is estimated that foreign investors account for more than one half of the
volume traded on the Singapore exchange. At one time, being involved in the
Far East meant having a substantial presence in Singapore stocks.
Not any more. Investors can now pick and choose from the region's newly
emerging markets. These often offer more excitement and volatility than
Singapore, which is perceived by some as over-regulated and a trifle dull by
comparison.
There is no doubt that a large amount of funds have been taken out of
Singapore, and have been invested in Hong Kong. Money has also gone north to
Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur.
Malaysian stocks once accounted for about 40 per cent of the Singapore
market's total capitalisation. Kuala Lumpur's break with the Singapore
exchange in 1990 was a severe blow to the island republic.
Moves by the KL exchange to go for paper-free trading next year are likely
to dampen activity further. Analysts say that locals, who at one time would
have played the market even during its quiet periods, are staying away:
having caught the prevailing nervousness about the economy, they are sitting
on their money, or also moving funds elsewhere.
The government has been criticised for its tardiness in bringing state
companies to the market. The government's answer is there is no need to rush
when these companies, in contrast to the case in most other countries, are
already well-run and profitable enterprises.
Brokers are hoping that the government will stick by its undertaking to
float the telecommunications utility, Singapore Telecom, next year and so
bring some much needed excitement to the market.
For the time being, Singapore seems resigned to the fact that its old rival,
Hong Kong, is stealing the stock market show. Analysts feel that when the
steam has gone out of the Hong Kong market and once fund managers - nowadays
acknowledged to be a less conservative, more risk prone breed - have
suffered a few market bruises, then Singapore, offering steady if
unspectacular long term growth, will come back into fashion. When that will
be is the big question.

FT  26 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei closes lower on
profit-taking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PROFIT-taking and arbitrage-related index selling depressed share prices as
investment trusts moved to realise profits ahead of the September interim
book closing, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average closed down 215.19 at 18,394.76, falling for the first
time in four trading days. It hit a high of 18,610.85 in the morning but
remained lower throughout most of the day, dipping to a low of 18,393.96
just before the close.
Volume eased from 376m shares to 350m. Declines outpaced advances by 543 to
443 with 139 unchanged, the Topix index of all first section stocks fell
9.65 to 1,371.53 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.37 to
1,096.49.
Institutional investors stayed inactive as dealers liquidated positions
ahead of the weekend. Activity centered on speculative trading by
individuals.
Despite yesterday's fall, traders said that underlying sentiment remained
firm on hopes that an inflow of public funds into the equity market,
expected early next week, will support shares.
Itoman, the Osaka based textile trader, fell Y14 to Y124. Investors rushed
to place sell orders in Itoman after the announcement that five Itoman
shares will be exchanged for one share of Sumikin Bussan, which is unlisted,
and the shares have fallen by 64 per cent since last Friday's merger
announcement.
Mitsui Mining &amp; Smelting, the most active issue of the day, fell Y4 to Y519
on profit taking. Nippon Mining, on the other hand, rose Y10 to Y513 on
individual buying.
Export-oriented high-technology issues were easier on fears of the rise in
the yen hurting profits. NEC lost Y20 to Y731 and Fujitsu fell Y10 to Y600.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 32.83 points to 19,790.07 in volume of 21.9m
shares.
Roundup
THERE was a relatively lacklustre performance among the region's markets
yesterday.
HONG KONG rebounded on bargain hunting by local and Chinese investors, but
Cheung Kong and Hutchison Whampoa both slid on a rumour that Li Ka-shing was
trimming Cheung Kong's stake in Hopewell Holdings through a private placing.
Cheung Kong fell 40 cents to HKDollars 21.20, Hutchison 10 cents to
HKDollars 15.40 and Hopewell 2.5 cents to HKDollars 4.975 as the Hang Seng
index ended 27.43 higher at 5,686.16, virtually flat on the week.
AUSTRALIA continued to fall on worries about Westpac's rights issue which
was not fully subscribed. The All Ordinaries index closed 10.8 lower at
1,496.4, a decline of 1.8 per cent over the week. Turnover was ADollars
296m.
The banking index closed 29.1 lower at 2480.9 with Westpac striking a day's
low of ADollars 2.79 before regaining some ground to close down 5 cents at
ADollars 2.86 with 5.6m shares traded.
KUALA LUMPUR advanced strongly, helped by lower interest rates and
encouraging economic news.
The composite index closed up 8.09 at 602.06, up 2.5 per cent on the week.
BANGKOK finished weaker due to losses in major property stocks. The SET
index ended down 4.44 at 859.17 in turnover of Bt14.34bn. The market was 2.8
per cent stronger on the week.
Bangkok Land, which has Thailand's biggest equity capitalisation, lost Bt8
to Bt138 in turnover of Bt796.9m.
MANILA settled slightly higher in quiet trading on bargain-hunting. The
composite index gained 3.19 to 1,389.61 in turnover of 340m pesos, down 2.2
per cent on the week. PLDT rose 5 pesos to 970 pesos with some 51m shares
traded.
TAIWAN lost ground again as the weighted index closed 67.98 lower at
3,472.50, still 1 per cent higher on the week.
SEOUL drifted higher in featureless trading on afternoon institutional
buying, a 2.22 rise to 525.57 leaving the composite index with a week's loss
of 1.8 per cent.

FT  26 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Heavy futures trading lifts
Paris bourse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES were mixed at the end of a careworn week, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS saw heavy trading on the futures market give a lift to equities, and a
steadier franc also helped to encourage sentiment. The CAC-40 index closed
14.03 higher at 1,843.53, down 2 per cent on the week. Turnover was some
FFr2.2bn.
A downgrade left Total down FFr7.60, or 4.6 per cent at FFr219.40 in volume
of some 7000,000 shares and led to the oil group issuing a statement just
before the close in which it disputed the reasons for the recommendation.
The note, from a UK broking house, cut the forecast for 1992 earnings by 8
per cent.
Havas lost FFr23 to FFr431 on disappointing interim results from
subsidiaries, while Peugeot was down FFr12 at FFr575 following poor earnings
figures from Fiat. Michelin improved FFr5.00 to FFr206.50.
Bancaire lost FFr30.50, or nearly 8 per cent at FFr356.00 in the absence of
corporate news, although some switching into Sovac was noted as the Lazard
group subsidiary saw a rise in first half profits. Its shares gained FFr19
to FFr799.
FRANKFURT extended the trends of a depressing week, with six DAX stocks
hitting new lows for the year, Daimler Benz matching an earlier low, and
weakness in carmakers, chemicals, engineering and steels, in particular,
relieved only by continued relative strength in the banking sector.
The DAX index fell 17.58 to 1,513.36, 4.8 per cent down on the week and 3
per cent above its August low. German stock market turnover fell from
DM5.1bn to DM4.6bn.
At Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, Mr Matthias Welticke said that Germany was the
main loser from the way currencies have moved in Europe and that it would
take additional, and early interest rate cuts from the Bundesbank (unlikely
now that the franc has stabilised) to change the mood of the bourse.
MILAN reacted to Fiat's first half profit fall and a profit warning from
Stet, the telecoms combine. The Comit index fell another 5.52 to 361.60, 3.7
per cent lower on the week.
Fiat responded to its 54 per cent fall in first half profits with a fix 4.7
per cent down at L3,448 before recovering slightly in kerb trade to L3,485.
Stet's warning of flat profits this year left it L58 lower at the fix, and
L44 down at L1,417 after hours.
ZURICH ended steadily, the SMI index rising 0.6 to 1,909.8 and underlining
this week's consolidation, with a gain of 0.7 per cent, following last
week's 4.7 per cent advance.
AMSTERDAM eased as DSM's fall continued. The CBS Tendency index finished 0.9
lower at 112.2, a 1.2 per cent decline over the week.
The chemical group was hit by a number of downgrades following an analysts
meeting on Thursday. The shares closed down Fl 2.70 at Fl 93.50. Its fellow
chemical group, Akzo, eased Fl 1.70 at Fl 144.00. Elsevier went against the
trend rising Fl 1.60 to Fl 111.20.
MADRID recovered some ground as buyers re-emerged following Thursday's steep
fall. The general index gained 1.62 to 199.77, after a intraday low of
195.64, fall of 7 per cent on the week.
There was a feeling that the rally in the French franc may have removed some
of the pressure for a further peseta devaluation. The construction sector,
which has seen some of the heaviest falls recently, was slightly firmer.
STOCKHOLM stumbled over falling building and property shares and the
Affarsvarlden General index dropped another 11.0 to 697.90 to end the week 8
per cent down in moderate turnover of SKr456m.
The property company, NCC, saw its B shares down SKr3, or 23 per cent to
SKr10 following news that the Globen City consortium in which it
participates has halted its interest repayments. Meanwhile, Sweden's biggest
construction and property group, Skanska, saw its B-restricted shares fall
for the 11th consecutive day, this time by a further SKr4, or 9.5 per cent
to SKr38.
Elsewhere, bad news, or the expectation of it, left Volvo B down SKr8 to
SKr256 and Electrolux B SKr13 lower at SKr178.
BRUSSELS saw relatively quiet pre-weekend trade as the Bel-20 Index lost
3.52 to 1,118.06, down 1 per cent on the week. Banks were a feature with
Generale de Banque climbing BFr50 to BFr7,100.

FT  26 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Profit-takers move in on share prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND UK STOCK MARKET EDITOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ADVANCE in UK share prices extended over the past week and a half met a
significant check yesterday morning when the stock market re-assessed the
parliamentary speech from Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, as well as
the prospects for the UK economy outside the ERM.
The FT-SE raced ahead by more than 36 points in early trade but turned back
sharply very early in the trading session. Reports that ministerial sources
in Germany had speculated on the possibility of a mini-Europe, excluding
Britain were denied. But the fall in sterling to a low against the D-mark
unsettled a London market conscious of the steadier trend in the French
franc. Also discouraging were signs of political pressures on the UK
government after Thursday's parliamentary debate and the resignation of a
Cabinet member.
By the close of trading in the UK, when Wall Street was showing a fall of 25
Dow points, London stocks were sliding lower. The final reading put the
FT-SE Index at 2,601 exactly, the net fall of 20.2 bringing it to the lowest
level of the day.
The session opened very strongly as the blue chip stocks responded to
strength in stock index futures in late trading on Thursday. Led by the
December contract on the Footsie, the stock market's underlying index moved
up quickly. But when the future contract lost heart, the stock market soon
turned down and attempted rallies in the second half of the session proved
of little avail.
The fear that falling sterling may refuel inflationary pressures was again
reflected in strong gains in index-linked government bonds, which added
around of a point yesterday. Long-dated gilts continued to resist downward
pressure, losing only  1/4 point or so, while the shorts, although a touch
easier, looked for a further cut in base rates soon.
Seaq volume remained high at 693.3m shares, compared with 671.2m on Tuesday.
Stock Exchange statistics disclosed that retail or customer business on
Thursday was worth Pounds 1.4bn.
But, despite the recovery in retail business, the market continues to
resound with complaints that the present quote-driven dealing system on the
London stock market has become impossible to operate profitably and there
are increasing pressures for a change to an order-driven system.
Retail business in equities rose sharply this week as the reduction in UK
base rates to 9 per cent encouraged hopes that rates are headed lower.

FT  26 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GLOOMY outlook for the UK economy led to a downbeat session in trading
in stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo.
The market looked set for a strong day's business when the first trade in
the December contract on the FT-SE was struck at 2,700. This however proved
to be the session's high point - the contract then went into retreat and by
mid-morning was trading some 15 points below its opening level as worries
over the economy surfaced.
Sporadic buying around lunchtime helped bring about a brief rally in
December before the sellers once again gained the upper hand. The poor
performance on Wall Street only served to increase the downward trend in the
contract.
December closed at 2,650, down 33 on its previous close and around 6 points
above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 40. Turnover was a
reasonable 9,461 lots.
The volume in traded options reached 32,100 contracts. The FT-SE 100 option
traded 10,848 lots. BP was the most active stock option, trading 2,129
contracts, followed by GEC at 2,048.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Coffee perks up on pact
optimism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COFFEE market moved ahead sharply on Monday as delegates to the
International Coffee Organisation gathered in London for a crucial two weeks
of talks about a new international pact.
London's November robusta contract broke through resistance at Dollars 800 a
tonne to close at Dollars 816, up Dollars 40 on the day. Dealers cited
French trade house buying and the breach of Dollars 800 which pointed to
chart-inspired gains. New York arabica prices also advanced on Monday,
partly on optimism about the ICO talks.
Throughout this week negotiations appear to have gone sufficiently well to
attract the attention of the markets, which have got into the habit of
expecting no progress at ICO meetings. Delegates took a big step forward in
agreeing on the definition of the 'universal quota' - the foundation of any
future pact. They agreed that exporting members would send their coffee to
all destinations 'without distinction between importing member and
non-member countries.' This would eliminate consumer fears that a two-tier
market could re-emerge, with producers selling surplus coffee cheaply to
consumers outside the ICO.
The problems of regulating such a quota system have now become the focus of
the negotiations. While traders and analysts generally concede that this
week's talks have been positive, they are highly sceptical that an agreement
will emerge next week. 'They are making progress, But there are still huge
stumbling blocks,' said one trader.
Their feelings were echoed on Thursday by Mr Lewis Preston, president of the
World Bank, who said in Washington that he was sceptical that any agreement
could succeed in reviving the depressed coffee markets. He blamed the 50 per
cent fall in prices since the ICO pact collapsed in 1989 on a fundamental
imbalance between supply and demand.
His remarks certainly helped to dampen market sentiment, and the London
November contract fell back below Dollars 800. Yesterday it closed at
Dollars 804 tonne, up Dollars 6 on the day and Dollars 28 on the week.
The strength of the dollar and an increase in warehouse stocks of all metals
on Tuesday helped to keep the lid firmly on London Metal Exchange prices.
The apparent fading of the nine-month squeeze on the zinc market suggested
that the market was experiencing a 'return to reality', one analyst said.
In heavy trading on Wednesday zinc moved into contango, where the price of
metal for immediate delivery is at a discount to the three-month price. At
the end of the day cash zinc was Dollars 5 a tonne cheaper than three-month
at Dollars 1,320.50.
Earlier this month the squeeze took three-month zinc to Dollars 1,398 a
tonne, the highest level for 22 months. 'It would take a massive investment
(by those behind the squeeze) to get the market up there again,' said Ms
Lesley Campbell, trader at Rudolf Wolff, the metals broker. However, other
analysts felt the squeeze could reappear before the year end.
On Thursday the market moved into backwardation again and yesterday cash
zinc closed Dollars 47 down on the week at Dollars 1,335 a tonne, Dollars 6
ahead of three-month metal.
Behind the squeeze are thought to be a small number of producers and one
trader with control over about 1m tonnes of annual refined zinc - between 15
and 20 per cent of western world production.
The physical market is likely to be oversupplied by 100,000 tonnes this year
and 150,000 tonnes next year, according to Mr Graham Deller, of Metals &amp;
Minerals Research Services. 'There is no shortage of metal so the price
should continue to fall until producers cut back.'
Cominco - one of the world's biggest zinc producers - said this week it was
seeking tax cuts to secure the future of the Trail smelter in British
Columbia. The smelter, which has reported operating losses of CDollars 98m
over the last two years, produced last year 242,000 tonnes (about 5 per cent
of western production).
Gold has tried again this week to move above Dollars 350 a troy ounce,
spurred on by rumours on Tuesday of a realignment of the Exchange Rate
Mechanism and by the dollar's weakness against the yen on Wednesday. But any
movement near Dollars 350 continues to attract producer selling. Gold closed
in London yesterday at Dollars 349.35, down Dollars 2.65 on the week.
In contrast, platinum has moved ahead, lifted by the rise in the New York
futures market, where speculation on improved demand in Japan has emerged on
the performance of the Nikkei stock index.

FT  26 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Blow to telecoms stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, STEVE THOMPSON and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS that the UK Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) had granted the
first licence to enable an outsider to compete in the international call
traffic market against such companies as BT and Mercury (the telecoms
division of Cable &amp; Wireless) hit shares of both the big UK telecoms groups.
Cable &amp; Wireless (C &amp; W) shares were particularly unsettled and fell 32, or
5.2 per cent, to 582p, making the stock the third worst performer in the
Footsie. Turnover in C &amp; W was a heavy 5.6m shares. The stock was also
affected by profit-taking after recent outperformance, dealers said.
Analysts said ACC, the US group, had been granted the first 'simple
international resale' licence, covering the UK and Australia, Canada and
Sweden. Analysts said they did not expect any immediate reductions in
earnings forecasts for C &amp; W but that the ACC move would have a greater
impact on C &amp; W than BT because of C &amp; W's higher revenue from its
international business. 'This is confirmation of the real impact of greater
competition in the telecoms business,' said one analyst.
BT shares, hit by recent reductions in earnings and dividend forecasts,
dipped 6 more to 353 1/2 p on 5.7m traded. The decline was cushioned by
optimism generated by the launch of a new marketing initiative - Lifetime -
by its Cellnet cellular phone business.
Market enthusiasm for Lifetime, which offers a lower tariff to cellular
customers, boosted sentiment in Securicor, the minority shareholder in
Cellnet. Securicor 'A' stock rose 5 to 559p. Vodafone, Cellnet's arch rival,
settled 7 higher at 335p, still boosted by a broker's switch recommendation.
Granada wanted
Leisure and media group Granada continued its strong run following recent
meetings with analysts. Yesterday, it was the turn of SG Warburg and Carr
Kitcat and Aitken to recommend the stock; the shares jumped 12 to 258p on
hefty volume of 5.7m.
Sentiment was also improved by news that two directors had made substantial
share purchases this week, prior to Granada going into its closed season.
Chief executive Mr Gerry Robinson spent around Pounds 750,000 on 300,000
shares, while the head of Granada Television, Mr Charles Allen, bought a
further 85,000 for Pounds 200,000.
Mr Jeffrey Harwood at Carr's said that Granada, which has been able to
curtail expenditure on Sky TV and elsewhere in the group, is now 'turning
into a formidable cash generator.'
Enterprise Oil and Lasmo attracted strong support early in the session, much
of it said to have emanated from the US. Enterprise closed 6 higher at 412p,
but Lasmo failed to hold on to an initial gain and settled a net 1 1/2 off
at 164p.
Dreadful quarterly figures from Continental Corporation, one of the big US
insurance groups, were the trigger for a sharp upturn in the UK composite
insurances. A reduced dividend and heavy losses resulting from Hurricane
damage prompted insurance analysts to take the view that US insurance rates
would have to be increased, thereby signalling a significant increase in
international rates.
The prospect of higher premiums, plus the strengthening of the composites'
balance sheets from the big gains in the equity market in recent sessions,
saw share prices race higher.
Commercial Union, with its minimal exposure to domestic mortgage indemnity
losses, ran up 16 to 535p, closely followed by General Accident, 12 firmer
at 521p. Sun Alliance edged up 7 to 310p and Royal Insurance hardend to
185p, the last-named after exceptionally heavy turnover of 5.9m. Insurance
brokers shared in the upsurge led by Willis Corroon which put on 20 to 208p
and Sedgwick, 12 firmer at 145p.
US-led selling in the pharmaceutical sector continued, fuelled on Wall
Street by disappointing data on a drug marketed by Merck. Smithkline
retreated 13 to 481p, Wellcome 13 to 950p and Glaxo 9 to 770p.
Waste management groups suffered as Leigh Interests issued a profits warning
due to a downturn in business. The shares collapsed 51 to 175p.
Several stocks in the transport sector were in demand. Among them, BAA moved
8 ahead to 715p, and P&amp;O improved 3 to 395p. Tiphook gained 8 to 278p.
Shares in tobacco machinery maker Molins jumped 18 to 319p, after the
company reported an improvement in interim profits from Pounds 6.8m to
Pounds 7.2m, and raised the dividend by 50 percent to 4.5p. Investors
favoured Vosper Thorneycroft, and the shares jumped 5 to 394p. Uncertainty
following the early retirement of the chief executive at wire rope maker
Bridon upset the shares and they closed 10 down at 48p.
Following a bear raid on Thursday, Allied Lyons came under renewed pressure
as some trader's decided the brewery group's recent outperformance was
overdone. The shares slumped 27 to 611p. A similar fate befell Whitbread,
the 'A' shares falling 15 to 450p, with UBS Phillips and Drew said to be
particularly negative. Meanwhile, Kleinwort Benson reinforced its buy stance
on Greenalls, the shares climbing 9 to 394p. Food manufacturer Northern
Foods continued a successful round of presentations to brokers. The shares
put on 4 to 283p.
BZW advised clients to take profits in Tate and Lyle, the shares declining
18 to 342p. County NatWest was also targeting Tate's, reportedly advising a
switch into United Biscuits, up 6 to 316p.
Abbey National moved up to 320p early in the session, still boosted by the
BZW buy recommendation, but quickly ran out of steam and fell away to 311p,
a net fall of 6. Barclays attracted fresh and sizeable buying interest,
reflecting the substantial shift in sentiment in the sector since the UK
withdrawal from the ERM and the cut in UK interest rates. Barclays shares
settled 8 higher at 374p on 10m traded. NatWest, on the other hand, slipped
8 to 365p.
SG Warburg, a strong performer at the start of the week when the shares
responded to the big increase in stockmarket activity and also to
speculation of a possible merger involving the bank, eased 2 to 534p.
Kleinwort Benson hardened 3 to 296p.
United Newspapers continued to bask in the glow of its well-recived interim
results on Thursday, with several brokers producing positive notes on the
publishing group. The shares added 5 to 430p. UBS Phillips and Drew, the UK
based securities house, was said to be recommending clients switch into
United out of Pearson, off 11 at 387p.
Solid results from Central Television sent the shares ahead 70 to 1445p.
However, disappointing first half results from HTV knocked the share price
by 14 to 27p.
The aerospace sector was particularly busy. Turnover in British Aerospace,
which reported interim figures below the worst market expectations earlier
this week, reached 6m in strong two-way business. The shares held up
relatively well easing only a penny to 125p.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Foreign Exchanges: ERM rumours plague market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH FRANC continued to make gains against the D-Mark in Europe's
Exchange Rate Mechanism yesterday, although there were persistent rumours in
the market about the possibility of another realignment of the ERM, writes
James Blitz.
The franc appreciated to a high of FFr3.3820 to the D-Mark in European
trading and closed at FFr3.3860. Both the Bundesbank and the Bank of France
made light interventions in the market to support the French currency, as it
showed the first signs of rising above FFr3.40. The intervention was thought
to have been tactically well-timed, and, by the close of European trading,
dealers were confident that the danger of a franc devaluation had receded.
The large differential in French and German overnight rates, which was
yesterday about 10 percentage points in the franc's favour, encouraged the
purchase of francs. It was therefore far more lucrative for dealers to be
long of the French currency over the weekend. However, there were few sign
of major investment institutions, like pension funds, reversing their
decisions earlier this week to sell francs.
The French currency also gained from suggestions that the core currencies of
the ERM - the D-Mark, French franc, Dutch guilder and Belgian franc - could
move quickly to currency union, transforming Europe into a two-tier currency
system.
The Belgian central bank governor, Mr Alfons Verplaetse, said that monetary
union among the 5 EC countries could start 'immediately.' Mr Carlos
Solchaga, Spain's economy minister, also called for an urgent re-ordering of
exchange rates in the ERM, adding to the idea that a realignment of the
system could take place this weekend. The head of foreign exchange at a
major London-based investment bank said that there was more than a 50 per
cent chance of this happening this weekend.
Sterling was undermined yesterday morning as investors turned their
attentions away from the French currency. The pound dipped to a historic low
against the D-Mark of DM2.5090 in intra-day trading, but recovered later in
the day to close 0.5 pfennigs down on the day at DM2.5450.
The dollar drifted lower in European trading as the French franc's stronger
position in Europe undermined perceptions of the dollar as a safe haven. The
US currency dropped more than a pfennig to a session low of DM1.4690. It was
further undermined by poor US economic indicators, including a 0.1 per cent
fall in durable goods orders in August, when a 1.8 per cent rise had been
expected. The dollar recovered to close at DM1.4840 against the D-Mark from
a previous DM1.4850.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Money Markets: Softer short dates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORT DATED rates in the sterling cash market softened yesterday after the
Bank of England explained how it would be rolling over the special credit
facilities offered to leading institutions after its massive purchase of
sterling on the foreign exchanges last week.
In the afternoon, rates firmed again after dealers took most of the day to
remove the Pounds 900m shortage forecast by the Bank.
The overnight rate came below the base rate figure of 9 per cent after the
Bank announced the terms on which it will offer credit to the major banks.
The Bank's purchase of more than Pounds 10bn to support sterling on the
foreign exchanges last Wednesday created a massive shortage in the money
market. If the Bank had tried to remove this through its daily interventions
alone, market rates would have moved to damagingly high levels.
The rates offered yesterday were 9 7/32 per cent for 1 week, 9 5/16 per cent
for 1 month and 9 1/4 per cent for the whole two months that the facility is
offered. These roughly reflect the current market rate for cash.
However, there was a lingering reluctance among traders to offer bills to
the Bank at such a volatile time, and the Bank had to provide late
assistance of Pounds 570m at the end of its daily intervention. The
overnight rate firmed up to 11 per cent in the afternoon, while 3-month
money again closed at 9 1/4 per cent on the offered side.
Sterling's three pfennig fall against the D-Mark had little impact on the
cash market but caused a ten basis point fall in the December short sterling
contract. For the moment, dealers remain uncertain of how the currency's
fluctuations affect the government's policy on rates, although several
dealers said that they would only start to pay close attention to the
currency if it fell below DM2.50. The December contract closed at 91.72
after closing the previous night at 91.81.
The Bank purchased Pounds 100m of Band 1 bank bills at 8 7/8 per cent. Later
the Bank purchased Pounds 5m of Band 1 Treasury bills and Pounds 25m of Band
1 bank bills at 8 7/8 per cent. The forecast was revised to Pounds 1.05bn,
and the Bank purchased Pounds 273m of Band 1 bank bills and Pounds 23m of
Band 2 bank bills.

FT  26 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Wembley advances to Pounds 2.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WEMBLEY, the leisure group, reported a trebled increase in first half
pre-tax profits but a reduced interim dividend as consumers continued to
show a reluctance to spend.
Sir Brian Wolfson, chairman, said last April's optimism about 1992 was based
on the assumption that this year would be no worse than last. However
takings per head and attendances were both down and operating profit margins
fell for the group as a whole.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 709,000 to Pounds 2.5m on sales up 17 per
cent at Pounds 96.8m (Pounds 82.9m) in the six months to June 30. Earnings
per share rose from 0.16p to 0.27p after allowing for the January rights
issue that raised Pounds 37m.
Wembley is not anticipating an early improvement in the economy, despite
recent renewed hopes of lower interest rates. 'The economy will stay flat
this year,' said Sir Brian. 'We are going further than this and assuming
that this (level of economic activity) is the new reality.'
As a result, Wembley is proposing to cut the interim dividend from 0.9p to
0.2p. The shares closed down 4p at 21p.
Asset sales cut gearing to 60 per cent from about 75 per cent after the
rights issue. However, Wembley showed a Pounds 1.4m extraordinary item
mainly relating to goodwill written off on purchase of the Hong Kong night
club which the group has now sold.
Operationally, UK trading improved with margins increasing at the Wembley
Stadium complex following cost cutting.
National Leisure Catering and Keith Prowse tickets had a much stronger first
half. The Ticketing Group joint venture with Expedier Leisure was hit by
lower attendances at West End theatres.
The US had a poorer year because of the translation of dollar earnings into
sterling and a turn down in betting at greyhound tracks.

FT  26 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Shares rise to Molins' 'blissful' results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Molins jumped 18p to 319p in a falling market as the tobacco
machinery manufacturer reported improved profits for the first half and
increased the interim dividend by 50 per cent.
The pre-tax return was 6 per cent up at Pounds 7.2m (Pounds 6.8m), in spite
of a slight decrease in sales from Pounds 75m to Pounds 73.5m. The dividend
is raised from 3p to 4.5p on earnings per share 10 per cent ahead to 18p
(16.4p).
Analysts hailed the results as 'absolutely blissful' in a week which saw
grim news from other engineers such as British Aerospace and Vickers.
Forecasts were for a further advance in full-year profits to Pounds 16.5m,
compared with Pounds 15.5m last year.
Mr Michael Orr, chairman, said he was optimistic about the group's
prospects: 'We feel better about the business today than we did a year ago.'
The absence of a hostile predator for the first time in more than four years
had left the board time to concentrate on business development.
He gave a strong indication that the full year dividend would be higher than
last year's 12.75p. He said Molins felt confident it 'should be able' to
pursue a progressive policy, adding the usual caveat that any pay-out would
depend on actual profits.
The improved results were largely the result of a better return from the
tobacco machinery operation. Trading profits increased by Pounds 800,000 to
Pounds 6.6m on sales almost 2 per cent lower at Pounds 48m.
Strong demand in Brazil and China more than offset a downturn in the US,
where Molins achieves some 40 per cent of machinery sales.
Mr Peter Greenwood, managing director, said the group enjoyed a strong
position in the important Chinese market, which accounted for 30 per cent of
the total world demand for cigarettes.
Packaging machinery suffered from exposure to the US. Operating profits fell
30 per cent to Pounds 700,000 on sales Pounds 1.1m lower at Pounds 24.4m.
Increased competition was also having an effect on prices, although as the
US market leader, Molins was less vulnerable than others to discounting.
Negotiations over Molins' pension fund surplus with independent trustees
continued. The surplus had been estimated at about Pounds 90m, although
under Inland Revenue rules, only about Pounds 38m would be available. Mr
Hamish McPhee, finance director, said it was too early to estimate how much
of the surplus the company would eventually receive.

FT  26 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Mowlem dives to Pounds 10m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHN MOWLEM, the house-builder and contractor, plunged to a Pounds 9.9m
pre-tax loss in the first half of 1992, partly reflecting a Pounds 2.5m
operating deficit on London City Airport and a Pounds 3m provision for
Canary Wharf, the insolvent Docklands office project.
The loss came on turnover of Pounds 669m, and compared with a pre-tax profit
of Pounds 7m on sales of Pounds 697m. Losses per share were 9.2p (earnings
4.7p).
The interim dividend is cut by 65 per cent to 2p (5.65p). But the group
emphasised that it remained in a sound financial position, with strong
positive cash flows.
At the operating level there was a loss of Pounds 1.9m (profit Pounds 8.9m).
The main businesses of contracting, housing, scaffolding and equipment hire
in the UK all made profits although, with the exception of scaffolding, less
than in either of the previous two half years.
Operating loss at London City Airport, in which Mowlem has a 90 per cent
stake, had previously been covered by a Pounds 33m provision set up in 1989,
but this was used up last year. Earlier this month Mowlem announced plans to
sell part of its airport stake and Sir Philip Beck, chairman, said yesterday
that there had been 'a lot of interest' expressed
Commenting on the group's performance, Sir Philip said attention had been
focused on cost reductions in all areas, the disposal of non-core assets and
businesses, cash control within all companies and the maintenance of the
strong and cash positive contracting business.
Cash flow was bolstered by sales of private houses, and the disposal of
non-core businesses and property sales from the discontinued property
development side raised Pounds 23m.
However, as a result of a short-term increase in borrowings, net interest
charges rose to Pounds 5.1m (Pounds 1.9m).
Borrowings will be reduced by the Dollars 30m proceeds of the disposal of
the North American scaffolding business, a sale which provides a premium to
net asset value.
As part of this process of withdrawal from North America, Mowlem was also
closing its Canadian operation which would result in an extraordinary loss.
These decisions, together with costs and possible tax liability, would
result in an extraordinary loss of Pounds 4.3m in the year's accounts.
COMMENT
Mowlem has pulled out of commercial property, run down its housing landbank,
quit North American scaffolding and is looking for a City Airport partner.
The company says that the remaining core contracting business is performing
well in terms of profits, cash generation and relatively well in orders won.
End-year gearing likely to be closer to 30 per cent than 40 per cent. But
most analysts are in the sceptical camp. Pre-tax losses could be Pounds
15m-Pounds 20m this year, and losses will continue at least in 1993 given
the dearth of big projects. Further cuts in the core are likely so perhaps
Mowlem should not be paying dividends out of reserves. It is no surprise the
shares are trading just above their all-time low.

<TEXT>
UNILEVER, the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products group, is expanding its
presence in eastern Europe with the acquisition of Povltavska Tukove Zavody
(PTZ), a Czech state-owned producer of edible oils, fats, toilet soap and
skin cream.
Unilever will pay more than Dollars 10m (Pounds 5.8m) for 100 per cent of
PTZ, which had sales in excess of Dollars 20m last year. Unilever has also
agreed to invest Dollars 15m over two years to modernise the Czech plant,
which will produce a range of Unilever's international brands.
The acquisition will strengthen Unilever's position in the Czechoslovak
consumer goods market, where its is competing with Proctor &amp; Gamble of the
US and Henkel of Germany. Both of these companies recently formed joint
ventures in the country to sell locally-produced and imported products.
Mr Hans Eggerstedt, Unilever's commercial director, said the company would
continue to invest in eastern Europe and hoped to have sales of Pounds 700m
in the region by 1997.
Unilever last year paid Dollars 20m for a detergent factory in Poland, in
which it will invest a further Dollars 24m. Earlier this year it bought an
ice-cream maker in Hungary and plans to acquire a second plant, making
edible oils, together with Ferruzzi of Italy.
'Our aim is to target the national markets. We are not here to simply create
a low-cost manufacturing base and re-export to the European community' Mr
Eggerstedt said.

FT  26 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Fortnum &amp; Mason profits little changed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WALTON MORAIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits at Fortnum &amp; Mason, the Piccadilly department store,
remained virtually unchanged in adverse economic conditions.
Fortnum made pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.46m in the 76 weeks to July 11
1992, following a change of accounting period. In the 52 weeks to July,
profits were down 0.5 per cent against Pounds 2.16m for the same period of
1990-91.
Mr Garry Weston, chairman, said this was a creditable result at a time of
economic recession and reflected tighter management and cost controls.
Sales at the Piccadilly store rose 6 per cent in the 24 weeks to July, but
this reflected adverse trading conditions in the same period last year
during the Gulf War. Mr Weston said sales at the store over the 76 weeks and
52 weeks to July 1992 were down 1.5 per cent and 2 per cent over comparable
periods the year before.
Total sales for 76 weeks, were up Pounds 900,000 to Pounds 33.33m, boosted
by a surge in exports in the early part of the period.
Earnings per share for the 76 weeks were 383p (311p for previous 52 weeks).
A third interim of 12p was declared making a total of 108p (90p).

FT  26 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Central TV jumps to Pounds 15m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CENTRAL Independent Tele-vision announced a sharp jump in pre-tax profits
from Pounds 3.4m to Pounds 15.1m in the half year to June 30.
Mr Leslie Hill, the chairman and chief executive, attributed the
higher-than-expected profits to continued pressure on costs combined with an
increasing share of ITV advertising revenue.
Overheads were reduced by 8 per cent while expenditure on programmes
increased by 15 per cent. Central's share of ITV advertising rose from 14.04
per cent to 14.83 per cent.
'Given our excellent first half result, we expect to have a successful year,
despite the outlook for advertising revenue remaining uncertain', Mr Hill
said.
Analysts expect Central to make pre-tax profits of about Pounds 41m for the
full year, the last before the new ITV licences begin, when the Midlands ITV
company will have to pay to the Treasury the money it bid for the new
licence - Pounds 2,000 a year plus 11 per cent of its advertising revenue.
Unlike many ITV companies Central did not benefit from this year's reduction
in the turnover-based Exchequer Levy from 10 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Its
charge fell by only Pounds 200,000 because of a higher profits-based levy
charge.
Turnover rose to Pounds 159m (Pounds 140m) with advertising revenue
contributing Pounds 115m (Pounds 102m). Earnings increased from 7.9p to
34.7p and the interim dividend is 10p (7.5p).
Central, which has children's programmes such as Woof, running on US
television, said it planned to increase expenditure on developing programme
pilots and new ideas. The aim was to keep Central's programme sales to the
ITV network high when it becomes an open market next year.
'We intend to stick to our knitting,' said Mr Hill in a reference to the
company's intention to expand only within the television industry.
The Central chairman also renewed his appeal for the government to act on
what the company believes are unfair takeover rules.
Central's share price closed 70p up at Pounds 14.45.

FT  26 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Waterman halves dividend to 1p

<TEXT>
The increasingly rapid decline in the property and construction markets led
to Waterman Partnership making a loss of Pounds 2.72m in the year ended June
30, against a profit of Pounds 113,000.
However, this group of consulting engineers continued to generate cash, and
is recommending a final dividend of 0.5p, which halves the year's total to
1p, from losses per share of 10.6p (earnings 0.2p).
Work done fell from Pounds 11.09 to Pounds 6.26m and there was an operating
loss of Pounds 1.21m (profit Pounds 466,000). There was an exceptional
charge of Pounds 1.73m (Pounds 609,000) mainly for bad debts and long term
contracts.

Headway turned in a pre-tax profit of Pounds 637,000 for the year ended June
30, compared with Pounds 606,000 for the previous 15 months.
The group, which makes garden furniture and sofa beds, partially offset the
effects of recession by cutting operating costs, containing capital
expenditure, reducing stocks and conserving cash.
Disposals reduced borrowings. Following the rights issue last September
gearing had been cut from 83 per cent to 6 per cent.
Turnover came to Pounds 28.3m (Pounds 40.7m for 15 months). Net interest was
Pounds 568,000 (Pounds 1.24m) and there were exceptional credits of Pounds
285,000.
Earnings per share worked through at 4.1p (4.3p for the period) and the
dividend is again 0.7p on higher capital.

FT  26 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Financial restructuring at Fitch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRAND TRUST, a company controlled by two French former advertising agency
executives and Sir Terence Conran, founder of the Habitat group and retired
chairman of Storehouse, plans to provide Pounds 2.5m in new capital for
Fitch, the lossmaking design consultant, in return for a 60 per cent equity
stake in the restructured group.
The capital injection is part of a financial reconstruction. Share trading
in Fitch, which ran into problems partly because of high interest costs on
property-related borrowings, was suspended in July at 41p pending the
outcome of talks with its bankers on a refinancing package.
Brand Trust is controlled by Mr Jean-Francois Bentz, former head of design
at Roux, Seguela, Cayzac et Goudard (RSCG), one of the largest French
advertising groups, and Mr Bernard Roux, former RSCG president.
Brand Trust and Sir Terence will pay 11.7p per share for a total of 21.35m
new shares. Brand Trust will have 35 per cent of the enlarged share capital
and Sir Terence 25 per cent. Existing ordinary shareholders will see their
stake diluted from 86.85 per cent to 18.9 per cent, while convertible
preference shareholders, who currently would hold 13.15 per cent of the
equity on conversion, will have their stock converted on enhanced terms into
an 11.1 per cent equity stake.
If Fitch's existing shareholders agree the restructuring at an extraordinary
meeting on October 19, Mr Bentz will become its European chief executive,
and Mr Roux and Sir Terence will join the board as non-executive directors.
As part of the financial reconstruction Fitch's principal banker, National
Westminster, has agreed to restructure its borrowings. The company has also
reached agreement with its landlords and will sell Fitch Benoy, an
architectural practice based in Newark, to its managing director, Mr Fitch
said yesterday.
Separately, Fitch reported increased pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.81m (Pounds
675,000), including Pounds 1.72m (Pounds 752,000) in exceptional charges,
for the six months to June 30. Losses per share were 31.9p (14.2p).

FT  26 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Further cost-cutting at HTV as losses
increase to Pounds 5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HTV GROUP has revealed details of a do-or-die Pounds 10m cost-cutting
programme as the company announced an increased pre-tax loss of Pounds 5.03m
for the six months to June, which was worse than expected.
The share price dropped from 41p to 27p.
Pressure is on the company, which has the independent television licence for
Wales and the west of England, because from the beginning of next year it
will start paying Pounds 20.5m a year plus 2 per cent of its advertising
revenue to the Treasury under broadcasting legislation.
The programme will include a year-long pay freeze for all staff, a reduction
in the actuarial costs of 'luxurious' pensions and an end to special loyalty
bonuses. A restructuring bringing together the separate Wales and west
divisions is already under way.
The company is not declaring an interim dividend and the question of a final
dividend will be reviewed in the light of autumn trading. Losses per share
were 5.4p (5.2p).
Mr Louis Sherwood, chairman, conceded that the independence of the company
was at stake unless the savings were made. 'We are fiercely independent and
we are going to do out best to remain independent.'
He added that the company would continue to reduce expenditure next year
'consistent with our licence obligations, in order to deliver to our
shareholders a return to profits and dividends'.
What Mr Sherwood described as 'extremely disappointing results' were mainly
the result of a sharp and unexpected decline in share of HTV's share of ITV
advertising revenue from 6.2 per cent to 5.8 per cent.
There had been an improvement in operating losses to Pounds 2.09m (Pounds
2.69m) on lower turnover of Pounds 65.1m (Pounds 80.7m). Net interest
charges were lower at Pounds 1.89m (Pounds 2.16m) but there was an
exceptional charge of Pounds 1m covering restructuring and redundancy costs.
Last year's interim pre-tax loss was Pounds 4.84m.
Mr Chris Rowlands, recently appointed group finance director, said that
almost all the Pounds 10m planned savings had been identified.
Until recently HTV believed that the UK economy would improve after the
general election. Now no end to the recession was in sight.
'It now seems to us prudent to plan on the assumption that these conditions
will continue for an indefinite period,' Mr Sherwood said.
The scale of the potential problem is shown by a review of advertising
revenue commissioned from consultants Booz Allen. In its franchise bid HTV
assumed 3.3 per cent growth in real annual advertising revenue throughout
the 10 years of the franchise. Booz Allen has told HTV the growth is likely
to be less than 2 per cent.

(September 22), highlighted the alleged unpopularity of the Tax Inspectorate
as a graduate career. The reality is a little different.
In 1992 alone we have received over 5,500 applications from honours
graduates for just 30 vacancies.
These applicants have realised that a career in the Tax Inspectorate offers
what most graduates actually want: good training and career development,
intellectual challenge, and progression on merit. All this in a dynamic
culture.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Letter: Misleading impression given of a little known
country

Sir, As the general manager of a consultancy which specialises in assisting
and advising western firms doing business in Romania, and therefore a
regular traveller to Bucharest, I was amazed and appalled by various
inaccuracies in David Pilling's article, 'In Ceaucescu's broken footsteps'
(September 19).
For example, it portrays Bucharest as a grim city in which 'the
Intercontinental Hotel has no coffee and many restaurants little or no
food'.
I returned from Bucharest on the day the article appeared, having spent
three evenings entertaining British and German clients involved in a
Romanian petrochemicals modernisation project.
As usual, the food of the countless privately owned restaurants which have
opened over the last two years in Bucharest was most agreeable and the
atmosphere pleasant. Although the quality of food in Bucharest's restaurants
is in itself of little import to the prospects of British business in the
region, the article's inaccuracies are damaging as they create a misleading
impression of a country which is still little known to the outside world.
Perhaps Mr Pilling's puzzling experiences are best explained by his own
admission that his travel companion on his trip was a 'guide book from
pre-revolution days'.
This is presumably not the best source of information on a city where the
atmosphere, restaurants and the entertainment have changed immensely since
the grim days of Ceaucescu.

Sir, September 29 this year will be the last five-figure palindrome date in
this millennium - 29.9.92. The next one will be January 10 2001, or 10.1.01.
There will be seven four-figure palindrome dates in Septembers, starting
3.9.93 and ending 9.9.99.
I thought you might like to know.

FT  26 SEP 92 / Godfather's dishonour: Japan's latest political scandal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the past month, the Japanese people have been treated to the unfolding
drama of The Strange Case of Shin Kanemaru. The country's most powerful
politician has publicly admitted that he violated a funding law, ignored
prosecutors' requests to come in for questioning, and finally dispatched a
written confession, confident that he could resume his political career.
Mr Kanemaru's case is indeed bizarre, but it highlights many aspects of
Japanese political life that are in need of reform. Fellow members of the
ruling Liberal Democratic party seem to think that the godfather, as Mr
Kanemaru is known, has done no wrong - one of his faction members even
suggested that he had been 'manly and honourable'.
The Japanese public, however, appears disgusted by the affair, which reached
a climax yesterday when Mr Kanemaru formally admitted his guilt in a
statement to the prosecutors. The statement was prepared in the comfort of
his own home, and it remains unclear when he will finally emerge to answer,
in his Marlon Brando-like mumble, questions from the several dozen
journalists camped outside his front door.
One reason for the public's anger is the meagre fine that Mr Kanemaru will
receive for having accepted Y500m (Pounds 2.4m) in political donations from
a scandal-tainted parcel delivery company called Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin. Under
Japanese law, Mr Kanemaru should receive no more than Y1.5m annually from
one company, and the maximum penalty for exceeding that amount is only
Y200,000.
This figure, as the ordinary Japanese well know, is exactly the same amount
as the congested country's most serious parking fine, imposed for leaving a
car overnight in a no-parking area. And it is clear to all - except, it
seems, to LDP members - that Mr Kanemaru has done more than leave his car in
a loading zone.
Before submitting his confession, Mr Kanemaru apparently received an
assurance from the prosecutors that his case would be dealt with summarily,
meaning that he would neither have to face the ignominy of a court
appearance nor even have to appear in the prosecutors' office. He will
simply be sent the political equivalent of a parking ticket.
At the same time, two former executives of the parcel delivery company are
on trial for breach of corporate trust, and a provincial governor who has
just resigned faces a public hearing for having received Y100m in political
donations. It is no wonder that a television commentator reached for his
copy of Japan's constitution, and read aloud, with appropriate irony, the
section that states 'all are equal before the law'.
Will this gnashing of teeth on television make any difference to a political
system that produces a scandal a year and a powerless prime minister every
two years?
In the past, prime ministers and ministers have resigned in disgrace but
have retained control over their factions. Mr Kanemaru is likely to return.
The son of a sake brewer, he holds no official title but claims to have
selected the present prime minister, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, and to have been
grooming the successors.
It must be noted that Mr Miyazawa has offered no comment on The Strange
Case. The prime minister's consistent weakness in the face of more
influential faction heads has disappointed most Japanese, who had perceived
him as intelligent and thoughtful, and perhaps able to push the political
system towards badly needed reform.
On taking office late last year, Mr Miyazawa promised that his first
priority was to end the system of 'money politics', by redrawing electoral
boundaries and by making the life of a politician less expensive. But
nothing has changed, and it is not in the interests of faction heads such as
Mr Miyazawa and Mr Kanemaru to alter things in a way that would undermine
their own prestige as patrons and 'godfathers'.
Meanwhile, Mr Kanemaru's fate has distracted the government from important
international business. Mr Ichiro Ozawa, widely accepted as a likely prime
minister, cancelled a trip to the US and Europe because of his duties as a
'loyal lieutenant' to the godfather. Mr Michio Watanabe, the foreign
minister, in New York this week for a United Nations meeting, has been
concerned by events in Tokyo and by the desire to ensure that his turn at
the top is not disrupted by the Tokyo Sagawa scandal.
Japanese politics is vulnerable to such episodes simply because careers are
founded, cultivated and crowned by cash. Mr Kanemaru's standing was not
built on ideological leadership or oratorical skills, but on a remarkable
ability to raise funds. These funds are distributed to other faction
members, who are then in debt to the godfather and ready to do his bidding
when the time comes to select a new prime minister or to shuffle cabinet
posts around the party.
If Mr Kanemaru's prestige is dented by this scandal, it will not be from the
shame of getting caught, but through the reluctance of traditional corporate
donors to do business with someone who has been publicly tarnished. At 78,
he has talked of retiring. The events of the past month may speed that
decision and create another diverting factional struggle. In the meantime,
the strongest politician in a powerful country will remain at home, keeping
fit by walking up and down stairs, amusing himself with mah-jong, the
Chinese game of chance.
