</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The news from the UK housing market is undeniably bleak, and will probably
get worse. But it would be rash for investors to conclude that a
consumer-led recovery can only happen when residential property prices pick
up again. The fact that 1m home owners are trapped in their houses with
negative equity is indeed cause for concern - but then the latest official
figures are considerably lower than some of the wilder estimates which
depressed sentiment in recent weeks. Financial journalists and stockbroking
analysts - many of whom followed their own advice to take out big mortgages
at the top of the market - do not tend to highlight the 9m householders with
their heads above water.
The fear of unemployment may be as big an influence on their behaviour as
the prospect of a further shake-out in the property market. It is worth
remembering that consumers started spending at the end of the last recession
when house prices were falling in real terms.

FT  18 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: UK dividends
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England may be gratified to see the stream of maintained and cut
dividends emerging from the interim results season. Its latest bulletin
contains a veiled criticism of companies for raising pay-outs last year
while profits were falling. One concern for investors must be that this
dividend growth was only delivered at the expense of investment in
productive capacity.
At 1.7 times, prospective dividend cover for the market as a whole is
running well below the long-term average of 2.5 times, and perhaps 10 per
cent below the trough of the last recession. Rebuilding cover will probably
limit the scope for dividend growth during the upturn. However, a glance
down the list of FT-SE companies shows the serious problem to be
concentrated in specific sectors. While overall investment by industry fell
sharply last year, it still remained respectable by historic standards. This
underlines that there is only a direct trade-off between paying a dividend
and making an investment where no other form of finance is available.
Yet the market for corporate funding is far from perfect. The Bank is surely
right to point out that the longer recovery is delayed, the more likely it
becomes that capital equipment will be scrapped. After all, the depressing
feature of the interim results season so far is not the level of reported
earnings, but some extraordinarily gloomy statements on the trading outlook.
The decision to increase dividends last year was a rational response to what
looked like a short-term cyclical downturn. But if the market is facing
something more serious, this year's decisions will need to be different.

FT  18 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: British Aerospace
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In retrospect it is now clear that the shrewd Mr Raymond Mould sold his
property company Arlington Securities to British Aerospace close to the top
of the market in July 1989. Yesterday's announcement of his resignation from
the BAe board, however, could surely have been better timed. The most
convincing reason for the departure is that the Arlington chairman faces an
obvious conflict of interest when BAe ultimately decides to sell some or
even all of its property subsidiary in line with its long-term strategic
objectives. Mr Mould, after all, could be a possible buyer.
Given that such a disposal is assumed to be some way off, why did BAe not
wait to tell the world about its board shuffle when it reports interim
figures and is free to explain itself properly next month? The market is
well aware that BAe has suffered a big cash outflow in the first six months
of this year, though the situation is set to improve in the second half. The
market has to take it on trust that Mr Mould's resignation - which removes
one obstacle to a sale - is not a sign that BAe's problems are worse than
supposed.
The truth about the timing may be more prosaic, perhaps related to the
prickly relationship which Mr Mould has had with the BAe board. BAe in any
case presumably wants to see at least some faint signs of recovery in the
property market before putting Arlington on the block, while it has assets
to clear out of the cupboard first. Investors, meanwhile, can draw some
comfort from the fact that BAe was not the only privatised company to pay
through the nose for property expertise: AB Ports and BAA have both had to
make major provisions reflecting optimistic values put on Grosvenor Square
Properties and Linton.

FT  18 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Mean streets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It may be that tomorrow's official retail sales figures for July will
counter some of the latest Confederation of British Industry gloom. But
there is little in Argos's results to suggest that life in the high street
is getting any easier. Like for like sales at the catalogue retailer are
still falling, albeit at a reducing rate, and the company is guarded about
its view of trading prospects. With a disciplined company such as Argos
having to sweat hard to offset cost increases with productivity gains, the
message for weaker stores is clear.
The severity of conditions is underlined by the new, keenly-priced Argos
catalogue. While the company hopes to offset low prices by better-targeted
marketing, any repeat of last year's pre-Christmas price war could force up
advertising costs and cut profits. Losses for the year at the Chesterman
furniture retailing operation are likely to be Pounds 4.5m - higher than
previously expected - and reflect the woes of selling anything to do with
housing.
That said, Argos's operations have proved resilient since the demerger from
BAT. The company has also retained the good habit of throwing off cash.
True, the bullish case that Argos was immune from recession has tarnished,
but then the shares have already lost their premium rating to the sector.
The issue now turns on management's strategic grip. Will the plan of
expanding from 300 to 500 catalogue stores at the same time as diversifying
into furniture retailing generate the profits growth the market wants to
see? Market research suggested Chesterman would work, but so far the results
have been disappointing. It would help investors believe the overall
strategy if management could make a good fist of Chesterman.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Letter: Guard small investors' access to new issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms EMMA JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your report ('Stock Exchange to relax rules on flotations', August 10)
raises a number of worrying points for the private investor.
The situation resembles the mid-1980s when the Exchange altered its placing
rules to cater for small companies chafing at the costs of making a new
issue via a public offer. Many private investors who had been enthusiastic
supporters of small new issues were denied access to placings. They
complained that they would become less interested in the new issue market as
a result of these changes to the placing rules. Your report has an
uncomfortable feeling of deja vu.
It seems that, in current poor market conditions, the private investor is
taking the blame for a lack of market demand. When times change, will this
be used to cut the private investor off further from the new issue market?
It is unfair to blame the failure of recent new issues on private investors'
lack of interest. Private investors did not cause the GPA issue to be
withdrawn. Instead, it was lack of institutional interest on both sides of
the Atlantic. Can anyone sensibly argue that private investors are wrong to
be wary in the current climate?
Recent surveys by Mori for ProShare showed that, in June, 43 per cent of
private investors felt it was not a good time to invest in equities; that
figure increased to 52 per cent by the end of July. Among the sectors viewed
unfavourably were publishing, consumer durables and household goods -
sectors in which several recent new issues have failed.
In the longer term, private investors will maintain a worthwhile role in the
new issue market - if they are allowed to do so. As a category, they are a
source of initial demand, a provider of liquidity and a continuing source of
two-way business.
Research shows that new issues play an important role in attracting private
investors to the market. Any move which cuts off this form of entry for the
private investor, however well-intentioned in the short term, cannot but
damage both attempts to ensure wide share ownership and the functioning of
the market as a whole.
The Stock Exchange response appears to be a short-term and pragmatic
solution to a temporary problem. We hope that this is what it remains. On
behalf of private investors, we urge the Exchange to reaffirm its long-term
commitment to the offer for sale as the preferred method of marketing new
issues.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Letter: Training and obligation do not mix
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER ASHBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your Leader on unemployment (August 14) is right in urging the
government to 'think long-term'. But you are wrong in suggesting that
entitlement to benefit should be conditional on unemployed adults
participating in training schemes open to them.
Our experience has led us to conclude that involvement in skills training
should not be obligatory. If the employment service forces people to train,
the result is that those who do want to train find their training ruined by
those who do not want to be there. Making skills training obligatory will
make it low-quality.
While training and obligation do not mix, obligation is right and proper in
relation to temporary work. Here our experience suggests that the unemployed
would respect an obligatory temporary work programme, since they know how
appalling it can be to have no constructive activities outside their homes.
They should be offered some choice about the work they do, but work they
should.
The government should retain Employment Training as a voluntary programme,
and make Employment Action an obligatory temporary work programme for those
out of work for more than 12 months.

FT  18 AUG 92 / When a review throws the records into a spin: Andrew Jack
assesses the options for the future of Companies House, the repository of UK
business information
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine, president of the Board of Trade, will walk into his
office one day next spring, and find a consultant's report on his desk. If
he agrees with its findings, Companies House - part of his department -
could be in private hands by the end of 1993.
Some civil servants are already excited about the prospect. But its own
staff and even private sector competitors view privatisation with more
ambivalence.
Companies House is the division within the Department of Trade and Industry
which registers limited-liability companies and receives their annual
accounts and returns. It has powers to bring criminal prosecutions and
impose large fines to ensure that all 1m British companies file each year -
and that they do so accurately and on time.
It processes the information, stores it on microfiche and makes it available
to the public within days. Last year it responded to more than 3m requests
for data from users including banks, credit-rating companies, research
organisations and individuals.
Last month Mr Heseltine announced a review of 'the operation and role' of
Companies House. He said it will advise on 'how its work can best be carried
out in future'.
Officials at the DTI have been reluctant to say more, as they prepare a
tendering document expected by the end of next month. But the ministerial
statement mentioned four options for consideration: full privatisation,
partial privatisation, contracting out of some activities, or continuing as
at present.
Its statutory roles might make Companies House appear an unlikely candidate
for privatisation. But it has been at the vanguard of attempts by Whitehall
to increase efficiency over the past decade.
Companies House was the second executive agency to be established under the
Next Steps programme in 1988, which gave it considerable managerial and
financial autonomy in return for meeting a number of performance targets.
These included increasing the proportion of companies filing accounts on
time; reducing the time it takes for the public to gain access to the
documents; and cutting costs.
Last year it was also made a trading fund, which effectively means it has
taken over ownership of its assets from the government, and is paying for
them in the form of interest on loans to the Treasury.
Senior staff have wasted no time in putting these new powers to good use,
and contracting out is already well in hand. The computer system, security,
catering and building maintenance are all in private hands. Even a debt
collection agency was hired in June to help collect fines from companies
late in filing their accounts.
Companies House has also embraced the market. It holds regular meetings with
large users. On payment of a premium, it offers express searches and will
deliver documents by courier and by fax. It is about to launch services
which will allow customers to call up information on directors or
outstanding loans for any company on record.
A detailed invitation for external consultants to bid for the review should
be ready by the end of September, with a preliminary report presenting
options by early next year. The implementation of its recommendations is
expected to be under way by next August.
Mr David Durham, the chief executive, says the review is necessary to remove
the uncertainty hovering over the Cardiff headquarters for the past few
years.
Given possible future changes in control and ownership of the organisation,
he says he cannot offer employees or customers much long-term reassurance.
'I can't put my hand on my heart and say that if we are fully privatised we
will stay in Cardiff,' he says. 'I've got no control.'
Insecurity over its future helped trigger a one-day strike last month. The
action also reflected the prospect of up to 80 redundancies as a result of
budget cuts in the face of low demand for its services.
The National Union of Civil and Public Servants (NUCPS) and the Civil and
Public Services Association are concerned about their members' jobs. In the
past three years, the number of full-time staff has fallen by more than 100
to just over 1,000.
But Mr Kieron Hill, NUCPS regional officer for Wales, also raises a
fundamental point which could concern customers: what would happen to the
quality of information if Companies House was fragmented as part of the
process of privatisation? Demand for the search rooms in London, for
example, has declined over the past few years, and Mr Durham admits there
can be no guarantee of their survival in the future.
Selling the entire agency to a private operator seems unlikely, although
there are precedents. In France, a company called OR Telematique has
monopoly control over data input and distribution of all official
information on all the country's businesses, on behalf of the state company
registration office.
But full privatisation would almost certainly require new legislation. There
would have to be safeguards to ensure that companies continued to comply
with requirements to register and file accounts; and for the public to have
access to this information at affordable rates.
A more likely option is that the clearly statutory services would remain in
public hands, while the provision and distribution of some of the
information could be handed to the private sector.
The comprehensive collection of annual records held on all British companies
since they were created could be tremendously attractive, particularly to
credit-rating agencies and companies which specialise in corporate
information.
But that raises a fundamental question: how could these facilities be
effectively valued? Some of the problems are highlighted in the first
corporate-style set of accounts issued by Companies House in July.
The figures show a commitment to repaying loans to the Treasury, which
extend over periods between 15 and 25 years. There is also an annual
contribution to the DTI of Pounds 17m - a sum the government would be
reluctant to lose.
The requirement under current legislation that Companies House must hold
information on all limited companies would prove costly for a private sector
operator. It could not simply select more recent data on larger concerns,
which might be most profitable. It would also doubtless come under
restrictions on the prices it could charge.
Mr David Clark, managing director of Infocheck, a business information
provider and a large user of the services, says: 'There are definitely parts
of Companies House which are textbook cases for privatisation.' But, in this
case, he is sceptical whether the textbook is relevant.

FT  18 AUG 92 / UN relief attacked by south Sudan rebels
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SUDANESE rebels yesterday threatened a United Nations plan for an emergency
food airlift to some 300,000 starving residents of Juba, saying that relief
workers flying into the besieged town did so at their own risk.
The dispute, which emerged between the rebel Sudan Peoples Liberation Army
(SPLA) and the UN, highlights the lack of a co-ordinated, comprehensive UN
relief effort in southern Sudan, and the way in which food is being used, by
both sides, as a weapon in the nine-year civil war.
Ambassador Darko Silovic of the UN department of humanitarian affairs told
reporters yesterday morning a resumed UN airlift would begin on Thursday to
move 1,075 tonnes of food, medicines and shelter material into the starving
government-held city.
The initiative was immediately attacked by the SPLA who described it as
'provocative'. 'Anybody flying to Juba without proper agreement does it at
his/her risk,' warned Mr Elijah Malok Aleng, executive director of the SPLA
relief organisation. The SPLA has in the past shot down aircraft.
Thousands of women and children have died in southern Sudan as both the
fundamentalist Islamic government and the rigid SPLA have consistently
disrupted and blocked relief efforts and sought to exploit them for military
gain. Since the beginning of the year fighting has escalated as the
government has pressed home a lightning offensive.
For four years the civilian population of Juba has been dependent for food
supplies on a threadbare airlift operation.
The airlift was suspended on July 18 after the SPLA, which has laid siege to
the town, stepped up fighting and shelling of the airport and shot down
several government planes. The suspension also followed SPLA protests after
the government had used a UN flagged aircraft allegedly to fly arms and
ammunition to encircled government soldiers.
Mr Silovic said: 'Today in Juba there is no food left. . .If immediate
assistance is not provided, large-scale deaths will certainly follow.'
The SPLA statement, which demanded a round-table meeting of all parties to
discuss relief, appeared to cast doubt on whether the airlift could go ahead
this week.
Mr Silovic admitted the UN had no guarantees that the SPLA and government
would not attack relief flights but said 'we have an understanding and we
hope it will go smoothly'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A US military team arrived in Kenya yesterday to prepare for a big airlift
of food into famine-plagued Somalia, as a top United Nations official
appealed to the Somali people to help resolve security problems impeding the
international relief effort.
The 33-member team from the US defence department arrived at the Kenyan
coastal city of Mombasa in a C-141 transport aircraft. In the next couple of
days it will set up a base for shifting 145,000 tonnes of food in Somalia,
where an estimated 1.5m people are at risk of starvation.
Aid officials have expressed surprise at the sudden speed with which the
Bush administration has reacted, stung by criticism of inadequate relief
efforts so far. The details of the airlift are still to be fleshed out,
although at least 10 military transport aircraft will fly food to Wajir, in
northern Kenya, and to destinations so far unnamed inside Somalia.
The US has no relief personnel on the ground in Somalia to help ensure the
security and effectiveness of food distribution to the needy and does not
appear to have consulted other aid agencies.
But Ambassador Mohammed Sahnoun, the UN secretary-general's special envoy in
Somalia, paid tribute to the US bilateral aid effort, which will complement
aid operations by the UN, Red Cross and other aid agencies.
He described it as a humanitarian act of solidarity with the Somali people,
especially starving children, and Somalis should respond by ensuring the
security of relief personel and getting together under a UN-brokered
national reconciliation conference.
Mr Sahnoun, who left Nairobi last night for Sweden, said he had consulted
the Canadian, German and Italian governments, which had promised to fund a
large part of the UN operations in Somalia.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Palestinian leader walks tightrope towards peace: The role
of Faisal Husseini
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THEY slaughtered six sheep to honour the son of Abdel Kader and in the
Bedouin tradition the men of the village of Sawahreh gathered to talk before
their feast of mansaff - mounds of steamed lamb and rice.
High in the stony hills of the West Bank of the River Jordan towards the
little town of Bethlehem in the simple breeze-block house of Sheikh Kasem el
Sourakhi they welcomed Abu Abed in the traditional way as a local statesman
and tribal leader.
Among the many who expressed greetings was an old man dressed in brown robes
edged with gold thread who stepped forward and kissed the honoured guest on
both cheeks, declaring: 'Ah, the loved one of the people.'
The object of all this attention, better known to the world as Faisal
Husseini, leader of the Palestinians under Israeli occupation, had come to
the village of Sawahreh to burnish his support among a small, but important
element of his constituency - the Bedouin tribesmen of the West Bank.
Known affectionately in the Arab way as Abu Abed, literally 'father of
Abed', Faisal Husseini has emerged as by far the most important Palestinian
of the occupied territories, and the key figure in extremely delicate peace
negotiations involving the Israelis, the Palestinians, and the Americans.
As preparations go forward for the resumption of Middle East peace talks in
Washington on August 24, Mr Husseini's importance is certain to grow. His is
not an easy task, caught between old enemies and under pressure from all
quarters. He likens his position to that of 'someone who is trying to walk
on a wire between two high buildings'.
Many, from both sides of the dispute and among American officials, will be
praying that he manages to keep his balance, for he is perhaps the only
figure capable of exerting a semblance of authority over the fractious
Palestinians of the territories in the testing months ahead.
Courteous and quietly spoken, the balding and slightly overweight Mr
Husseini draws part of his authority from the fact that his father, Abdel
Kader Husseini, who died in battle in 1948, endures in people's memories as
perhaps the most authentic Palestinian hero of the independence struggle.
Descendants of the Prophet Mohammed, the Husseinis are also the closest
thing to nobility in status-conscious Palestinian society.
As the heat of a mid-summer's day brought beads of perspiration to the brows
of those present, Mr Husseini took calls on his cellular phone and fielded
questions about progress towards peace, seeking to reassure his audience
that the process seemed to be on the right track, and that Jewish
settlements on Arab land were being curbed. He also gave the impression that
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the new Israeli leader, was someone he could do business
with.
'The situation is better than it was before. . .' Mr Husseini told his
audience, to which an old man interjected, somewhat sceptically, it seemed,
'Inshallah - God willing.'
Mr Husseini felt obliged to correct one of his hosts who addressed him as
the 'leading man of peace'.
A ripple of polite laughter greeted his reply that 'first of all I am not
the leading man of the peace process, the leading man is Abu Ammar (Yassir
Arafat, the PLO chairman)'.
Faisal Husseini, now in his early 50s, formed his Arab Studies Society, a
kind of political action group, in the late 1970s. Egypt and Israel had made
peace in 1979; however, there seemed little chance that the rest of the Arab
world would follow and the PLO was bitterly opposed to the Camp David
agreement.
But Mr Husseini has plugged on, enduring periods in jail and moments of
despair, in his efforts to chart a political course for his people under
occupation. All the while his stature grew in the towns, villages and
hamlets of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. He is regarded as much more than a
political figure. In Palestinian eyes, he is a tribal chief, and would-be
peacemaker not just with the Israelis, but between feuding Palestinians, as
well.
On a recent particularly hectic working day, no fewer than 430 people
representing all strata of Palestinian society passed through his offices in
Arab east Jerusalem, seeking his help as a counsellor, friend and arbiter of
disputes ranging from marital problems to ancient feuds between families.
Mr Mehdi Abdul Hadi, a prominent Palestinian academic and activist, said
that Mr Husseini, with the 'blessing and encouragement' of the PLO, was
exercising 'national authority' in the territories. He had become, Mr Hadi
observed, the 'address for the Palestinian house'.
In contrast to the severe constraints that the previous government of Mr
Yitzhak Shamir sought to impose on Mr Husseini, the new administration is,
for the time being, giving him room to move. He has been allowed, for
example, to reopen the offices of his Arab Studies Society in an east
Jerusalem hotel.
A proposed amendment to Israel's 1986 anti-terrorism law, allowing
Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza openly to meet Mr Arafat and other
PLO officials will also enhance Mr Husseini's visibility.
On the drive from Jerusalem to Sawahreh for the mansaff, Faisal Husseini had
seemed preoccupied, for he has much on his plate at the moment. Among his
main concerns is how to ensure Palestinian security, should an interim self
rule agreement be reached with Israel, involving a pull-back of the Israeli
military from Arab population centres.
He has proposed a 20,000-strong 'police force' to guard security. He argues
that it would be disastrous for the Palestinians if, having been granted
autonomy, they were unable to provide a secure environment. He warns of
threats from armed Jewish settlers and from a local 'mafia' of drug dealers
and car thieves.
One worry for Mr Husseini is fear of factional strife involving the Islamic
fundamentalist Hamas, which opposes compromise with Israel.
Mr Husseini is also being advised to take better care with his own security
and fairly recently he acquired several bodyguards, who are not permitted by
Israel law to carry arms. In his quiet way, Mr Husseini acknowledges the
dangers. 'Now there is more risk,' he says. 'Yes, I must be more careful.'

trade body
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE proposed Multilateral Trade Organisation (MTO) that would implement the
results of the current round of global trade talks should be renegotiated to
take account of environmental concerns and if not should be jettisoned,
according to the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)*.
Environmental groups, especially in the US, are angry that the MTO, which
would be a far more powerful institution than the present General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), makes virtually no reference to the environment
and its relationship with trade.
This is likely to be one of the most hotly debated issues if and when the
Uruguay Round package, still stalled over farm trade reform, goes to the US
Congress for ratification.
A report on the proposed MTO by WWF International points out the contrast
with the Maastricht treaty, which states that one of the objectives of the
European Community is to promote 'sustainable and non-inflationary growth
respecting the environment'.
The recently completed North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) also
refers to sustainable development as a principal goal.
Mr Charles Arden-Clarke of WWF International said that the draft MTO would
perpetuate the pre-eminence now given by Gatt to free trade over the
environment, and failed to honour commitments made at the Earth Summit in
June to make trade and environment policies 'mutually supportive'.
The WWF is calling for MTO objectives to include a commitment to sustainable
development, recognition and assessment of the environmental impact of trade
measures, creation of a standing committee on trade and the environment
similar to the Gatt committee on trade and development, and consultation
rights for environmental groups in trade negotiations.
Mr Arden-Clarke said WWF would favour an MTO to replace Gatt, 'so long as
the new organisation is equitable, transparent, democratically accountable,

environmental protection and sustainable development'.
Otherwise the proposal should be removed from the Uruguay Round package.

FT  18 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Bush under pressure in oilseeds row

<TEXT>
AS THE US-EC dispute over oilseeds moves towards a climax, the Bush
administration is being pressed by farm organisations and Capitol Hill to
make the oilseeds dispute a test of the effectiveness of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. .
Today is the end of the 60-day period for compensation talks under Gatt.
Brussels made a number of offers, including proposals to raise quotas for
beef imports and to increase access for imported maize.
These have all been rejected as insufficient and providing little for the
injured party - the oilseeds producers. However, according to one US farm
group official, there was 'progress of sorts' when the EC withdrew a threat
to impose a tariff rate quota on oilseeds.
It remains possible that even today, the US could release its retaliatory
'hit list' which would put tariffs of as much as 400 per cent on trade worth
Dollars 1bn. The list, thought to be the largest US sanctions package on
record, will have been whittled down from a list valued at more than Dollars
2bn.
Although the 60-day period is expiring, it could be some days before a final
sanctions roster is released, because the farm experts at the US Trade
Representative's office have been preoccupied with the North American Free
Trade talks. Mrs Carla Hills, the US Trade Representative, is in Houston at
the Republican Convention.
Ms Nancy Foster, of the American Soyabean Association, which brought the
complaint, said: 'We are recommending that the admin-istration show a strong
signal of resolve on this issue.'
In an election year, with the Mid-West an expected battleground, that
recommendation is not likely to be ignored.
Senators supporting the soyabean lobby in discussions with administration
officials are making the issue 'a litmus test for the value of a new Gatt
agreement,' Ms Foster said.
'If we follow the procedures, win a case twice and still not get redress,
what is the point?'
The negotiations in Brussels have gone beyond the US and the Community to
encompass all oilseeds exporting countries claiming damages from the EC
failure to eliminate subsidies to its oilseeds sector.
The compensation talks include Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Hungary,
Poland, Pakistan, India and Sweden.
So far, the group has been united in holding out for a better compensation
package.
While the farm groups have been urging a tough line on the administration,
US business has been scurrying to keep the food, wine, spirits and flowers
it imports off the final sanctions list.
If it comes to retaliation, the damage will be painful on both sides of the
Atlantic.

The Mexican government will encourage further private investment in the
petrochemicals industry, by reducing the number of basic petrochemicals
reserved to the state from 19 to 8, reports Damian Fraser in Mexico City.
Under Mexican law, only the state-owned Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) can make
basic petrochemicals, defined as those chemicals that are the result of the
first chemcical or physical transformation from gas or oil. This definition
has proved to be elastic, and the number of basic petrochemicals has
steadily been reduced over the past six years, according to political rather
than scientific considerations.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDUSTRIALISTS in Argentina are demanding that the government take action to
slow an avalanche of imports, especially from Brazil, which they claim is
threatening the survival of domestic industry.
Mr Israel Mahler, head of the Argentine Industrial Union (UIA), which
represents the country's industry, said at the weekend that 'we are very
close to industrial disruption, because (the imports) affect the domestic
market, the last redoubt that is left to certain sectors.'
The UIA has singled out Brazil as the chief offender, with which Argentina
together with Paraguay and Uruguay, plans to create a common market to be
known as Mercosur by the end of 1994. The four countries are already
reducing trade barriers in preparation for economic integration.
However, concern is rising in Argentina over the volume of Brazilian
exports. Brazil is now expected to run up a Dollars 1.5bn surplus in its
trade with Argentina this year, contributing heavily to Argentina's
deteriorating trade balance. Argentina registered a Dollars 302m trade
deficit in the first quarter, which forecasters fear could rise to an annual
deficit of more than Dollars 1bn. Even optimistic analysts expect the
Dollars 3.87bn trade surplus of 1991 to be whittled away to a very small
surplus.
The UIA wants the government to tighten up anti-dumping procedures and
increase administrative controls to prevent 'abuse' by foreign, particularly
Brazilian, competitors. The union has also demanded that the government
introduce countervailing duties against Brazil to offset the effects of
Brazil's macroeconomic instability. The government has so far refused to
adopt any protectionist measures.
The UIA says Brazilian companies receive government export incentives,
subsidised trade finance and artificially low prices for such inputs as
steel, gas and electricity, plus the benefits of a strongly undervalued
currency. Furthermore, Brazil's severe economic downturn has strongly
increased exports.
However, the Brazilians blame serious structural distortions in Argentina
for the surge in imports. Argentina's industrial costs are rising steadily,
pricing companies out of the international market.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE star of Mr Walter Momper, who shot to international prominence as mayor
of Berlin during Germany's unification celebrations, slumped below the
horizon yesterday morning.
'The man with the red scarf' resigned as chairman of the city-state's Social
Democrat party after a short, sharp clash over his new job as general
manager of Ellinghaus, a building and property company with ambitions in the
east.
Complaining of attacks 'bordering on vilification', Mr Momper, 47, said he
had been surprised by the vigour of the assault and claimed enemies had
seized on his new job as an excuse to get rid of him.
His political leadership had not been brought into question and there were
no candidates for his job, he said yesterday. He had recognised the
possibility of a conflict of interests between his new business commitments
and his lifelong political vocation, and had undertaken not to do business
personally in Berlin.
But to no purpose. A week after his new appointment became known, Mr Momper
was out.
He gained local fame in 1989 after rallying quarrelsome SPD factions and
leading the party to a surprise parliamentary victory over the CDU.
For a brief 20 months, as unification loomed, came and went, Mayor Momper
enjoyed popular support and shared the international limelight - never
without his red scarf - in company with Chancellor Helmut Kohl and other
Bonn notables.
But off-stage, his wobbly coalition with the anti-establishment Greens was
unpopular with many SPD stalwarts. Combined with the surge of support for
the CDU which followed the fall of the wall, the internal unrest led to the
SPD suffering its worst-ever result in Berlin at the first pan-German
election in December 1990.
Although the CDU formed a government with the Social Democrats, there was no
place in it for Mr Momper. Holding on as party chairman, he took a back seat
in parliament. Resentments simmered and rivals waited for him to make a
mistake. In the end, he made two.
While Ellinghaus is above reproach, the Berlin property and construction
business is no stranger to scandal and corruption charges. Second, and
possibly worse, Mr Momper's new boss, Mr Gert Ellinghaus, is a member of
Chancellor Kohl's Christian Democrats.
A surprise offer by Germany's DAG white-collar trade union to accept longer
working hours and less pay was revealed yesterday after Sunday's preliminary
pay talks for the 60,000 employees of Lufthansa. The loss-making state
airline, will shortly announce a dramatic cost-cutting programme, expected
to include up to 10,000 job losses.
DAG, said its aim was to help restore Luthansa's fortunes.

<TEXT>
SWEDEN'S opposition Social Democrats want the right-centre government to
agree a broad-based bargaining position with them before it starts its
negotiating next year with Brussels on the country's future membership of
the European Community, reports Robert Taylor from Stockholm.
The opposition's move comes in the face of substantial public hostility
towards the EC. Mr Carl Bildt, the country's Conservative prime minister,
hopes to complete the negotiations in early 1994 in time for a binding
national referendum.
The Social Democratic leadership continues to back Sweden's EC application
but questions whether Mr Bildt will defend the country's national interest
in negotiations with Brussels. Many feel he has been too ready to argue that
Sweden has no alternative but to joinand that this could weaken his
negotiating stance. Leading Social Democrats fear unless a bipartisan stance
is worked out there will be a 'no' vote in the referendum.
The initial euphoria at the Swedish application on July 1 last year by the
then Social Democratic government has evaporated.
A poll at the weekend showed 41 per cent of Swedes saying they would vote
against the EC if the referendum was held now. Only 32 per cent were in
favour, with 27 per cent undecided. A mere 18 per cent of Social Democratic
supporters favour membership.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Brokers drive a hard
bargain - Just the job
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By THOMAS SLEMEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you possess a passable telephone manner, a flair for negotiating, and a
modicum of knowledge about the motor trade, you could become a car broker -
someone who offers new vehicles for sale at well below list price.
The returns from this line of business can be high. Brokers add a 'mark-up'
to the reduced 'on the road' price of the vehicle after negotiating with the
dealer. They get around 15 per cent discount on the list price from a dealer
and then sell on at a 13 per cent discount. On average, an experienced car
broker can earn more than Pounds 1,000 per week, and a beginner can expect
to earn around Pounds 350.
But how do you begin? You should start by renting a small office equipped
with a phone, stationery, and a copy of the Yellow Pages, which contains a
list of car dealers who hold the appropriate franchise. You will then need
to advertise in local newspapers. Before you take that step, you would be
wise to study the ads in motoring magazines to learn how the experienced car
brokers operate.
When a customer responds to your advertisement, take down the details of the
requested car model, then contact the dealers. Begin by telling them you are
a car broker, or they will not be willing to negotiate.
Once the quote has been accepted by the car-buyer, the dealer delivers the
vehicle directly to the buyer, receives payment and forwards the agreed
commission to the broker.
This symbiotic relationship between the car dealer and broker is flourishing
now that car tax has been halved. Furthermore, because cars in several
European countries can cost 40 per cent less than cars made in the UK, the
EC's competition directorate has drafted rules which may force down UK car
prices.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Management (The Growing Business): A longer life-line -
Japanese small companies are coping with hard times but whether they can
continue to do so remains questionable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the Japanese economy sneezes, it is its small businesses that catch
cold.
During previous economic downturns, small companies served as shock
absorbers to ease their big business customers over economic bumps. In their
role as subcontractors, small industrial concerns were often forced by their
big clients to cut profit margins for the components they supplied.
But small companies are now more successful in resisting profit squeezes and
weathering hard times. Although the number of bankruptcies has doubled among
small and medium-sized businesses since the height of the economic boom two
years ago, it is no worse than in 1987, when the economy suffered from the
yen's sharp appreciation. In addition, the percentage of bankruptcies among
industrial companies has fallen, while that for finance companies and small
retail outlets has grown.
One main reason for their survival, according to Tsuyoshi Nakai, director
for research of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry's Small and
Medium Enterprise Agency, is that many small manufacturing companies built
up large capital reserves during the economic boom of the late 1980s.
They also avoided investments in overvalued land and securities, and used
their earnings instead to acquire capital assets such as machinery. 'The
good liquidity situation means that most small and medium businesses can
survive for another year or two before encountering severe difficulties,'
said Nakai.
One good sign is that the profitability of small concerns, measured by the
ratio of earnings to sales, is not much different from the country's big
companies. Companies that have gone bankrupt have tended to be ones which
over-invested in production technology in the belief that the economy would
keep expanding rapidly.
The small business sector has benefited from a gradual restructuring. About
half of the small companies work as subcontractors to bigger concerns, but
they are reducing their dependence on a single company. 'The keiretsu
relationship is gradually disappearing as small companies develop niche
products that they can sell to several customers,' said Nakai. 'We are
shifting from a pyramid structure, with one company dominating thousands of
suppliers, to a network system that is more egalitarian.'
This has enabled small companies to assert themselves and refuse to accept
price cuts. Those with advanced products have a better bargaining position
than ones that turn out basic components.
The Arakawa district in Tokyo, for example, is home to more than 8,000
closely-packed family-owned workshops, with most employing fewer than 20
people. Almost all are subcontractors producing components for the car
industry as well as parts for bicycles, furniture and electrical appliances.
The downturn in the motor industry has particularly hurt the district, with
a 60 per cent drop in orders from a peak period in the early 1980s.
'Although demand is shrinking, companies are reluctant to reduce prices
because of the need to pay back loans and maintain wages,' said Mashiro
Kitagawa, deputy director of the Arakawa branch of the Tokyo Chamber of
Commerce. 'Instead, they are reducing their workforce, with some companies
now only relying on family members.'
The fall in land prices has had a beneficial effect on companies operating
in central Tokyo. 'The high rents that drove some companies out of the
district are coming down. This is easing the financial pressure on
businesses here,' Kitagawa adds.
But concerns remain about the long-term future of small businesses. It is
difficult for small concerns to get bank loans, and their ability to attract
labour will become more difficult as the economy improves. 'Many of the
family owners are even finding it tough to persuade their children to carry
on the business,' explains Atsushi Yamauchi, the project manager for the
Arakawa Chamber of Commerce.
These problems are not limited to Arakawa; they threaten the future of
Japanese small businesses. The need for Japanese banks to improve their
capital adequacy ratios could curb loans to small businesses. Even small
concerns that have used their own land as collateral may find it difficult
to secure new loans if land prices fall drastically.
'The tightening of credit to small businesses will damage their efforts to
develop new technologies, attract skilled workers such as engineers, and
introduce automation to replace workers,' said Nakai.
Moreover, automation may not be a practicable solution for companies too
small to use it effectively. Instead, they will need to attract workers in a
country suffering a serious labour shortage.
Finding new workers is likely to prove a formidable task. Wages are lower
and working hours longer at small companies. They are also associated with
3-D ('dirty, difficult and dangerous') jobs that most young Japanese now
shun. The government is encouraging small companies to improve their image
by reducing working hours, but most concerns are reluctant to do so because
this will increase costs.
Instead, they are pressing the government to increase the number of cheaper
foreign labourers allowed into Japan. Small companies are already among the
main employers of illegal workers - mainly from the Middle East and the
Indian subcontinent.
All this is discouraging the creation of new small companies. The proportion
of new businesses has fallen to 4 per cent of the total number of companies,
compared with 6 per cent 10 years ago. The ratio is lower for manufacturing
concerns - at 3 per cent.
Nakai believes that, if steps are taken, there could be a resurgence of
small businesses. Local governments should promote small businesses which
would serve as the focal point for regional development, with each area
specialising in a few industries. Small businesses could also co-operate in
such activities as distribution and marketing, in order to reduce costs and
increase their efficiency. Finally, they could seek foreign investment.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Consultancy and fool's
gold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARAH HEGARTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For John Ryan, consultancy is a dirty word. Three years ago as the director
of a small business making satellite television equipment, he had the chance
to expand into the German market. Aware that he needed advice, Ryan (not his
real name) contacted his local branch of the Department of Trade and
Industry, hoping for the subsidised consultancy help advertised as part of
the DTI's Enterprise Initiative.
According to Ryan, he 'got nowhere' with his approaches to the DTI. He
thought the help on offer was half the cost of one of the company directors
going to Germany; instead, after 'many weeks of phone calls and
discussions', it emerged that the DTI would provide a representative, and
would pay half his costs.
Ryan was disappointed: 'I didn't think anyone representing us could have
done as good a job as we would ourselves. And I didn't want cost of the
consultant's holiday.' He felt part of the problem was the size of his
business - it only employed eight staff, but 'they were treating us like a
big firm'.
According to the Federation of Small Businesses, Ryan was not alone. Around
the same period, the FSB's Birmingham office received many complaints about
the quality of consultancy advice to small businesses under the Enterprise
Initiative. The result was a meeting between the FSB and the local DTI
office to reinforce small business needs.
Both sides now agree things have improved: according to the local DTI
office, in the last year they have had only a handful of complaints, yet
have a total of 2,400 consultants on their books. FSB spokeswoman Fay
Goodman cautiously agrees. 'We haven't had as many complaints in the last
year, but more small businesses have been going bust, and they don't have
the money to get consultancy advice. We still get the impression there are
problems.'
Under the Enterprise Initiative, companies with less than 500 employees can
apply to the DTI for consultancy help. This can range from five to 15 days'
work, and half the costs will be paid by the DTI. In some areas of the UK
the department meets two-thirds of the cost.
According to the DTI, the role of matching consultant to company is the
responsibility of the organisations contracted to run the scheme. These each
cover a separate area, from design (the Design Council) to marketing (the
Chartered Institute of Marketing) and business planning (3i Industrial
Support Ltd).
At the Design Council, Helen Ives-Rose manages the Enterprise Initiative
design consultancy scheme. She says the council has 576 consultancy
practices on its books. 'To be considered for the scheme, they have to have
been in business for at least two years and be able to show successfully
completed work.'
Ives-Rose admits that some small firms can be disappointed with the help
they get. 'We do try to stress that they are unlikely to get a completed
project with 15 days' work. She adds that companies have to understand that
consultancy advice is expensive. 'There's no point in them getting advice
really cheaply and then wanting to carry on on their own and finding out
that they can't afford it.'
The DTI is confident that any complaints about the scheme are picked up by
its independent evaluations; according to a spokesman, studies carried out
in June 1989 and February 1991 found that 'over 50 per cent of the 420 firms
questioned were now more likely to use consultancy help in the future' and
'84 per cent reported that the scheme represented value for money'.
But at the FSB, Fay Goodman warns small businesses not to be over-impressed
with the idea of consultancy. 'It can sound so wonderful, and people do
think it's the answer to all their problems.'
For John Ryan, going it alone is now the only answer. After the collapse of
his satellite TV equipment business he is starting up again, but in a
different field. 'I'm not asking for any help now - you've got to do it
yourself.'

FT  18 AUG 92 / Call to halt loss of Pounds 1bn in VAT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN EXTRA Pounds 1bn of value added tax could be collected and the potential
for fraud arising from the single European market could be tackled if 2,000
more VAT inspectors were recruited, two civil service unions say.
The unions argue that the government's plan to cut 300 inspectors this year
and the decision not to deploy an extra 400 inspectors to deal with the
single market is a false economy.
Mr Mike King of the National Union of Civil and Public Servants said: 'It
seems madness that, at a time of massive fiscal deficit and when the single
market is putting millions of pounds of VAT at risk, the government has been
cutting the number of inspectors.'
The NUCPS is joining with the Civil and Public Services Association to lobby
the chancellor. The unions say Customs and Excise has calculated that each
VAT inspector last year discovered Pounds 270,000 of additional tax on
average, compared with an average cost of Pounds 25,000 for employing each
inspector. The level of 'productivity' had increased consistently over the
years.
The unions also say that the current level of VAT arrears is Pounds 1.6bn
and estimate the loss through evasion to be Pounds 1bn.
The unions say that an extra 2,000 staff would cost Pounds 48m a year but
the direct benefit in extra revenue would be Pounds 452m and the benefit
from preventing fraud or non-payment through ignorance would be an extra
Pounds 556m - making an annual overall gain of Pounds 1bn.
The CPSA and NUCPS will ballot members next month on industrial action over
government plans to move staff from Westminster to Canary Wharf in London's
troubled Docklands. Members will vote on whether to withdraw goodwill or
work to rule.
Staff at the environment and transport departments oppose the planned move
because they say it would mean extra travelling and disruption for a
workforce already under pressure from staff cuts.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Banks warned of severe staff crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDUSTRIAL relations in clearing banks are threatened by an unprecedented
mixture of job losses, branch restructuring and truncated promotion
prospects, according to a report to be published this week.
Although banks are attempting to change staff relations policies to cope
with their moves towards increased competitiveness, new tensions and the
breakdown of the old 'paternalism' are putting staff loyalty at risk, the
report says.
'Staff trust in management appears to be at a low ebb, producing the seeds
for future conflicts. The level of resistance, of grievance and of
resentment remains high,' say the study's authors, Mr Peter Cressey, a
sociology lecturer, and Mr Peter Scott, a research officer, both of Bath
University.
The paper points to the significant job losses, with the number employed in
banking as a whole falling from 504,000 in 1990 to 450,000 last year, as one
factor in the destabilisation.
Career structures are also being affected by banks' increased emphasis on
the ability to sell financial products and services to customers. 'There is
considerable resistance among the banks' lower and middle managerial staffs,
aged in their 40s and above, to the idea of the bank administrator as a
salesperson first and foremost,' the report says.
In addition, recruitment is becoming increasingly segmented. As management
and technical services become more specialised, the banks are employing an
increasing number of part-time workers, mainly women, whose promotion
prospects out of clerical jobs are limited.
This latter group is becoming increasingly dissatisfied, says the report.
The study says that each of the 'stabilising pillars of employment levels,
employees' career structure and industrial relations at the banks has
individually been threatened before. What is new is that rather than being
relatively self-contained in their own spheres, they are now interwoven
constituents of a general crisis in employment relations.'

FT  18 AUG 92 / Bush spurred by hopes that Saddam is nearly finished
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush insists, probably honestly, that he is not seeking a
military showdown with President Saddam Hussein or seeking to manipulate the
situation in the Gulf for his own domestic political advantage. The
political key to the present increase in tension lies far more in the
additional damage that could be done to Mr Bush during the next three months
by Mr Saddam, rather than the punishment that can be inflicted on the Iraqi
leader by US air strikes.
The hollowness of the Gulf war victory, as it has come to be seen in US
domestic political terms, was fully brought home to the administration last
month when, for nearly three weeks, the Iraqis denied UN weapons inspectors
access to the ministry of agriculture, in defiance of UN ceasefire
resolutions. Baghdad presented the affair as a great national triumph, Mr
Saddam went for a much-photographed swim in the Tigris, and US officials
acknowledged that they had been been caught badly off balance.
It was an event that the White House was determined should not be repeated
in the run-up to November's presidential election, in which Mr Bush is
already trailing Governor Bill Clinton, his Democratic rival. The timing of
the weekend's revelations of increased US military preparedness in the Gulf
owed more to the fact that the UN weapons inspection team was completing its
latest searches in and around Baghdad than to the Republican party national
convention which opened yesterday in Houston.
As senior party members pointed out, the last thing they wanted was for
Saddam Hussein to deflect national attention from the official launch of the
Republican campaign and it was certainly not something Mr Bush would
deliberately choose to happen. They also doubted whether there was a great
deal of political advantage to be reaped by bombing Baghdad, but there was
much to be lost by allowing Mr Saddam to claim another victory.
Part of this damage-limitation exercise appears to have paid off already,
with the present visit by weapons inspectors in Iraq apparently concluding
without Baghdad challenging the UN's authority. However, US policy is also
directed to the overthrow of Mr Saddam and longer-term planning to achieve
that objective continues.
Evidence of this is now emerging from what seems to be a US-led allied
decision to establish an exclusion zone below the 32nd parallel in southern
Iraq below which Iraqi aircraft will not be permitted to fly. It is a move
that the US has been reluctant to make, despite powerful evidence of
repeated violations of UN resolutions by Baghdad.
Western forces stood by when, in the immediate aftermath of the Gulf war,
Saddam Hussein stamped out the Shia uprising in the south.
Mounting evidence that the Iraqi regime is now deploying both helicopters
and fixed-wing aircraft against the Shia may have tipped the US hand.
Representatives of exiled Iraqi opposition groups last month called on Mr
James Baker, then secretary of state, and last week evidence was produced to
the UN Security Council of continuing atrocities in the south.
What seems to have been holding the administration back is its determination
to avoid become involved in the political dismemberment of Iraq and its fear
that Iran would be the main beneficiary of any allied intervention on behalf
of the southern Shias. Arab leaders in the Gulf are themselves divided over
the wisdom of seeking to divide Iraq into three parts with the Kurds in the
north, the Sunni Moslems in the centre, and the Shias to the south.
Set against that is the conviction among some sections of the Bush
administration that Saddam Hussein is now closer than ever to be being
toppled. They point to a serious economic situation with inflation out of
control and basic foodstuffs ever scarcer. The recent execution of an
estimated 40 traders accused of making excessive profits is cited as
evidence of the desperate state of the regime. It is argued that a further
twist of the screw now, by giving protection to the Shias, could push the
regime over the edge.
The fall of Saddam Hussein in the next three months, whoever or whatever
replaced him, would be a political bonus for Mr Bush. But if Mr Saddam is to
survive, the administration is determined he should at least be quiescent.

ARAB participants in Middle East peace talks due to resume next week are
threatening to delay their arrival in Washington in protest at the US
decision to grant Israel billions of dollars in loan guarantees without
first insisting on a settlement freeze.
The Palestine Liberation Organisation has summoned delegates to its Tunis
headquarters to discuss tactics before the Washington round. PLO hardliners
have demanded that the Palestinians boycott the talks until they get
undertakings that work on Jewish settlements will be stopped.
Palestinian officials have denounced President Bush's decision to grant some
Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.2bn) in guarantees without making public details of
understandings reached with Israel over settlements in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
The four Arab parties to the peace talks - Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and the
Palestinians - are expected to meet in the next few days to discuss the
settlement issue. Their last meeting as a group was in Damascus in July.
Comments last week by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, on his
return from the US, that his government was pressing on with 11,000 homes
already under construction in the territories, have infuriated Palestinians.
They are demanding that work on these structures be stopped as a gesture of
good will, and that construction on new dwellings in Jerusalem and its
environs also be curbed.
Palestinian delegates to the peace talks were briefed at the weekend on the
US position by the American consul in Jerusalem. Sketchy details provided by
the US official did not allay Palestinian suspicions that Mr Bush had
softened earlier US demands that Israel freeze settlements.

A NIGHT-LONG rocket duel between rebel forces and pro-government troops
ended early yesterday with defence ministry officials claiming to have
repulsed the attack, AP reports from Kabul. For a week rebels loyal to
fundamentalist rebel Gulbuddin Hekmatyar have been pounding the capital with
rockets, killing an estimated 1,000 people.
The three-month-old Afghan government expelled Mr Hekmatyar and his
fundamentalist Hezb-e-Islami group last Friday. Mr Hekmatyar has vowed to
destroy the capital unless an Uzbek militia, led by Gen Rashid Dostam, is
evicted from Kabul.
Clashes between rival Sunni and Shia rebels on the western outskirts of
Kabul have been aggravating the violence in the city.

ONE IN every seven students enrolling in Chinese universities at the start
of the new academic year next month will pay for the privilege, writes
Yvonne Preston from Beijing.
The 100,000 new fee-paying students is the highest number in the 40 years
since China's universities were nationalised and tuition fees abolished.
Fees are 2,000 yuan (Pounds 190) a year. Students who pay their own way must
find their own jobs on graduation. Free education is for students passing
the highly competitive university entrance exams who are mostly assigned
jobs at the end of their courses. Even they pay fees of around Pounds 19 a
year.
The State Education Commission said growth in the number of fee-paying
students was a natural outcome of the reform drive of Deng Xiaoping.

crush rebellion

THE death toll in the disputed Abkhazia region of west Georgia rose
yesterday to at least 40, with Georgian leaders vowing they would crush the
rebellion in renewed military action today.
Mr Tengiz Kitovani, Georgia's defence minister, yesterday demanded the
immediate resignation of Abkhazia's parliamentary leader, Mr Vladislav
Ardzinba.
'If he declines, we shall move forces into Sukhumi and disband his illegal
parliament,' he told Reuters at the former dacha of Josef Stalin on the
Black Sea coast.
The Abkhazian leadership said they would not back down and appealed to the
leaders of the Commonwealth of Independent States and the United Nations to
persuade Georgia to withdraw its forces.
Fierce fighting erupted in Sukhumi, Abkhazia's capital, last week as
Georgian forces reacted to the kidnapping of several senior officials,
including the interior minister.
Although the officials were subsequently released, Georgia continued to
press for the re-integration of the breakaway Abkhazian region, which
declared its independence last month.
The centre of Sukhumi has been ravaged by gun battles as Georgian troops
have fought Abkhazian irregulars. Looting broke out on Sunday night after
the two sides began to disengage in line with a fragile ceasefire.
Georgia has put the death toll from the recent fighting at 40. But the
independent Interfax newsagency quoted Abkhazian health ministry sources
saying that at least 50 people had been killed with more than 200 wounded.
Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the Georgian leader, is determined to preserve the
integrity of the Georgian state both from the rebel region of Abkhazia and
the still active forces of Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia, Georgia's ex-president,
who was deposed after a violent revolt in January.
Mr Shevardnadze told a radio interviewer yesterday: 'I will do all I can to
secure the unity of Georgia. I will be first in the ranks of fighters for
every handful of Georgian soil.'

<TEXT>
ARMENIAN President Levon Ter-Petrosian yesterday defended himself against a
growing tide of opposition to his handling ofthe war with neighbouring
Azerbaijan.
Last night he won a parliamentary motion of no-confidence after three days
of protests in the capital sparked by a series of Armenian setbacks in the
war. Observers said that up to 50,000 people attended a rally in Yerevan
last Friday, in which speakers demanded that Mr Ter-Petrosian resign.
'If I saw Ter-Petrosian, I'd kill him,' said Mr Valeri Mirzaian, 46, an
Armenian soldier who attended an opposition rally on Sunday night at
Yerevan's Liberty Square. 'We're not losing Karabakh. We're losing Armenia.'
The four-year old war is centred on the Armenian enclave of
Nagorno-Karabakh, which lies entirely within Azerbaijan. But the fighting
has recently spilled over into other areas.
The weekend protesters in Yerevan expressed dismay with Azeri success in
capturing several Armenian enclaves lying within Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan
controls the north of Nagorno-Karabakh, or one-fourth of the enclave. Last
week, Azerbaijan also captured the Armenian region of Artsvashen.
Mr Ter-Petrosian is thought still to enjoy majority support in the republic
of 3.3m people. But 'the opposition is growing stronger every day,' said a
western diplomat in Yerevan.
Mr Raffi Hovannisian, the foreign minister, defended the president's
policies, and said Armenia might 'reply in kind' to Azeri bombing last week
of border villages. Mr Hovannisian also said the government might declare
emergency rule 'in the immediate future' in those regions bordering
Azerbaijan. 'Azerbaijan is carrying out a military final solution,' he said.

MR Mikhail Gorbachev, Russia's most famous private citizen, yesterday urged
the country's leaders to speed up reform, warning of dire consequences if
they failed in their task.
'I lagged behind events and they are doing the same today. If the leaders of
Russia and the Commonwealth do not take the initiative, then others will
seize it from them,' the former Soviet president said.
His warning struck an ominous chord only two days before the first
anniversary of the coup that hastened the disintegration of the Soviet
Union.
Although Mr Gorbachev thought that only an 'idiot or a crazy man' would
attempt another coup, he warned of a more gradual and sinister coalescence
of anti-democratic forces, threatening dictatorship or some form of
neo-Bolshevism.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Slow death by a thousand rumours of resignation: Why
Russia's foreign minister has been hurt, perhaps fatally, by a campaign of
denigration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FOREIGN policy of Russia is being conducted by a man who has been
injured, it may be fatally, by a campaign of denigration and hostility which
has gone so far as to threaten the effectiveness of his actions.
Mr Andrei Kozyrev is increasingly cut out of the important decisions which
confront the Russian state in the world. Most recently, he suffered the
public snub of seeing Mr Mikhail Poltoranin, a vice premier and a confidant
of Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, going to Japan to prepare the
way for Mr Yeltsin's trip there next month.
Mr Kozyrev has played little part in arranging the truces - still more or
less holding - in the hot spots around the Russian borders. He seems to have
no special relationship with Mr Yeltsin and has been unable to find a
reliable base in the parliament - whose more active members are pursuing
their own international agendas.
He has succeeded in retaining his position for now - but it hangs by a
string held by the Russian president. There are many in the foreign
diplomatic community who fault Mr Kozyrev on grounds of style and tactics.
He has never defined a foreign policy, saying only that 'the essence of the
concept . . . is to create a favourable environment for the transformation
of Russia' - hardly a help to foreign governments trying to discern a
pattern. He has been frenetic in his travelling, as yet to no great purpose.
The attacks on him are not motivated by a desire to replace him with someone
diplomatically or strategically more effective.
The main reason for his slow death by a thousand rumours of resignation is
that he is out of fashion: he tries to continue a pro-western liberal
tradition which had been all the rage in government until a few months ago -
but is now on the wane.
Mr Vitaly Tretyakov, editor of the Nezavisimaya Gazeta (the daily voice of
Moscow's intelligentsia) wrote in a front page editorial column last month
that, were Mr Kozyrev to be forced into resignation, then the only liberals
left in government would be the few clustered round Mr Yegor Gaidar, the
acting prime minister.
It was all quite different when Mr Kozyrev took over the Russian foreign
ministry over a year ago.
Then, his rhetoric was based on the assumption that the collapse of Soviet
structures would inevitably give the new states the opportunity to advance
rational and pacific relations with the rest of the world.
'Our task,' he said in an interview last December, as the Soviet Union
collapsed, 'is, as Andrei Sakharov once said, not to be buried under the
rubble of a decomposing empire . . . . I think that such a threat is more
distant now than before'.
Less than four months later these words were hollow: the congress of Russian
peoples' deputies, meeting in April, saw him as a traitor prepared to sell
Russian interests - and Russian people - to placate the resurgent
nationalisms in what had been subject races. The congress forced him on the
defensive: yet he did not drop his fundamental positions.
The congress made him aware that distrust of him stretched beyond the ranks
of the ultra-nationalists and the former Communists, who had made common
cause.
His former democrat allies saw him as vacillating: a motion produced at the
congress demanding the return of the Crimea from Ukrainian to Russian
control was framed by radical democrats.
'What these super patriots are trying to do,' said Mr Kozyrev, 'is again to
make everything a matter of ideology. It's the old Bolshevik mentality: they
try to depict me as an enemy of the people, a traitor to the county.
'That's why they hate my foreign policy so much: for 70 years we could point
to someone and say - there's the enemy - and I am trying to change all that
. . . but I am pessimistic . . . I think sooner or later we will have a
confrontation on foreign policy'.
The confrontation is now upon him, its emotive power drawn from the plight
of Russians outside the Russian borders.
In the self-declared TransDnestrian Republic in Moldova, the majority Slavs
came under the attack of the Moldovan army (a fragile ceasefire has been
kept).
In all of the Baltic states, Russians are being treated as second-class
citizens, and tension is rising (particularly in Estonia, where a firefight
broke out at the end of July between Russian and Estonian soldiers).
As Mr Yeltsin's trip to Japan gets closer, there are accusations that the
foreign office is preparing a sell-out on the Kurile Islands consigning
Russians to Japan or forcing them off their island homes. Japan is
energetically reclaiming the four islands, seized by Russia at the end of
the last war.
Mr Kozyrev, trying to keep going civilised discussion, found himself under
yet more ferocious attack - including from one-time liberals such as Mr
Sergei Stankevich, a Yeltsin adviser and Mr Oleg Rumyantsev, head of the
Social Democratic party.
Goaded, the foreign minister himself lashed out - in an interview with the
daily paper Izvestia. 'The party of war is rearing its head in our country.
Why are the military deciding on all major political questions? I think that
the threat of an anti-democratic coup does exist.' Days later, a collection
of generals and colonels from the military and security forces denounced Mr
Kozyrev for daring to suggest that they would act undemocratically.
He survived that, but barely. He continues to plan his calendar for the
autumn and later like a man with a future ahead of him.
But he must know it is a highly conditional future - conditional on the
outcome of a struggle for power, and for influence with the president,
within the Russian leadership which daily grows more intense.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Danish opposition to EC union grows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, European Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DANISH voters, who threw a spanner in the EC's works two months ago by
rejecting the Maastricht treaty, appear to have grown still more resolute in
their opposition to European union.
An opinion poll published yesterday indicated that 57 per cent of Danes
would now vote against the Maastricht treaty with only 43 per cent in
favour.
The survey - in the financial newspaper Borsen - also showed large
opposition to a common European currency, with 54 per cent of Danes opposed
and only 31 per cent supporting it.
The poll underlines the difficulties faced by the EC in its attempt to find
a compromise with Denmark this autumn to bring the country back to the
mainstream of the Maastricht process.
Even if the French electorate vote 'yes' to Maastricht in next month's
referendum in France, the treaty will still need to win backing from Denmark
before it can go into effect as planned next year.
Latest French opinion polls point to a narrow majority in favour of the
treaty in next month's referendum. But since it will partly be a vote of
confidence in President Francois Mitterrand, the outcome will be heavily
affected by domestic politics.
The Danish government intends to bring out a white paper after the French
referendum on September 20 to outline ways of gaining electoral acceptance
for the treaty, as demanded by Copenhagen's ratification procedures.
Denmark's dilemma is however that full-scale renegotiation of the treaty is
unacceptable to its EC partners.
The most likely option being examined in Copenhagen is to insert into the
document additional pledges against centralisation of EC power. This,
however, probably would not prove sufficient to persuade anti-Maastricht
Danes to vote 'yes' in a second referendum.
Denmark's deliberations are of crucial interest to the UK government,
currently holding the Community presidency.
Assuming a French 'yes' next month, Britain will still not reintroduce the
Maastricht ratification bill to the House of Commons until Denmark has made
plausible proposals on how to resubmit the treaty to the Danish electorate.
Whitehall officials say the bill may be reintroduced in October or November,
but it may be delayed until the beginning of next year.
British officials said yesterday that the opinion poll - emphasised the
pressure on the Danish government to come up with an acceptable formula. 'It
was always very difficult to see how the Danes would change their mind just
like that,' one British diplomat said.
Yesterday's poll showed a significant increase in the strength of Danish
'No' feeling compared with the June referendum, when the electorate rejected
Maastricht by a narrow 51 to 49 per cent.
Yesterday's survey indicated that 47 per cent of Danes would approve a new
treaty if commitments to closer European political and military cooperation
were omitted, with only 33 per cent opposed.
However, since such a drastic rewriting of the treaty would effectively rip
out its core, this particular option is clearly not on offer as a way of
pacifying anti-Maastricht feeling.
Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the Danish foreign minister, has refused to comment
on his country's plans for solving the imbroglio until after the French
vote.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Britain prepared to join US in air strikes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH forces are ready to join the US in air strikes against Iraq if the
Baghdad government continues to flout United Nations resolutions, the
government signalled yesterday.
Downing Street officials played down speculation that strikes were imminent.
But they confirmed Mr John Major would discuss the option at a meeting with
senior ministers this morning
UK officials emphasised that Mr Major had yet to make any final decisions.
The prime minister is said to be uncertain whether military action would
require further deliberation at the UN Security Council or whether it would
be authorised under existing resolutions.
Legal experts are expected to clarify the position at today's meeting. But
one senior official said that even if no further resolutions technically
were required, Mr Major would prefer specific UN authorisation for air
strikes.
The officials added that the bombing of military installations and
government buildings was only one of the options under consideration to
force compliance with UN decisions.
Mr Major is interrupting a holiday in Spain to attend today's meeting which
will discuss Iraq as well as next week's international conference on
Yugoslavia.
The officials indicated that the brunt of any military action would be borne
by the US. But UK aircraft could operate from several bases in the region.
The RAF has a small number of Jaguar fighters stationed in Turkey to protect
the safe havens for the Kurds in northern Iraq. Squadrons of Tornado ground
attack aircraft regularly operate from Cyprus and others could be quickly
deployed in Bahrain if the strikes went ahead.
The Royal Navy's three-vessel Armilla Patrol is also in the region and the
Type 42 destroyer HMS Edinburgh is currently involved in a training exercise
with the Kuwaitis.

FT  18 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Rally extended in sluggish turnover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECOVERY in the UK stock market was extended yesterday as investors
continued to hope that Friday's better news on inflation might open the way
for lower interest rates and thus prompt recovery in European economies.
Equities were helped at the close by reports of a successful outcome to the
auction of government bonds.
However, reports on the UK economy remained unconvincing and yesterday's
buyers of shares appeared to be mostly professionals wanting stock to meet
selling commitments taken on during the market's seven-day slide. The
institutions played a cautious role, and trading volume was thin.
The upturn came in the second half of the session, and was led from the
stock index futures sector when the September future moved towards the 2,400
mark. In the stock market itself, there were further gains among building
and construction shares, and hopes for recovery in the US dollar spurred
rises in dollar-orientated issues.
By the close, the FT-SE Index had put on 19.3 to register 2,376.1, the best
level of the day. Seaq volume, in spite of the improvement in the latter
half of the session, reached a mere 315.3m shares. Friday's total of 449.7m
represented only Pounds 820.2m in retail or genuine investment business.
These volume statistics tend to confirm that the recovery in share prices
since Friday afternoon has been spurred by intra-market business, as
marketmaking houses have competed with one another to buy stock ahead of the
close on Friday of the equity trading account.
Yesterday's session opened uncertainly, with mixed signals coming from the
retail sector. The latest survey of distributive trades from the
Confederation of British Industry reported the worst spending figures for a
decade. However, this was offset by interim results from Argos, the discount
retailer, which disclosed higher sales and some optimistic signs on the
outlook for the rest of the year.
The market lost its early gains but managed to rise again in lacklustre
business. The absence of significant profit-taking after Friday's rally was
encouraging and helped share prices to move forward.
The rebound in building and construction shares came in spite of a report
from the Bank of England that about 1m, or one tenth, of the householders in
the UK now have mortgages greater than the market value of their houses. A
leading UK estate agent reported that building land has lost 62 per cent of
its value over the past three years.
The uncertainty in the stock market was reflected by comments from equity
strategists. Mr Nicholas Knight, the bearish analyst at Nomura Research,
said: 'The knock-out punch is fast approaching in our opinion  - a rise in
UK interest rates.'
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew says its economic forecasts can no longer be described
as sugg-esting modest recovery 'even on the most charitable interpretation'.
Mr Peter Thorne at Nikko, however, believes equities are oversold and
represent 'excellent fundamental value'.

FT  18 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SQUEEZE late in the day led to a firm finish for stock index futures after
a volatile session characterised by thin trading, writes Joel Kibazo.
The September contract on the FT-SE opened at 2,381 before moving forward to
2,384 within minutes of the opening. However, the upward momentum failed to
hold as dealers focused on falls in gilts and short sterling, together with
the negative CBI retail trades survey. This sent the contract falling to
2,362 by mid-morning.
After a bout of sideways trading over the lunch-time period, a squeeze
developed in the September future, helping it to rally from the earlier
fall, with demand said to have been led by buying from Salomon Brothers. The
firm early showing by Wall Street sent September further forward before it
tailed off just before the close on profit-taking.
September ended at 2,389, just one below Friday's close and around two
points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 12. Turnover
at 8,335 was poor.
Traded options were dull, with volume totalling 24,341 lots. The FT-SE 100
option had 7,125 contracts dealt. Fisons was the most active stock option on
2,682 lots, with the 180 calls the busiest series.

little changed, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 4.05 down at 3,324.89, having
spent the day moving within a narrow range. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up
0.83 at 420.74 and the Nasdaq composite 0.71 easier at 572.47. Turnover on
the New York SE was typically light for a midsummer session at just 152.8m
shares.
Before trading opened, analysts had suggested that prices would start firmer
on the belief that President Bush's popularity could gain a big boost from
the week-long convention. There was also talk that the possible renewal of
conflict in the Gulf might also help the president's poll standings.
These hopes never translated into buying, and with many institutional
investors staying out of the market during the height of the summer
doldrums, share prices drifted uneasily in light trading. Analysts, however,
noted that the ex-dividend trading of several large stocks meant that the
Dow was a few points lower than it might have been on an ordinary day, and
that another sharp fall in bond prices kept optimism in check.
The one bright spot was the airlines sector, which attracted strong demand
after Mr Kevin Murphy of Morgan Stanley, a leading industry analyst, was
reported to be recommending that now is the best time to buy airline shares,
in view of the generally negative coverage of the industry.
Among those receiving a boost were UAL, up Dollars 2 at Dollars 109 1/4 ,
Delta, Dollars  3/8 firmer at Dollars 51 7/8 , and USAir, Dollars 1/2 ahead
at Dollars 13 1/2 . AMR, parent of American Airlines, lost an early gain to
end a net Dollars  1/8 down at Dollars 59 1/8 .
On the American Stock Exchange, amid heavy selling Wang Laboratories plunged
Dollars  7/8 further to Dollars  3/4 in turnover of 3.2m shares on
speculation that the troubled company will not get an agreed cash injection
from IBM that could have been worth as much as Dollars 75m. IBM was up
Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 88 5/8 .
Eljer Industries jumped Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 10 after a court ruled in
its favour on an appeal of a judgment about insurance coverage for a
polybutylene plumbing system. American Health fell Dollars 3 7/8 to Dollars
26 after the company restated its second-quarter results from a profit of 54
cents a share to a loss of Dollars 2.07 in the wake of a Dollars 54m
writedown.
Canada
TORONTO showed a bias to higher levels in continued moderate trading. The
TSE 300 index finished 11.3 firmer at 3,379.8, while rises outpaced declines
by 286 to 231 after volume of 22.2m shares.
PWA, off 4 cents at CDollars 2.90, rejected a merger proposal from Air
Canada and said it would again seek an alliance of its Canadian Airlines
International unit with American Airlines. PWA also reported a
second-quarter loss little changed at CDollars 34.4m. Air Canada, which late
on Friday announced wider second-quarter and six-month losses, shed 20 cents
to CDollars 4.30.
TransAlta Utilities, up CDollars  1/8 at CDollars 14 1/8 , posted slightly
higher six-month earnings.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Money Markets: Lighter mood
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS a lighter mood in both the sterling futures and cash markets
yesterday morning as the pound managed to stay above DM2.8200 on the foreign
exchanges. In the afternoon, however, the atmosphere darkened as the
currency slid back, and traders grew anxious about German and British
indicators due out later in the week.
In the morning, the markets were still being lifted by Friday's bullish news
out of Germany, especially the wholesale prices figure for July, down 1.3
per cent from the previous month. Short dates in the sterling cash market
also softened after traders removed most of the Pounds 1.2bn shortage
forecast by the Bank of England in early operations.
The softer tone to period rates in cash lasted throughout the day. One-month
money closed  1/8 easier on the offered side at 9 15/16 per cent, and the
three-month ended at 10 7/32 per cent offered, down from 10 1/4 per cent.
But the underlying pessimism about a rate cut maintained the yield curve:
both six-month money and the one-year finished at 10 3/8 per cent on the
offered side.
Futures dipped in the afternoon as the pound lost its early gains on the
currency market. After opening at 89.72, the September short sterling
contract fell to a low of 89.67 and closed 3 basis points down on the day.
The December contract ended 4 basis points off at 89.75.
Several factors subdued futures dealers. Mr Lothar Mueller, a Bundesbank
board member, said at the weekend that the central bank would quickly raise
the Lombard rate if last month's discount rate increase was seen to have no
effect. Dealers are also concerned about the figure for M3 money supply in
Germany, the guide to Bundesbank monetary policy, which is due out this
week.
Whatever their long-term views on rates, few expect a rate change in Britain
or Germany between now and the French referendum on Maastricht, and dealers
were therefore selling bills to the Bank of England rather than running
portfolios. In the early round, the Bank purchased Pounds 210m of Band 1
bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent, and Pounds 800m in a repurchase agreement
(repo) at 9 15/16 per cent. The shortage was later revised to Pounds 1.1bn
and the Bank did not operate in the afternoon.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar loses D-Mark gain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR surrendered an early gain against the D-Mark yesterday as the
foreign exchange markets ignored a series of factors that might have been
expected to boost the currency, writes James Blitz.
In early European trading, the dollar peaked at DM1.4761 as dealers
continued to digest the promising economic news out of Germany. July's
figure for wholesale price inflation, down 1.3 per cent on the month, could
signal a turning point in the German economy, reducing the need for a
Lombard rate rise.
When US trading opened, the good news was forgotten. The dollar dipped well
in excess of a pfennig to a low of DM1.4610, and ended in Europe at
DM1.4630, down 55 basis points from Friday. Yesterday's close in New York
was DM1.4645.
There is still a creeping uncertainty in the market as to where the dollar
is going. In its latest currency report, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said the risks
to holding dollars will fall over the next month, supporting the US currency
at the upper end of the DM1.4500 to DM1.5050 trading range. Others believe
that if this week's figure for July M3 money supply in Germany emerges worse
than expected, at 9 per cent or above, the market will test the dollar's
historic lows again.
A Bundesbank council member compounded the gloom at the weekend, saying the
Lombard rate will only be cut when M3 is back in the 3.5 to 5.5 per cent
target range, and inflation is below 3 per cent.
Whatever view is taken, the dollar is undeniably weak. Mr Jim O'Neill, head
of research at Swiss Bank Corporation in London, said: 'There was talk of
new military action against Iraq at the weekend, there was talk of a new
fiscal stimulus in the US, and the Republican convention is under way in
Houston. All this should have led to a stronger dollar today. It did not.'
By contrast, the markets ought to have seen a much weaker pound on the back
of even gloomier UK statistics. The Confederation of British Industry
announced a sharp year-on-year fall in retail sales in July and the Bank of
England said more than 1m households may be trapped in homes that are less
than the value of their mortgage loans. But sterling ended  1/4 pfennig
above Friday's close at DM2.8175. It was nearly a cent stronger against the
dollar at Dollars 1.9260.
The Italian lira firmed a little as the effect of Moody's downgrading of
Italy's foreign debt wore off. The lira closed at L759.0 to the D-Mark after
a previous L759.9. The Swiss franc was firmer against the D-Mark at
SFr0.899, compared with SFr0.901. A dealer said that uncertainty over
European union continued to strengthen the 'Swissie's' reputation as a
secure haven.

FT  18 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Managers find faith in
index-matching strategies - Passive management techniques
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN's leading fund managers, who pride themselves on their stock-picking
skills, have long scorned passive management techniques. But the passive
strategy used in index matching is increasingly being seen as an option for
pension fund managers who have lost faith in the roller-coaster performance
records of many of Britain's top money managers.
An indexed portfolio consists of all the shares in an index whose
performance the fund manager wishes to track and in a proportion to each
company's capitalisation. It requires no analysis of each share's underlying
performance or prospects.
The Wellcome Trust, the medical research charity, announced recently it
would use index matching to manage half the equities portion of a portfolio
it intended to buy with proceeds from a recent sale of Wellcome shares.
Mr Roger Gibbs, chairman of Wellcome Trust, said that tracking the FT-A All
Share Index of 654 UK stocks seemed a logical approach for a charity whose
liabilities were in Britain. While active fund managers can and do
out-perform the index, they rarely do so consistently. And in the interim,
fees for index tracking are well below those charged by active managers.
Passive management was boosted several weeks ago when Marks and Spencer, the
UK retailer, announced its Pounds 1bn pension fund was dropping its
classic-style fund managers in favour of an index-tracking house.
Barclays de Zoete Wedd Investment Management, the UK's largest external
index-tracking fund manager, won the Marks and Spencer account against two
top-drawer 'active' managers, Prudential Portfolio Management and Mercury
Asset Management.
'There's been an increasing trend towards index matching over the past four
years,' said Mr John Clamp, chief executive of Combined Actuarial
Performance Services, a pension fund performance measurement service. Mr
Clamp estimates that 15 to 20 per cent of UK pension assets under management
are managed on a passive basis, with one fund, the Pounds 20bn scheme of the
Post Office and British Telecommunications accounting for about a quarter of
that. Roughly Pounds 12bn of the fund is managed using index-matching
techniques.
Mr James Woodlock, director of BZW Asset Management, the UK's largest
external manager of indexed funds, said that passively managed funds under
its management have grown from Pounds 3.5bn at the end of 1987 to Pounds
8.5bn by the end of 1991. Since the start of this year, indexed funds have
risen by another Pounds 3bn and they now account for nearly half of BZW's
Pounds 25bn under management.
Mr Woodlock said that clients were attracted by greater certainty of return
offered by index matching, even if it rules out the potential for
out-performing key stock indices. Fees and transactions costs are lower,
partly because fewer transactions need occur, he added.
Some supporters of index tracking say it is the fee structure which rewards
passive managers less generously than active managers, that has caused UK
fund managers to resist it.
WM Company, a pension fund performance measurement service, estimates the
market at a somewhat smaller but still significant 12 to 15 per cent of all
funds under management.
In the year ended 1991, WM Company noted that 90 per cent of the indexed
funds which it monitors had out-performed the index. This suggests that
index-tracking fund managers have some way to go to improve their technique
if they are to exactly match the key FT-All share index. In seeking to
explain the tracking error, WM said it believes that a number of partly-paid
issues and the distribution of various rights offerings distorted
calculations of returns.
By comparison, over half the actively managed funds had under-performed the
index. Also, the weighted average return of active fund managers measured by
the WM index in 1991 was 20.0 per cent, compared with 21.1 per cent for
index fund managers.
Not all those who have shifted to passive management have done so because
active managers offered disappointing results. One large UK pension fund
with roughly Pounds 6bn under management said it chose index matching
because the size of the scheme was impairing the ability to move in and out
of shares quickly. 'The number of stocks in which we choose to be active is
60 to 100. But the size of our equity portfolio had become so large we
couldn't manage that effectively,' he said. Sticking to manageable stakes
would have required investment in far more companies than the in-house fund
manager felt could be monitored effectively.
Mr Robert Colville, director of Financial Activities at M&amp;S, said the
company had decided to switch its pension scheme to a largely index-matched
system of management after conducting an analysis of asset and liability
classes.
Mr Colville said the investment approach used by active managers appeared
incompatible for a mature fund such as Marks and Spencer which had a large
pensioner population looming. Indexation allows the pension scheme to tie
its returns more closely to those of the stock market providing an element
of inflation-proofing for investment returns.
About 20 per cent of the fund remains in the hands of Phillips &amp; Drew Fund
Managers who handle the fixed interest portion.
In the US, roughly 51 per cent of domestic equity pension fund assets are
managed using index-matching techniques in a trend begun in the 1970s. Index
matching has taken a long time to cross the Atlantic.
Mr David Damant, managing director of MAP Securities, said: 'There is a
certain distrust among UK fund managers of anything academic and index
matching is a rather academic discipline.'

FT  18 AUG 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries fall sharply at long end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
LONG-dated US Treasury securities fell sharply yesterday on fears that
President Bush may announce tax cuts in his acceptance speech later this
week at the Republican convention.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  17/32 at 98
21/32 , yielding 7.356 per cent, although that was above its lows for the
day. The two-year note was little changed, however, up just 1/32 at 100 5/16
to yield 4.064 per cent.
After an impressive month-long rally, the Treasury market has suddenly been
gripped by worries that President Bush is willing to sacrifice his long-term
goal of balancing the budget in favour of a short-term economic stimulus in
the shape of a tax cut.
UK government bonds continued to rise yesterday, following Friday's strong
rally on the back of favourable inflation figures.
Yesterday's rise was held in check by sterling weakness but the Liffe gilt
futures contract rose from 97.17 to trade at 97.23 by late afternoon while
in the cash market, medium-dated issues made the strongest gains.
The 9 3/4 per cent gilt due 2002 rose from 103 7/32 to 103 3/8 to yield 9.22
per cent while shorter-dated issues were little changed on the day.
DEALERS reported firm buying interest in French government bonds with
investors apparently anticipating a favourable result in an opinion poll on
the government due to be published this week.
The yield on the 8 1/2 per cent bond due 2002 fell from 8.97 per cent to
8.92 per cent, while the Matif futures contract climbed from 105.92 to
106.08. The release of favourable inflation data had little impact on the
market.
Elsewhere in Europe, German government bonds ended the day only slightly
higher after Friday's strong gains, but dealers said the market was awaiting
the key money supply data due out later this week.
JAPANESE government bonds rallied yesterday afternoon after a weak start,
with the futures contract reaching its highest level since September 1989.
Profit-taking pushed the bond market lower at the start of trading, with the
yield on the benchmark No 129 moving from its opening of 4.8 per cent to
4.83 per cent. Dealers noted modest buying interest and short-covering later
in the trading session, pushing the yield on the No 129 to 4.77 per cent.

FT  18 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Pfizer to float stake in
minerals business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PFIZER, one of the largest US drug companies, yesterday announced plans to
float a majority interest in its speciality mineral business on the stock
market.
The US drug company said it would retain a stake of around 30-40 per cent in
the minerals operation - to be called Minerals Technologies.
No precise timing was given for the spin-off, but a filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, the US securities industry watchdog, is
likely within a week. The transaction could then be completed by the end of
1992.
Pfizer accompanied news of the partial disposal with an announcement that
the board had authorised a buy-back of up to 10m shares over the next two
years.
Together, the two pieces of news sent the shares Dollars 1 1/8 higher, at
Dollars 81 1/4 .
Ahead of the SEC filing, Pfizer declined to discuss details of the new
Minerals Technologies company. However, according to last year's annual
report, the specialty minerals operations had sales of Dollars 359.3m last
year, up from Dollars 343.9m in 1990. The drug company sold its pigments
business - which used to be part of this division in 1990.
Precipitated calcium carbonate satellite plants - which operate in the
paper-making industry - account for about half the division's sales at
present. There is also a separate subsidiary, called Quigley, which supplies
monolithic refractories and specialty products to the iron, steel and glass
industries.
The division is a small part of Pfizer, which had aggregate sales of Dollars
6.95bn last year.
The company said that decision to float a majority interest in the minerals
business 'furthers Pfizer's ongoing strategy of focusing on its strengths as
a research-based, diversified health-care company with global operations."

WESFARMERS, the diversified West Australian agricultural group, lifted
earnings and dividends strongly in the year to June 30 on acquisitions,
higher sales and falling costs, writes Bruce Jacques in Sydney.
The company posted a 77 per cent net profit rise from ADollars 35.8m
(USDollars 25.8m) to ADollars 63.1m in the period. Operating revenues rose
by 35 per cent from ADollars 953m to ADollars 1.8bn for the same period. The
annual dividend has been boosted from 14.5 cents to 26 cents a share,
lifting the payout from ADollars 26.7m to ADollars 48.5m.
The company benefited from its increased stake in Bunnings, the timber
group, which added pre-tax earnings of ADollars 11.3m to its latest results.

SIR Lynden Pindling, prime minister of the Bahamas, faces a strong challenge

Sir Lynden's Progressive Liberal party, which took 32 of the 49 seats in the

Hubert Ingraham, a former minister in the PLP government.
The administration in the archipelago of 250,000 people has been troubled by
a deteriorating economy. Tourism and offshore financial services, pillars of
the economy, have suffered from the international recession; the national
debt has grown; and increasing taxation has been used to stem a widening

CHILE has secured loans totalling Dollars 267m from the World Bank and
Japan, Dollars 165m of which will be used to modernise agriculture and bring
more land under irrigation, Leslie Crawford writes from Santiago.
Mr Alejandro Foxley, the finance minister, said the credits would help Chile
increase its irrigated farmland by 20 per cent in the next four years. The
Japanese government's Fund for Economic Co-operation and Development is
lending Dollars 172m for irrigation projects, sanitation and the
modernisation of the state railway company, Ferrocariles del Estado, which
has been earmarked for privatisation.
The World Bank loan of Dollars 95m will be used to provide technical
assistance and working capital for more than 100,000 small and medium-sized
farms.
Chilean agriculture is at present sharply divided between a modern,
export-oriented fruit and vegetable sector, which earned over Dollars 1bn
last year, and a backward and heavily indebted traditional sector which
serves the local market. Mr Foxley said the loans would help the traditional
sector to diversify crops and increase productivity.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Growth put firmly before environmental progress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW KAMINSKI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HOUSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Republicans and Democrats see two very different shades of green on
environmental issues, writes Matthew Kaminski in Houston.
The first clear salvo in the campaign war of words on the environment came
from Senator Al Gore, Governor Bill Clinton's running mate, who at a
California recycling plant earlier this month mocked President George Bush's
1988 pledge to be the 'environmental president' by suggesting the
alternative soubriquet 'hypocritical president'.
Not to be outdone, Mr Gore's rival, Vice-President Dan Quayle, quickly
labelled him 'an environmental extremist' for his best-selling book on the
environment and claimed the Democrats put 'a spotted owl or a giant garter
snake' ahead of economic growth and American jobs.
The brief environmental plank in the Republican's platform for this week's
party convention refuses to 'sacrifice' environmental progress to economic
growth. In sharp contrast, the Democratic platform loftily pledged to
conserve 'the critical sources of soil, water and air'.
However, the Bush administration itself suffers from severe internal strains
on environmental issues. Mr Quayle leads the anti-regulatory flank, where he
is joined by Mr Richard Darman, the budget chief, and Mr Michael Boskin, Mr
Bush's chief economic adviser, while Mr William Reilly, the Environmental
Protection Agency chief, tries to advance the environmental agenda.
The divisions became embarrassingly public during the Rio de Janeiro Earth
Summit in June, when an internal leak blunted Mr Reilly's efforts to get the
US to sign the biodiversity treaty.
Mr Reilly likes to trumpet progress - pointing to more funding for, and
fines by, his agency - but, since Rio, it appears Mr Quayle has become the
environmental standard bearer for the administration.
Mr Quayle has led the administration's efforts to make the important
environmental laws such as the 1990 Clean Air Act and the Endangered Species
Act friendlier to US industry and businesses, who complain about high
compliance costs.
This is mostly done through Mr Quayle's controversial pro-business group,
the Council on Competitiveness, which in its nominally advisory role has
persuaded federal agencies to dilute environmental rules. For instance, some
60 regulations in the Clean Air Act, ranging from chemical plant standards
to carbon dioxide emission limits, are held up by the Office of Management
and Budget, which works closely with the council.
The council, which is guided by Mr William Kristol, Mr Quayle's chief of
staff, estimates its efforts 'to relieve the stranglehold of burdensome
regulation and excessive regulation' will save or create some 200,000 jobs.
The Senate is expected this autumn to consider an amendment to erase the
council's Dollars 86,000 budget from a funding bill while the House, which
has already cut funding, also plans to weigh a measure that publicly exposes
the council's back-room activities.
The controversy is unlikely to temper Mr Quayle's tone or stop his council.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Shaken to the core: Du Pont, America's biggest chemicals
group, is in the process of a radical restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is not just Britain's Imperial Chemical Industries that is attempting to
reinvent itself.
Recession and the increasingly competitive environment in the world
chemicals industry has also caused Du Pont, the biggest US chemicals group,
to embark upon the most radical restructuring plan in its 190-year history.
The plan, which involves slashing costs, concentrating on core divisions,
expanding European and Asian revenues and disposing of non-core assets, will
determine whether Du Pont can stay among the leaders of the international
chemicals industry during the 1990s. As the eighth-largest of the Fortune
500 companies in the US, with an annual turnover of nearly Dollars 40bn, the
restructuring is also a measure of how well US industry is adjusting to the
international economic slowdown.
The chemicals sector has been hit hard by recession, both in the US and
elsewhere. Profit margins have been squeezed by weak demand, while companies
are struggling under a burden of overcapacity and excessive costs. In the
US, Du Pont has been badly affected by falling demand from industrial
customers, especially in the auto and housing industries.
The common problems facing international chemicals groups have, however,
elicited different responses.
In the UK, ICI has announced plans to split off its pharmaceuticals
businesses and is engaged in a programme of cost cutting. Similarly, Union
Carbide of the US last December set in motion plans to spin off its
industrial gases business and create a free-standing company called Praxair.
Monsanto, also of the US, raised Dollars 1.28bn (Pounds 670m) last month by
selling its Fisher Controls valves division, which it viewed as a non-core
business.
Du Pont's strategy has been developed by Mr Edgar Woolard, chairman and
chief executive since 1989. lt aims to reduce fixed costs by Dollars 3bn, or
30 per cent of the total, by 1996, across its principal divisions -
chemicals, fibres, polymers and energy (a division which is dominated by
Conoco, the oil company). The total workforce of 130,000 is likely to be
reduced by almost 12 per cent.
To achieve these goals, Du Pont has already announced plans to cut Dollars
1bn of overheads from the chemicals businesses by 1994, resulting in the
loss of 8,300 full-time staff and 3,200 outside contract workers. A separate
plan, announced in December 1991, involves cutting a further Dollars 2bn of
operating costs across the company, with the estimated elimination of
another 7,000 jobs.
Measures to achieve the two other principal prongs of Du Pont's
restructuring policy - geographical expansion and a concentration on core
businesses - are also being pursued.
Internationally, Du Pont is seeking to almost treble its non-energy European
revenues to Dollars 15bn by the end of the decade, according to Mr David
Williamson, president of European operations.
Mr Woolard acknowledges this is likely to mean 'one or more big
acquisitions' in Europe during the 1990s. But he declines to comment on the
state of Du Pont's talks with Rhone-Poulenc of France, which have been under
way for a year and concern a possible venture in titanium dioxide pigments,
used for making dyes.
Several steps have already been taken to expand the group's international
presence.
In Asia, Du Pont is investing Dollars 240m in a new Taiwan pigments plant,
taking the competition into the home market of new and lower cost producers.
In April this year the group announced it would swap most of its remaining
acrylics business for the European nylon holdings of ICI. This would make Du
Pont one of the big players in the European fibres business - so big that
the European Commission is still examining the implications.
The group has also implemented plans to dispose of non-strategic businesses
and increase its concentration on core activities. The most significant
moves include:
A May 1992 decision to invest Dollars 1.5bn over the next 10 years to
modernise US nylon production facilities.
An investment of Dollars 300m in modernising its US polyester plants, partly
in response to a challenge from Nan Ya, a Taiwan-based company that is
building a polyester plant in South Carolina.
An April 1992 decision to sell the connectors business by the end of the
year. This makes components for the computer industry, and has annual sales
of Dollars 450m and 3,000 employees.
The establishment, in January 1991, of a joint venture between its
pharmaceuticals business and Merck, the biggest US drugs company, to form Du
Pont Merck Pharmaceutical. Du Pont believed its pharmaceuticals business,
which had a turnover of about Dollars 500m, was too small and too costly to
operate on its own. The sale in April 1991, for Dollars 1bn, of half of Du
Pont's coal business to Rheinbraun of Germany.
More change is in the pipeline. Wall Street observers say it is likely that
Du Pont will eventually sell all or part of its imaging division, which
makes film, printing and reproduction equipment. This division, which
includes electronic imaging equipment and offset plate businesses, lost an
estimated Dollars 40m last year on Dollars 1.25bn of turnover.
Mr Woolard admits that the market for imaging equipment has 'absolutely
deteriorated' and promises that those parts of the business which cannot be
made profitable will be sold.
In addition to the numerous disposals and cost cutting, the company's
traditionally stolid management culture is also being shaken up. Executives
admit in private that until quite recently there was much complacency, even
lassitude, among the company's ranks.
Mr Woolard himself acknowledges that customers were in the past treated in
an arrogant manner and that Du Pont was perceived as a lumbering giant. As a
result, the chairman and his colleagues have implemented a rigorous
assessment of middle management, replacing and removing those believed to be
underperforming.
The results of Du Pont's far-reaching restructuring programme will take time
to feed through. Even company insiders admit that trying to change course at
Du Pont is like trying to alter the direction of a super-tanker. It can be
done, but slowly.
Yet Du Pont's latest figures for the first half of 1992 show an improvement
in underlying profits, once extraordinary items have been accounted for. In
fibres, chemicals and polymers (see accompanying chart) the company's
revenues are up only slightly, but profits have benefited from cost cutting.
The pharmaceuticals business has also enjoyed a turnround following the
joint venture with Merck. Losses of Dollars 30m a year have been transformed
into profits of a similar size.
The Du Pont plan has been helped by the fact that during the 1980s it halved
 -to about 20 per cent - the proportion of its non-energy turnover of
Dollars 22.8bn derived from low-margin bulk chemicals products. The
proportion of revenues from such highly competitive and price-driven bulk
chemicals is much larger at Dow Chemical and Union Carbide.
The response from Wall Street to Du Pont's restructuring has already been
enthusiastic. Du Pont's share price on the Big Board has risen by more than
15 per cent since the start of the year, outpacing the S&amp;P 500 index gain of
just 1.3 per cent.
Mr John Garcia, a corporate finance executive at Wertheim Schroder, the New
York investment bank, says Mr Woolard 'is doing a terrific job'. He praises
the Du Pont chief for 'refocusing the corporate culture, forcing the company
to be more market-driven, and tackling the cost structure'.
Mr Jeff Cianci, a chemicals analyst at the New York investment firm of Bear
Stearns, concurs: 'Du Pont historically wanted to be the biggest and the
best and would spend the most to get there. They have now transformed
themselves into a company that will get there by spending less and spending
it more efficiently.'
But difficulties lie ahead. The consensus among industry analysts is that
the US chemicals business will see only modest growth over the next two or
three years. 'The major problem,' says Mr Woolard, 'is that many of our
large customers are struggling.'
In addition, Conoco, the big oil and gas company which is a wholly-owned
division of Du Pont, is suffering in line with the US energy industry as a
whole. In the second quarter, profits fell by 65 per cent compared with the
same period in 1991. This is a particular worry given that the division
accounted for about 41 per cent of total group revenues of Dollars 38.7bn in
1991.
Mr Woolard forcefully rejects the notion - favoured by many on Wall Street -
that Conoco should be spun off. He believes that its strong cash flow is an
important advantage.
However, in an effort to trim costs the group plans to cut capital spending
at Conoco by 20 per cent this year.
In the current recessionary environment, such a focus on limiting costs and
improving margins in core areas is likely to be Du Pont's strategy for the
foreseeable future. Mr Woolard and his colleagues will be hoping that having
set the course of reform, the direction will be maintained.
As Mr Jeff Cianci of Bear Stearns, concludes: 'It takes enormous effort to
wake up the dinosaur and change its habits, but once you start the dinosaur
moving there is nothing that can stop him.'

FT  17 AUG 92 / Citicorp bows to closer scrutiny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CITICORP, the biggest US bank, has bowed to closer scrutiny from banking
regulators, joining 530 other US banks which require special attention
because of financial difficulties with bad loans and shrinking capital.
The bank announced on Friday that it signed a memorandum of understanding
with the US Federal Reserve and the Comptroller of the Currency as long ago
as February agreeing to accept closer oversight by the regulators.
Citicorp, which is thought to be the only big US money-centre bank to have
agreed to special oversight in this way, has been under strong pressure from
regulators for the past two years to improve its finances.
According to Mr John Reed, the bank's chairman, the memorandum did not
impose any new constraints on the bank's activities, but merely embraced
Citicorp's publicly-announced plans to strengthen its balance sheet with
asset sales, securities offerings and dividend cuts.
Through its reorganisation and capital building programme, the bank has
already added Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 780m) of new capital so far this year,
raising its main Tier One capital-to-assets ratio (the main capital adequacy
measure used by US bank regulators) to 4.25 per cent, up from 3.74 per cent
a year ago. It also boosted its reserves against problem loans by more than
Dollars 1bn.
Although a memorandum is the mildest form of reproach available to
regulators, the Citicorp chairman and other bank officials wasted no time
saying the agreement was not an indication that Citicorp's problems were
escalating. Reporters were invited to Citicorp's Park Avenue headquarters on
Friday for a rare briefing from the chairman.
Evidence of close regulator interest was provided on Friday, when the bank
announced it had been forced by regulators to reduce its
previously-announced second-quarter profit from Dollars 171m to Dollars 143m
to account for an expected flood of mortgage prepayments by homeowners in
the wake of July's interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve.
The bank said it had planned to recognise the prepayments in its
third-quarter results, and analysts believe the restatement will have little
impact on Citicorp's share price.

FT  17 AUG 92 / Market instability leads to bid difficulty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECENT instability in the UK stock market has led to takeover bids involving
paper offers running into difficulty as fund managers seek to reduce their
exposure to equities.
Corporate financiers say institutions are unwilling to underwrite cash
alternatives for bids. All-paper offers are also proving unpopular with fund
managers, many of whom see a cash bid as one way of reducing their equity
holdings.
Two current bids - the Kalon Group bid for Manders (Holdings) and the T
Cowie bid for Henlys Group - were judged by the stock market on Friday as
unlikely to succeed.
In the paint industry battle, Kalon's offer of 17 of its shares for six
Manders, valued each Manders share at 232.3p at Kalon's closing price of
82p, while Manders' share closed well below that at 211p. Kalon introduced a
partial cash element to its bid when it increased the offer on August 7.
This bid is of 14 shares plus 300p in cash for every six Manders shares,
suggesting that each Kalon share should be valued at 100p. Under these terms
 -with cash accounting for just over a fifth of the offer value - Manders
shares are worth 241.3p at Friday's closing Kalon share price, and Manders
is valued at Pounds 90m.
However, Manders largest shareholder, the British Steel Pension Fund with a
22 per cent stake, is refusing the offer because it does not want to take
Kalon paper. Kalon's offer closes on Friday this week.
Meanwhile, in the motor traders sector, moves on the stock market on Friday
suggested the offer was expected to fail. Cowie's shares rose 3p on Friday
to 118p, while Henlys fell 1p to 74p.
Cowie's all share offer of seven shares for every 10 Henlys shares equates
to 82.6p on each Henlys share, and values the group at Pounds 31.3m.
Cowie also introduced a cash element when it increased its offer last week,
adding 40p to its original offer of one Cowie share for every two Henlys.
Under these terms - with about a quarter of the price in cash - Henlys
shares are valued at 79p each. This bid's final closing date is September 1.

FT  17 AUG 92 / Cleaning up in business services: The challenges facing John
Clark at BET
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Clark has achieved a great deal in the 16 months since taking over
as chief executive of BET, the UK's most diversified business services
company.
In spite of having to halve the dividend after a profits collapse last year,
he has led the company from the emergency room where it was confined after a
Pounds 1bn jaunt down the acquisition trail in the late 1980s.
Crucially, last week he went a long way towards completing the
rehabilitation of the balance sheet by redeeming Pounds 200m of auction
market preferred stocks through a rights issue.
But Mr Clark may have only completed the easy part. In one of the toughest
recessions the UK has seen, BET faces the challenge of sorting out its five
divisions and 110 operating companies.
Even if this rehabilitation is successful - and Mr Clark must have been
hoping for more help for his cyclical businesses from a little economic
recovery - BET is in danger of being left behind by competitors like Hays
Group, Christian Salvesen and Rentokil.
While these more focused companies are pushing into higher growth areas for
the future, Mr Clark's time will be consumed in a struggle to sort out the
the legacy he inherited from his predecessor, Mr Nicholas Wills.
'I think the management is doing the right things to get improved returns
from existing businesses but has BET got the kind of businesses to deliver
long-term growth?' asks Mr Bob Carpenter, analyst at stockbrokers Kleinwort
Benson. 'Every company is a prisoner of its circumstances and history.'
According to Mr Ronnie Frost, chief executive of rival Hays, the City did
not fully realise how deeply BET was in trouble when Mr Clark took over. 'He
is doing a hell of a job in incredibly difficult circumstances,' he says.
'But he now has to put the businesses into controllable cores so he can tell
a story that makes sense rather than just say: 'have business services
group, will do anything'.'
Up for grabs, Mr Clark says, is a business services market that should grow
as recession forces more companies to contract out and is worth Pounds 40bn
in the UK and Dollars 800bn (Pounds 420bn) in the US.
But before BET can properly reposition itself for this market it has two
problems to address.
First of all there is the clutch of companies losing money and deeply
exposed to the construction industry. Boulton &amp; Paul, the joinery business,
lost money last year and the contract plant business has little to
differentiate it from a multitude of other companies not able to rent out
scaffold planks and poles.
More fundamentally, many of BET's businesses, though cash generative, show
little growth potential and are in mature markets with few barriers to
entry.
In distribution, for example, BET is mainly involved in transporting bulk
chemicals and foodstuffs.
Hays, on the other hand, has almost entirely moved beyond the simple
movement of bulk products, winning dedicated delivery contracts for
Waitrose, Tesco and Scottish &amp; Newcastle Breweries.
Likewise with document handling, Hays has built up an extremely cash
generative document storage, data delivery and overnight mail service in a
growing market. By way of contrast, two of BET's strongest cash generators -
its washroom towel business and textile rentals - are both under strong
margin pressure from a plethora of 'me-too' competitors.
BET's dire financial condition also forced it to dispose of promising
businesses. Biffa, the waste management company, may have been sold for a
high price to Severn Trent in 1991 and may have helped stave off insolvency.
But it deprived BET of one of the few companies with exciting potential,
according to Mr Paul Beaufrere, business services analyst at stockbrokers
James Capel.
In spite of the once widely-aired belief that business service companies
were recession-proof, few companies have escaped. But a look at the better
long-term prospects for BET's competitors in the sector provides a pointer
to the troubles Mr Clark faces.
Personnel services, for instance, has performed badly for Hays and is now
the weakest of its three business legs. But when recovery arrives Hays'
focus on recruiting accountants and other professionals, arguably gives it a
more interesting long-term future.
BET, on the other hand, is far more dependent on the placing of temporary
and relatively unskilled staff which, however profitable when in rude
health, is a far more competitive business.
When looked at as a whole, both Hays and Salvesen are also better placed to
handle the vagaries of business cycles; both have three core businesses
groupings, one each in what can broadly be seen as growth, maturing and
recovery phases. BET's near-halving of operating profits last year to Pounds
146.1m - before Pounds 90m of exceptional reorganisation costs - clearly
shows that BET has none of this balance.
Mr Clark recognises that refocusing BET must to a large extent follow the
house-keeping in the group's existing businesses. With the balance sheet in
better shape, there may be opportunities to make small bolt-on acquisitions,
but only after the disposal programme is further advanced, he says.
At its simplest, turning the group around in the short-term will involve
even more cash generation than last year when debt was cut from Pounds 425m
to Pounds 107m; Mr Clark hopes this will cut gearing to zero by year-end.
And there will be even tighter cost controls and greater emphasis on
enhancing financial returns.
But cleaning up is going to be a painful process. What is more, the longer
the recession continues, the slower the process will be, allowing BET's more
balanced and better managed rivals to continue to wipe the floor.

</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday set out a re-election strategy focusing on
attacks on the Democrat-controlled Congress, whose 'sorry record' he will
link directly to his opponent, Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas. In a
pre-recorded interview with ABC News broadcast yesterday, Mr Bush said he
would take as his model former Democratic President Harry Truman, who won
re-election in 1948 by fiercely attacking a 'do-nothing' Congress.
Against the background of a Washington Post/ABC News poll yesterday showing
that 61 per cent of Americans do not know what Mr Bush wants to do in a
second term, the president sought to portray himself as having been too busy
in Washington dealing with Congress to lay out an agenda. Congress had 'let
me down and the American people.'
As the Republican party faithful began gathering in Houston for their
party's convention, which begins today, Mr Bush defended moving Mr James
Baker from his role as secretary of state into the White House to assist his
re-election campaign.
'He's been at my side in every political battle, and I think there's so much
at stake in terms of what we can do to help this country, that I wanted to
have this trusted friend and adviser, with a proven record, running the
White House.'
The president also said he would come forward with new ideas on education
programme, health care reform and taxes, so that voters had 'a major
choice'.
Convention speakers in Houston were preparing for a concerted assault on Mr
Clinton. Mr Rich Bond, the party chairman, said Mr Patrick Buchanan, who
unsuccessfully challenged Mr Bush in this year's Republican primaries, would
'tear the bark' off the Democratic candidate in his speech today.

FT  17 AUG 92 / Major keeps open troops option: Prime minister to interrupt

<TEXT>
BRITAIN yesterday left open the possibility that it would contribute ground
troops to protect aid convoys in Bosnia as Mr John Major, the Prime
Minister, announced he was interrupting his holiday for emergency talks on
the crisis.
British officials, however, said Mr Major was as determined as ever that
British troops should not become embroiled in a peacekeeping role in Bosnia,
while President George Bush reiterated that the US would not involve US
troops in any multinational force 'for the time being'.
British officials emphasised that Mr Major's return to London tomorrow from
Spain for talks with senior cabinet colleagues did not signal the imminent
despatch of ground troops to the former Yugoslav republic.
The prime minister instead planned a detailed review of the options
following last week's UN resolution authorising the use of 'all necessary
measures' to ensure that humanitarian aid convoys were protected. The
resolution, watered down by the UK, fell short of advocating military force.
Mr Major's decision to raise the UK government's profile in efforts to
restore peace to the former Yugoslav republic is partly in response to
criticism that his government, which holds the EC presidency, has not done
enough to co-ordinate international action to end the fighting.
His decision coincided with a stinging criticism of Serbia by Mr Douglas
Hogg, the foreign office minister.
Mr Hogg said next week's London peace conference on Yugoslavia, sponsored by
the EC and UN, would make it clear to Serbian leaders that their country
would remain a 'pariah' state until it reversed the policy of 'ethnic
cleansing' in Bosnia.
But a US diplomat in Belgrade yesterday said it was 'naive' to believe that
ethnic cleansing could be reversed, or that the former status quo in Bosnia
could be restored.
EC officials will meet in Brussels today to discuss measures to stop
violations of UN sanctions imposed last May against Serbia and Montenegro,
its remaining ally from the former Yugoslavia, a German Foreign Ministry
spokesman said.
Mr Bush, meanwhile, said during a television interview shown yesterday: 'I
don't want to commit a soldier to battle unless I know that we've got the
wherewithal for them to win, and win fast.' He added: 'The US cannot be the
world's policeman.'
An eight-truck UN relief convoy reached the relative safety of Sarajevo last
night after delivering food to the besieged Bosnian town of Gorazde, a UN
official said. The convoy, which had been delayed on its return by a mined
bridge, was rescued by UN forces. Moslem and Serb forces had refused to
unblock the bridge, a UN spokesman said.

FT  17 AUG 92 / Arts: The dangers of political architecture - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS summer beach reading takes on a serious tone as Europeans loll on sunny
islands, within earshot of the sounds of hideous civil wars.
Two particular books seem to have a timely relevance for anyone interested
in the inevitable effects of politics upon architecture - The Arts of the
Third Reich by Peter Adam, (Thames and Hudson, Pounds 24.95) and Stalinist
Architecture by Alexei Tarkhanov and Sergei Kavtardze, (Laurence King,
Pounds 35). Both these books are about blood and buildings. Hitler and
Stalin, two tyrants of the twentieth century, both needed more than just
terror to perpetuate their nauseating ideals.
Hitler had serious architectural and artistic ambitions - indeed he is
supposed to have wanted to be an architect. He would certainly have given
architectural arrogance a new dimension. But he was served by his architect
Albert Speer and the sculptor Arno Brecker in ways that were not completely
without artistic merit. The tragedy of art and architecture being used so
blatantly for banal propaganda purposes is that all artistic standards are
debased. Even a good artist is inevitably corrupted.
Stalin simply encouraged mindless monumentalism. The two Russian authors
have written an extremely staight-forward account of a period that is very
recent to them with elegant objectivity. The Stalinist style has an interest
because if it had been built with its modernist cubist style of ornament and
without its Social Realist heroics, it might well be admired today. Instead
the mighty buildings stand for a hollow and horrific period of megalomania.
Peter Adam has gathered from the slowly opening archives a good collection
of visual images many of which have never been seen before. From his book
you get a very strong sense of art perverted by politics. It is the kind of
book that makes the reader examine his aesthetic responses as well as his
political ones. The author engages in an impossible search for artistic
objectivity and inevitably leaves a lot of difficult questions unanswered.
His analysis of the ways that Nazis misused artists is accurate and
fascinating.
Both books belong in any library about the art and architecture of the
twentieth century. Both demonstrate the huge set-back these tyrants caused
to the natural development of a historically based architectural tradition.
First tyranny and then modernist excesses almost succeeded in killing off
history as a source of architectural development.
Both the Nazis and the Stalinists perverted history - and we are all still
suffering for it. How often is fascist now used as a term of abuse when
classicism is revived today ? These books both show objectively the dangers
of political architecture and the artistic danger of perverting history.
On a calmer note, anyone interested in recent architecture should take a
look at a series from Phaidon Press. It is called 'The Architecture in
Detail' series - and plans to be a range of monographs with excellent
drawings and photographs of the, 'most celebrated buildings of the last two
centuries'.
The series struck me as useful to anyone contemplating commissioning an
architect, (a rare and recondite activity today) and probably useful as crib
sheets for practising architects. The buildings covered include, The Red
House by Philip Webb; The Oxford Museum of Natural History by architects
Deane and Woodward; Alvar Aalto's Villa Mairea in Finland; Frank Lloyd
Wright's Barnsdall House in Los Angeles; The Royal Festival Hall; The Hoover
Factory; the UK Pavilion at the Seville Expo; and many more.
They are far from perfect as a series because they seem to fall between two
stools. They are quite expensive - Pounds 19.95 for a paperback magazine
format and yet they are not the last word on the buildings they cover. They
are not written by scholars and indeed the texts I have read are very
variable - the quality of the actual writing does not seem to matter.
Several of the series deal with recent trendy architecture - it is hard to
see the lasting significance of some London restaurants and advertising
offices. If the series can avoid appearing as uncritical publicity brochures
for current contemporary architects it will be far more successful.
My other criticism is that an aversion to captions and a certain martyrdom
to the wilful ways of the graphic designer makes the series more difficult
to read than should be the case. The most successful are the titles that are
photographed by one distinguished photographer. The publishers hope for
annual subscribers - twelve slim volumes a year - and offer a good discount.
I had looked forward to the summer break to have time to read the handsome
volume, The Italian Renaissance Interior 1400-1600 by Peter Thornton,
(Weidenfeld and Nicolson , Pounds 65.00 ). What a disappointing book -
perhaps the subject is too big and the evidence too recondite to make a book
on this intriguing subject readable and scholarly and convincing.
This is really an amazing cull of pictorial material assembled by a team of
helpers and captioned at length by an author who is clearly more interested
in certain aspects than in others. I cannot be alone in finding it hard to
take seriously a tome that wants to be seen as scholarly but contains this
extraordinary disclaimer by the author - 'Readers may notice that when I
come to matters that do not particularly interest me (or about which I am
rather ignorant, which comes to the same thing) I say very little; I mention
these matters in the appropriate places merely so that my coverage of the
field should be fairly comprehensive.'
This reader noticed that Mr Thornton is not particularly interested in
architecture, nor is he even remotely interested in painting. His analysis
of fragments of great paintings selected to illustrate interiors of his
period almost always ignores the artist's colour and compositional
intentions.
The book is full of wonderful pictures - the text is a worrying muddle.

FT  17 AUG 92 / Arts: Elves of Denmark - London Promenade Concerts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN and MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE elves of Denmark were malicious little creatures, not nice at all. Just
when the people who lived around their territory thought things were
progressing for the good of the community, the Danish elves would rouse from
their other-worldly slumbers and throw a spanner in the works out of gleeful
spite. All fiction, of course, handed down to us in folk-tales.
Stories about elves were popular in Northern countries in the nineteenth
century and the Danish composer Niels Gade was particularly taken by them.
At the Promenade concert on Friday a visiting Danish choir and orchestra
brought a rare performance of his cantata Elverskud ('The Elf-King's
Daughter') with a text in which Hans Christian Andersen had a hand. A noble
lord is lured to Elfin Hill on his wedding day by a elf-maiden of the night,
whose seductive wiles bring him to a grisly end.
The tale, with its barely-suppressed theme of the dangers of sexual
attraction, is potentially a gripping one. If only the music was half as
interesting. Unfortunately Gade was content to spend his time picturing at
leisure star-lit nights on the Elfin Hill and barely gets to grips with the
nub of the story at all (Schubert said far more in five minutes in his song
'Erlkonig').
The music is all watered-down Mendelssohn. Occasionally some of the
descriptive passages catch the magical atmosphere, but the rest is far too
monotonous, substituting a generalised naive and homely mood for the thrill
of narrative tension that the story demands. The fine solo trio of Inga
Nielsen, Anne Gjevang and Poul Elming introduced a couple of Wagnerian
voices to this very sub-Wagnerian piece, accompanied by the Danish National
Radio Choir and Symphony Orchestra under Dmitri Kitaenko.
The chorus and orchestra, which had made a good impression in the Gade,
returned later for a lacklustre performance of Prokofiev's Alexander Nevsky.
In between, however, Aage Haugland was the awesomely gloomy bass soloist in
an extraordinary arrangement of Musorgsky's Songs and Dances of Death by
Edison Denisov, in which Denisov enjoys himself hugely adding vibraphones
and ghostly chromatic celesta descants to the music. Nothing like Musorgsky
at all, but novel and entertaining.
The next night brought another choral concert, in which the BBC Symphony
Orchestra and Chorus might have made more impact if they had been galvanised
into action by a conductor with some energy and a tough line on ragged
ensemble. Instead, Gennady Rozhdestvensky led them in a sleepy account of
Brahms's Schicksalslied ('Song of Destiny') and a slack one of Verdi's
Quattro pezzi sacri. Strong music like the Verdi needs strong direction.
A corresponding lack of energy and freshness marred Schumann's Piano
Concerto. The soloist was Victoria Postnikova, who alternated a few passages
of Prokofiev-like metallic virtuosity with long stretches in which all
momentum was lost, as she laboured to find the poetry that should be at the
heart of the concerto. If not for the glory of Verdi resounding through the
Royal Albert Hall, this would have been a dispiriting evening.
*****
THURSDAY'S BBC Philharmonic concert at the Proms was conducted by the
orchestra's recently-appointed Composer Associate, Peter Maxwell Davies.
It included, as well as works by Mozart, Tchaikovsky and Beethoven, a big
Maxwell Davies revival - Black Pentecost (1979), the long, bleak-spirited
song-symphony for mezzo (Della Jones) and baritone (David Wilson-Johnson)
and large orchestra on texts by the Orkney poet George Mackay Brown.
The theme is the destruction for commercial purposes of an Orkney island.
This adds Black Pentecost to the honourable short list of twentieth century
'protest symphonies' (Shostakovich being, of course, Maxwell Davies's most
significant predecessor on that list).
It starts, Shostakovich-like, with a slow, dark, barely-scored rumination,
shaped according to this composer's 'medieval-modern' structural designs,
that gradually accrues bitter tints of Mahlerian anguish.
The beauties of the island (touched in by achingly delicate applications of
percussion glitter) are characterised as spacious and timeless; the violence
and mindlessness of its destroyers are depicted in terms of 'mechanical'
madness.
The voice parts, grave in tone, work predominantly in narrative mode (though
the baritone has a brief passage of this composer's dottiest Expressionist
vocal writing).
I don't feel Black Pentecost quite adds up, holds together; its form seems
somehow distended, loose. But the impact of all its parts proves loweringly
fierce.

FT  17 AUG 92 / Arts: An enchanted voyage - Glasgow International Early
Music Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE highlight of this year's Glasgow International Early Music Festival was
La comica del cielo, ovvero La Baltasara a 1668 Roman 'music-drama' given
two performances in the vast and wonderful spaces of the Tramway Theatre.
The music was by a noted Roman church musician, Antonio Maria Abbatini, the
text by a play-writing cardinal, Giulio Rospigliosi, at the time near the
end of his short period of office as Pope Clement IX.
In case any of this suggests a dusty research-exercise, I must immediately
insist that this revival of La Baltasara - claimed as the first-ever -
afforded an experience of rarest delight, a enchanted voyage across
historical time and space to what for most people in the Glasgow audience
will have proved a new world of opera. Seventeenth century Roman opera, not
possessing a musical figure of Monteverdi dominance or Cavalli stature, is a
territory relatively little excavated; these festive Glasgow re-discoveries
 -two years ago it was Marazzoli's 1656 Vita humana, still talked of with
excitement - are changing all that, to illuminating effect.
The titular heroine stepped into theatrical and then operatic re-creation
from real life: she was Francesca Baltasara de los Reyes, a leading Valencia
actress, who experienced religious revelation in mid-performance and took up
the life of a hermit. A Spanish play on the subject preceded Rospigliosi's
treatment; the character of Spanish theatre, of Lope de Vega and Calderon
(both of whom the cardinal passionately admired), feeds one source of
influence into the libretto.
Act 1 is a backstage comedy-drama. Acts 2 and 3, set in a desert, mingles
events supernatural (Baltasara's new-found faith tested by the devil) and
picaresque, of main and subordinate characters serious and comic. The
morally uplifting ending - Baltasara's triumphant arrival in Paradise to the
strains of a celestial chorus and a dance of the seven virtues - is entirely
in keeping with the distinct tenor of Roman opera.
Ears habituated to the mould-breaking genius of Monteverdi and the indelible
melodic and rhythmic appeal of Cavalli may at first have found Abbatini's
succession of recitative and short numbers small-scale, and lacking in
individuality.
As Baltasara's own stature grows, however, so does the force of the drama;
in this reading, with two small groups of 'period' instruments, either side
of a thrust stage, the dignity of the later scenes infused the whole theatre
with a glow of lyrical radiance.
Kate Brown (producer) and Warwick Edwards (musical director and editor), the
team responsible for La vita humana at the Tramway in 1990, have mastered
the art of spreading the focus of a music-drama across a whole auditorium
(and, in the intervals, the foyers) without ever diluting it. The charm and
fluency of the production, the brisk wit and keen intelligence of its
stagecraft, the deft manipulation of cohorts of dancers and singers ' all
this kept the show tautly unfolding, and kept me captivated. A pity no
English translation was available for even closer contact with the audience
(but the standard of Italian enunciation was higher than usual, and a
libretto was on sale).
In the title role Janis Kelly showed herself once again - as she had in the
Opera Factory poppea earlier this year - an artist of the highest eloquence,
verbal and vocal conviction, distinction of bearing. She was the opera's
vital centre; around her such admirably stylish singing-actors as Tinuke
Olafimihan (a fast-developing young soprano of lustrous tone and presence),
Alan Watt, Eleanor Bennett, Stuart Patterson and Francesc Garrigosa were
aptly and impressively displayed.

FT  17 AUG 92 / Management: Will you hold? - With 45,000 of its staff
applying for voluntary redundancy, BT has had to be selective
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the last Friday in July 19,000 British Telecom employees across the UK
cleared their desks, said goodbye to their colleagues and left work for the
last time.
Over the coming months thousands more will join this exodus: the company
calculates 33,000 of its 210,000 workforce will go during this financial
year.
The sheer scale of the redundancy programme has been unmatched by anything
else in British industry in a single year since the coal-field closures of
the 1980s.
The opportunity to shed staff has been presented by technological advances,
stimulated by competitive pressures and the example of US telecommunications
companies' lean staffing. However, greatest of all has been pressure on the
bottom line: pre-tax profits in the quarter to June fell nearly 30 per cent,
and the pressure will continue now that BT has been forced by its regulator
to adopt a stricter pricing regime.
The job cuts are also set to continue. By 1996 the workforce may well have
dropped to 130,000 employees or fewer - a 38 per cent reduction on numbers
at the beginning of this financial year. Even more remarkable than the scale
of the operation is the fact that all redundancies have been voluntary.
Indeed, the exit package offered by BT has been so popular - it was more
than 50 per cent oversubscribed - that a new piece of jargon has passed into
industrial relations language.
Union leaders at BT now complain of 'compulsory retention' where they once
spoke of the threat of compulsory redundancies.
The main BT union, the National Communications Union, has moved a long way
towards accepting the inevitable: in the days when it tried to fight
privatisation with industrial action it would certainly also have been
manning the barricades over job losses on the current scale.
Instead, the NCU speaks with pride about the terms of the package it has
negotiated. The NCU's membership will be decimated but its leaders console
themselves with having achieved what Tony Young, general secretary, calls a
redundancy package that is 'one of the best in the UK'.
Release 92, as the package is called, is made up of the following elements:
Redundancy compensation of up to three years' pay, depending on age, length
of service and which of two pension schemes an individual belongs to.
Pension and pension-related lump sum, dependent on the same criteria.
Early-leaver bonus of 25 per cent of annual pay for those who left before or
during July. Employees leaving before October get bonuses on a sliding scale
of between 10 and 20 per cent of pay.
Pay in lieu of notice for those who left before the end of July.
Counselling and outplacement services to identify skills and training needs,
and provide advice on preparing CVs. 'Job shops' provide details of
vacancies, word processors and telephones.
Retraining costs of up to Pounds 1,000.
A tie-up with two employment agencies - Skillbase for managers and
professionals, Manpower for engineers, operators and clerical staff -
providing opportunities for temporary work within BT and other telecoms
companies.
Payments to some employees quitting the company will be as high as Pounds
100,000 plus pension entitlement, although pay-offs of around Pounds 30,000
are more common. Overall, BT estimates the deal will cost more than Pounds
1bn.
Expensive but successful - that is the official BT verdict on Release 92.
However, behind the scenes the company is attempting to answer some awkward
questions about whether the package was pitched at the right level. It also
has to deal with what it admits are continuing severe morale problems and a
complex redistribution of the workforce.
Judging from the demand from employees to leave, it appears that in the
management's anxiety to recruit enough volunteers, and win union support,
the deal was over-generous. The final figures speak for themselves. Some
29,000 employees are being allowed to leave (the balance of job losses will
come from natural wastage and the sale of some businesses). However, nearly
45,000 applied to go.
Demand was whipped up to some extent by management warnings that the
generous terms of Release 92 would never again be available. It was also
made clear that more jobs would go over the next two or three years. Poor
morale born of constant policy changes and insecurity about future
prospects, say the unions, was another factor which inflated demand.
It has been claimed that many employees were misled about their chances of
being able to collect the redundancy package and start new lives. The NCU is
supporting appeals by employees who, for example, took leases on business
premises and raised loans in the expectation - allegedly fuelled by their
line managers - that they would be able to leave under Release 92. Says
Young: 'They created a climate of expectation they couldn't hope to fulfil
in the end.'
Michael Hepher, group managing director, told staff last month: 'We have
said repeatedly . . . that BT could not undertake to release everyone who
asked to go, but with hindsight, we should have reinforced this message at
every one-to-one interview.'
Young claims that, as the cut-off date of July 17 approached, Release 92
'spun out of control'. When it became clear that take-up had been seriously
misjudged, managers were given the invidious job of rejecting candidates who
showed merit.
An internal memo at the time made it clear that certain categories of
applicant should be retained. Those whose appraisals had marked them out as
sound performers with potential for promotion, for example, were rejected.
Those with long service (the most expensive to pay off) were also less
likely to get through. Unions complained that employees were being punished
for being loyal and capable.
It was decided at the last minute to extend Release 92 to 8,500 more
employees than had originally been intended. David Scott, BT's industrial
relations manager, denies the programme was out of control but concedes
there was 'certainly a lot of quick thinking going on'.
Now BT is turning its attention from those clearing their desks to those who
will remain. The priority is maintaining customer service: last time staff
numbers were cut, following privatisation, consumer complaints soared and
recruitment had to be increased again. Redeployment to fill some of the
worst gaps is now urgent, as is restoring morale among the 16,000 staff who
thought they would be attending their own leaving parties this year.

FT  17 AUG 92 / Middleton set to be Lloyd's chief executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER MIDDLETON, chief executive of Thomas Cook, the travel subsidiary
recently sold by Midland Bank, is expected to be appointed as the new chief
executive of Lloyd's of London, the insurance market, in the next few weeks.
He was chosen as the preferred candidate for the vacant post at a recent
meeting of the senior appointments committee of Lloyd's Council members from
a shortlist compiled by GKR &amp; Associates, a London-based firm of executive
head-hunters.
Mr Middleton will be formally introduced at the next full council meeting in
early September. Traditionally this has been a formality, as the full
council has no authority over selection for the post.
The new chief executive will work closely with both the chairman and the
head of regulation at Lloyd's. Mr David Coleridge, the previous chairman,
nominated Mr David Rowland, the head of Sedgwick, the insurance company, as
his successor at the annual general meeting last month.
The role of the chief executive is being fundamentally restructured to focus
on 'business development' in line with recommendations from both the Lloyd's
task force report issued in January and in the report chaired by Sir Jeremy
Morse released at the start of July.
Mr Middleton became chief executive of Thomas Cook Group in December 1987,
and helped negotiate the sale of the group for Pounds 200m from Midland to
LTU, Germany's third-largest package tour operator. Much of his past career
was spent at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
Mr Middleton is believed to have been chosen over two internal finalists for
the position, Mr Robert Hewes, head of regulatory services, and Mr Andrew
Duguid, head of market services.
His salary is not known, although his predecessor received about Pounds
200,000 a year. Mr Middleton earned more than Pounds 140,000 as chief
executive of Thomas Cook for the financial year ending in 1990.
A note on the skills required for the job by Mr Alan Lord, the previous
chief executive who retired in June, is believed to have stressed the
importance of attendance at committees and preparing papers, which he
believed made a civil servant the preferred choice.
Senior Lloyd's insiders had been concerned at the speed with which a new
chief executive was being chosen, so soon after recommendations for changing
the position's function.
But several said yesterday that they were satisfied with the choice of Mr
Middleton because of his diverse background, including considerable business
experience.
Thomas Cook said yesterday that Mr Middleton was halfway through a
three-week holiday in Italy arranged through the company, and could not be
contacted. 'It is not for any of us to comment on personal matters,' a
spokeswoman said.

FT  17 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Preference shares
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
General Accident's proposed fixed-rate preference share issue prompts the
thought that, at the level of simple arithmetic, either the company or
investors in such paper seem to get a bad deal. When Commercial Union raised
Pounds 100m preference capital in May its ordinary shares were yielding 6.2
per cent. The prefs were priced to yield 11.6 per cent gross. On these
numbers, they looked like expensive capital for the company and a good deal
for investors.
But on even modest dividend growth assumptions, prefs start to look a poor
equity investment over the longer term and, conversely, cheap capital for
companies. Assuming annual dividend growth of 8 per cent, Commercial Union
ordinary shares will offer a higher return than the prefs from the tenth
year. This does not neccessarily imply that buyers of prefs are
extraordinarily gloomy on dividend growth. Instruments which offer a high
yield and a known cash flow have value as a match for fixed liabilities such
as annuities. The choice for most institutions is not between equities and
preference shares, but between preference shares and gilts.
Preference shares look like cheap equity for companies because they are not
really equity at all. For example, some preference shares are cumulative -
missed interest is rolled-up for payment at a later date. For insurers and
banks this debate is of little concern. The instruments are recognised as
core capital by their regulators. For non-financial companies the question
is more serious. If auditors or the market refuse to recognise preference
shares as equity, why not raise long-term debt and pay a lower interest rate
instead?

FT  17 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Japan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With the equity market back to 1986 levels, investors are beginning to ask
whether Japanese shares represent good value. On some valuation measures
Japanese industrial companies do indeed stand direct comparison with their
international competitors. Unfortunately the best support comes from exotic
investment criteria. For example the ratio of a company's market
capitalisation to its sales gives a fairly crude rating, but has the benefit
of excluding differing accounting conventions. On that basis Toshiba has a
market value of only 0.4 times its sales, while General Electric sells on
1.5 times, GEC 0.6 and Siemens 0.5. True, this says nothing about the value
Toshiba extracts from sales, but it starts to argue the shares are not
hugely expensive. Similarly the price to cash flow measure shows firms such
as NEC, Hitachi, and even Nippon Steel holding their own.
The snag is that investors cannot eat a price to cash flow ratio, and it has
become fashionable to focus on low Japanese dividends. Equity yields rose as
the market fell, but there are good reasons for dividend payments to remain
below western levels. Some 60 per cent of Japanese shares are held by other
quoted Japanese companies; with dividends taxed at more than 50 per cent,
increasing dividends becomes an expensive exercise.
At the heart of the debate about value lies profitability. It is a cliche
that Japanese companies until now pursued market share at the expense of
profits. With strong balance sheets, many of the larger companies might
still be tempted to stick with the culture that puts corporate size above
stock market performance. But pressure from banking partners who face large
losses on their share portfolios is shifting attitudes. Companies are moving
on from cost control to rationalising their range and extending product
life-cycles. Matsushita is cutting back from 50,000 to at most 40,000
product types this year.
Others have made strategic change. Fujitsu has withdrawn from the US
facsimile market and Toshiba has pulled out of audio products. In all cases
the focus has shifted from commodity items such as consumer durables and
towards higher added value areas. But change is slow; profitability will
improve, but Japanese consensual management means it will not arrive
overnight. Investors looking for value in Tokyo must tread warily.

FT  17 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Dollar dilemma
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There remains something baffling about last week's concerted intervention to
support the dollar. The currency closed in Europe on Friday at DM1.4675, not
much changed from the level of DM1.4610 at which the intervention occurred.
At least the central banks seem to have put a brake on the dollar's fall
towards its historic low of DM1.4430. Were it to slip below that point the
dollar could begin a seemingly unstoppable decline. Yet the intervention was
all the less convincing since it flies in the face of interest rate factors
for which the central banks are also responsible.
Recent dollar weakness stems above all from the market's belief that the
interest differential between Germany and the US may be set to widen.
Continuing economic disappointment may prompt the US to cut rates: money
supply worries may provoke an increase in Germany's internationally
sensitive Lombard rate. Granted the German economy is slowing and wholesale
prices are falling, but the Bundesbank drained liquidity from the money
market last week, a move which could signal concern about the volume of
Lombard borrowing by the banking system.
Perhaps the intervention was motivated by the fragile state of world stock
markets earlier in the week. The dollar's fall was also putting the D-Mark
under upward pressure within the ERM. Still more significant may have been
the Federal Reserve's desire to ward off a rise in US long rates which are
every bit as important to economic recovery as short rates.
Doubtless US bond yields, which are already being pushed up by election
worries, would move smartly higher if the dollar did breach its previous
low. The intervention came in the middle of a quarterly US Treasury funding
programme in the bond market. It offered at least some comfort to foreign
investors worried about the exchange risk in holding US bonds. But, if that
is a serious preoccupation for the Fed, it is hardly likely to provoke the
exchange market by cutting short rates further. On the US side at least, the
market's worry about a wider transatlantic interest differential may be
overdone.

FT  17 AUG 92 / Revenues from state sell-off may beat target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT could raise more than the Pounds 8bn expected from
privatisation in the current financial year, giving it scope to consider
raising additional funds to help curb its rising deficit.
Cash already received and funds due from sales that have taken place is set
to yield Pounds 6.74bn of the targeted Pounds 8bn for 1992-93. A further
Pounds 1bn is to be raised from the sale of government loans made to
privatised utility companies, including BT and the electricity sector,
taking it to within Pounds 250m of the target figure.
This could be covered by the repayment of part of a further Pounds 650m
tranche of electricity company debt. The government can take this on to its
books in 1992-93 or 1993-94, allowing a degree of flexibility in its
planning.
The Treasury is not thought to be pushing for extra privatisation cash this
year, over and above the budgeted Pounds 8bn. But pressure to drum up more
money could grow if the public sector borrowing requirement moves too far
above the Pounds 28bn forecast.
The government will not officially revise this forecast ahead of the autumn
statement in November, but a deficit of well over Pounds 30bn is widely
expected because of the severity of the recession and its impact on public
spending and tax revenues.
The Treasury would be reluctant to take privatisation proceeds that would
otherwise accrue in future years simply in order to maximise the present
year's takings.
But analysis of debt and equity assets still owned by the government in
privatised companies suggests it could comfortably realise the Pounds 11bn
of proceeds budgeted for during the next two financial years. This is
without taking into account likely proceeds from the sale of British Coal
and British Rail and the possible sale of part or all of the Post Office.
The government's most valuable stake in a private sector company is its 22
per cent of BT. This could raise more than Pounds 4bn.

FT  17 AUG 92 / Twin tasks to stop the strife: The future of Bosnia must be
resolved or other ethnic conflicts could erupt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Prime Minister John Major holds an emergency meeting of the British
cabinet tomorrow, he will be faced with one of the most important decisions
since the Tories were returned to office in April.
Against a background of mounting public pressure, he will have to decide
whether to commit ground troops to protect humanitarian aid convoys in
Bosnia-Hercegovina. And since Britain is the current president of the
European Community, Mr Major will be expected by his EC colleagues to
provide a sense of leadership in deciding how to deal with the war in
Bosnia, and how to prevent it from spreading. Neither task is easy.
British officials are hoping that the resolution passed last week by the
United Nations Security Council, which stipulated that 'all necessary means'
would be used to safeguard aid convoys in Bosnia, will be enough to force
the Bosnian Serbs to lift their siege of several towns.
For the moment, Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of the Serbs in Bosnia, appears
determined to allow the aid convoys unhindered access to some towns and
cities. This is understandable. The last thing Mr Karadzic wants is a
large-scale military intervention. Western diplomats and academics point out
that it is in Mr Karadzic's interests to comply with the UN resolution.
'Karadzic has everything going for him now,' said Mr James Gow, a specialist
on Yugoslavia at the London-based centre for Defence Studies at King's
College.
'He will look good if he allows the convoys through. But more importantly,
he has got what he wanted. Even though the Serbs make up 33 per cent of the
4.3m population, Karadzic's men now control 70 per cent of the territory of
Bosnia-Hercegovina. He is in a position to sue for peace.'
The Croats, who make up 17 per cent of the population of Bosnia, are also in
a position to sit down at the negotiating table. With the backing of Franjo
Tudjman, the Croatian president, Bosnia's Croats now control a swathe of
territory in western Hercegovina, in the west of the republic. Like the
Serbs, Bosnia's Croats, led by Mr Mate Boban, have carried out their own
form of ethnic cleansing. Their war aims - the eventual annexation of parts
of Bosnia-Hercegovina to Croatia - have nearly been fulfilled.
Indeed, so confident are Mr Karadzic and Mr Boban that they held their own
talks in Brussels at the weekend, following the collapse of the official
negotiations headed by Lord Carrington, chairman of the EC-sponsored peace
conference on the former Yugoslavia. At the unofficial talks on Saturday
both leaders agreed to a ceasefire on those frontlines in Bosnia where Serbs
and Croats have been fighting. In addition, they put forward their own
version of a constitutional arrangement for the future status of Bosnia. The
plan - supported by the EC - will be presented to a new UN/EC-sponsored
conference in London which is scheduled to start on August 26, chaired by Mr
Major. It suggests that Bosnia should be partitioned between its three
constituent communities.
The problem with this arrangement is that it leaves the Moslems - who
accounted for 43 per cent of the population before tens of thousands fled
the republic - with a tiny area of territory near Sarajevo, the Bosnian
capital.
'The Moslems have been boxed into a corner,' a Turkish diplomat at the UN
said. 'They want to defend their homeland. But if they fight, regardless of
the UN resolution and regardless of the fact that Bosnian Serbs will allow
the aid convoys through, they will be accused by the international community
of being unco-operative and obstructive to any peace plan,' he explained.
'If the Moslems and the Bosnian president, Alija Izetbegovic, agree to the
carve-up of their republic by Croatia and Serbia, they will be disowned by
their own people. It is a terrible dilemma for them. In reality, the
independent republic of Bosnia-Hercegovnia no longer exists. Force has
destroyed it.'
Thus, tomorrow's cabinet meeting, and the challenges facing the London
conference, are daunting. Both meetings will have to decide whether Bosnia
can exist as an independent and sovereign state. If this principle is
accepted, then arrangements will have to be made to allow the mostly Moslem
refugees to return to their homes.
This would mean that the UN would have to set up safe havens in Bosnia for
returning refugees, said western diplomats. Western governments would also
have to provide substantial financial assistance to rebuild the homes
destroyed in the war. However, returning to the status quo ante is
acknowledged to be impossible.
'The problem with any of these options is that they are too late,' said Mr
George Schopflin, an east European specialist at the London School of
Economics. 'The west, particularly the UK, has responded with weakness and
cowardice. The Moslems have no homes to which they can return. The
international community, which has adopted the politics of appeasement, has
allowed might to prevail over right. 'This will encourage potential
authoritarian regimes to emerge in the republics of the former Soviet Union,
and in eastern Europe,' he added. 'Who will stop them from carrying out
their own forms of ethnic cleansing?'
A US diplomat in Belgrade said the depth of revenge and hatred was now so
great in Bosnia that it would be 'extremely difficult' for the three ethnic
communities to live peacefully together again. 'The war has radicalised
every ethnic community. The tragedy is that we are witnessing the
establishment of ethnic ghettoes in Bosnia which will be accepted as one of
the solutions towards bringing peace to the republic.' Meanwhile, as the EC
and the UN ponder the fate of Bosnia, diplomats continue to urge western
governments to stop the war spreading in the Serb-controlled southern
province of Kosovo and in Macedonia.
'Macedonia will become a pawn between Serbia and Greece if we do not
recognise its independence - and defend that independence,' a US diplomat
said. 'If the London conference really wants to tackle the problem of the
Balkans, it will have to address the whole question of minority rights.'

FT  17 AUG 92 / British unions consulted less than on Continent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH unions and employees have been consulted far less about moves
towards decentralisation and greater flexibility in industrial relations
than their continental European counterparts, according to a study to be
published next month.
While most European governments have been promoting labour-market
flexibility, the normal pattern outside Britain has been for such changes to
be implemented in close consultation between unions and management, say Prof
Richard Hyman and Mr Anthony Ferner of Warwick University.
Analyses of trends in individual countries conclude that:
'Thatcherism' in Britain generally reinforced trends in industrial relations
that were already under way rather than marking a change of course, and has
not left British managers with a more strategic approach to industrial
relations.
In France, in spite of support for collective bargaining and stronger
industrial relations institutions, unions have continued their long decline
and employers are enjoying a resurgence in public esteem as wealth creators.
The German dual system of industry bargaining and company-level works
councils has proved remarkably adaptable but is responding more uncertainly
to the challenges of reunification and the introduction of Japanese-style
production concepts.
Industrial relations in Italy have undergone the most remarkable
transformation over the last decade, with co-operation in change encouraged
by increasingly formal union-management arrangements.
The study challenges the thesis that union power is withering away. It
concludes: 'In most countries unions are still robust and are important
agents of industrial relations change, especially where national unions
maintain strong links with workplace organisation.'
Industrial Relations in the New Europe, Blackwell Publishers, 108 Cowley
Road, Oxford OX4 IJF. Pounds 19.95.
THOSE WHO say that pay for the police and firefighters should no longer be
indexed to general earnings should remember the circumstances in which the
principle was introduced, a pay expert warns, Michael Smith writes.
Sir Pat Lowry, former head of the Acas conciliation service, says: 'In the
late 1970s the police were seething over what they considered to be their
low pay and the Police Federation was under great pressure to amend its
rules prohibiting strike action.
'The firefighters went on strike and the army was called out to cover for
them.'
Sir Pat, in the Institute of Personnel Management magazine PM Plus, says:
'If indexation is to go, we need an alternative in which the police and
firefighters would have faith.'

FT  17 AUG 92 / Conference agenda reveals Tory unease
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNEASE among Tory party activists about the depth of the recession has
been confirmed in a series of critical motions tabled for debate at the
party conference in October.
Senior party officials are, however, drawing comfort from assurances by Lady
Thatcher that she has no plans to use the conference to launch a broadside
on Mr John Major's approach to the economy and Europe.
In spite of her public backing for sharp cuts in interest rates and her
fierce opposition to the Maastricht treaty on European union, Lady
Thatcher's aides have indicated that she does not intend to embarrass the
prime minister.
Conservative Central Office has suggested in return that she make a brief
appearance on the conference platform to share the applause of the party
faithful for April's general election victory.
The draft agenda for the Brighton conference, leaked at the weekend,
contains several dozen motions from constituency activists which are openly
or implicitly critical of the government's handling of the economy and
Europe.
Most of the economic motions back the government's determination to defeat
inflation but many then go on to call for a more sympathetic approach to the
plight of small businesses, the housing market and the unemployed.
Among the specific demands are calls for more government help for training
and an extension of the moratorium on stamp duty. A handful demand that
sterling be withdrawn from the European exchange rate mechanism to allow
interest rates to be cut sharply.
A large proportion of the motions on Europe have a similarly equivocal tone,
with support for Mr Major's negotiating stance at Maastricht tinged with the
scepticism of the treaty's opponents. A small number suggest outright
rejection of European union and back Lady Thatcher's call for a referendum
on the treaty.
Ministers were voicing confidence yesterday that the critics could be
'handled' by Mr Major.

THE JURY in the Brink's-Mat trial will reconvene today to consider verdicts
on two people accused of laundering proceeds from the Pounds 14m bullion
robbery.
Two of the accused - Mr Gordon Parry, a property developer, and Mr Patrick
Clark, a former nightclub owner - were convicted at the weekend. Mr Parry
was convicted of 10 charges of handling and cleared of one further charge of
handling. Mr Clark was convicted of conspiracy to handle.
Mr Clark's son Stephen was acquitted of taking part in the plot to launder
profits from the 1983 robbery.
The jury has yet to reach verdicts on Ms Jean Savage, a tobacconist, and Mr
Brian Perry, owner of a minicab company.
All the defendants had variously denied charges of handling and conspiracy
to handle proceeds from the raid.

FT  17 AUG 92 / Treasury takes stock of its share portfolio: There should be
little difficulty in meeting the Pounds 19bn target for privatisation
proceeds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS not much family silver left in the government's cupboard. Excluding
British Coal and British Rail, which are on the block, and the Post Office,
which is under review, the Treasury's list of nationalised industries
comprises just six names.
These range from the probably unsellable Nuclear Electric and Scottish
Nuclear to Caledonian MacBrayne which provides 'cost-effective lifeline
services to remote island communities'. The others are: the Civil Aviation
Authority, London Transport and the British Waterways Board.
The era of privatisation is drawing to a close. But it is surprising how
much the government still has locked away for a rainy day. An analysis of
its remaining debt and equity holdings suggests it should have little
difficulty raising the Pounds 19bn in privatisation proceeds it has budgeted
for the three years commencing 1992-93.
This would bring to more than Pounds 60bn the sum raised since the sell-offs
started with Pounds 377m of disposals in 1979-80, the first year of the
Thatcher administration.
The conclusion that Pounds 19bn is within easy grasp assumes the government
would be prepared to sell its remaining stakes in British Telecommunications
and the two electricity generating companies by April 1995. It does not take
into account proceeds from the latest batch of proposed privatisations,
which are not expected to be among the biggest money-spinners of the past 13
years.
How then might the figure be raised?
As much as Pounds 3.6bn is already in the kitty. This has been raised by
Pounds 835m from the second instalment payment of the Scottish electricity
companies sale, Pounds 1.915bn from the second BT instalment, Pounds 350m
from the disposal of Northern Ireland Electricity and Pounds 350m from the
repayment of the last tranche of British Gas debt - the balance is derived
from other odds and ends.
A further Pounds 3.975bn will accrue by 1993-94 from more scheduled
instalment payments on share sales which were completed some time ago. The
payments consist of Pounds 1.465bn due in September from the sale of the
regional electricity companies, Pounds 1.675bn due next March from BT and
Pounds 835m due a month later from the disposal of the Scottish electricity
companies.
Another Pounds 650m relating to the repayment of debt owed to the government
by the electricity industry will be credited to its account by 1993-94.
The government also owns a Pounds 4bn-plus portfolio of marketable debt that
is owed by the privatised utility companies. The loans range from Pounds
350m to less than Pounds 50m and maturities stretch until the year 2008.
About half of the debt is in BT loan stock, which yielded about Pounds 450m
of income over the seven years to 1990-91.
Last month Baring Brothers, the merchant bank, was appointed to advise the
Treasury on how to sell its loans, with the aim of raising about Pounds 1bn
in this financial year.
The government still owns more than Pounds 7bn in ordinary shareholdings in
private-sector companies. The most valuable stake is the residual 22 per
cent holding in BT, which alone would raise well over Pounds 4bn if put on
the block. The roughly 40 per cent interests in National Power and PowerGen,
the electricity generating companies, are together worth just under Pounds
2bn.
All of this is not to suggest that meeting the Pounds 19bn target -
equivalent to the projected budget of the Home Office over the three years -
will be plain sailing.
The recent stock market slide has wiped more than Pounds 500m off the value
of the government's ordinary share holdings in 11 weeks - its 1.9 per cent
stake in British Petroleum is now worth about 30 per cent less than in late
May. But convincing evidence that the end of the recession is in sight could
prompt share prices to rebound equally rapidly.
Meanwhile, the attempted sale of the marketable debt portfolio has been
described as one of the most teasing corporate financial puzzles since the
privatisation programme began, partly because of the varied form of the
loans and the high interest payments that many of them carry.
If sold direct to investors, the high-yielding paper would need to be priced
well above face value - a fact calculated to put off many UK buyers because
of the tax implications of buying bonds above par.
THE GOVERNMENT is considering co-ordinating aspects of the sale of the two
parcels businesses that it is to privatise.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and Mr John MacGregor,
transport secretary, are to discuss the timing of the disposals, which will
transfer both Parcelforce, the Post Office's delivery service, and British
Rail's parcels division to the private sector.
The level of co-ordination is thought unlikely to extend to appointing the
same teams of advisers for the sales.
It is expected that traditional inter-departmental rivalries may limit the
extent of co-operation. British Rail is primarily Mr MacGregor's
responsibility, while the Post Office is Mr Heseltine's.
Parcelforce, which lost Pounds 24m on turnover of Pounds 508m in the year to
April, delivers about 750,000 parcels a day.
BR's parcels arm, which lost Pounds 34.7m last year, consists of Red Star,
the express parcels service, and Rail Express Systems, which mainly carries
letters for Royal Mail, Parcelforce's sister organisation.

FT  17 AUG 92 / Edinburgh director confident of success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 1992 Edinburgh Festival opened last night with Mr Brian McMaster, who is
directing the festival for the first time, confident that the Pounds 4m cost
will be covered.
Ticket sales, which are planned to achieve 70 per cent of seating capacity,
are slightly below target at nearly Pounds 900,000 but late booking has
become commonplace in the recession and the festival has successfully raised
Pounds 770,000 in sponsorship, the same as last year.
For the next three weeks the Scottish capital will fill with such performers
as American dancers, German actors and Danish musicians among the thousands
of participants in the largest arts festival in the world.
The most persuasive of this year's four main themes at the festival is the
music of Tchaikovsky, with 30 performances of his work, including the
rarely-performed opera The Oprichnik.
There will be an unprecedented concentration of Scottish music, from the 8th
century to the present day. On the final evening of the festival, this will
culminate with a performance by the Scottish Chamber Orchestra of James
MacMillan's new Percussion Concerto written for Evelyn Glennie.
After many years in which foreign drama has dominated the festival the main
feature of the theatrical programme this year is the work of two neglected
British playwrights, the Edwardian Harley Granville Barker, best known for
The Madras House and The Voysey Inheritance, and the Glasgow born CP Taylor,
who wrote Good and Walter.
Other highlights include the first British performance of the Mark Morris
Dance Group from the US and the first for 10 years of the Pina Bausch
company from Germany, Andrei Serban's production of An Ancient Trilogy
performed by his Romanian company in ancient Greek, and Elisabeth Soderstrom
singing Poulenc's opera for solo voice, La Voix Humaine.
The fringe festival this year threatens to be the largest ever with more
than 1,100 different shows.
The television and film festivals will also run alongside the main festival.

new reading room and the six-storey, glass-walled tower which will house the
King George III collection of books and manuscripts. Construction of the
building began 10 years ago, on the site of the former goods yard for St
Pancras station in Euston Road, London. Some reading rooms are due to open
in 1994 but the project will not be completed until 1996. The new library
will allow the public access to 12m volumes and more than 1m visitors are
expected each year.

FT  17 AUG 92 / National Savings pulls in Pounds 481m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Savings contributed Pounds 635m last month to government funding,
the third highest monthly figure ever recorded, according to official
figures released today, Andrew Jack writes.
Total gross sales were Pounds 950m, including Pounds 299m on the new
tax-paid First Option Bond which was launched on July 7 and had its rate cut
within two weeks.
The inflow - which caught the government by surprise and brings the total
contributions so far this year to more than Pounds 2.1bn - indicates the
high demand for National Savings certificates and accounts compared with the
rival products offered by banks and building societies.
The Treasury has cut rates three times since May. It is widely believed to
have bowed to pressure this month from building societies, which warned that
they would be forced to raise mortgage rates in order to compete with
National Savings interest rates to savers.
The rate for First Option, which was designed for basic-rate taxpayers, was
cut from 10.34 per cent gross to 9.67 per cent on July 21.
The 37th issue tax-free National Savings certificates, which was introduced
in May paying 8 per cent, was withdrawn this month to be replaced this week
by the 38th issue paying 7.5 per cent.
The government had not envisaged such a high demand from individuals for its
savings products, which help it to meet the projected public-sector
borrowing requirement of Pounds 28bn for 1992-93.
Officials said they did not want to set the rates any higher than was
necessary to make their contribution to funding. But City economists said
the cut in the First Option rate had little bolstering effect on building
society deposits.
After repayments of Pounds 469m, net receipts from National Savings totalled
Pounds 481m for July. Including accrued interest of Pounds 154m, the
contribution to the government was Pounds 635m.
Allowing for Pounds 700m in accrued interest, there has been a net cash
inflow of Pounds 1.4bn since the beginning of the year. The total amount
invested at the end of July was Pounds 41.9bn.

FT  17 AUG 92 / Developing country competition and unskilled jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEW ECONOMISTS doubt that trade is the route to economic growth for
developing countries. Most also believe that free trade is in the interests
of consumers in developed countries too. But the rise of trade barriers in
industrial countries over the last decade, and their unwillingness to
complete the Uruguay Round, suggest that politicians are not convinced by
the merits of lower trade barriers.
The popular view that competition from low-cost producers in developing
countries pose a growing threat to jobs and incomes in industrial countries
is, instead, gaining ground. Both Ross Perot, the former US presidential
candidate, and senior Democrats in congress have latched on to this fear.
The proposed North American free trade area, signed last week, may yet
flounder over the next few weeks in the face of congressional opposition.
Developing country exports have certainly grown rapidly over the past three
decades, and exports from the east Asian economies have grown even faster:
by an average 9.2 per cent between 1965 and 1980 and 10.2 per cent a year
between 1980 and 1990. The share of developing country goods in total
developed country consumption of manufactures has more than tripled in the
last 25 years.
Yet conventional wisdom among economists says that developing country trade
is too small to have significant negative effects on wages and employment in
developed countries. The penetration of developing country imports into
developed country markets may be growing, but it remains low. Developing
country exports account for less than a 10th of the manufacturing imports of
developed countries and only 3.1 per cent of total manufacturing
consumption, as the chart shows. Even if every developing countries had
posted South Korean style export growth in the 1980s, this share would have
been a mere 0.6 percentage points higher.
The impact of trade on labour-intensive manufacturing industry in developed
countries has been more pronounced. The share of developing country trade in
industrial country imports of these goods has grown from 9.8 per cent in
1965 to 18.7 per cent in 1989 and developing country clothing producers now
account for 22.1 per cent of total clothing consumption in industrial
countries.
Professor Adrian Wood of the Institute of development Studies at Sussex
University has estimated the cumulative effects of developing country trade
on manufacturing employment in industrial countries over the last 30 years.
Skilled employment increases very slightly - the extra jobs created by
higher exports out-weighed the jobs displaced by imports. But for unskilled
employees, the losses swamp the gains. By 1990, total manufacturing
employment was a net 9m jobs lower, as a result.
Still, estimates of the manufacturing employment cost of developing country
trade are not large compared to the actual decline in manufacturing
employment that has occurred. The decline in the share of manufacturing in
total employment in industrial countries, from 29 per cent in the mid 1960s
to 22 per cent in the mid 1980s, implies a loss of 30m jobs.
Yet estimates of lost employment and import penetration ratios ignore the
effect of trade on investment and technical progress. Research in the US
suggests that trade is overwhelmed by domestic factors in explaining the
shift in demand for labour from unskilled to skilled. But companies may
respond to the threat of competition by introducing more advanced production
methods which use less labour. The timing of the acceleration in
manufacturing productivity growth over the last three decades matches the
rise of developing country trade. Productivity growth is largely to blame
for the fall in manufacturing employment in developed countries, accompanied
by rising unemployment and falling relative wages among uneducated workers,
whether or not it can be traced to domestic or external factors; and for the
nervousness of politicians.

FT  17 AUG 92 / Retail fall hits recovery hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROSPECT of an imminent consumer-led recovery collapsed last month as
retailers suffered the largest year-on-year decline in sales and responded
with the sharpest cut in orders to suppliers since the Confederation of
British Industry started its distributive trades survey in 1983.
The latest survey, covering 290 retailers, 157 wholesalers and 79 motor
traders, paints a picture of falling sales, orders and expectations in
almost every sector. The survey was conducted between July 20 and August 5.
Retail sales in July slipped below their level of a year ago for the second
successive month, and the decline is accelerating. Of the retailers
surveyed, 33 per cent said the volume of sales in July was higher than a
year ago while 48 per cent said the volume was lower. The percentage-point
balance of - 15 compares with - 3 in June and positive balances in the
previous two months.
Retailers said that sales for the time of year were more depressed in July
than at any time since the survey began. Only 6 per cent of retailers said
sales were good and 52 per cent said they were poor. The percentage-point
difference of - 46 between those reporting good and poor sales follows a
balance of - 21 in June and a previous low of - 27 in March when sales were
depressed in the run-up to the election.
Only chemists, confectioners and grocers saw business improve in July, while
stores supplying durable goods for the home continue to be badly affected by
the depressed state of the housing market. Grocers reported a slight annual
sales increase in July but the balance of +3 reporting higher rather than
lower sales, compared with a year ago, was the lowest since the survey
began.
By contrast clothing and footwear sales showed a marked annual decline in
July, after growth in volumes during the preceding two months, and furniture
and carpet retailers reported the second sharpest annual declines in sales.
The balance reporting higher rather than lower sales fell from - 2 in June
to - 43 in July, with the sector's fall on the year outstripped only by
specialist food retailers.
Retailers expect little improvement. Sales in August are expected to decline
again, though at a slightly slower rate than in July. Among retailers, 29
per cent expect higher sales compared with 39 per cent predicting lower
sales. The balance of - 10 compares with a balance of +1 in last month's
survey, suggesting that retailers were expecting July to be a better month
than it turned out to be.
Depressed sales caused retail stocks to rise slightly last month and
retailers have cut-back their orders to suppliers. A balance of +21 said
that stocks were too high, compared with +19 in June, and the volume of
orders placed with suppliers fell for the second month running.
Sales volumes in the motor trade are expected to increase slightly in August
compared with a year ago but sales are expected to remain poor for the time
of year.

FT  17 AUG 92 / Concern at 'misjudgments' by big international banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING international banks suffered from weakening profitability and
worsening asset quality during the 1980s, an article in the Bank of
England's quarterly bulletin suggests.
The banks lent money to less-developed countries and the property sector,
and became involved in highly-leveraged transactions based on an expectation
that relatively benign economic conditions would continue, it argues.
They often lent in areas with which they were 'relatively unfamiliar' in an
attempt to improve returns at a time of aggressive expansion and
competition.
The bulletin suggests that adjustments to the new environments of
deregulation and greater competition may have led to 'misjudgments in the
assessment and pricing of risk'.
It points out that it is very difficult to compare levels of profitability
internationally because of differences in accounting and taxation practices.
German and Swiss accountancy conventions smooth year-to-year fluctuations in
earnings via transfers to and from hidden reserves, for example.
The paper highlights four responses to the pressures of the last decade
which have been adopted by the international banks:
Improved capitalisation and better risk-pricing: driven by the 1988 Basle
capital adequacy guidelines, banks have taken measures such as increasing
debt and equity issues, borrowing on a wider range of markets, and
increasing spreads and fees.
International retrenchment: many banks have been forced by third world debt
and the deterioration of corporate and property loan portfolios in overseas
markets to reduce their foreign operations and focus on specialist niches.
A shift to non-interest earnings: banks have increased the power of their
retail franchises by greater involvement in fee-based retail and securities
business, driven by competition from capital markets and non-bank financial
institutions, as well as by the development of information technology.
Cost control: banks have cut staff and branches, introduced new technology
and engaged in mergers and acquisitions over the last two years which have
contributed to some improvement in earnings.

Bulletin.

FT  17 AUG 92 / Smaller businesses warn of long slump
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE recession has turned into a slump and is set to last for at least
another two years, according to the Federation of Small Businesses.
The prediction follows a poll the federation conducted last week among 350
small companies and is accompanied by a warning of impending 'catastrophe'
in the sector. The survey found that nearly half of the companies contacted
saw no improvement in projected turnover levels before the end of 1994 at
the earliest.
Companies said a cut in interest rates was the measure most needed to help
combat the recession. The federation forecasts that, if its members' fears
are confirmed, unemployment could double in the next two years.
Mr Ian Handford, the federation's policy unit chairman, said: 'Statements
from the Treasury urging a sit-tight-and-wait policy do nothing to alleviate
the fears of small businesses and destroy any sign of hope or confidence in
the foreseeable future.'

FT  17 AUG 92 / Market for mail order rises 3%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAIL ORDER sales grew by 3 per cent to Pounds 4bn last year as the home
shopping market proved marginally more resistant to recession than
high-street department stores and clothing retailers.
Though most of the sales increase was due to higher VAT rates, the sector's
performance showed an improvement on the two previous years during which it
lost ground to the high street.
A market survey by Verdict Research, the retail consultancy, suggests that
mail order companies - led by Great Universal Stores, Littlewoods, Freemans
and Grattan - benefited from the high percentage of older consumers and
lower socio-economic groups among their customers.
Older consumers had more money to spend than younger people, and many home
shoppers felt more comfortable using mail order credit facilities than
credit cards or other options available in the high street, Verdict says.
Mail order companies raised their share of new retail credit granted during
1991 from 15.3 per cent to 16.5 per cent.
In spite of last year's growth, however, mail order's share of total retail
sales has fallen to less than 3 per cent.
'Home shopping is suffering from its own form of overcapacity,' the report
says. 'There are too many catalogues serving a sales base which is declining
in real terms.' With lower spending in many retail sectors, competition with
high-street and out-of-town retailers has become fiercer. Yet some of the
mail order companies still see their main competition as one another rather
than the high street, Verdict adds.
Competition between mail order companies to recruit agents serving a wide
circle of friends, neighbours and relatives had been largely
counter-productive. It had shuffled market shares without stimulating sales
growth.
Though agents accounted for 83 per cent of sales, they increasingly shopped
only for themselves and their immediate families, switching from one
catalogue to another and treating the commission as a form of discount.
Future success in the sector would depend on the ability of companies to
move from the agency system to direct sales, using their customer databases
to target segmented groups of shoppers with different ranges of products,
Verdict concludes.

FT  17 AUG 92 / Corporate sector health improves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FINANCIAL health of the corporate sector improved last year, according
to an article to appear in the Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, published
tomorrow. In spite of falling profits and rising dividend payments,
companies undertook stringent cost control measures including cuts in
employment, investment and stocks.
But capital gearing is still high and many sectors remain in a fragile state
despite a 45 per cent increase in company insolvencies last year, the Bank
says. The longer a recovery is delayed, the greater will be the damage to
the real economy.
Gross trading profits of UK industrial and commercial companies, excluding
the newly privatised electricity companies, fell by 5 per cent last year but
profitability remained higher than in previous recessions. Gross trading
profits were Pounds 74.3bn in 1991 - Pounds 68bn when North Sea oil profits
are excluded.
The real rate of return has fallen from 11.5 per cent in 1988 to 7.3 per
cent in the first quarter of last year. The overall fall in profitability
has been at least as severe as in the 1980-81 recession, when the rate of
return fell from a peak of 8.9 per cent to a trough of 5.6 per cent. But the
fall in profitability for non-North Sea oil companies was much sharper in
1980-81.
Manufacturers appear to have been able to maintain their domestic profit
margins last year because of falling wage inflation and input prices,
although the Bank suspects that these estimates may not take into account
the effects of price discounting on profit margins.
But export margins were pared back sharply, the report says, as companies
strived to maintain price competitiveness and market share against a
background of worsening labour competitiveness and weakening overseas
demand. UK manufacturers are still earning a lower rate of return than their
international competitors, despite making up some of the ground in the
1980s.
The Bank says high real interest rates have encouraged companies to
strengthen and restructure their balance sheets. Total company income fell
by 3 per cent last year, but the financial deficit of the corporate sector
fell to Pounds 11bn from Pounds 24bn in 1991. Last year, companies repaid
Pounds 3bn of bank borrowing while net issues of ordinary shares rose
threefold during the year.
The Bank of England report expresses surprise that against this background
of severely restrained profitability and cost-cutting, industrial and
commercial companies have chosen to raise their aggregate dividend payments
by 7 per cent last year with a further strong rise in the first quarter of
this year.
In spite of a Pounds 3bn fall in total income, the dividend pay-out ratio
was slightly up on 1990 and remains high by historical standards. Even at
the current stage in the economic cycle, managers feel obliged to provide
shareholders with a constant stream of income and minimise the threat of
takeover, the report says.
Increasing dividends has meant that the burden of adjustment has had to fall
on employment and investment. The fall in capital investment has been
steeper than in the last recession, although gross domestic fixed capital
formation remains higher than in 1979-81 as a percentage of gross domestic
product.
The Bank expects that as output recovers, a cyclical improvement in
productivity should enable companies to widen their profit margins. But the
longer the recovery is delayed, it says, the more likely it is that capacity
will be scrapped and the greater the damage to the real economy.

THE Houston Astros, a baseball team of limited talent, are having a
miserable season. Adding insult to the injury of being nearly last in their
league, they have been evicted from their own stadium, the Astrodome, for
nearly a month because the Republican party is staging its quadrennial bash
there, just down the road from the hotel room which President George Bush
calls home for voter registration purposes.
That hotel, the Houstonian, is also a sad story, operating only under the
protection of bankruptcy laws. Indeed, Houston generally is a bit of a mess,
unrecovered from the recession that so damaged its biggest industry, oil,
hit by rising crime and recently in the grip of the sort of heatwave that
turns tarmac back into crude by midday.
These are not the most auspicious surroundings for a party which needs some
auspicious moments this week. By contrast, the Democrats found New York last
month at its most benign and, thus encouraged, came out of the city on a
unified bus and with a ticket driving away to undreamt-of leads in every
known form of polling measurement.
It is not easy to adjust to this political role reversal. Democratic
conventions used to be fun, because they were disorganised, while the
Republicans orchestrated theirs to the last nano-second, easing such dissent
as existed under the blue rinses and funny hats of the delegates quietly
into oblivion.
Now, suddenly, it is the Republican party which portrays itself as 'the big
tent', tolerant of an unprecedented diversity of opinion, while depicting
the Democrats as the imposers of the sort of discipline that used to be
associated with the KGB.
The reality is that the Republicans must get their act together this week.
The twin tasks are to bash the Clinton-Gore ticket at every turn, but in
ways that strike home to the wider electorate and not only to the committed;
and to give President George Bush the sort of 'bounce' which so lifted
Governor Bill Clinton a month ago.
Yet this is going to be done mostly without the ever-present direction of
the new bandleader, Mr James Baker, still secretary of state until next
Sunday, who may not be much in evidence at Houston. The convention score
has, in effect, been composed mostly by those very people found so wanting
that Mr Baker's return was deemed necessary by Mr Bush.
The party platform, for example, constitutes a very conservative wish list,
the unfinished agenda of the Reagan era. This reflects the influence of the
activists, almost all of the right and many of them nakedly distrustful of
Mr Bush, not to mention Mr Baker.
Only with difficulty were explicit criticisms of Mr Bush's sanctioning of
the 1990 tax increase excised. As it stands the economic policy
recommendations of the draft document emphasising tax reductions contain
most, if not all, the right wing's demands.
The social policy agenda was best described by a leader of the Christian
Coalition, representing fundamentalists: 'The language on Aids, education,
abortion, homosexual rights, prayer in schools and taxes is all being
strengthened so we can telegraph a message to the core constituency that
this is still their party.'
It is unlikely that Mr Baker will pay too much heed to the platform when he
is in control, though if the battle for the presidency is to be fought on
middle ground, as the Democrats expect, it does not help to be stuck with
too much baggage from either far left or right.
But to go into battle without the right - who are, like liberal Democrats,
the enthusiasts, the activists, the letter stuffers of the party - would be
a handicap. So Vice President Dan Quayle stays on the ticket and speaking
room has been found this week for Mr Jack Kemp, the housing secretary, and
Mr Patrick Buchanan, the erstwhile candidate for the nomination, just as Mr
Clinton let the Rev Jesse Jackson and Mr Jerry Brown have their say.
The worst handicap is to go into battle with an unpopular leader, and in
this respect the resurrection of Mr Bush is easily the most important task
of the week. This can be done both by tearing Mr Clinton down and by
building Mr Bush up. The same can, and will, be done to their respective
wives.
There has been a sharp negative edge to the assaults on the Clintons in the
last two weeks, especially as voiced by Ms Mary Matalin, the campaign's
political director, and by Mr Rich Bond, the national party chairman. What
they have seen as good rough'n'tough partisan politics seems sometimes to
have sat ill with Mr Bush, though he has never explicitly disowned them.
More to the point, they have neither rattled Mr Clinton nor improved Mr
Bush's standing.
Mr Baker undoubtedly will, in time, refine this, creating more of a balance
between attacking Mr Clinton for his inexperience and the presumed cost and
impracticality of some of his policy proposals, contrasting both with Mr
Bush's record, especially in foreign policy. It is certain that this week
will be full of the Gulf war and the president's role in presiding over the
collapse of that ultimate Republican demon, Soviet communism.
Where Mr Baker's influence might first be apparent is in the content of Mr
Bush's acceptance speech on Thursday night. While too much can be made of
one address - Mr Clinton gave an indifferent one in New York, but was not
hurt by it - the president's matters because it gives him the opportunity to
lay out what he would do with a second term. This is precisely what the
electorate has been waiting to hear and it is why Mr Bush said he was
bringing Mr Baker back to the White House.
The president enters this week knowing he is behind. The current polling gap
is comparable to the 23-24 point margins by which Nixon beat McGovern in
1972 and Johnson beat Goldwater in 1964. There is no way that Mr Bush and Mr
Clinton are going to be separated by as much in November, but what the
incumbent needs from Houston is more than its miserable baseball team can
offer.
If he wants local inspiration, he might try Nasa's Johnson space centre,
accustomed as it is to proclaiming 'we have lift-off.' He will have to
ignore the fact that it is named after a Democrat.

The International Federation of Tour Operators (Ifto) is to ask Kenya to
establish a tourist police force in an attempt to reduce crime against
visitors, Michael Skapinker writes. The call follows a number of widely
publicised attacks on tourists in Kenya which, tour operators say, have led
to a fall in bookings.
Ifto, which represents tour operators in 17 countries, hopes to send a
delegation to Kenya at the end of this month to discuss improving safety for
tourists. Ifto will also ask for stricter licensing of drivers involved in
the tourist industry.

TAIWAN'S foreign currency reserves, the largest in the world, surged to a
record Dollars 86.6bn (Pounds 45.3bn) at the end of June, Reuter reports
from Taipei.
The reserves rose from their previous record of Dollars 84.6bn in May and
Dollars 72.2bn in June 1991, the central bank reported. It attributed the
rise mainly to recent appreciation of the D-Mark and yen against the dollar,
which inflates the value of the reserves when expressed in dollars.
Taiwan holds about 55 per cent of the reserves in the form of securities
issued by foreign governments and institutions, and the rest as bank
deposits. It was the biggest Asian buyer of US government securities in the
first quarter of 1992.
The reserves have drawn fire from the US, which runs a trade deficit with
Taiwan.

FT  17 AUG 92 / Health care hit as sanctions bite in Belgrade
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED Nations sanctions, including an oil embargo, imposed on May 31
against the reconstituted Yugoslavia, are biting hard in Belgrade despite
allegations of widespread violations.
The effects are far broader than petrol queues snaking out from the few city
filling stations still open.
Amid an overall collapse of the economy, hospitals are among the hardest
hit. 'All the doctors pray that we won't fall ill because we know there is
no way to be cured,' says a young endocrinologist in Belgrade.
Dr Sasa Simic, a surgeon who works at one of Belgrade's top hospitals, calls
the present state of health care a 'catastrophe'. Patients are admitted to
hospital only if they can supply their own medicine, anaesthetic, bandages,
and towels.
'We do not have any material. No sutures, no plastic gloves. Everything we
used was imported from the US.' Doctors say while medicine is supposed to be
exempt from the sanctions, medicines must go through the UN bureaucracy in
order to be imported.
A cardiologist who spoke on condition of anonymity said: 'The import of
medicines theoretically is not banned. But it is blocked because it is
illegal to import packaging.'
The shortages have forced doctors into an ethical dilemma: to choose which
patients should be allowed medical care. 'We now have to reject all patients
for elective surgery, operating only on those with cancer or injuries,' says
Dr Simic. He explains how hernia patients, for example, are told to go home
and wait for better days.
Few beds are filled in the once-packed cardiology ward. Unable to provide
their own pacemakers, most people now must forego surgery.
Haematologists say the treatment of blood disease has stopped because
diseases such as leukaemia were treated only with imported drugs.
Dr Simic says: 'We now have a rise of urinary infections because we no
longer have disposable catheters. Infection results because everything must
be washed by hand.'
An official from the World Health Organisation (WHO) said it would soon be
hazardous to drink tap water because Serbia and Montenegro, the sole members
of Yugoslavia, can no longer provide the chemicals for purification. Flats
in about half of Belgrade for the past five days have been without any water
at all.
But Dr Simic says: 'Medicine is so hard hit that all other problems - gas
queues and shortages - seem irrelevant.'

FT  17 AUG 92 / Russia alerts troops as Georgia violence simmers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT LEAST 22 people are reported to have been killed in three days of clashes
in the breakaway Abkhazia region of western Georgia.
The violence prompted Moscow to despatch paratroopers to guard military
depots and other buildings that still belong to the Russian army. The
Russians also began evacuating army officers and their families holidaying
in a Black Sea resort in the area.
Two Russians were reported to be among those killed in the sporadic
violence.
In spite of a formal ceasefire between the Georgian authorities and Abkhazia
at the weekend, fighting flared again yesterday in Sukhumi, the local
capital.
Fighting first erupted on Friday when Georgian national guardsmen and police
tried to seal off roads and bridges in Abkhazia to prevent militant
separatists moving more than a dozen hostages.
Most of the hostages, including Georgia's interior minister, Mr Roman
Gventsadze, were subsequently released.
The ruling State Council claimed Georgian forces now fully controlled the
situation in the west of the country and had arrested 200 suspected members
of 'bandit groups', the usual term for supporters of ousted Georgian
President Zviad Gamsakhurdia.
The Abkhazia region wants to break away from Georgia and effectively
declared its independence last month after a parliamentary vote.
But Georgia has dismissed its independence claim, arguing that ethnic
Abkhazians represent only a quarter of the population and are outnumbered by
Georgians.
On Saturday, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the Georgian leader and former Soviet
foreign minister, declared Abkhazia to be 'an integral part of Georgia' and
said forces had been deployed to protect the region from 'banditry'.
Abkhazian leaders accused him of launching an invasion. Bands of armed
Abkhazians have fought fierce clashes against what they regard as Mr
Shevardnadze's invading army.
Top Georgian and Abkhazian officials renewed talks on restoring order to
Sukhumi yesterday as their forces withdrew to create a 4km buffer zone. But
isolated bursts of machine-gun fire rang out across the city, where Georgian
patrols were stopping local cars in an apparent search for arms.
The Abkhazian dispute is the latest in a series of fierce ethnic battles in
the former Soviet Union.
In an attempt to help contain such conflicts, seven members of the
Commonwealth of Independent States signed an accord on Friday to establish a
joint peace-keeping force.
Itar-Tass news agency reported that the specially trained force could only
be deployed with the agreement of the council of CIS leaders and the various
parties involved in a particular conflict. The agreement was signed by
Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgystan, Tajikistan, Armenia and Moldova,
although four other states may also join before next month's CIS summit.
This weekend, Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, the former president of the Soviet
Union, warned of the dangers of massive upheaval unless the CIS member
states developed stronger links.
Writing in Saturday's edition of La Stampa, the Turin daily newspaper, Mr
Gorbachev commented: 'If the Commonwealth fails truly to develop, then all
will have to fight each other. All borders will become objects of dispute,
all the parties involved will be in conflict. We will find ourselves faced
with a situation of extreme danger, which could develop into a war of vast
proportions,' he said.
Russia's air traffic controllers abandoned a brief strike yesterday in the
face of public hostility and the 'catastrophe' they claimed was threatened
by the government calling in replacement military controllers.
Saturday's strike disrupted a few domestic flights to Moscow, St Petersburg,
Omsk, and Volgograd, but international connections were largely unaffected.
All Russia's airports were operating normally last night. The controllers
had been demanding a big pay rise.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S finance minister, Mr Theo Waigel, yesterday sought to reassure the
German people that 'there will be no automatic doing away with the D-Mark.'
The German government takes the worries of ordinary German people about
monetary union and the eventual abolition of the D-Mark very seriously, he
told the mass circulation Bild am Sonntag yesterday.
There would be a full debate in both houses of parliament before the
government took a final decision on European monetary union and the future
of the currency would be decided only with the support of parliament, Mr
Waigel said.
'Even if one day a common currency comes to Europe, the familiar imprint of
the D-Mark will definitely remain on one of side of the new notes and
coins,' he told the newspaper whose sister publication, the daily Bild
Zeitung, lamented the passing of what it called 'our lovely money' after the
signing of the Maastrict treaty on monetary and political union last autumn.
The minister's remarks reflect the sensitivity of Bonn political circles to
widespread disenchantment with the move towards a single currency, but fall
short of giving the people a referendum.
A poll conducted by Der Spiegel news magazine in the wake of the Danish vote
against the Maastrict treaty showed almost three quarters of Germans in the
western part of the country in favour of their own referendum on the issue,
and a majority against political union with a common currency.
In the same interview, Mr Waigel said there would be no new solidarity
surcharge tax to pay for the costs of reunification. However car drivers
would have to pay a toll by 1994 to help Bonn fund the reform of its
railways system and to keep its roads from becoming overburdened.
'To finance the restructuring of the railways we will introduce a levy on
autobahn use in the form of a vignette. That is the price that needs to be
paid to prevent a collapse of the road system,' Mr Waigel said.
A vignette is a sticker to be attached to the windscreen which would cost
the same for all car drivers. Mr Waigel did not say what price the vignette
would be.
The recent fall in the German inflation rate - from 4.3 per cent in June to
3.3 per cent in July - was no grounds for a cut in Germany's interest rates,
Mr Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank's chief economist and member of its
policy-making directorate, told the Welt am Sonntag yesterday.
It was essential to bring money supply growth down to the 3.5-5.5 per cent
growth target set by the Bundesbank , he said, and even a 3.3 per cent
inflation rate was not a level with which the central bank could feel happy.
The middle-term objective was to return to inflation 'with a 2 before the
comma', he said.
The Bundesbank's anti-inflation policy could not be held responsible for the
3m unemployed in Germany, nor was it likely to impede an upswing in eastern
Germany.

FT  17 AUG 92 / US threatens air strikes if Iraq again defies UN
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US is prepared to bomb targets in Iraq within days if President Saddam
Hussein again attempts to defy UN weapons inspectors in Baghdad. Officials
say air strikes would be triggered if Iraq carried out its threat, made
earlier this month, to deny the UN team access to government ministries.
The US administration is confident that the 22-strong UN team in Baghdad
will demand to visit the Ministry of Military Industrialisation before its
planned departure from Iraq tomorrow. Mr Nikita Smidovich, the Russian who
heads the team, said yesterday he was 'awaiting instructions' from UN
headquarters in New York on the timing of his departure.
Following five hours of discussions with Iraqi officials, Mr Smidovich said:
'Tomorrow (Monday) will be an inspection day.'
The New York Times claimed yesterday the confrontation with Iraq was being
provoked by the White House to boost President George Bush's flagging
re-election campaign. It said the decision was taken last week during a
series of meetings which included consultations with British and French
officials.
But Mr Bush angrily denied he was trying to 'pick a fight' with Iraq and
said the election campaign had 'nothing to do with this'.
A State Department official stressed that any US-Iraqi confrontation was
entirely the responsibility of Baghdad. Iraq's refusal last month to allow
UN inspectors access to the Ministry of Agriculture sparked the present
crisis. Washington has repeatedly stressed its readiness to use force if
Iraq did not comply with UN resolutions.
Military preparations for renewal of hostilities with Iraq are well
advanced. More than 5,000 US troops are in Kuwait for two months of
exercises, brought forward in response to the increased belligerence from
Baghdad. Additional batteries of Patriot missiles are being delivered to
Bahrain and Kuwait, while the Pentagon confirmed that an air warfare control
group has been sent to Saudi Arabia from its base in South Carolina.
The US has more than 200 strike aircraft in the region, principally in Saudi
Arabia and on the carrier Independence in the Gulf. It also has Tomahawk
cruise missiles which could be used as the main strike weapon.
The US could also use the confrontation with Iraq to aid Shia groups in the
south of the country who have been attacked by Saddam Hussein's forces,
including helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. Reports from Iraqi opposition
groups say Baghdad is trying to root out dissidents in the southern marshes.
Iraq responded in typically aggressive fashion over the weekend. Mr Hamed
Youssef Hammadi, the Minister of Information, said in an interview
yesterday: 'If attacked we will fight to the last man without regard for the
consequences.'
He told the German magazine Der Spiegel that Iraq also stood by its
territorial claim to Kuwait and would not rule out the use of force to
achieve it.
Iraq's ambassador to the UN, Mr Abdul Amir al-Anbari, said: 'Obviously
someone is trying to provoke Iraq into taking a confrontational stand.' He
hoped his government would realise this.
Mr John Major, the British prime minister, will discuss Iraq as well as the
crisis in the former Yugoslavia when he meets top ministers tomorrow.
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, a key US Arab ally during the Gulf War,
made a surprise visit to Kuwait yesterday for talks with the emir and other
leaders, adds Tony Walker.
Arab and western officials said it appeared the Egyptian leader wanted to
reassure nervous Gulf states of Egypt's support against possible Iraqi
belligerence.
Mr Mubarak's visit to Kuwait followed that of the Kuwaiti foreign minister,
Sheikh Salem al-Sabah to Cairo and Damascus last week, prompting speculation
that Gulf states may be reviving plans for an Arab deterrent force.

FT  17 AUG 92 / Shareholders show little faith in annual reports, says
survey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST analysts and shareholders do not believe annual reports give a 'true
and fair view' of a company's financial position, according to a survey.
The findings come during an intense debate over the quality of accounting in
British companies. Last week, Mr Terry Smith, head of UK research at UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew, was suspended after he pressed ahead with plans to publish
a critical book on the subject.
While 80 per cent of finance directors had faith in the accounts, 60 per
cent of investor relations consultants - who are often intimately involved
in preparing annual reports - were not confident that they fairly reflected
a company's financial position.
The survey of more than 300 finance directors, analysts, shareholders and
investor relations staff was conducted for McBride's, a design consultancy,
in April and May this year.
Both companies legislation and guidelines for auditors use the phrase 'true
and fair' to mean that the accounts accurately represent the financial state
of the company. But there are differences in the way the accounting
standards required to comply with the phrase are interpreted.
Two-thirds of analysts and a quarter of shareholders said accounts did not
provide a true and fair view. Some 39 per cent of shareholders said they did
give a fair view; 36 per cent said they did not know. One commented: 'An
annual report is self-generated by the company so one cannot expect it to be
true and fair'.
Analysts wanted more information on the value and use of a company's assets,
capital expenditure and the sector in which it operated. Shareholders called
for greater detail on long-term performance and less on profiles of key
staff.
Only 22 per cent of shareholders said the most important purpose of an
annual report was to gather information on financial performance, while 29
per cent said it was for general information about the company.
Nearly two-thirds of shareholders and one-quarter of analysts said they
would be interested in a short form annual report, containing far less
detail on a company's accounts.
But only 2 per cent of finance directors said they were interested in
producing such a report, and 15 per cent of these said they would consider
providing it as well as the full report.
The vast majority of those questioned said clearly-written text, an
uncluttered format and figures which were easy to read were the most
important design features in a report.
Three-fifths of shareholders and nearly two-fifths of analysts believed that
too much money was spent on producing annual reports.

FT  17 AUG 92 / Mortgage debt traps one million households
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ONE MILLION households
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
one in every 10 homeowners with a mortgage - may be trapped with homes worth
less than the value of their loans, according to the Bank of England.
The total value of this 'negative equity' amounts to about Pounds 6bn, an
average of Pounds 6,000 per household affected, the Bank estimates in its
next Quarterly Bulletin to be published tomorrow.
This assessment of the depth of Britain's housing market crisis provided
further evidence of the obstacles to a consumer-led recovery as the
Confederation of British Industry announced a sharp year on year fall in
retail sales in July. This was the second successive monthly fall.
Retailers said sales for the time of year were more depressed in July than
at any time since the CBI distributive trades survey began in 1983. Sales
linked to the housing market were among the worst hit sectors. 'Furniture
and carpet retailers are among those reporting the sharpest annual
declines,' said Mr Andrew Sentance, CBI economics director.
The Bank of England report suggests that households will have to maintain
high savings ratios for some years to rebuild their balance sheets. If house
prices were to rise by 1 per cent per quarter, the value of negative equity
would fall to around Pounds 2 1/2 bn by the end of 1993, although 600,000
households would still face a shortfall.
If they fall by a further 1 per cent a quarter, the value of negative equity
would rise to Pounds 10 1/2 bn by the end of 1993, affecting more than 1.6m
households. A recent research paper by Morgan Grenfell, the UK investment
bank, forecast that house prices would fall by an average 2.5 per cent next
year, and by 4.5 per cent in the south-east.
The two reports together painted a 'devastatingly bleak' picture for the
economy, said Mr Roger Bootle, economist at Midland Montagu, the investment
bank. 'There is a direct conflict between the government's policy for
near-zero inflation and the prospects for relief for hard-pressed
home-owners,' he said.
'If the impotence of the housing market remains, consumer spending is going
to be weak not for one or two quarters but for many years to come,' Mr
Bootle said. Analysts expect official figures for retail sales volumes for
July, released on Wednesday, to be flat compared with June and down 0.1 per
cent year on year.
Shadow Chancellor Mr Gordon Brown called for Mr John Major, the prime
minister to meet mortgage lenders to consider new measures to lift the
depressed housing market. He told the Fife Regional Labour Party the Tory
Party was in 'disarray over its mishandling of the economy'. Britain should
use its EC Presidency to urge 'co-ordinated action to expand the economies
of Europe and get interest rates down,' he said.
Nominal house prices in the south-east have fallen by 25 per cent from a
peak in the last quarter of 1988. The Bank estimates that 876,000 households
were caught in the negative equity trap by falling house prices - 523,000
are in the south-east.
But at least a further 100,000 households are in the debt trap because their
mortage payments have fallen into arrears, or they have undertaken another
loan secured against their property.

THE Bank of England expressed surprise that UK companies chose to raise
their aggregate dividend payments by 7 per cent last year and again in the
first quarter of this year, against a background of restrained profitability
and cost-cutting. Page 4

FT  17 AUG 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: Waiting for M3
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN monetary policy will come under even closer scrutiny this week, as
the D-Mark threatens to make further gains against both the US dollar and
European currencies, writes James Blitz.
Last week's figure for German wholesale prices in July suggested that
inflationary pressures had eased, and slowed the D-Mark's gains against the
dollar. Dealers believe that falling German inflation will reduce the need
for the Bundesbank to keep interest rates high, reducing the wide
differential between US and German short-term rates that is driving the
market.
July's figure for M3 money supply in Germany, which is due out this week,
will help to confirm whether the pressure on rates has really eased. The
indicator is the guiding light of Bundesbank policy, and is expected to
reamain high, at around 8.6 per cent from a previous close of 8.7 per cent.
Some analysts think that the figure could even come in above 9 per cent,
ensuring tight monetary policy.
The markets will keep a close eye on the Bundesbank's weekly intervention in
the money market. Last week, the central bank triggered a fall in the dollar
by withdrawing more liquidity than was expected, pushing call money up to
the Lombard rate level. If the Bank adds net liquidity on Wednesday, the
D-Mark could weaken.
Inside the European Monetary System, the main attention will be on sterling.
Barring open intervention from the Bank of England, sterling's key indicator
will be the provisional figure for second quarter GDP, due out on Wednesday.
After a  1/2 per cent fall in the first quarter, the market believes that
the decline is slowing down to -0.2 per cent.

FT  17 AUG 92 / Economics: GDP may give positive sign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS WEEK could see the technical end of the recession in the UK. Although
the median forecast is for a small fall in second quarter gross domestic
product, the forecasts range from a drop of 0.5 per cent on the first
quarter to growth of 0.4 per cent.
It takes only one quarter of positive output - however slim - to mark the
end of the statistical recession and last week's better than expected
manufacturing output figures could tip the balance. GDP excluding oil and
gas production has fallen for seven successive quarters.
However, there is a risk of the recession continuing into the Autumn.
Today's distributive trades survey from the Confederation of British
Industry suggests that retail sales are still falling. Official figures on
Wednesday are forecast to show flat sales last month.
The following include some of the other economic highlights of the week. The
figures in brackets are the median of economists' forecasts from MMS
International, a financial information company.

year); US, June merchandise trade (Dollars 6.8bn deficit); June, merchandise
exports (Dollars 36.1bn); June merchandise imports (Dollars 43bn); France,
July industrial production (up 0.7 per cent); Canada, June merchandise

RESULTS DUE
INTERIM results from Argos, the catalogue retailer, are due today with most
profit estimates between Pounds 8.5m and Pounds 9.5m pre tax, against Pounds
10.7m last year. The figures are hard to forecast as the first half of the
year is far less important than the Christmas trading period.
Annual figures from Ratners, the jewellery retailer, are also expected this
week. The figures for the year to February 1 are expected to show a loss of
Pounds 125m pre-tax after exceptional costs for rationalisation of Pounds
98m and interest charges of around Pounds 27m. More interesting will be
reports of the group's talks with its bankers and, perhaps, news of a
capital restructuring.
BICC, the cables and Balfour Beatty construction group, is likely to
announce on Wednesday a pre-tax profit fall of about Pounds 10m from the
Pounds 66m made in the first half of last year. A key question - with an eye
on 1993 dividend prospects - will be whether profits are holding up from the
European cables business.
Marley, the building products manufacturer which announces interims on
Wednesday, is expected to show a further fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds
9.3m to about Pounds 8m. The bad news should be softened by a maintained
interim dividend of 2.1p for the third consecutive year - albeit uncovered.
However, the company may indicate a cut in the final pay-out.
Rentokil Group, the environmental services and property care concern, is
expected to stay on course for a 20 per cent earnings increase when it
announces its half-year results on Thursday. Forecasts are for about Pounds
53m compared with Pounds 42.3m.
Profits should have been boosted by strong growth from environmental
services, while sales will have continued to grow more quickly outside the
UK.
Soft insurance markets in the US and a weak dollar will have depressed
Sedgwick and Willis Corroon, the UK's two biggest brokers, which report
interim figures on Tuesday and Thursday respectively. Analysts expect
pre-tax profits of between Pounds 54m and Pounds 63m at Sedgwick, compared
with Pounds 65.3m. Willis's pre-tax profits could fall to between Pounds 55m
and Pounds 65m, from Pounds 69.4m.

FT  17 AUG 92 / US Money and Credit: Treasury market faces test of nerve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME people, it seems, are never satisfied. Despite the fact that Mr Alan
Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, has sanctioned more interest
rate cuts in the past 18 months than any of his predecessors over a
comparable period, and despite borrowing costs being at their lowest level
for almost 30 years, the call has gone up again for another policy ease.
The politicians, of course, are still unhappy with the Fed for not doing
more to boost economic activity, but in an election year that is to be
expected.
The economic pundits in the media also continue to press for further rate
cuts, while plenty of their counterparts on Wall Street agree that more
should be done to breathe fresh life into the weak recovery.
All argue that recent economic indicators show interest rates need to go
lower if consumers are to be persuaded to dig into their wallets and pick up
their spending.
Some go even further, such as Mr Ed Yardeni, the chief economist at
brokerage house CJ Lawrence. Commenting on last week's 'disappointing' 0.4
per cent rise in July industrial production, Mr Yardeni said: 'Manufacturing
production is at a standstill. Weak early August car sales are not
encouraging. We believe lower interest rates are needed just to sustain slow
growth in the economy.'
The chances of a new cut in rates, however, are slim.
For one, the sustained and troubling weakness in the dollar has left the Fed
with less room to manoeuvre. Regular and co-ordinated intervention by US and
European central banks to support the ailing currency during the past few
weeks has shown how concerned the monetary authorities are by the steady
decline in the dollar.
The Fed is unlikely to give the green light to another interest rate
reduction, which would make the dollar even less attractive to overseas
investors, at a time when central banks worldwide are working hard at
propping up the US currency.
Second, the Treasury market is becoming more nervous about the outlook for
efforts to reduce the budget deficit as the election battle hots up, and so
another policy ease may not bring long-term market rates down much further.
Last week was a clear example of how the bond market is unwilling to push
long-term rates substantially lower.
On Thursday, the 30-year bond nose-dived after Mr James Baker, the new chief
of staff at the White House, said tax cuts should be the centrepiece of
President George Bush's re-election campaign and second term.
His comments immediately drew fire from bond analysts. Mr Mitchell Held, of
Smith Barney, said that 'if Baker's statement is meant to imply that
attempts to balance the budget will begin to play second fiddle to the need
for new federal fiscal stimulus to undo the economy's lethargy, then the
fixed-income market's disapproval has only begun to be heard.'
More of that disapproval could be on display over the next few days during
the Republican Party convention.
The market is particularly concerned that the president may announce during
his acceptance speech a tax cut as part of a package of economic stimuli
aimed at recapturing the ground lost in the polls to Democratic nominee
Governor Bill Clinton.
Rumours that he may do just that were flying around Houston yesterday as
delegates arrived for the convention, as was speculation that the president
is ready to recommence hostilities with Iraq.
It looks as though the next five days will be a test of the Treasury
market's nerve - if it breaks, bond yields could head back up through 7.5
per cent in a hurry.

FT  17 AUG 92 / Japanese Bonds: Profit-taking may check strong rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE government bonds have rallied strongly recently, reaching levels
last seen in early 1989 as the plunge in the Tokyo stock market has raised
hopes of a monetary easing.
The slide in the leading Nikkei 225 average below the psychologically
important 15,000 level last week - over 60 per cent off its peak - has
prompted speculation of a further cut in the official discount rate. At the
end of last week, rumours circulated that the Bank of Japan might cut the
reserve requirements for commercial banks, adding to speculation about lower
interest rates.
The yield on the No 129 benchmark bond closed last week at a record low of
4.82 per cent, down from 4.905 per cent. The yield was the lowest for a
benchmark issue since January 1989.
Sagging consumer confidence has also raised hopes of action by the monetary
authorities. Until recently, government officials had been confident that
firm consumer spending would lead the Japanese economy out of recession.
However, the bearishness over the economy has filtered through to ordinary
Japanese, prompting them to tighten their belts. Department store sales were
down 3.7 per cent year-on-year in June, marking the fourth consecutive
decline, while chain-store sales fell 1.1 per cent from the previous year,
representing the first decline in five years.
Concern is also mounting over the health of Japanese banks, which are
burdened with bad loans linked to stocks and property. Bankers believe a
further lowering in the official discount rate is essential to boost
profits, offsetting a sharp increase in write-offs and loan-loss reserves.
Institutional investors have been active buyers in the bond markets, and
turnover in July rose to Y57,242.3bn, excluding brokers' trading on their
own accounts - the highest level in five years. Total turnover rose to
Y117,000bn, exceeding Y100,000bn for the first time since March 1991.
As demand for loans has decreased due to the slowing economy, insurance
companies and long-term credit banks have shifted into long-term funds. The
Japan Securities Dealers Association said net buying by life and non-life
assurers doubled from the previous month to a record Y920bn, while long-term
credit banks bought a record Y500bn, up 7.5 times from the previous month.
However, in spite of the excitement, analysts believe the rally in
government bonds may end soon. The yield on the 10-year benchmark has fallen
over 380 basis points from the 8.7 per cent level two years ago. Mr Russell
Jones, economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in Tokyo, says that although
investors may find little incentive to sell while the stock market weakness
lasts profit-taking may begin.
One factor which may hinder an easing of credit by the Bank of Japan, is the
rising trade surplus. Lower interest rates would lead to a weakening of the
yen against the dollar, and could contribute to Japan's already mounting
trade surplus.
With Japan's trade surplus in July rising 40 per cent from the previous year
to a record Dollars 9.2bn, the central bank will need to find a balance
between a weaker currency and the weakening economy.

FT  17 AUG 92 / UK Gilts: Auction targets domestic investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOMORROW, the Bank of England will announce the full details of its next
auction of gilt-edged stock, scheduled for August 26.
So far, the Bank has said the stock will be a conventional gilt with a
maturity of more than 15 years. Market participants are expecting the Bank
to auction Pounds 2.5bn of the 8 3/4 per cent gilt due 2017, although the 9
per cent gilt due 2008 is seen as a possible alternative.
Whichever is chosen, the fact remains that this is the third auction in a
row to be aimed at domestic - rather than foreign - investors.
Overseas investors tend to prefer 10-year or shorter-dated stocks, and the
Bank has successfully pitched some of its past gilt sales at foreigners by
selecting these maturities.
Indeed, foreigners were significant buyers of gilts last year and in the
early part of 1992. However, their interest in the gilt market showed clear
signs of waning in the second quarter with sales to overseas investors
dropping sharply in April and May.
Even though gilt purchases by overseas investors picked up again in June,
market-makers point out that North American and Far Eastern investors remain
apprehensive about the European government bond markets in general, ever
since the Danes voted against ratification of the Maastricht Treaty and put
a question-mark over the future of European economic and monetary union.
Domestic investors, on the other hand, have been eager buyers of gilts in
the second quarter and still appear to have a healthy appetite for gilts and
other fixed income investments.
The latest Smith New Court/Gallup survey of UK fund managers - which came
out last week - showed that 'managers remain more interested in increasing
their exposure to bonds as against equities . . . the balance of managers
planning to increase holdings of UK gilts was 30 per cent in August, only
slightly below July's level (32 per cent) which was the highest for two
years'.
For those fund managers reared on the cult of the equity in the 1980s, this
represents quite a change of tune. However, given the difficult economic
conditions in the UK and the feeling that it may be some time before matters
improve, fund managers are naturally worried about the prospects for
dividend growth in the UK.
At the same time, as inflation in the UK continues to fall, domestic
investors are being given the opportunity of locking into high-yielding
gilts.
The inflation figures released last week were particularly good: average
earnings - released on Thursday - showed a fall from 6.25 per cent in May to
6.0 per cent in June.
Friday's announcement, showing the annual rate of retail price inflation
fell to 3.7 per cent in July from 3.9 per cent in June, raised hopes that
inflation could fall to between 3.25 and 3.5 per cent by the end of 1992 and
to about 2 per cent by the end of next year.
While sterling's weakness against the D-Mark cast a black cloud over the
gilt market for most of last week, the release of such favourable RPI
figures - coinciding with good inflation data from Germany - helped to push
gilt prices up by over a point on Friday.
'The prospects for inflation do genuinely look good - so investors are being
given the chance to lock into irresistible (gilt) yields at a time of real
uncertainty over equities,' says one UK economist.
Since the government started borrowing in the gilt market again, UK
institutions have been keen to see an improvement in the liquidity of
certain long-dated gilts and some of them hinted to the Bank that they
wanted to see the creation of an 'extra-long' issue, thereby extending the
government debt maturity profile.
At the last two auctions, their wishes were granted. On April 29, the Bank
auctioned Pounds 2.5bn of the newly-created 8 3/4 per cent gilt due 2017,
the 'super-long' gilt: the bonds were taken up mainly by UK insurance
companies looking for long-dated paper to match their liabilities.
The following auction - on June 24 - of Pounds 2.75bn of the 9 per cent gilt
due 2012, was also dominated by domestic investors.
No doubt the Bank is hoping fund managers stick to their guns and increase
their gilt allocations at this month's auction too.

<TEXT>
CHINA has given Citic, the state-owned investment company most closely
linked with economic reform policies, broad autonomy to borrow and invest
without central government permission, the China Daily newspaper said,
Reuter reports from Beijing.
China International Trust and Investment Corp, Beijing's most westernised
company with businesses ranging from banking to real estate to satellites,
can now borrow overseas without obtaining prior approval, as long as it
keeps within a ceiling set for the five years ending in 1995.
Citic now also has complete autonomy to decide on investment projects under
Yn200m (Dollars 37m) at home and Dollars 30m abroad, the official newspaper
said.
It did not say what the five-year ceiling on borrowing was.
Mr Wei Mingyi, Citic president, said the organisation now had complete
freedom to decide the amount of loans, their tenor, the market, the lead
managing bank and the currency. Previously the government had to approve
each case.
The lifting of investment restrictions will also speed Citic's business. Mr
Wei said in the past it had sometimes taken months to receive approval for
even a Dollars 1m project.
Citic hopes to have diversified investments around the world with its shares
listed and traded on exchanges worldwide within a decade, the newspaper
said.
The company last year benefited from the fast growth in China's economy and
recorded one of its best results. Profits jumped 42.5 per cent to Yn368.9m
from Yn258.8m, according to its latest annual report.
It recorded only 5 per cent profit growth in 1990 compared to 1989 because
of a market slump and a domestic credit crunch.

<TEXT>
ISTITUTO Bancario San Paolo di Torino, the Italian bank which floated some
of its shares earlier this year, has confirmed its interest in expanding in
France, possibly by acquiring Centrale de Banque, the lossmaking retail
banking chain owned by Societe Generale.
The French bank has said that San Paolo was 'interested' in buying the unit.
However, a spokesman for San Paolo denied reports that negotiations on a
purchase were already taking place.
San Paolo, which raised L1,525bn (Dollars 1.4bn) by listing 20 per cent of
its shares last March, has a 50-branch network in France through its
Sanpaolo Banque subsidiary.
Most of its branches have come through the acquisition in recent years of
Banque Vernes and Banque Francaise Commerciale, two small retail banking
operations.
However, the company has indicated that it sees 100 branches as representing
the minimum size for an acceptable retail banking presence in the French
market.
Centrale de Banque has 730 employees and 50 branches, and it is thought
their locations would fit well with Banque Sanpaolo's network.

chemicals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BP CHEMICALS continued the restructuring of its petrochemicals operations
with the announcement of the proposed sale of its low density polyethylene
plant at Antwerp.
Neste Chemicals, the acquisitive state-owned Finnish group, is to buy the
120,000-tonne-a-year operation.
Terms were not disclosed. However, with low density polyethylene prices at
about DM1.17 a kilo, the plant's turnover would be about DM140m (Pounds
49.6m). It makes tubular polyethylene for wire and cable insulation and
packaging materials.
BP Chemicals said the sale was part of its efforts to focus its polyolefins
operations on areas of competitive strength. The company would concentrate
on ethylene derivative production where it could use cheap gas rather than
naphtha feedstocks. It is currently building a 330,000-tonne-a-year plant at
its Grangemouth complex.
The company said the sale would have no effect on the south Wales Baglan Bay
ethylene plant that supplies the Antwerp polyethylene business.
A transitional agreement has been agreed between the groups so that BP
Chemicals will supply ethylene for two years. Industry observers believe an
option exists for the company to close a 120,000 tonne train at the Baglan
Bay site. There is another 210,000 train there. As many as 120 workers have
already been made redundant.
Neste, Europe's second largest polyolefins manufacturer, already has a joint
venture with Petrofina called FinaNeste which has more than 1m tonnes
ethylene capacity at Antwerp. The group also has polyethylene plants in
Finland, Sweden and Portugal.
BP Chemicals said between 250 and 300 of its 900 staff at Antwerp would
transfer to Neste as part of the deal. A further 100 jobs would be lost.
In a separate deal, Neste is also buying BP America's performance polymers
business at Hackettstown, New Jersey. Its 40,000 tonne a year plant makes
polyethylene and other polymers and employs 125 people, all of whom will
transfer to Neste. Financial details were not given.
The sales follow BP's announcement earlier this month of a strategic
alliance with Enichem of Italy in styrene and polyethylene.

FT  17 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Solvency ratio debate starts hotting up -
The reaction to Royal Insurance's restructuring move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEBATE within the insurance industry about the value of the solvency
ratio, one of the principal tools used to measure the financial strength of
non-life insurance companies, is set to hot up following a sharp rise in
Royal Insurance's ratio after its restructuring last week.
Royal announced on Thursday that it was transferring ownership of its life
insurance subsidiary from the general insurance sub-holding to the parent
non-insurance holding company. This released funds of Pounds 547m and
allowed the general insurance business to liquidate debt and financed an
increase in its net assets.
Although at group level the overall asset and liability position remained
unchanged, Royal said the solvency ratio - net assets as a percentage of
non-life premium income - of its general insurance business had increased
from under 30 to a comfortable 40 per cent.
The move was criticised as 'cosmetic' by some analysts. Mr Stephen Bird, of
Smith New Court, the securities house, points out that it means Royal is now
presenting its solvency on a different basis to other companies in the
sector. More generally, after recent losses and declines in asset values
have eaten into the industry's strength and increased the need for closer
scrutiny, analysts are beginning to question the value of the indicator.
The logic of the solvency ratio seems straightforward enough. The stronger a
company's capital base the less chance there is of it being unable to pay
insurance claims, and the more insurance policies it can sell. The volume of
premium income acts as a kind of proxy for the scale of risk being assumed.
But the ratio has a number of shortcomings. For a start, the definition of
what constitutes an adequate ratio varies widely.
Industry regulators insist on a minimum of between 16 and 18 per cent, but
are likely to press for corrective action long before this point is reached.
The market - insurance brokers, analysts and investors in insurance
companies - has gradually become less conservative about the level it
regards as adequate. During the 1970s, a ratio of less than 50 per cent was
considered worrying. More recently the level of acceptability has fallen to
as low as 30 per cent.
'There's been a general recognition that from a shareholder's point of view
too much solvency can depress your rate of return on capital,' says an
executive with one leading UK insurer. 'It is a moving target to some
extent,' says Mr Youssef Zaia of Morgan Stanley, another securities house.
Regulatory and market assessments of the assets that can be taken into
account for the calculation vary. UK regulators insist on a very precise and
complex definition of admissible assets, with limits on particular
categories of assets. For example, if an insurance company had invested a
quarter of its assets in one single company, for solvency purposes it would
only be able to take into account a proportion of these.
Regulators are also only interested in the business conducted by the
operating insurance company. By contrast in assessing their own solvency,
companies may include assets held at group level. Commercial Union takes the
value of its extensive life insurance businesses outside the UK, including
those registered in the name of its large Dutch subsidiary, Delta Lloyd. It
also brings the value of a UK 'non participating' life assurance fund into
the picture, which contributes a further Pounds 90m to net assets and boosts
solvency to 42.5 per cent.
By including the value of the life business which it has 'sold' to its group
holding company, Royal too has converted its life business into an asset for
its general insurance business. On the other hand Sun Alliance, the
strongest insurer (with a ratio in the mid-fifties according to analysts),
Guardian Royal Exchange (about 40 per cent) and General Accident (38 per
cent) do not include extensive life insurance businesses when they make
calculations.
The ratio has also been criticised because it fails to adequately indicate
the real level of risk a company is running. Companies can, in effect, be
penalised for taking measures to reduce risk.
All other things being equal, an increase in premium rates, for example,
will lead to higher premium income and a drop in the solvency ratio. On the
other hand a company cutting premiums to win market share might be insuring
more risks for the same premium income. This increase of risk would,
however, not be reflected in a falling solvency margin.
The measure also fails to differentiate between classes of risk on an
insurer's books. The risks incurred in insuring a motor car are much less
than those in insuring an oil rig, for example. Yet Pounds 1 of premium
earned from either policy counts for exactly the same in the solvency
calculation.
'It is a very wide measure that doesn't take into account different risk
exposures,' says Mr Paul Found of Commercial Union.

Beazer violated the regulations in 1987 and 1988, the government claimed.
Beazer, which paid Dollars 1.8bn for Koppers, was purchased last year by

FT  17 AUG 92 / International Financing: Private US debt market plugs the
funding gap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONG-TERM, fixed-rate money these days is hard to find. Banks often do not
want to lend it: capital and credit concerns have made them unwilling
long-term lenders. Public bond markets are not interested unless the
borrower is a top-class name, and even then do not provide money for longer
than 10 years. So it is a relief to a growing number of European corporate
treasurers that the private US debt markets are plugging the gap.
In 1985, foreign companies accounted for only 2.5 per cent of the debt
placed privately in the US. The proportion has grown steadily ever since,
save for a brief dip in 1990, reaching 18.1 per cent last year - or Dollars
17.8bn.
British companies have led the way. The latest round of deals, announced in
recent days, includes Pilkington (which had sought Dollars 200m but
increased the deal to Dollars 300m due to demand), and Smiths Industries and
United Newspapers (which raised Dollars 100m each). All have used the money
to repay short-term borrowings.
In all, British companies raised nearly Dollars 5bn last year. Swedish,
Dutch and German companies managed another Dollars 4bn between them.
Some 20 to 30 of the US's biggest insurers account for the bulk of the
market. US insurers hold around two-thirds of their investments in
fixed-income securities, compared with a typical holding of 15 to 20 per
cent by UK insurers, and so have a vast appetite for new fixed-income
investments. At the moment, many non-US companies are getting a better
reception from these insurers than US ones.
This is partly because the insurers have turned their back on higher-risk
investments at home: US insurance industry regulators, prompted by insurance
companies' junk bond losses, imposed new rules in 1990 on the credit quality
of their investments.
At the other end of the spectrum, many US companies with a better credit
standing have turned to the public bond markets to take advantage of the
high level of demand in the past two years.
That has left US investors short of domestic assets to buy. 'Effectively,
they are underinvested,' says Mr William Coles, of Salomon Brothers.
One result is a new love-affair with foreign companies. Investors have begun
to look overseas more actively for companies to invest in to replace the
decline in US business - and investment banks have put more effort into
developing deals to bring to the investors. Prudential Insurance Corporation
of the US, for instance, now has a subsidiary in London to seek out
investments. Among the deals it has been responsible for arranging was a
Dollars 100m 15-year facility last year for Scapa Group, a maker of coatings
for pulp and paper.
For corporate treasurers, one of the attractions of private placements in
the US has been the freedom from the Securities and Exchange Commission's
disclosure requirements. However, there are other drawbacks.
One is the type of covenants that investors demand. Typically, these include
interest cover and gearing ratios that are more onerous than those imposed
by unsecured bank lending. US investors also ask for a covenant governing
'event risk', allowing them to opt for repayment in certain circumstances.
These extra safeguards are perhaps not surprising given the disadvantageous
position a long-term, unsecured creditor is in. 'No one wants to be the
longest lender to a corporation,' says Mr Ron Tannenbaum, head of private
placements at UBS in London.
Another potential drawback is the attention of rating agencies. All debt
securities held by insurance companies in the US are rated by the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners: the ratings are used by regulators
when setting each insurer's reserve requirements. Many deals are also pawed
over by ratings agencies, however.
In part, that is because more are issued under the SEC's rule 144a, which
allows for a limited market to develop (about one-third of the issues by
foreign companies last year were under this rule). Moody's Investors Service
has caused some waves by issuing unsolicited ratings on private deals. At
least one company, Usinor Sacilor, of France, withdrew a planned private
placement when the agency said it would issue a rating.
Ratings by commercial agencies may already be desirable in the 144a market
and in time could become standard, according to IBCA, the UK-based agency.
If so, that could remove one of the current attractions of the market for
investors.
In time, more European companies could turn to the private placement markets
that are developing in their own back yard. One investment bank in London
estimates the European market to be worth Dollars 25bn to Dollars 30bn a
year. But it is what the bank calls a 'private private market' (deals are
not announced, unlike the US).
It is also highly fragmented: investors tend to prefer domestic investors,
rather than those from overseas. And each domestic market has developed its
own characteristics. For instance, the market for permanent interest bearing
shares (Pibs) issued by UK building societies, though nominally a public
one, is to all intents and purposes a private market, with mainly UK
institutional investors tucking the paper away into their portfolios.
Hence the strong German private placement market, or the developing one in
the UK, are seldom open to foreign companies. Until that changes, the US
will remain the most obvious source of long-term debt finance for many
European companies.

VITAL FORSIKRING, reported a 19 per cent fall in first-half pre-tax profit,
before extraordinary items. The company saw the figure decline to NKr555m
(Dollars 96m) from NKr689m a year earlier due to a fall in financial income
as a result of the weak stock market.
Group financial income also fell, to NKr1.47bn from NKr1.67bn, and Vital
took a charge of NKr157m for an unrealised loss on securities.
Premium income, however, rose to NKr1.43bn from NKr1.24bn while operating
expenses were cut to NKr275m from NKr282m.
Vital said premium income jumped 16 per cent, with income from the sale of
life insurances and pensions with single premiums increasing by 18 per cent
and sales of insurance with annual premiums rose 15 per cent.
The company added that despite a drop in financial income the yield on total
assets increased to 9 per cent.
Actual and estimated losses on loans at the half-year mark were just NKr9m,
but no comparative figure was given.
Since the turn of the year reserves covering investment assets were reduced
to NKr39m from NKr111m, Vital said. Vital said that since the end of June,
the reduction in asset values had continued because of the weak performance
of the stock markets at home and abroad.

FT  17 AUG 92 / International Company News: Canadian airlines merger stalls
on buy-out proposal
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADIAN Airlines International has stalled controversial merger talks with
Air Canada to consider a buy-out proposal from a group of its employees
backed by several Canadian provincial governments.
The pressure on Canada's two leading airlines either to merge or forge
alliances with foreign carriers was underlined however, by continued heavy
losses in the second quarter. The two carriers posted a combined loss of
CDollars 163m (USDollars 137m) in the latest three-month period, and
CDollars 401m in the first half of 1992.
PWA Corp of Calgary, Canadian's parent company, was pushed into Air Canada's
embrace late last month after it called off negotiations for American
Airlines of Dallas to acquire a significant minority shareholding.
Since then, the future of the two airlines has become a highly-charged
political issue. Besides concern about the commercial implications of a
monopoly carrier, the western provinces are nervous that they will suffer
the heaviest job losses from a merger. The deal would probably leave
Montreal-based Air Canada calling most of the shots.
PWA said late on Friday that Air Canada's merger terms were unacceptable.
While the two airlines have not broken off talks, PWA said it will at the
same time study a hastily-assembled proposal from its employees. This would
include bridge financing from several provinces, including Alberta and
British Columbia, where the bulk of Canadian's operations are located.
Outsiders are speculating that PWA may also revive its talks with American.
Air Canada's second-quarter loss was CDollars 129m, or CDollars 1.73 a
share, up from CDollars 30m, or 41 cents a share, a year earlier. The latest
figure includes a charge of CDollars 31m to cover, among other things, staff
cuts. The operating loss rose to CDollars 35m from CDollars 6m.
PWA lost CDollars 34.4m, or 74 cents a share, virtually unchanged from
CDollars 34.7m, or 75 cents a share. The company said that without new
financing, Canadian's ability to continue operating and meet its financial
obligations in 1993 was 'a matter of concern'.

FT  17 AUG 92 / International Company News: Delta Air pilots add conditions
to pay deal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PILOTS at Delta Air Lines, one of three US 'mega-carriers', have refused to
make wage concessions until they have reviewed the company's finances - a
process which could take some months, agencies report.
Delta, which took over Pan Am's transatlantic routes last year in a key
expansion move, has recently been making heavy losses.
Having reported a Dollars 506.3m loss after tax in the year to end-June, the
airline announced plans last month for a 5 per cent staffing cut, greater
use of contract services, more seasonal flights and other cost-cutting
measures.
The airline is understood to have asked its pilots - the only group of its
employees who are unionised - to delay a 5 per cent wage increase due to
take effect in September.
In a recent letter to pilots, the company described the recent 'fare wars'
in the airline industry as an 'economic bloodbath' which could threaten the
company's future.
Traditionally, Delta has been viewed as one of the more benevolent airline
employers, and its last pilots' contracts made Delta pilots the best paid in
the US.
The pilots, however, have already agreed to extend that contract, originally
due to expire in August 1993, to allow the carrier to digest the Pan Am
assets.
Trans World Airlines has reached an agreement in principle with the
6,000-strong Independent Federation of Flight Attendants under which the
union would acquire a 45 per cent equity stake in the carrier. TWA said the
deal contemplated the workers giving 15 per cent wage, benefit and work rule
concessions in exchange for the equity.
The airline said the flight attendants' union was the first of its three
unions to agree to the deal. It said the deal remained subject to certain
conditions, including bankruptcy court approval and execution of agreements
with the carrier's other unions.

<TEXT>
VITAL FORSIKRING, Norway's second-biggest insurer, has issued a sharp
warning that domestic insurance companies would be forced to halt stock
market investment unless new regulations covering allocation of life
insurance profits were amended.
Mr Bjoern Elvestad, Vital's president, said life insurance companies would
have serious problems in maintaining their role as long-term investors in
Norwegian companies because of the current rules.
'The consequence of these regulations may be that insurance companies will
be forced out of the stock market, and in that event an important source of
funding for Norway's capital-impoverished businesses will dry up,' Mr
Elvestad said.
Vital estimates the need for capital by large, domestic stock-listed
companies during the next four years at NKr100bn (Dollars 17bn).
New regulations, based on the Norwegian Insurance Act, now call for the
policyholders' share of annual profits from life insurance companies to be
credited completely to the policyholder and on a continuing basis, based on
market value.
These allocations will have to be made annually, as well as at the
termination or transfer of an insurance contract.
'As unrealised gains are also to be distributed, companies' abilities to
withstand major fluctuations in the securities' markets, will be reduced,'
Mr Elvestad said. He said the 'market-value principle' imposes an unwanted
short-term focus on the companies' share investments.

FT  17 AUG 92 / International Company News: New European debit card player -
The establishment of Europay International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of National Westminster Bank's most senior executives is to head a new
inter-bank payments organisation being set up to create a new debit card for
Europe and outflank debit card services offered by Visa International.
Mr Ron Williams, NatWest's director for payment services, has been appointed
as the first chief executive of Europay International, a card payment
organisation to be formed through a merger of Eurocard International, the
European affiliate of MasterCard, and Eurocheque International.
Mr Williams is vice-chairman of the board of Eurocard, a consortium of
European banks, led by the Big Three German banks. The main Eurocard banks
are strongly opposed to the possible expansion of Visa International in
Europe.
In Germany and several other north European countries, Eurocard dominates
the market and Visa has relatively few members and cards in circulation.
This contrasts with the UK, where Visa has a larger number of cards and
member-banks than the MasterCard/Eurocard network and all large banks belong
to both Visa and MasterCard.
Until recently, the Eurocard banks regarded paper Eurocheques, introduced in
the 1960s, as the standard instrument for consumer payments.
Europay is an attempt to establish a new card-based electronic point-of-sale
payment instrument. The aim is to head off the challenge from Visa and give
consumers a means of making payment by debit card across Europe.
Europay will continue to issue Eurocheque products and Eurocards, but its
main work will be to establish a standard European debit card branding which
is likely to include all debit card products not linked to the Visa network.
The new company comes into operation on September 1.
Mr Williams says he expects around 90m European debit cards to be in the
market by the end of 1993, about twice the number of Visa debit cards now in
circulation.
The emergence of the European debit card comes on the heels of plans by
MasterCard International, the global credit card system which owns a 15 per
cent stake in Eurocard, to launch a new debit card branding called Maestro
in North America.
Though Visa has offered debit cards, such as Barclays Connect, for several
years, this is the first debit card in the MasterCard family.
MasterCard has designed Maestro as a distinct card brand which can operate
independently of its credit cards. A formal system of interchange fees, the
commission paid by a retailer's bank to the cardholder's bank each time a
card is used, has been established.
The fee is a standard 1 per cent of the transaction for credit cards, but
for Maestro it is expected to be around 0.5 per cent.
The introduction of the fee is expected to arouse protests from retailers
who claim the fees enable banks to operate a cartel on their card payment
services.
The European debit card will have its own branding, but it will will be
linked to Maestro's global network and each European debit card will carry
the Maestro logo on its reverse.
Switch, the UK electronic debit card branding, is understood to be
considering whether to link up with the European debit card.

QUEBECOR, the North American publishing and printing group, reported a sharp
increase in second-quarter net profits. They jumped to CDollars 15.5m
(USDollars 13m), or 28 cents a share, up 76 per cent on CDollars 8.8m, or 18
cents a share, a year earlier.
Sales advanced to CDollars 616m, compared with CDollars 593m.
First-half profits rose to CDollars 20.7m, or 37 cents a share, up from
CDollars 11.1m, or 23 cents, a year earlier, on sales of CDollars 1.2bn,
against CDollars 1.16bn.
The latest period excluded a CDollars 48.5m special gain, which brought
per-share earnings to CDollars 1.22.
Commercial printing in Canada and the US turned in the best performance, but
publishing and other sectors also delivered improved results.
Quebecor includes 28 per cent of Donohue, a newsprint producer, in its
figures.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LISE Bockhart is swapping her computing job at British Telecom for the
exotic occupation of aromatherapist, using fragrant oils and massage to
treat stresses and ailments.
Her choice of a new career may be unusual but the voluntary redundancy
package she has picked up from her employer is fairly typical of the terms
of Release 92.
A lump sum of Pounds 21,000 includes the maximum 'early leaver' bonus and
money in lieu of notice. She also gets Pounds 1,000 towards the cost of her
retraining.
Bockhart, aged 31 and with a son of five, had worked for BT for eight years
and was earning Pounds 17,000 when she left at the end of May.
She says she 'moved very quickly' when she heard about the package: out of
her 30 immediate colleagues, six have left under the scheme but a further
four have been refused.
Her Hertfordshire-based job was on BT's internal computer 'help desk',
taking about 200 enquiries a day and problem solving over the telephone.
Before that, Bockhart was a senior data processing officer - a job which
gave her greater opportunities for overtime and shift payments.
If morale within the company had not been so low and future job prospects so
insecure, Bockhart says she would not have gone for voluntary redundancy. 'I
knew our site was threatened with closure.
'Other sites have been moved to the far reaches of Scotland where labour is
cheaper. It would have been impossible to relocate,' she says.
Bockhart expects to be qualified as an aromatherapist by the New Year and
wants to work freelance from her home in St Albans. 'I've left a stressful
working environment. Now my job will be to treat others who are still
there,' she says.

FT  17 AUG 92 / People: Withdrawing from Wescol
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Alan Riddle and David Sutton, who joined the board of USM-quoted steel
fabricator Wescol in May, have resigned already, as the stock market turned
sour and general business confidence dropped, putting an effective halt to
expansion plans.
Riddle, 50, and Sutton, 39, had set up in business together in 1988, when
they both left Tarmac. Having developed an interest in niche building
material products, including a controlling stake in a security shutters and
grills business, they were keen to merge with Wescol, which they had
identified as a well-managed company, albeit in a problem sector. 'We
thought we had seen a window of opportunity to raise money and build it up.'
But they had underestimated the grave problems afflicting the sector - with
structural steel and building components combine Ward Group, for instance,
going into administration about the time the pair joined Wescol. The climate
for rights issues also 'fell off a cliff', as Sutton puts it.
The previous Wescol chairman John Hicks had resigned in May over an
unrelated matter. Riddle and Sutton had lined up 'a well known figure in
construction and engineering' to chair what should have been an expanding
business. But with their plans dropped, Barry Anysz, a non-executive
director since 1987, and acting chairman following Hicks' departure, is
confirmed as chairman.

FT  17 AUG 92 / International Company News: C&amp;W talks could lead to listing
for Mercury - Telecommunications group seeks strategic partner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CABLE &amp; WIRELESS, the telecommunications group, is looking for a strategic
partner to take a stake in Mercury Communications which could result in a
separate listing for its subsidiary.
Mr James Ross, chief executive, said: 'While Mercury does not need a link-up
with another company we are looking for a strategic partner to invest in
Mercury Communications.
'This would enhance its value within the group and would ensure the market
valuation of Cable &amp; Wireless properly reflected the value of Mercury. A
long-term option would then be to seek a separate listing for Mercury.'
Cable &amp; Wireless is currently in negotiations to form a partnership between
Mercury and US West, the North American Telephone company.
Fears that US West would not receive the regulatory permission to take a
stake in Mercury because it holds an international licence have so far
proved unfounded.
While Mr Ross declined to comment on any talks that may be taking place, he
outlined the reason for seeking a partner for Mercury.
'We believe a strategic partner for Mercury would link its long-distance
services with a local network and an equity injection could be used either
to repay debt or make further acquisitions. We are, however, in no hurry to
do a deal'.
An enhancement of Mercury's value would make a separate listing more likely
in the long-term since by selling a stake to another group it will have
established a market price.
The Hong Kong Telecom subsidiary of Cable &amp; Wireless has its own listing on
the Hong Kong, New York and Pacific stock exchanges.
The talks with US West underline the importance that Cable &amp; Wireless
attaches to finding a strategic partner for Mercury to challenge the
dominance of BT in the UK.
As one of the 'baby bell' US regional companies born in the aftermath of the
break-up of American Telephone and Telegraph in 1984, US West would need
permission to take a stake in Mercury in order to participate in
international services.
The Federal Communication Commission, the US regulatory authority, said
waivers to participate in international services had been given to 'baby
bell' companies in the past and would probably be given in the future.
Negotiations between the two companies may be prolonged. Cable &amp; Wireless is
also negotiating with US West to take a stake in TeleWest, its cable
television joint venture in the UK.
TeleWest, which provides local telephone services, is a joint venture
between US West and TeleCommunications, the US cable television group.
The inclusion of a third party in the negotiations is one of the reasons why
the talks are likely to be prolonged.

FT  17 AUG 92 / Unit trusts faced with hedging restrictions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH unit trusts, which manage some Pounds 57bn, have been effectively
barred from hedging their investment portfolios following guidance from a
City regulator.
The unofficial guidance caught fund managers unawares and has led to a
review of their use of derivatives markets.
The guidance, issued at a private conference for trustees recently by a
staff member of Imro, the investment regulator, means managers of unit
trusts are not allowed to use derivative instruments except in rare
circumstances.
Mr Graham Dunnachie of Imro told trustees of unit trusts that their fund
managers should only buy derivatives based on particular market indices if
there is at least a 95 per cent correlation between that index and their own
investment portfolio.
That means the manager of a portfolio of UK shares could not use the FT-SE
100 futures contract traded on Liffe unless his own portfolio matched the
FT-SE 100 index almost exactly. Such a correlation is only followed by
specialised indexed funds.
The ruling, aimed at preventing fund managers using derivatives for
speculation rather than hedging, creates particular problems for
international fund managers, who generally have investments spread across a
number of markets.
'I don't think people at Imro have any idea of what derivatives are about,'
one unit trust fund manager said last week.

<TEXT>
Sir, Dr Sally's letter (August 10) is surprising, coming from an institution
which has as its goal the promotion of forward looking strategic thinking.
Dr Sally's arguments relate to the past, not the future. I am not sure the
stakeholders in Bayer, Hoechst and BASF would agree that Germany is today 'a
conducive environment'. High wages, environmental costs which outweigh the
benefits they bestow and a legislative/constitutional environment that
prevents the exploitation of biotechnology - hardly a positive picture. Many
observers of today's chemical landscape have suggested that the three
chemical companies face equal traumas to those which ICI is already setting
about tackling. It has been noticeable that only in recent years have these
companies begun to deal with their sprawling bureaucracies and reduce
headcounts.
Even without a level playing field - equivalent electricity prices and a
similar cost of capital to name only two - I would be hesitant to pick them
as tomorrow's winners.

FT  17 AUG 92 / Letter: Pension age that is not supportable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr R H PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Bryan Freake (Letters, August 11) accuses the Confederation of British
Industry of failing to appreciate the implications of current retirement
patterns in its support for an equalised state pension age of 65. But there
is little depth to his own vision when he argues for an equalised age of 60
which seeks to enrich pensioners in future by placing an impossible cost
burden on the next generation of workers and their employers.
It is true that during periods of labour-shedding recently, employers have
seen early retirement as one of the more acceptable methods of reducing the
workforce. But the CBI's proposal seeks a common pension age that will meet
the UK's labour market needs in the second decade of the next century and
beyond. Older workers will play an increasingly important role as the
proportion of younger people in the labour force falls. Paying pensions as
early as 55, as MSF suggests, would encourage an early retirement culture
the nation could in no sense afford. In terms of cost and the imperatives of
the labour market, an equalised age lower than 65 is unsupportable. It also
goes against employees' own wishes to work on later in life, encouraging the
very age discrimination that Mr Freake is rightly anxious to avoid. Richard

FT  17 AUG 92 / Letter: Poor argument for employers to scrap disabled quota
scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr STEVE SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The Confederation of British Industry's statement (Letters, August 10)
that more employers must be made aware of what disabled people can offer in
the labour market is to be welcomed. However, we strongly disagree with the
view that because employers cannot make the quota scheme work it should be
scrapped.
Quota schemes do work elsewhere in Europe - most notably in Germany, which
has implemented a very effective quota scheme of 6 per cent. However, such
schemes need the full support of government and in the UK the government
does little to enforce it: three-quarters of employers fail to meet the UK's
more limited 3 per cent target, yet there have only been some 10
prosecutions since the quota was implemented in 1944.
Mr Gilbert of the CBI argues that one problem with the scheme is that
disabled people themselves object to being categorised by the registration
process. The Spastics Society's own research shows that, in fact, the reason
disabled people do not register for the quota scheme is that they have
little faith in its effort on behalf of government and employers to make the
most of the untapped pool of talent represented by unemployed disabled
people.

FT  17 AUG 92 / Letter: Correction of an imbalance in industrial legislation
is overdue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr D ROONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Re David Goodhart's article 'Stewards shop for new members', may I put
a hypothetical question?: 'How do you market an excellent product when the
retailers have told the potential consumers that it is 'forbidden fruit'?'
For the problem facing potential trade union members is 'fear'. I have been
involved in a recruitment campaign at a company based at Bathgate, near
Edinburgh, and I can readily understand any employee being apprehensive
about joining a trade union if their employer is 'anti-union' (in most
companies this is the case).
It has to be recognised that the alleged union 'barons' of the 1960s and
1970s have been replaced in the 1980s and 1990s by the employers' 'boot
boys' - oblivious to the seeds of conflict and destruction that they sow.
If an employee joins a trade union and is victimised as a consequence (an
unheard-of situation, of course?), it is extremely difficult to take
successful legal action against the employer.
The present legislation totally supports the employee who chooses to remain
a non-member. Trade unions have learned to live with this situation.
What is unacceptable, however, is that when 60 per cent, 70 per cent or even
80 per cent of a work force join the same trade union and ask for
recognition, and are refused, they have no legal redress in this regard.
There is a need for legislation based on former section 11 of the Employment
Protection Act 1975, which gave trade unions an avenue to claim recognition
on behalf of a group of work people who had been taken into membership and
meaning to the legal right 'to belong to a trade union'.
Potential trade union membership is, in my opinion, substantial, and work
people of today are not driven by ideals of egalitarianism. They want
support and assistance to negotiate 'the basics', ie personal contacts,
pensions, performance-related pay, shift working/pay, health and safety etc,
all of which feature to a considerable extent in their working life.
Trade unions are by far the best vehicle for maintaining the 'checks and
balances' necessary for an efficient and harmonious industrial society. The
need to correct the existing imbalance in industrial legislation is long
overdue.

It was the reforms of the new South Africa which allowed the Springboks and
the All Blacks to renew their rugby rivalry over the weekend after a gap of
11 years. The day itself, however, was very much an old South Africa affair.
The overwhelmingly white crowd of 70,000 took the opportunity to deliver a
large raspberry to politically correct sporting administrators who had tried
to prevent playing of the national anthem - Die Stem van Suid Afrika (The
voice of South Africa) - and displays of the national flag, two symbols with
a strong apartheid flavour.
Johannesburg's Ellis Park stadium was completely awash with South African
flags and twice rose to deliver spontaneous renditions of Die Stem, sung
with a gusto the sombre tune seldom enjoys. The second occasion coincided
with what was supposed to be a minute of silence for victims of recent
political violence in the country.
Not surprisingly, an angry ANC is threatening to review its support for
Saturday's match against the Wallabies.

Why are accountants Price Waterhouse increasing the starting salaries of
their graduate in-take by 20 per cent, to Pounds 14,000 a year, in the
middle of the worst recession since the 1930s?
Given that the dole queues are full of eager young graduates who would love
to train as PW bean counters, it doesn't make sense for PW to break ranks
and start paying above the odds for staff. Surely they are not going to add
the extra hundreds of thousands of pounds of this generosity onto clients'
bills?
If PW were a bank, this sort of behaviour might make some of its depositors
nervous.

FT  17 AUG 92 / Observer: Water on the brain
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Still on the subject of big-spending water companies, water watchdog Ian
Byatt's recent grim warning that water prices could double in real terms by
the year 2005 has already begun to prompt some zany debate about the cost of
water quality.
John Gummer, the agriculture minister who made his daughter eat a very
public hamburger to show that there was no risk of mad cow disease, has been
one of the first to throw his weight behind Byatt's common-sense views. But
Gummer may regret his enthusiasm.
Writing in yesterday's Sunday Express, he asks: 'Do we really want to double
our bills just to make our water 20,000 times purer than the vegetables we
cook in it?' No doubt the minister knows what he is talking about, but it is
hardly a ringing endorsement for Britain's vegetables.
Gummer's comments are not much better than those of the Perrier-drinking
classes who complain that every glass of water coming out of a London tap
has been drunk six times already. Have they not heard of the hydrological
cycle? Ever since the dawn of time, all the water in the world has been
going round in a circle. Every time they raise a glass of water to their
lips, says one expert, they risk imbibing recycled dinosaur pee.

FT  17 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Need for light over Europe
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   IT IS still August
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
yet already, over Europe, a pall of pessimism seems to be descending. To the
problem-racked countries of eastern Europe, the western half of the
continent is starting to look less like a beacon of light, more like a rock
against which hopes founder. Beset by their own difficulties of slow growth
and rising unemployment, the established European democracies are not doing
enough to buttress the countries which after 1989-90 broke free from
communism. The main EC members, Germany, Britain, France and Italy, are for
a mixture of political and economic reasons entering a phase of
introspection and indecisiveness, just at the time when global vision and
leadership are required.
The US during the next few months will have its ear cocked to the hue and
cry of domestic politics. But Europe must not see US preoccupation with the
hustings as an excuse for inaction. European problems require European
solutions. If Europe's leaders fail to produce results, they cannot complain
about growing American jibes at European impotence.
There are three reasons for the setbacks: lack of preparation, lack of
generosity, and lack of competence. Into the first category falls the EC's
dithering over the Yugoslav war. By unlucky coincidence, an intractable
crisis on the Community's borders has coincided with an upsurge in its
ambitions of assuming a post-cold war defence role. The EC's inability to
prevent the apparent carve-up of Bosnia must inevitably lower those
ambitions, or at least postpone their realisation until the EC has mustered
the political consensus to support a common foreign and security policy
worthy of the name.
After-shocks
The EC's economic treatment of the former Soviet Union and eastern bloc
comes into the second category. The Community's external trade barriers
discriminate against the goods which countries like Poland, Hungary and
Czechoslovakia are most adept at producing; and - with the exception of
Germany - it has failed to provide the financial resources needed to dampen
the after-shocks of communism's collapse.
In the third area of shortcomings, EC governments agreed at Maastricht a
far-reaching treaty on political and monetary union without having properly
explained the implications for national electorates. The rethinking almost
everywhere in the Community is welcome, and may, depending on how the French
vote in next month's referendum, end up salvaging the treaty. However, part
of the Maastricht rationale - along with the desire to fit larger Germany
into a new European framework - was to present unity in western Europe as an
antidote to instability in the east. Unfortunately, to the reality of
fission in the east has now been added the threat of western fragmentation.
Balkan refugees
Britain, as a seasoned international operator taking the Community chair at
a taxing time, has the task of steering the Community through the shoals. It
is too early for a considered judgment on the UK's presidency. But, so far,
the British government has shown a greater predilection for advancing its
own interests than for encouraging an atmosphere for effective joint
decision-making. One example would be its cautious reaction to calls from
Germany for greater equality in sharing burdens caused by the Balkan
refugees.
There is a need both for principled leadership and for a spirit of
compromise in which national goals can be put aside in pursuit of overriding
aims. Mr John Major is still a long way from showing that he can fulfil the
expectations vested in him; the 'flow of ideas' across Europe which his
foreign secretary claims is turning in Britain's favour may end up causing
them considerable difficulty.
Western Europe will not properly cure its malaise until there is a
pronounced upturn in the economy. That will not happen quickly. In the
meantime, if governments look over their national parapets, they will
recognise an urgent need for action to shape Europe's common interests. The
Community aspires to the ranking of a global political player. If it fails
now, at a pivotal moment of challenge in its own backyard, it will have
tarnished the idea of concerted action by west European governments.

FT  17 AUG 92 / Arts: Annie Get Your Gun - Theatre/Plymouth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Ethel Merman revived Annie Get Your Gun in 1966, playing her own
original part from 1946, it was dubbed 'Granny Get Your Gun.' But nothing
could be more fresh, energetic and upbeat than this new production of Annie
at The Theatre Royal, Plymouth. This is uplifting, sunny theatre, precisely
sung, energetically danced and meticulously directed.
The show has aged well. Annie was nearly written by Jerome Kern. He died in
1945 leaving the producers with everything but the music. They called on
Irving Berlin in the spring of 1946, just before rehearsals were beginning,
and he wrote them a golden score at breakneck speed. It opened at New York's
Imperial Theatre in May 1946, and ran for 1,147 performances.
Annie followed Showboat in setting a show within a show. It added two great
American institutions, hotels and trains, and based itself on the life and
times of Phoebe Anne Moses (1866-1926), sharpshooter and firebrand. The
writers, Herbert and Dorothy Fields, had found a subject fantastic enough to
meet the musical's demand for escapism.
Roger Redfarn's direction knows that the musical offers the complete world.
He leaves no character on stage redundant, even when not singing or dancing.
The show-stopping ensemble 'I Got the Sun in The Morning' has a butler and
footman singing to each other in the chorus, and makes two dancers pause
before launching into the number, wondering whether to join in. The precise
choreography complements the pacey orchestral accompaniment (Nick Davies) to
make every aspect of the show hum with vitality.
Each scene has its own rich design (Terry Parsons): stetsons and bustles in
town, head-dresses and moccasins in the tee pee.
Kim Criswelll plays Annie magnificently. She fills the stage with
personality, rounding out a two dimensional part with the intimate
'Moonshine Lullaby' and the stomping 'I'm an Indian Too'. Opposite her, John
Diedrich as Frank, her rival and beau, makes the most of Berlin's more
varied fare, particularly 'My Defences are Down'.
Their infectious energy transmits to the rest of the cast: Veronica Hart and
Billy Burke as two young lovers, sing and dance their way into love, twice;
Leon Greene (Buffalo Bill) and Brian Glover (Chief Sitting Bull) add height
and depth.
The all-singing all dancing chorus carries the ensemble numbers with verve
and wit.
This is a delightful piece of Americana, alive with movement and incident
still foreign to the English sensibility. And it proves Berlin's wisdom, 'A
man never trifles with girls who carry rifles'.

FT  17 AUG 92 / Management: More than your job's worth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU could have your time again, would you choose to struggle up the same
ladder? Some 40 per cent of British managers are not so sure, reckoning that
the costs in terms of lost free time are so high that it is not worth it.
Indeed, only 3 per cent of executives feel that on the way to the top, they
have not made any sacrifices at all.
The survey, carried out by Robert Half, the recruitment consultants, shows
that many managers also fear that their work is having a nasty effect on
their personalities: it is making them less likeable, ruining their
relationships at work, and getting in the way of their friendships. Above
all it is damaging their home life - one in five reckon the effect is
serious.
Has the problem always been this bad, the difference being that only now
managers are happy to talk about it? To judge by the survey, the pressures
do seem to be increasing. It seems that the move to cut out several hundred
thousand middle managers in the UK has served to increase the pressure on
those that remain. Many of those who took part in the survey noted that
their workloads had increased, and were continuing to do so. Furthermore,
almost half had felt that their jobs could be next to go.
Apparently, managers realise they are not alone in their suffering. On
average, they estimate that 70 per cent of executives in their organisations
are also victims of stress, a problem made worse by recent waves of
redundancies. The most common signs are bad temper and irritability,
although the symptoms identified ranged from nervous breakdowns and heart
attacks at one extreme to rattling change and clicking teeth at the other.
The survey suggests that rather than tackling managers' problems through
changes in work patterns, many companies are instead concentrating on
treating the symptoms. Consequently, the management of stress is becoming
big business. One executive said that following two nervous breakdowns among
managers at his company, a special agency dealing with stress and its
problems had been taken on, and executives who seemed to be bending under
the stress were being sent off to private clinics for a rest cure.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
How would George Peabody have tackled the problems of London's homeless if
he had been alive today? This is a question that William Benyon, the former
Tory MP, will be increasingly asking himself as he takes up his new job in
January as chairman of the Peabody Trust, London's largest housing charity.
The problems of London's poor have changed considerably since George
Peabody, the one-time supposedly heartless American banker, suddenly
disarmed his many critics by setting up the Peabody Trust in 1862 with a
Pounds 500,000 donation. However, the trust, which houses 25,000 Londoners
on some 70 Peabody Estates, has not moved with the times as quickly as it
might.
A paternalistic organisation, for many years Peabody's main motivation
seemed to be to keep the rents on its properties as low as possible. To this
extent it has been very successful with average rents for two bedroom houses
ranging from Pounds 25 in Haringey to Pounds 48 in Ealing.
However, Benyon, who takes over his unpaid role from Hugh Astor, hopes that
Peabody can come to play a far bigger role in tackling poverty generally,
rather than just providing cheap housing. The problem is balancing the costs
of a Pounds 200m ten-year modernisation of Peabody's existing old properties
with wider plans to help the homeless and disadvantaged. He says that he has
a number of ideas but refuses to be drawn on them because 'negotiations are
very ticklish at the moment.'

NATIONAL WESTMINSTER BANK has appointed a new boss of its operations in
London's West End a month after it sacked 185 staff. Andrew Blessley, 41,
has been appointed regional executive director for the bank's West End
region which puts him in charge of over 90 branches and more than 3200 staff
in the heart of London.
The bank says that there is no connection between Blessley's appointment and
the sackings, which have caused considerable ill-feeling amongst the bank
staff. Blessley's predecessor, Alan Thomas, 57, retired in May.
Nevertheless, whilst all big banks have been operating voluntary redundancy
schemes, NatWest has gone further than most by identifying the staff it
wants to get rid of, as opposed to those who want to leave voluntarily, and
summarily dismissing them. One of Blessley's first tasks will be to rebuild
staff morale which Richard Lynch, senior London organiser for the Banking
Insurance and Finance Union, says is at an all-time low.
Blessley, who joined the bank after reading modern languages at Cambridge,
has spent the bulk of his 20-year NatWest career on the international side.
He spent three years in San Francisco, was seconded to Banco Nacional in
Mexico City for six months, and worked in New York for several years. In
October 1990 he was appointed assistant general manager of the group chief
executive's office.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Out of all the lies and half-truths flying around Houston's Republican
convention, one political myth can be laid to rest. The Republicans, not the
Democrats, are the real poor folk.
There are three Democrat millionaires for every Republican, according to a
recent survey of senators' wealth in Washington's Roll Call newspaper. Even
after adjusting for the Democrats' Senate majority, it is more than twice as
likely that a Democrat senator will be a millionaire, than his Republican
opponent.
It is partly explained by the fact that some Democrats come from formidable
political dynasties, such as the Kennedys and Rockefellers. Indeed, Chuck
Robb - hubby of Lynda Bird Johnson (daughter of LBJ) - tops the
millionaires' club with a Dollars 19.5m fortune. However, self-made men like
defence guru Sam Nunn and Lloyd Bentsen, the former vice-presidential
nominee, have made it into the Democrats' millionaires' club. Amongst the
Republicans, former presidential contender Bob Dole is perhaps best-known.
But amid all this conspicuous wealth - more than one in four senators is a
millionaire - there are still some poor Democrats. Joe Biden, chairman of
the Senate judiciary committee, has a negative net worth of Dollars 170,000,
and sank deeper into the red last year. No wonder he had to plagiarise Neil
Kinnock. Obviously, he couldn't afford his own speech writer.

FT  17 AUG 92 / Break with tradition in a quest for former glory: Trafalgar
House faces a difficult future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The assets of Trafalgar House, the UK conglomerate, read like a roll-call of
famous names from the past: Cunard, John Brown, Davy, Scott Lithgow, the
Ritz. A year ago, Trafalgar's standing on the UK stock market displayed the
same faded grandeur. Though its shares had underperformed the market for
years, it was still valued at almost Pounds 2bn and had just raised more
than Pounds 300m from its shareholders.
Since then the shares have tumbled, the dividend has been halved and the
company is worth just Pounds 390m. Subtract from that the cash raised last
year, and the market is saying that all those famous names, plus Pounds
800m-worth of housebuilding land and commercial property, are worth Pounds
78m.
As one City analyst privately remarks, this kind of valuation suggests the
market is no longer worried about minor matters such as cuts in the
dividend. It is starting to ask whether Trafalgar might go under. The simple
answer to that is no. Whether Trafalgar can ever regain its former glories
is another matter.
Since its foundation in 1956, Trafalgar has been not so much a normal
conglomerate as a loose collection of household names. At one time these
included the Daily and Sunday Express, which were hived off in 1982. They
still include housebuilder Ideal Homes and contractor Trollope &amp; Colls.
How did such an apparently solid business get into such a mess? The simple
answer is one which has become sadly familiar across the UK corporate
landscape: cashflow.
Insofar as Trafalgar ever had a traditional business, it was property and
housebuilding. In the 1980s, these were dangerously deceptive markets to be
in. Year by year, as property prices rose, housebuilders, property dealers,
brewers and retailers found they could generate cash by the simple expedient
of buying and selling their property assets. When the asset inflation
stopped, at the tail end of the decade, they had no means of servicing their
borrowings: unless - like the brewers and some of the retailers - they could
still generate cash from their normal operations.
In Trafalgar's case, it is not clear how cash-generative its other
operations ever were. Whatever the history, the pressures have lately become
acute. In particular, last year's acquisition of the engineering contractor,
Davy, has caused a cash outflow this year of more than Pounds 100m.
Davy, one of the world's most distinguished engineers, had been brought to
its knees by a single disastrous contract on a North Sea oil rig. Trafalgar
paid just Pounds 60m for it, then wrote its net worth down to minus Pounds
131m.
But that was a mere book-keeping exercise. Trafalgar then discovered the
reality: that Davy was seriously behind in paying its bills. It had to
inject more than Pounds 100m of working capital.
'I have to say,' says Sir Eric Parker, Trafalgar's deputy chairman and chief
executive, 'that in my experience since the mid-1960s of taking over UK
quoted companies, you generally find things slightly worse than you
anticipated. In Davy's case, the unexpected bit was the cashflow.'
Otherwise, he claims, Trafalgar's underlying cashflow is not too bad. 'Our
construction and engineering side is very cash positive. There's very little
capital expenditure - mostly computer-related stuff for the engineering
side. There are whole sections of that business which work on negative
working capital. That will throw up very positive cashflow in 1993-94. The
hiatus in 1992 is entirely to do with Davy.
'In housing, we have a land bank which is too big for our present business,
so we don't need to buy any land. On each sale we recover some of the
underlying book value of the land, even if the business is not making any
profit. And in commercial property, we have almost no developments going on
at present. That means the only cash outflow is interest charges on the
debt.
'In hotels, the cashflow is negligible. But the cruise ship business is
positive - the only cash outflow is the improvements you have to make to the
ships. Across the group,the pressure on cashflow has emanated from having
two legs of the business - leisure and property - not generating the cash
they should have done: that, plus Davy.'
Trafalgar is certainly in a tight spot, but its finances look safe enough.
Its agreements with its bankers are:
Net worth should be at least Pounds 500m. Last year's figure was Pounds
716m. This year it will be lower, but not much (though it is worth noting
that the figure has been falling since 1989).
Net borrowings should be no more than 1.75 times net worth. The borrowing
figure at this year-end, including some Pounds 50m of off-balance sheet debt
covered by the agreement, will be only around Pounds 500m.
The average interest charge should be covered at least twice by profits
before provisions. Last year it was covered more than three times.
Besides that, Trafalgar has lines of credit with its bankers - committed
facilities, in the jargon - totalling Pounds 800m and good for another five
years.
But its future remains problematic. The kind of conglomerate Trafalgar
represents is these days deeply unfashionable. The new fashion is to strip
companies back to their original business and concentrate on what they know
best. The snag in Trafalgar's case is that UK commercial property and
housebuilding are so moribund that no business would concentrate on them if
it could possibly help it.
Trafalgar's strategy is rather the opposite: to concentrate on the
businesses it bought most recently and knows least about. These are the
engineering contractors John Brown and Davy, acquired in 1986 and 1991
respectively. Cunard and the Ritz will probably be sold off as soon as their
markets recover, or possibly demerged. By the late 1990s, property and
housebuilding may have gone too. Looking 10 years ahead, says Sir Eric, the
only essential part of the company's strategy is to be like the giant US
contractor, Bechtel.
The trouble about that industry is the risk involved in huge contracts. Both
John Brown and Davy ultimately owed their loss of independence to such
contracts going wrong. Trafalgar, says Sir Eric, is the best in the business
when it comes to risk control. But, as he concedes, the big risky turnkey
contracts are where good profit margins are to be found.
Nevertheless, he insists, 'our engineering and construction business is in
the books for virtually nothing. This year it will produce operating profits
of Pounds 100m or so. If you look at the fancy earnings multiples in process
engineering elsewhere in the world, that could theoretically be worth
another Pounds 1bn on our shareholders' funds.'
In theory, Trafalgar's shareholders should be profoundly glad to hear it.
The reality is slightly different. Their once-proud company still has a
value. But however far they look into the future, it becomes no easier to
establish what that value really is.

FT  17 AUG 92 / Letter: Buying into eastern Germany, the dream and the
reality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANTHONY ROSEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Christopher Parkes's admirable article ('German privatisation', August
11) highlighted the gulf between dream and reality as far as the proposed
sales of industrial and commercial propositions in eastern Germany are
concerned.
The situation is, if possible, even worse as far as agricultural land is
concerned. The Treuhand boasts of having some 450 large farms for sale. When
one follows this attractive statement up, one finds that they have actually
sold only one farm and that they are in a position to sell, perhaps, only
one more.
The German government announces that purchasers who wish to start new dairy
units in eastern Germany will have made available 'unlimited milk quota'. In
reality this means enough for 60 cows - a totally uneconomic number - or if
in partnership the new owner may receive milk quota for 120 cows.
The Treuhand puts the 'sales' of its 450 farms in the hands of a firm of
accountants which has probably never sold a square metre of land let alone
450 farms, each in excess of a thousand acres.
The Treuhand in London conveys one message, in Berlin another and yet a
third view is given by the Treuhand in the Lander.
The basic problem as far as eastern Germany's agricultural land is concerned
lies in the fact that the overall land-use policy has become a political
football between those who believe that the five eastern Lander have a
significant structural advantage in their large-size farms and the Bavarian
attitude of so many German ministers who believe that the 20-acre peasant
smallholding should be the norm for the whole of Germany.
In the meantime potential land purchasers should ignore the siren calls of
the Treuhand and their British selling agents.

FT  17 AUG 92 / The high price of ignorance: American worries over
competitiveness have put education and training on the political agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Republican party leaders gather today in Houston to try to rescue Mr
George Bush's ailing presidential campaign, there is no more potent symbol
of his ills than the state of US education and training. Mr Bush singled out
improving education as his most important domestic task when he was elected.
But four years on, the education system that was once treasured for offering
the best chance of a college education in the world now strikes many
Americans as wasteful and inefficient.
The Japanese politicians who questioned this year whether US workers were
too ignorant to compete in the world economy thus touched a raw nerve. Mr
Bush, who promises to come forward with new ideas for his 'revolutionary'
education programme, has backed reforms such as national testing of school
pupils, but has not achieved enough to reassure voters. Mr Bill Clinton, his
Democratic rival, has called for more radical measures. Among other things,
Mr Clinton wants all high school pupils who do not enter college to have the
chance of an apprenticeship.
America's tradition of open access to university and college education -
started under the postwar GI Bill - remains a striking achievement. A
greater proportion of workers in the US hold college degrees than in any
other OECD economy - 19.2 per cent, compared to 11.5 per cent in Japan and
4.5 per cent in Germany. The growing worry is over the fate of the 67 per
cent of the US population which does not enter any form of post-secondary
education.
The quality of education and on-the-job training received by what has been
dubbed the 'forgotten half' of the US workforce has a number of clear flaws:
School academic standards are often lax. Only a small proportion of pupils
nearing high school graduation can accomplish a mix of writing tasks, and
half cannot handle moderately challenging mathematical problems, according
to the last National Assessment of Educational Progress. The first National
Education Goals report for 1991 says that only one in five pupils displays
basic competency in mathematics, and reports Japanese pupils scoring
significantly higher.
High school vocational education is often of poor quality, and has come to
be regarded as a 'dumping ground' for less able pupils. One study of 6,700
pupils taking vocational courses found that many were excluded from rigorous
maths and science courses, and often had never read a poem or a play. Nor
are pupils well-prepared for jobs by vocational classes: the Department of
Education estimates that only a third of such education is used at work
after leaving school.
There are few apprenticeships for young people not entering college, and
those that exist are concentrated in a few traditional industries such as
construction. In 1989, there were 1.7m young people placed in
apprenticeships with 500,000 employers in West Germany; the US had only
263,000 registered apprentices from a population four times as large. Many
employers resist apprenticeships because they dislike the principle of joint
union administration.
American companies carry out less training of adult workers than foreign
competitors, even compared with plants based in the US. Newly-hired workers
in US car plants receive under 50 hours of training each, compared with more
than 250 hours for workers in Japanese car plants in the US. Of the
estimated Dollars 30bn that American companies spend on training adults,
two-thirds goes to college-educated managers. Most is spent on orientation
courses for recruits.
There are two reasons why the US is worried about education and training
standards. The first is a gradual increase in the demands placed on
employees in jobs that do not require post-secondary education. Many
employers who have installed new technology, or initiated quality
improvement efforts that require greater involvement from entry-level
workers, have made awkward discoveries about the limited competence of
workers with high school diplomas.
The second reason for concern affects US society as a whole. Despite the
public attention given to trying to reduce the rate at which teenagers drop
out of high school before graduation, a high school diploma is of shrinking
value in the labour market. While the real wages of college-educated
employees increased over the past 20 years, those of male workers with only
high school diplomas fell by 25 per cent between 1973 and 1987.
Underlying this fall is the loss of well-paid jobs for men in industries
such as steel and car making: the unionised blue-collar jobs which used to
form the backbone of US employment. It is hard for a school-leaver to find
work in a steel mill these days. He or she is far more likely to be offered
an insecure and poorly-paid service job. One result is that 23 per cent of
white high school-educated males now earn too little to support a family of
four by themselves.
The need for educational and economic changes to address such problems is
not disputed. The US government has called for more companies to adopt a
'high-performance' model of work organisation, giving more responsibility to
entry-level employees. It has also backed educational reforms aimed at
improving preparation for work. Mr Clinton differs only in supporting more
radical efforts to make employers train, and to overhaul education for those
not entering college.
But the country's educational traditions mean that reform involves two
difficult tasks: the first is to raise the number of high-skilled jobs that
can provide well-paid employment. Some companies have reorganised work or
invested in new technology only to find that their employees are too badly
educated to cope. But most US employers have stuck with old methods: one
study last year estimated that only 5 per cent were altering working methods
in ways which required higher skills of entry-level workers.
Mr Ray Uhalde, an assistant secretary at the Department of Labour, says the
history of assembly-line work in the US means managers are more inclined to
automate work than seek higher productivity by upgrading skills. 'They know
how to make production more efficient by chopping up work, and you tend to
go with what is natural and comfortable when you are thinking of ways to
raise productivity,' he says.
The US faces problems in persuading companies to adopt different strategies
of work organisation. The economy has one of the highest rates of adult job
mobility in the OECD: only 35 per cent of male workers in their late 30s
have been with their current employer more than 10 years in the US, compared
with 58 per cent in Germany. The fact that workers are likely to leave
quickly reduces the incentive for employers to spend money on training.
The second task facing the US is improving school education, and finding
better ways to prepare young people for skilled employment. American
employers are increasingly critical of schooling standards: 'My sense is
that not many schools are producing people with the mix of skills we need.
They might be producing people with barely manageable, get-by sort of
skills, but that is it,' says Mr Harvey Greenberg, Polaroid's director of
education and training.
Until now, many employers have displayed little interest in how well pupils
are educated at school. Nor have they been willing to back apprenticeships,
or give incentives for young people to undertake further vocational
education. Compared to the close links forged between Japanese employers and
schools, and the involvement of German employers in the dual system, most US
companies have been indifferent to the education of their non-managerial
workers.
Some observers argue that this indifference has played a crucial role in the
poor standards of US high schools. Mr John Bishop, an economist at Cornell
University, says there is little incentive for school pupils to work hard
because employers neither bother to ask what they did at school, nor reward
academic competency. One study found that employers had asked to see records
of high school achievement in only 14 per cent of cases where a
school-leaver was hired.
There is now growing interest among both employers and educators in forming
closer links. The Educational Testing Service is working on an initiative to
give employers access to a computerised record of high school achievement.
Los Angeles, one of the largest US school districts, is trying to stimulate
employer interest in its school standards by guaranteeing any company
dissatisfied with a school-leaver that he or she will be offered free
re-education.
But such efforts only scratch the surface of the enormous task of
educational reform. Despite the current wave of interest in apprenticeships
as an alternative to flawed academic schooling, there is little chance of
apprentice places growing rapidly enough to match the German dual system.
'Schools operate on a demographic cycle and employers on a business one, and
they are hard to match,' says Mr Richard Kazis of consulting group Jobs for
the Future.
The best hope lies in better forms of vocational education that include a
broad academic grounding. America has a substantial asset in its network of
community colleges, which provide academic and vocational courses leading to
two-year degrees. Most educators and employers agree that the US needs to
combine a more rigorous school system with better incentives for students to
enter - and graduate from - community colleges.
So America faces a difficult struggle in raising the demand for, and the
supply of, better-educated workers. The alternative is to accept the growing
dispersion of wealth between the college-educated and others. For a country
formed in the promise of equal opportunity for all, such acceptance is
virtually unthinkable. However, the current political clamour over education
and training indicates the status quo will not be quietly tolerated.
Yet the means of achieving change appear elusive. The division of
responsibility for education among thousands of local school districts is
mirrored by the determination of each American employer to define its own
training policy. It will take a more inspiring call to action than Mr Bush
has yet mustered to unify this diverse body. And without such unity, America
cannot solve the education and training flaws that now hamper its economic
progress.
This is the first in a series of articles about US education and training.

FT  17 AUG 92 / Leading Article: A two-horse race in the US
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IF PRESIDENT George Bush hopes to be re-elected on November 3 he had better
make a good speech on Thursday. He will be addressing fellow-Republicans at
their convention in Houston, but he will also be watched by most of the
American electorate and much of the world outside the United States. He
needs to give a convincing answer to a single question - is there a reason
why he should be returned to the White House for a second term?
Mr Bush was at his best during the Gulf war, but that is long over and
President Saddam Hussein is still in charge of Iraq. He has sent a great
many bills to Congress - on health, education, energy and other important
matters - but he has not been able to persuade the American people of the
value of his plans.
This may now change. Last week the president confirmed that his old friend,
Mr James Baker, would resign as secretary of state and come to the White
House as chief of staff. Mr Baker's particular strengths lie in the
assembling of deals, and the presentation of the resulting packages as
coherent and practical expressions of a logical strategy. Over the past four
years he has deployed these skills to great advantage in the Middle East and
elsewhere. His task now is to apply the same energy to domestic policy. The
first intimations of how he proposes to proceed should appear in Mr Bush's
acceptance speech in Houston.
Full attention
Mr Baker's task may be too much for even him to complete with success. As he
leaves for the White House he is taking his entire inner circle of state
department advisers and associates with him. It is likely that he will try
to run foreign policy with one hand while seeking the re-election of Mr Bush
with the other. Unfortunately, both jobs need the full attention of the
individual in charge. In the way of these things the probable outcome is
that the election campaign will quickly come to demand all of Mr Baker's
time, and then some. Only events of domestic electoral significance - such
as, say, a fresh provocation by Mr Saddam - will trigger an adequate
American response. The rest of the world may have to wait until November 4,
if Mr Bush gets back, or January, if, as the polls suggest, Mr Bill Clinton
becomes president.
This is in part the consequence of a natural US preoccupation with its own
internal problems, and in part a reflection of the uncertainty that is felt
by foreign policy professionals since the collapse of the Soviet empire.
Four years ago such matters were quite simply stated. The Republicans stood
as the party of strong defence and staunch anti-communism, the Democrats
were damned as unreliable. Now nobody is sure. As Dean Acheson might have
said, America has lost an enemy, and has yet to find a role.
Positive attributes
Yet it is too soon to write Mr Bush off. Mr Clinton leads the president by
around 20 points in most recent opinion polls, but the general expectation
is that this advantage will slip away quite quickly, especially if this
week's convention is a success. Mr Baker can be expected to bring some
professionalism and discipline to the Bush campaign team. He should be able
to insist on a strategy of projecting two or three positive attributes of
the Republican candidate ('Leadership,' and 'trustworthiness' among them)
while hammering home the message that Mr Clinton's expenditure plans cannot
be put into effect without substantially higher taxation.
His difficulty is the recession. It did not exist when Mr Baker helped Mr
Bush win in 1988. In that year the president came from behind and trounced
Mr Michael Dukakis. A midsummer Democratic lead of 17 points quickly melted
away.
The US mood was, however, different then. Some of the afterglow of President
Reagan's years still existed, to the advantage of Mr Bush. There was not
quite so much disenchantment with politicians in general and none with Mr
Bush in particular. The candidates are also different. Mr Dukakis was not a
first-rate campaigner; so far the strategies adopted by Mr Clinton have been
highly successful. The contrast in the contenders for the vice-presidency
has been widely noted. In short, Mr Baker may be a great help to Mr Bush,
but even if he is, this looks like being a two-horse race, right down to the
wire.

<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is considering co-ordinating aspects of the sale of the two
parcels businesses that it is to privatise.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and Mr John MacGregor,
transport secretary, are to discuss the timing of the disposals, which will
transfer both Parcelforce, the Post Office's delivery service, and British
Rail's parcels division to the private sector.
The level of co-ordination, however, is thought unlikely to extend to
appointing the same teams of advisers to handle both sales.
Though nothing has been ruled out, it is expected that traditional
inter-departmental rivalries may limit the extent of co-operation. British
Rail is primarily Mr MacGregor's responsibility, while the Post Office is Mr
Heseltine's.

FT  17 AUG 92 / Tecs sounded out over possible cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHAIRMEN of the 82 Training and Enterprise Councils are being canvassed
individually by the government about their spending priorities should there
be large-scale cuts in their budgets next year.
The Department of Employment is seeking full information on Tecs' response
to possible cuts before Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary,
meets Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, at the end
of the month to discuss next year's spending.
The canvassing of a broad swathe of opinion is indicative of the new
relationship that Mrs Shephard has tried to forge with Tecs. She may have no
more to offer them in practical terms than Mr Michael Howard, her
predecessor, but she has appeared keen to listen to their concerns and, in
doing so, appears to have improved the relationship with them.
This may be vital in preventing large-scale resignations among members of
Tec boards, most of whom are business executives. Many joined Tecs with
ambitions to transform the UK's skills base and may be unwilling to remain
on boards if training programmes were severely pared.
One Tec chief executive said the employment department was indirectly
inviting comment on whether directors would leave should there be cuts.
Tecs have said that they want more flexibility in how they spend their
budgets. Mrs Shephard has told Tecs she would try to get them three-year
instead of annual funding, on the same lines as the new hospital trusts.
Mr Rodney Skidmore, chief executive of the Central England Tec, said:
'Government has to be very clear about what it wants from Tecs and then
provide sufficient resources to provide that. If it makes cuts, government
then has to cut its cloth appropriately. We must not expand the volume of
training at the expense of quality.'

BRITAIN'S engineering sector is well placed to take advantage of an upturn
in the economy, according to a report published today by Albert E Sharp, the
Birmingham stockbroker.
It says engineering companies are more competitive than at any time in the
past 20 years and are capable of performing strongly in world markets. The
broker says this is acknowledged by overseas competitors, but remains
largely unrecognised in the UK.
Mr Tim Bennett and Mr John Dean, the stockbroker's engineering analysts, say
that many engineering businesses have become more internationally oriented.
They say: 'Instead of just fighting their own corner in the UK and looking
nervously over their shoulder at the inroads foreign competition might make,
they are out pitching for new business in international markets, realising
they now have a competitive edge.'

FT  17 AUG 92 / Pakistan PM cools towards Hekmatyar: Islamabad impatient
with Afghan rebel it backed
</HEADLINE>

   ISLAMABAD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Nawaz Sharif, Pakistan's prime minister, yesterday strongly criticised Mr
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the Mujahideen leader Pakistan supported during the
13-year Afghan civil war.
Pakistan's growing impatience with Mr Hekmatyar is the result of heavy
fighting in the past week around Kabul, in which hundreds of civilians are
reported killed. The Red Cross hospital alone said it admitted 604 people in
five days, of whom 85 had died.
Mr Hekmatyar's forces have encircled the city and closed the airport and Mr
Hekmatyar yesterday vowed to continue his attacks on the Afghan capital
until his demands are met.
Mr Sharif said in an interview with the Financial Times: 'I think Mr
Hekmatyar should abide by the commitment that he has given. He should not
fight the government. Why should he fight? Afghanistan stands liberated. Who
is he fighting against?'
The recent violence, Mr Sharif said, was a violation of the April Peshawar
accord, which followed the downfall of the Soviet-backed President
Najibullah. Under the agreement, designed to end the civil war, Mr Hekmatyar
agreed with other rebel leaders, including Mr Ahmad Shah Masoud, on sharing
power in an interim government and holding elections within six months.
It emerged yesterday that Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani had dismissed
Mr Ustad Farid, the prime minister who was Mr Hekmatyar's most senior
representative in the interim government.
Pakistani government officials said that Islamabad had taken steps to cut
off supplies of food and other essential goods going over the border into
Afghanistan, since these supplies were mainly going to Mr Hekmatyar.
One Pakistani official said: 'Hekmatyar is the man responsible. He needs to
be brought back to his senses.'
However, Islamabad is also discussing with Mr Rabbani how supplies can be
sent into Afghanistan without aiding Mr Hekmatyar, and has offered to assist
in bringing the rival factions together for discussions.
Officials fear that a worsening of the conflict could lead to a break-up of
Afghanistan. Pakistan wants to prevent this, partly because stability there
is crucial for Islamabad's policy of developing political and trade links
with the new central Asian republics.
Pakistan's frustration with Mr Hekmatyar is significant because during the
Afghan war it provided him with large amounts of arms and other support. It
also helped Mr Masoud, but he largely relied on weapons captured from Soviet
and Afghan troops. Most guerrilla groups maintained offices in Pakistan as
their main links to the outside world.
Despite the government's attempt to dissociate itself from Mr Hekmatyar,
however, there remain elements within Pakistan sympathetic to the guerrilla
leader who feel the other parties to the Peshawar accord have not honoured
their commitments to him.
They remain suspicious of the role being played by General Rashid Dostam,
the militia leader who was previously allied with Mr Najibullah. His switch
to Mr Masoud contributed significantly to Najibullah's fall, but his militia
has since aroused resentment among Mujahideen.
Mr Hekmatyar is thought to be attempting to press his case by force because
time is running out. The winter snows, due in October, would temporarily
weaken his position because his forces are mainly camped in the hills.
Most UN staff withdrew from the Afghan capital as more rockets pounded
residential areas over the weekend, Reuter adds.
Only seven staff remained in the city after three carloads headed towards
the northern town of Mazar-i-Sharif, UN officials said.
Tens of thousands of Afghans were fleeing north. Several thousand who tried
to head east have taken shelter instead in the Pul-i-Charkhi prison on the
city outskirts.
Diplomats were reported to have met Mr Rabbani to discuss evacuating
foreigners from Kabul but said they were waiting for guarantees of safety
before evacuating. About 200 embassy personnel want to leave the city after
two Russian embassy staff were killed last week when five rockets hit the
embassy in the south of the city. Embassy spokesman Zmair Kaboulov said the
compound had been targeted deliberately.
Mr Rabbani warned diplomats they could become a target for rockets and some
embassies said they were considering closing.

<TEXT>
A WEEKEND meeting between Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister,
and Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Keidanren business federation,
produced no new proposals to stem economic slowdown.
Mr Miyazawa reiterated that an autumn package aimed at stimulating the
economy would lay stress on reviving demand for property and equities. He
promised to study ways to reduce the tax burden on such investments.
At their talks on Saturday Mr Hiraiwa urged a government commitment to some
Y6,000bn to Y7,000bn (Pounds 24.8bn-Pounds 29bn) in additional public works
in the current fiscal year which ends next March - sums around the average
of expectations.
The outlay would encompass government purchases of land needed for state
projects. Mr Hiraiwa said such lots should be bought in part from financial
institutions, which would be able to reduce bad loans by selling land they
had been holding as collateral.
Mr Hiraiwa called for the stock market to be made more attractive to small
investors through expansion in employee stock ownership and a cut in the
minimum trading unit on the Tokyo stock exchange.

<TEXT>
THE Indian prime minister, Mr PV Narasimha Rao, has urged all political
parties to agree to a 'three-year moratorium on divisive issues' in the
interests of the 'co-ordinated development' of the country.
In an Independence Day address, Mr Rao was in effect asking for a freeze on
any debate on the key issues confronting his government. Referring to the
Ayodhya temple dispute which threatened his government's authority in July,
Mr Rao suggested that a grand Hindu temple be constructed without destroying
the 16th-century mosque, built on a site claimed by Hindu militants to be
the birthplace of Lord Ram.
On Kashmir, Mr Rao said the state was an indivisible part of India, and 'no
force on earth' could separate the two.
The prime minister reiterated his government's commitment to punish the
guilty in the Bombay financial scandal, and to see through economic reforms.
Opposition parties have not responded favourably to his unusual suggestion
that all 'dispute and dissention' be shelved for three years.
Mr Lal Krishen Advani, the leader of the right-wing Hindu Bharatiya Janata
party (BJP), yesterday opposed the move to stop public debate on
controversial issues, and demanded that the prime minister clarify what he
meant by a 'moratorium'.
'Let them have a moratorium on violence, terrorism, or political
corruption,' said the BJP leader, who is head of the opposition in
parliament. He said the prime minister's suggestion would mean a breakdown
of democracy.
Mr Somnath Chatterjee, leader of the Communist party (Marxist), described
the prime minister's call as 'an excuse' to prevent people from raising
uncomfortable issues.

FT  17 AUG 92 / Mutual suspicion across the causeway: A look at the climate
of mistrust between Malaysia and neighbouring Singapore
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINGAPORE'S parliament this month approved the construction of a second
bridge across the narrow stretch of water separating Singapore from the
state of Johor in Malaysia.
The SDollars 169m (Pounds 59m) project, already approved by Malaysia, is due
for completion in early 1995 and marks another step towards closer economic
links between the two countries. But news of the bridge comes at a time of
tense and difficult relations between them.
The immediate and most visible argument between Singapore and Malaysia
concerns a bleak island about 50km north-east of Singapore. Administered by
Singapore for more than 100 years, the island sits on an important shipping
lane and has a lighthouse and radar station. The Singaporeans call the
guano-covered rock by its Portuguese name, Pedra Branca. To Malaysia, it is
Batu Puteh.
In the early 1970s Malaysia lodged a claim to the island.
This year a group of Malaysians from Johor made an abortive attempt to plant
a flag on it. A shouting match developed between the two countries after a
series of tit-for-tat arrests of fishermen. The Malaysians accused Singapore
of being high-handed and arrogant: there was talk in Singapore of
Singaporeans being maltreated in Johor. An MP of the governing People's
Action party in Singapore advised his compatriots against visiting Malaysia.
While senior government officials on both sides have acted to calm things
down, other issues have raised hackles. In the latest incident, Malaysians
were angered by a guide book published in Singapore and depicting the
Malaysian town of Johor Bahru, just across the causeway from Singapore, as a
sexual pleasure haunt, full of 'love hotels'. The book was mistaken, they
said. Furthermore, Singapore was allowing writers licence abroad it would
never permit at home. The publishers withdrew the book.
Underlying these quarrels, some petty, some more substantial, are broader
problems of history and race. In the early 1960s, Singapore was part of the
post-colonial Malaysian Federation. Malaysia is more than 50 per cent Malay
but has a large Chinese minority. Singapore is 76 per cent Chinese but 15
per cent of its 2.7m people are Malay.
Even before the days of the federation, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, the former
Singaporean prime minister, had campaigned for 'A Malaysian Malaysia, not a
Malay Malaysia'. In turn the Malays, already fearful of Chinese economic
domination, saw the rise of a Chinese city state - 'A Chinese nut in a Malay
nutcracker'. Malaysia's rulers warned of bloodshed. Singapore left the
federation after less than two years.
Since then the two countries have gone their own ways. Malaysia is governed
by Malays: the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) has had
uninterrupted control of government for nearly 20 years. Singapore, though
its politics are not divided on such sharply racial lines as in Malaysia, is
run predominantly by the Chinese.
Each country is acutely sensitive to issues of race. Though only a few
hundred yards of water separates them, neither country allows the sale of
each other's newspapers.
There are other restrictions. The many thousands of Singaporeans who travel
to Malaysia each week have to pay their government an exit tax. Singapore
also insists motorists have at least half a tank of petrol, lest they take
advantage of cheaper prices in Malaysia.
Singapore recently caused a furore in Malaysia when it introduced a daily
SDollars 20 charge for Malaysian vehicles travelling into the island
republic.
Such measures seem to fly in the face of the increasing economic
interdependence between Singapore and the south of Malaysia. Singapore
imports water and natural gas from Johor. Many Singaporean companies have
their main manufacturing base across the causeway. Over the past 10 years
Singaporean companies have invested nearly MDollars 1.5bn (Pounds 312m) in
540 projects in the state.
To some in Malaysia this is evidence of creeping Singaporean - that is,
Chinese - economic control. 'We must guard against Johor becoming
Singapore's Kowloon,' says one senior Malaysian official.
Singapore maintains what is generally perceived to be one of the best
equipped and trained military machines in the Asian region. It spends 6 per
cent of its GDP each year on defence, one of the highest ratios in the
world. Though a fraction the size of its neighbours, Singapore has a bigger
air force than Malaysia and Indonesia combined. Military analysts are also
impressed with the Singapore army's more than 300 light tanks. Government
advertising often reminds people of the fate of Kuwait and other small
states.
By contrast, Malaysia's armed forces have been starved of funds and badly
equipped. In what seems in part a reaction to Singapore's defence build-up,
Malaysia has recently embarked on a multi-million dollar defence procurement
programme, much of the equipment being supplied by Britain.
Mr Musa Hitam, once a contender for power in Malaysia and a former special
envoy to the UN, is concerned about what he sees as a lack of sensitivity on
the part of an up-and-coming generation of leaders on both sides of the
causeway. 'I worry when I see the new leaders in Singapore and Malaysia
responding to events in both countries not in the manner handled by the old
guard. If this level of tolerance is lowered, we are going to have
problems.'

FT  17 AUG 92 / Moscow's mayor thrives in icy waters: Yuri Luzhkov believes
he is making headway despite his bitter inheritance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Yuri Luzhkov inherited three gifts when he took over as mayor of Moscow
in June: privatisation which was fast but ineffective, an obstreperous city
legislature, and a mountain of corruption allegations.
One year after the abortive coup which he played a prominent role in
opposing as deputy mayor, this thick-skinned 55-year-old believes he is
making headway on market reforms in spite of the setbacks over the past
year.
Since the euphoria over the coup's defeat, many Russians, ground down by the
harsh economic reforms which followed, have also come to feel sympathy for
the Communist leaders who claim they were only trying to save the Soviet
Union.
But Mr Luzhkov opposes calls to let them off.
The mayor, who was appointed for his bravery during the coup to the interim
committee which ran the Soviet economy until the country's collapse in
December, says: 'I am categorically against pardoning them. We have a
responsibility to history. If we want to live in a democratic system, they
must be severely punished.'
He also rejected increasingly fashionable calls by many politicians and
industrial plant managers for the resignation of Mr Yegor Gaidar, the young
acting prime minister who launched the painful reforms.
'Gaidar is not the the same Gaidar as the man who came to office a year ago.
He is a man who has undergone the harshest criticisms . . . and is no longer
just building macro-economic models,' he said.
As for his own reform plans for Moscow, Mr Luzhkov disclosed that in a few
weeks, he would make it legal for anybody, including foreigners, to buy land
outright. This has so far not been possible under national legislation
because of fears in the Russian parliament that foreigners will buy up the
country. He also pointed to the little-publicised fact that foreigners could
now buy flats in Moscow, a right so far reserved for Russians.
On Saturday, the capital will conduct its first auction of buildings which
the bankrupt state building sector has been unable to finish.
He said hard currency proceeds of real estate deals would finance the
building of municipal housing for Muscovites who had been queueing for years
for their own flat under the old state system. Most of what he does involves
riding rough-shod over an antiquated city legislature inherited from the
Bolsheviks. Mr Luzhkov has also dropped the give-away privatisation methods
launched by his predecessor, Mr Gavriil Popov. It had been fast and had kept
work collectives happy, but had made little or no improvement to the quality
of goods and services. In some cases, the method justified by Mr Popov to
'smash state property at all costs' had made things worse.
'A simple man assesses reforms through his pay packet and the situation in
the shops. If these become worse, he will decide that market reform is a
load of nonsense and that things were better under the Communists. This is
alarming.'
A number of shops, for instance, had stopped selling basic commodities like
bread, and turned themselves into wholesalers of consumer goods for the
little retail kiosks which have sprung up all around Moscow as a result of a
presidential decree allowing free trade.
He would now try the auction system of privatisation introduced by the
government elsewhere in Russia. He would also clamp down on the street
sellers despite the continuation of the presidential decree.
He also dismissed allegations of corruption which have dogged him and his
colleagues, saying hurtful lies were an additional reason for the
resignation of Mr Popov, who said he was stepping down to defend democratic
politics at national level.
In a new departure for Russian politicians, who usually do not sue, Mr
Luzhkov, who enjoys swimming in sub-zero temperatures, says he has already
won the first of six libel suits he has lined up against Russian newspapers.

FT  17 AUG 92 / The European Market: Bulldozers try to clear a path through
mountains of rules - A look at the uphill struggle to shift the obstacles to
cross-border sales of construction equipment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASK a construction equipment man to pick out a German wheeled loader from a
yard full of similar equipment and he will find one in less time than it
takes to say 'homologation'.
The German wheeled loader will be the one with the wheel chocks screwed on,
or close to, the steps up to the cab. Germany is the only country which
requires chocks on its loaders for use in case of brake failure. 'They're
waiting for something that never happens,' says one senior UK executive.
Little more than four months before the introduction of the European Single
Market, progress towards a true single market in construction equipment
matches that of an overloaded dumptruck struggling up a muddy hill. The
engine is running, but the final destination is a long way off.
It is not just details such as wheel chocks and lighting specification
differences which irritate the big construction equipment producers, and add
to production costs. 'We've got machines lying around in the UK which could
easily be sold in Germany if they were adapted to German standards,' says Dr
Frithjof Timm, president of Komatsu Europe.
Producers, in fact, do regularly bring unsold equipment back to their
factories to refit them for a different European market, but this is both
inefficient and demoralising, says Mr Tuve Johannesson, president and chief
executive of Brussels-based VME Group.
Unfortunately, though, some national regulations defy minor re-engineering.
On Italian roads, for example, there is a 2.5m width restriction for
construction equipment: consequently, it can be a lot easier for an Italian
producer to sell its equipment in the UK than vice versa, says Mr David
Barrell, director-general of the UK's Federation of Manufacturers of
Construction Equipment &amp; Cranes.
Behind the complexity lies the thorny issue of homologation - modifying a
piece of construction equipment to conform to national legal and market
requirements without changing the overall design.
These requirements are often more exacting than the two main recognised sets
of standards - the SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) and ISO
(International Organisation of Standardisation) standards.
Multinational producers claim, with some justification, that the hidden
purpose of homologation has been to protect national industries and markets
from foreign encroachment. It has thus contributed to the chronic
overcapacity, fragmentation and duplication of effort among European
suppliers.
Cutting through the morass of conflicting national regul-ations and
specifications is, of course, a key aim of the the Single Market programme,
and a start has been made. The EC's basic Machinery Directive was adopted in
1989, and subsequently amended to include mobile machinery.
Even at this late stage, discussions are still continuing on a second
amendment related to lifting equipment. Agreement could be reached by the
end of the year for adoption in May or June next year, completing the
'Machines Package'.
For the main equipment suppliers, the directives are fine - as far as they
go. Caterpillar, the world's largest producer, is pleased by the progress
made, and notes particularly that the standards backing up the directives
are clearly based on the ISO norms.
But there are problems. Apart from some unease in the industry over the pace
at which national governments will introduce the necessary enabling
legislation, there is concern that a mandatory directive, which is
deliberately framed in general terms, is backed up only by voluntary
standards. These are being drawn up under the aegis of CEN, the European
standardisation organisation.
This raises a serious question about the enforcement of the directive. The
precedents are not promising: one supplier says an EC directive on noise
omission from certain types of construction equipment, introduced in January
1989, virtually outlawed a particularly irritating French homologation
requirement, but there is no evidence of the directive being policed.
The biggest problem with the Machinery Directive, however, is its scope. It
was designed to concentrate on safety at work, with the result that what the
industry calls 'job-side' specifications are covered, while 'road-side'
rules are not.
Although there is some frustration, especially in the UK, that the two
elements were not considered simultaneously, the inclusion of road
regulations would undoubtedly have caused further delays, because of the
need to consult many different levels of highway authorities.
The result, therefore, is that - despite pushing by the UK - only
preliminary work has been carried out at EC level on harmonising road
regulations on widths, weights and specification details. 'The rest of the
loaf has yet to be worked on,' says Caterpillar.
With most observers predicting slow progress towards harmonisation of road
standards, the implications for the industry are significant. Germany is
generally regarded as the toughest market for homologation, with every
detail of a machine tested by the TUV road safety body for compliance, from
the reflector plates to engine output.
But reunification has transformed Germany into a market for an expected 46
per cent of European construction equipment sales this year, up from a
stagnant 18 per cent in 1989, according to a Corporate Intelligence Group
forecast last week.
Importers to Germany have always suspected their machines are scrutinised
for road regulation compliance rather more closely than those of
home-produced rivals. Having a manufacturing presence in Germany has never
been more important.

FT  17 AUG 92 / Ukraine's bank chief seeks return to rouble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UKRAINE needs a 'tactical retreat' from the coupon, the republic's faltering
quasi-currency, and re-introduction of the Russian rouble, according to Mr
Vadim Hetman, chairman of the Ukraine National Bank.
The National Bank of Ukraine is emerging as the strongest proponent of
tougher economic policies for the republic, but fears its belt-tightening
measures will be opposed by Mr Vitold Fokin, the prime minister.
The showdown could come in September, when Mr Hetman plans to present a
tough stabilisation programme to parliament. The struggle will pit the
technocrats at the National Bank, who are itching to become members of good
standing in the international banking community, against Mr Fokin's insular,
Communist-dominated cabinet of ministers, which is struggling to preserve a
command economy.
First introduced in January as a stop-gap solution to Ukraine's severe
shortage of roubles, the coupon now accounts for 97 per cent of official
cash transactions in Ukraine.
However the government's ballooning budget deficit and lax credit policies
have rapidly eroded the value of the coupon from an initial two or three
roubles to the current rate of between 60 and 65 kopeks.
'The state of the coupon is a national tragedy,' Mr Hetman said at an
emotional press conference over the weekend closed to foreign journalists.
'We took a series of provocative acts against the coupon which no currency
in the world could endorse and which no other government in the world could
countenance.'
Mr Hetman, a hard-headed manager who ran Ukraine's largest commercial bank
before moving to the National Bank this spring, outlined a two-part strategy
to rescue the coupon.
In the short-term, Mr Hetman said: 'We must arrange a temporary marriage
with the rouble. This is a tactical retreat.'
In a move piloted in Crimea last week, Mr Hetman would like to re-introduce
the rouble as a parallel currency in mainland Ukraine, where state stores
only accept coupons.
In the long term, Mr Hetman wants to restrict the issuing of coupons by
putting a ceiling on wages and severely cutting credits to inefficient state
enterprises.
However, discussions of these proposals late on Friday with Mr Fokin did not
encourage him. 'The prime minister does not want us to take these steps but
wants us to stick with the old policy,' he said.
Mr Hetman blamed Mr Fokin's government and the parliament for Ukraine's
runaway inflation.
'The parliament and the government continue to print money and to endorse
increasingly costly programmes, despite the repeated protests of the
National Bank,' he said.
Mr Hetman warned that, if the introduction of Ukraine's long-awaited
separate currency, the hryvnia, was to be successful, 'these 'stabilisation'
measures must be implemented by the end of the year.' The final decision on
when to introduce the hryvnia would be taken in September.
The manner in which several CIS members are tinkering with the rouble is
causing growing alarm to the monetary authorities in Moscow, writes John
Thornhill in Moscow.
On Saturday, Azerbaijan announced it was to print a new currency, the manat,
to supplement a shortage of roubles circulating in the trans-Caucasian
state. Workers will now receive 20 per cent of their pay in manats. The
Azeri central bank said it would issue three different denominations of
manat bank notes. One manat would be equivalent to 10 roubles.
Other former Soviet republics have also issued parallel currencies, although
only Estonia has completely abandoned the rouble-introducing its own kroon.
Many western economists and bankers have argued that a proliferation of
national currencies among the republics of the former Soviet Union will only
hamper trade within the region.

FT  17 AUG 92 / Looters seize part of relief shipment to Somalia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOGADISHU
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RELIEF operations in famine-stricken southern Somalia were sabotaged
yesterday when armed looters seized part of the first United Nations
shipment of food and fuel into the port of Kismayo.
The need for UN military protection of relief operations was underlined when
local militia hired to protect the shipment stole 600 tonnes of food and
fuel.
The supplies were meant for an estimated 200,000 starving people in and
around the port, including 10,000 children believed by the UN to be in the
final throes of malnutrition. About 1.5m people are facing starvation in the
country.
The looting in Kismayo took place as rival gunmen shot dead three people in
the port of Mogadishu, disrupting efforts to unload food from two ships.
In spite of security problems, international relief efforts were boosted
yesterday by the news that the US would begin an airlift of 145,000 tonnes
of food to Somalia. But the news surprised aid officials in Mogadishu,
raising questions about the level of co-ordination between donors.
An Irish relief official aboard the ship in the port of Kismayo described
the scene in a radio call to UN headquarters in Mogadishu: 'The security
situation is critical. I can see them looting as I speak to you.'
In a tense but controlled radio conversation the official said the rest of
the shipment was effectively being held to ransom by Somali port officials
and gunmen, who were demanding Dollars 140,000 (Pounds 73,298) for customs
clearance, security and other claimed fees. This was Dollars 100,000 more
than the official had expected to pay.
Some Somali officials in Kismayo were said to be calculating their charges
at an exchange rate of Somali Shillings 5,800 to the dollar, instead of the
normal market rate of 7,400.
Mr Husein Yusuf of the Red Cross said at least 10,000 UN guards were needed
urgently to safeguard relief operations.

FT  17 AUG 92 / Monday Interview: The riddle of The Chairman - Jerry
Rawlings, president of Ghana
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The World Bank may be surprised to learn that its model economic recovery
programme in Africa is described as 'economic blah blah blah' by Ghana's
president.
Flight-Lt Jerry John Rawlings, 45, is more at home in the cockpit of a
fighter-jet than articulating the principles of the structural adjustment
programme which has been adopted across the continent. But, in spite of his
apparent contempt for economic theories and intellectuals, Rawlings has not
wavered in his political support for tough and often unpopular reforms.
One of Africa's most dynamic leaders, Rawlings has ruled post-colonial
Ghana, often uncomfortably, for the past 13 years - longer than anyone else.
Since his first populist military coup in 1979 against a corrupt, army-led
government, he has set Ghana back on the road to economic rectitude and
political maturity - although not without abuses of human rights that he now
refers to as 'mistakes'.
He has had to confront the problems facing other parts of Africa in the
1980s: marginalisation, corruption, the fall-out from the end of the cold
war and external and internal pressures for democratisation.
Having presided over reform of the economy, 'JJ', or 'The Chairman' as he is
known, now faces a challenge equally demanding: the transition from the
authoritarian, often idiosyncratic era of military rule to a multi-party
democracy, culminating in presidential elections in November this year.
He is shy of publicity and foreigners and rarely gives interviews. But
recently he spoke to the FT in his modest private quarters inside the
whitewashed, 16th-century, Danish-built castle which is home to Ghana's
presidents. The Chairman, in a checked plaid shirt, jeans and army-green
Reeboks, railed against his familiar targets - the hypocrisy of the
'so-called ethics' of the US, the way the west has sponsored brutal African
dictators like President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, and 'the greedy
consumerist attitude of Europeans' which was destroying the environment.
At times, he struggled to find the words for his emotional thoughts. But in
an exceptional display of candour, he revealed the qualities which have made
him popular. They include his acknowledgment of 'his own limitations', his
plain speaking and an element of playfulness, revealed by his production of
a huge tiger's claw he cut from a tiger's skin in an Ethiopian palace.
To many, Rawlings is an enigma - a firebrand socialist who has pursued one
of the continent's most widely praised free-market economic reform
programmes, backed by aid from the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund. Since 1983 he has backed a programme of devaluation, trade
liberalisation, tight fiscal and monetary policy, and large reductions in
the bloated bureaucracy. These policies have given Ghana an average real
growth rate of 5 per cent a year, reduced inflation from an annual rate of
123 per cent in 1983 to 18 per cent last year, restored confidence and
stimulated investment and the return of millions of dollars held overseas by
Ghanaian nationals. Debt arrears of USDollars 600m were erased by 1990.
Part of the answer to the Rawlings riddle lies in the fact that he has been
shrewd enough to ensure that management of the economy, which he admits he
does not fully understand, has been left to technocrats led by Dr Kwesi
Botchwey, the finance minister, and including Dr Joe Abbey, the ambassador
to Washington. 'They are workers but they like to call themselves advisors,'
Rawlings jokes.
He has also shown a political commitment to reform. Rawlings believes that
in Africa the alleviation of poverty can be achieved only through a lean,
free-market economy, backed, at least in the short-term, by western aid.
Classical structural adjustment policies of devaluation, free-market
liberalisation and cutting of subsidies have redistributed wealth and
promoted growth. They have released state resources for education, health
and infrastructure, and shifted the terms of trade in favour of rural
farmers who make up most of the population.
Rawlings said common sense dictated that he support economic reform. 'What
we are aiming for is the humanising of capitalism . . . We have only done
what is common sense to the ordinary person. Oppressed, poor people don't
have to be told by foreigners and intellectuals about corruption, the price
they have paid for their cocoa or bringing clean water to their villages.'
This commitment to 'the people', combined with a reputation unsullied by
charges of corruption, has made the programme one of the most successful in
the continent.
Rawlings' support for free-market policies, however, remains qualified, and
he stresses that colonialism and the inequities of the international
economic order remain powerful constraints on Africa's development. He also
frequently lashes out at the west, complaining about the way Africa has
become marginalised and 'ripped-off' by some foreign companies.
Many question whether, with these views, Rawlings can deepen the limited
successes of the reform programme, and move it forward to the next critical
level. This requires a commitment to the private sector and foreign
investment which would create self-sustainable growth without dependence on
foreign aid.
In three months Rawlings will return the country to civilian rule for a
second time. So far, he has remained mute over whether he will be a
presidential candidate. 'I have left it to God for guidance. That's what I
tell the diplomats anyway,' he said, chuckling.
However, having once before wrested the country back from an incompetent
civilian administration, he hopes that Ghanaians will avoid being being
badly served by politicians again. 'The people have become a lot more
defiant. You can't fool the people any more with sweet promises. Thank God
for it. The politicians would be better talking about the reality of
hardship ahead which faces us, instead of trying to con people.'
If Rawlings decides to run against as-yet undeclared opponents, he will face
severe criticism of his human rights record, which includes executions,
kidnappings, arbitrary detention without trial and confiscation of property.
The Chairman admits that human rights abuses have been committed during the
past decade, but he says he is genuinely sorry for past excesses. 'The
humanity of our revolution is that the politicians can come back and smear
us. In the French revolution, they were beheaded. Our crime is our
humanity.'
This humanity is best illustrated by his background and character, rather
than by his erratic and flamboyant economic and political philosophy. He
recalled his childhood on the streets of Accra, where he got into 'a lot of
scrapes and whenever I heard a police siren my heart started pounding
because I thought they were coming to get me'.
During the interview, he prowled around his study, which has two televisions
so he can get CNN, C-Span and watch videos about acrobatic and formation
jet-flying, his first recreational passion. But his ferocity crumbled as he
got up to hug his wife and children and listen to a little lecture from Mrs
Rawlings about kicking his heavy smoking habit.
Throughout his rule, he says, he has managed to make sure 'the office
doesn't take away my personal freedom'. His bedroom is like a small workshop
with tools spread out for building radio-controlled model aircraft. A punch
bag hangs next to the dining table. He has made time for regular complex
flying exercises, riding motorbikes and scuba-diving. Flying, he says, is
the 'ultimate challenge' and 'anybody who does not enjoy these things does
not get the best out of life'.
If he stands and is defeated in the forthcoming elections, he says he will
have to search for a job because 'I have no money'. But he says he might
like to write a book on social psychology or become a preacher to continue
his campaign against injustice.

FT  17 AUG 92 / Letter From The Midlands: History turns on its tail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
History is playing tricks with Birmingham and the Black Country, the
sprawling conurbation at the heart of the West Midlands, at the heart,
indeed, of British industry itself.
According to the old aphorism, history ought to be repeating itself. More
likely, it has stopped repeating and gone back on itself. Put another way,
the recession gives rise to the thought that the economic foundations of the
conurbation are gently crumbling.
If history is simple repetition then there is nothing exciting in the
present recession or its predecessor of the early 1980s. Recessions are
regrettable. They cause hardship. But eventually they go away. They are just
part of the normal order of things and have been for a couple of centuries.
Asa Briggs, the historian, writing* of Birmingham in the Victorian era,
termed it 'a city of marked industrial fluctuations'.
The difficulty is that the gap between the fluctuations seems to become
shorter. There were about three good years between the recession of the
1980s and that of the 1990s. So the emphasis in the plethora of engineering
companies is on survival rather than expansion, on cost-cutting rather than
investment.
All industrialists are busy reading the runes, looking over their orderbooks
and finding that instead of them getting fatter they are remaining
dangerously thin. The surveys of business performance and expectation - from
the Confederation of British Industry, the Engineering Employers' Federation
and the Chambers of Commerce - scrutinise the ground for the chancellor's
green shoots and find the soil waterlogged. The best they can say is that
things are not getting much worse.
Looking for solace, Mr Edward Roberts, the CBI's regional chairman, found it
encouraging that 'whilst there may be less spending on buildings in the year
ahead, investments in plant and machinery may stabilise - for the first time
in three years'.
If the investments are not being made, it is difficult to see how West
Midlands industrial companies can remain competitive later in the decade.
Rather, they will be in the position of trying to keep up the speed of a
Mercedes in a Morris Minor. And here the problem is not with the big players
 -the likes of GKN, Glynwed, IMI and Lucas or even car makers such as Rover
or Peugeot - but with the host of small companies.
The industrial base was built up on small companies. Briggs quotes the
factory inspector who, in 1843, remarked that 'there are no large and
crowded factories such as abound in other districts'. Nearly 150 years on,
there are, of course, large factories but the importance of the small
companies remains: Birmingham still likes to see itself as the city of a
thousand trades.
The small companies are vainly looking for help. Mr Andrew Millward,
chairman of the regional Chambers of Commerce and thus spokesman for 13,000
companies, turned recently to the old refrain. 'Companies still need to be
given right messages by the government. They need to see a lowering of
interest rates. It is important also that a correct balance is struck
between controlling public expenditure and ensuring that important long-term
investment programmes, particularly those for training and infrastructure
improvement, continue,' he said.
Leaving aside the gripes about the cost of money and the litany of
complaints about roads, rail and the rest, the underlying importance of what
Mr Millward was saying concerns skills. Lack of them caused bottlenecks in
the heady days of the 1980s. Shortage will doubtless return when companies
start taking on labour instead of laying it off.
Recession is causing the skills base, slender at best, to atrophy further.
Last week's unemployment figures put the proportion of West Midlands jobless
at 10.6 per cent, or 267,500 people. That number will increase. The latest
CBI-BSL regional trends survey put the loss of manufacturing jobs at 23,000
this year alone. But then the number of manufacturing jobs has been in
decline since the 1970s.
At one level, this fall in manufacturing employment can be construed as a
healthy development. Companies, it is argued, get leaner; their costs come
down; their productivity goes up. Last week's sharp rise in profits from
Glynwed, one of the most diversified of West Midlands engineering groups,
adds support to that argument. It has been cutting its manned capacity to
meet lower demand. It has not cut its machinery capacity.
There is another factor to support the argument. It is that the West
Midlands, with 33.2 per cent of its gross domestic output coming from
manufacturing, needs to diversify its economy into services. Then it would
be less vulnerable to Briggs's 'industrial fluctuations'.
The problem is that the service industries tend not to offer such high wages
as manufacturing. So relatively well-paid jobs are being exchanged often for
low-paid jobs. This exacerbates a growing social problem. The West Midlands
Low Paid Unit calculated that 45.4 per cent of adult workers in the region
received wages under the low-pay threshold of Pounds 185 for a 38-hour week.
Briggs noted that in the 19th century 'a large proportion of the Birmingham
labour force was skilled and therefore relatively well-off economically'.
This was a source of strength in developing the industry which gave the city
and its region prosperity. The proportion of the unskilled - those, by
definition, who are low paid - is too high to secure regional prosperity in
the late 20th century. Which is one reason why history has turned back on
itself.

FT  17 AUG 92 / Time to do or die on the economy: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Forget family values, education, healthcare and crime. The principal
challenge facing the Republican party in Houston this week is economic. If
President George Bush leaves the Astrodome on Thursday night having
convinced the American people that he can restore economic prosperity in a
second term, he may win in November. If he fails to sound credible on the
economy, he may as well head straight for retirement in Kennebunkport.
The task of reinventing Mr Bush as an economic statesman falls to his old
friend, Mr James Baker, who is moving back to the White House as chief of
staff. Mr Baker has the credentials for the job. He brings a strong personal
staff from the State Department, including Mr Robert Zoellick, his widely
respected economic aide.
A natural pragmatist, Mr Baker gained worldwide respect as treasury
secretary in the mid-1980s when he boldly reversed the Reagan
administration's 'hands off' approach to the dollar, advocating instead a
policy of collective intervention by the leading industrial powers backed by
global co-ordination of fiscal and monetary policy. That volte face
indicates that Mr Baker would not hesitate to recommend a radical change of
economic course if he felt it would help electorally.
Mr Baker's return to domestic affairs is a reminder that the sense of drift
during Mr Bush's first term owed much to the weakness of his economic team.
Mr Nicholas Brady, the treasury secretary, has been invisible much of the
time while more junior figures, such as Mr Michael Boskin, the chief White
House economist, lack clout with the president. Mr Bush's domestic advisers
repeatedly projected rosy economic upturns, creating the impression that the
White House was badly out of touch.
They have also mishandled Congress. Mr Bush, for example, set a date this
spring (a domestic line in the sand) by which Congress had to pass his
'growth package'; but when Congress did not, he meekly accepted the rebuff.
Mr Baker's first task is to rewrite history so as to give the impression
that Mr Bush has made economic progress. Frankly, this looks horribly
difficult. I can think of only two obvious achievements - a reduction in the
rate of inflation from about 5 per cent to perhaps 3 per cent, and the just
concluded North American Free Trade Agreement.
Neither is an automatic turn-on for voters. Few people regarded the 5 per
cent inflation of the 1980s as problematic and hardly any would choose to
pay even a temporary price in lost jobs to get it down. Nafta mainly has
appeal as a way of countering 'Fortress Europe' and neutralising Japanese
economic power, which frightens Americans. But many voters will have mixed
feelings, recognising that blue-collar jobs may be exported to Mexico.
The negative side of Mr Bush's ledger is daunting. Living standards have
barely risen since he was campaigning in 1988 - an awfully long time in this
land of short attention spans - while the unemployment rate is sharply
higher.
Mr Bush has presided over the slowest economic growth of any president since
Herbert Hoover and the fastest growth of federal spending since the early
1960s. He has broken his pledge not to raise taxes, but not decisively
enough to prevent budget deficits exploding to their highest level since the
second world war. The middle classes, struggling to service mortgages on
houses that are often losing value, have been hit by soaring costs of
healthcare and college tuition. Polls indicate a general loss of confidence
in the American dream of steadily rising prosperity.
To be fair, Mr Bush's record is poor partly because he had to clear up the
mess left by two Reagan presidencies. Mr Reagan pulled every lever to gain
temporary advantage: he revved up defence, slashed income and corporate
taxes, lowered interest rates and gave huge tax incentives for real estate
development. The ensuing boom eventually drowned in a sea of debt. Mr Baker,
however, can hardly defend Mr Bush's record by blaming Mr Reagan, whom he
served for eight years and who remains a hero to grassroots Republicans.
If the past is a minefield, the future is also fraught with danger.
Conservative Republicans are strongly pressing a free-market strategy for
economic renewal, consisting mainly of sharp cuts in income and capital
taxes and vague promises to restrain federal spending. As he left Foggy
Bottom last week, Mr Baker signalled support for some of this platform. But
he and Mr Zoellick will have to ponder carefully the merits of offering the
American people another walk on the supply side.
The federal deficit is at record levels, the federal debt has quadrupled to
Dollars 4,000bn under three Republican administrations. Mr Bush has shown no
capacity to control spending and has already proposed healthcare reforms
that will cost an extra Dollars 100bn. Are voters really going to believe in
the wisdom of further tax cuts?
So what else could the pragmatic team of Baker and Zoellick offer? How about
an investment programme to repair the nation's crumbling infrastructure and
upgrade workforce skills to make American business more competitive in world
markets? Sounds great: too bad that Governor Bill Clinton's policy wonks had
the idea first.

FT  17 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: The British disease becomes
endemic

   GOOD news at last
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
in a way. The 'surprising' fall in inflation was hailed, as the headlines
had it, by the Treasury. The government's policies are working, they said;
and that is just the trouble. The danger, as Roger Bootle (Midland Montagu's
chief economist) pointed out last week, is not that ministers do not mean
what they say (which is what the markets seem to fear), but that they do.
They will get their victory, only to achieve a Carthaginian peace. ('They
made a wilderness and called it peace,' says my dim memory of the classics.)
The fall in inflation is unsurprising because it is the natural result of a
slump, as dealers understood last Friday when they marked sterling down.
And that means there may be worse to come: not only a fall in inflation,
which means a rise in real interest rates, but a greater risk of higher
nominal rates, which will rack up real rates still higher. And then, if the
French vote down Maastricht next month . . .
Ministers are no doubt praying that the French vote will go the 'right' way;
but, in fact, it is hard to know which is the frying pan and which the fire.
Either we face a full-blown sterling crisis, or else we are stuck with
Maastricht convergence conditions, and German monetary policy. Unappetising
is a very mild word for it.
The Maastricht conditions are bad enough. They are illogical, as the IMF
used to be in the worst days of de la Rosiere debt phobia. Now the IMF is
more enlightened.
It calculates that the rules will reduce growth all over Europe by about 1
per cent annually - bearable in normal conditions, but dreadful in a
recession, and probably an under-estimate anyway. They reflect not economic
logic, but a mixture of German horror at the Italian national debt, and
Dutch Puritanism (always the most extreme in my experience) - a grim
combination.
German monetary policy, though, is worse. Four years ago, an enlightened
veteran of the Bundesbank council explained German monetary policy to an
admiring group of central bankers.
The great thing, he explained, was to have a clear, consistent policy over
the years; and an official able to explain convincingly why, at any given
moment, it was not being followed. This seems an ideal blend of apparent
rigour and practical common sense.
Things have changed, sadly, since then. The policy is no longer consistent,
and the commonsense has gone out of the window. The Buba Council has swapped
targets, as the Bank of England used to do so regularly; and in doing so, it
has adopted a policy, trying to deflate broad money through high interest
rates, which can only work (if it works at all) through provoking a sharp
recession.
This is obvious in theory: high rates make interest-bearing bank deposits
more attractive, and market investment less so, so raising rates tends to
inflate broad money, as long as the banks still see acceptable lending
opportunities, which dry up only in a recession.
What is more, this effect has repeatedly been demonstrated by the Bank of
England (remember the Thatcher monetary targets?).
Mr Paul Volcker fell into the same trap when President Carter turned him
loose. He squeezed, and broad money ballooned. His sudden enlightenment
exactly 10 years ago, triggered by the Mexican debt crisis (and memorably
forecast by Dr Henry Kaufman, with dramatic results on Wall Street) started
a worldwide fall in rates, and so ended the worst world recession until this
one.
An example for Buba, now faced with recession and actual falling prices?
Probably not, alas; because Volcker's timely relaxation was sustained until
it caused the world asset inflation.
Is it ignorance that causes these huge policy errors? Surely not, after all
this time. The common factor in all these episodes is not economic doctrine,
but emotion.
In all of them, the central bank saw itself as the only power able to save
its nation from an irresponsible government, and adopted a policy designed
to put the government on the rack.
This used to be a purely British syndrome. It now seems to be endemic all
over Europe.

FT  17 AUG 92 / International Company News: Cross border M&amp;A deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISPOSALS of various kinds provided last week's more interesting
international corporate developments, writes Brian Bollen.
The week saw two developments in the dismemberment of Polly Peck
International, which collapsed almost two years ago. In the biggest new
deal, the group's administrators agreed to sell PPI Del Monte Fresh Produce
to a Mexican-led investor group for Dollars 499m (Pounds 261m). The
administrators also received a bid for the company which owns the Sheraton
Voyager Hotel in the Turkish resort of Antalya.
The week's biggest non-core disposal was US business group Dun &amp;
Bradstreet's sale of London-based Datastream International. The buyer,
Virginia-based holding company Primark, is in the process of changing from a
utility-based conglomerate to an information services group.
In France, the sale of Isoroy continues Pinault's debt reduction programme
and its efforts to refocus away from timber and into retailing.
Eastern Europe continues to generate deals sporadically, despite the
criticisms of some investment bankers that there is no money to be made
there. Poland's stuttering privatisation programme took a step forward with
the announcement by International Paper, the US forest products group, of
its first venture in the region. The purchase of Kwidzyn Pulp and Paper
marks a new phase in the company's international expansion after its
domestic and European growth in the 1980s.

FT  17 AUG 92 / Personal View: A way out of recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GAVIN MCCRONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS pressure mounts on the UK government over interest rates and the exchange
rate mechanism (ERM), one of the oddest features of the recent parliamentary
session was the sight of Conservative backbenchers arguing for devaluation,
a policy which the Tory party has historically opposed.
The truth is that neither an ERM realignment nor lower interest rates would
be an easy answer to Britain's economic woes.
Sterling's downwards adjustment within the ERM would be so damaging to its
credibility that higher interest rates would follow; while a cut in interest
rates combined with sterling's withdrawal from the ERM would cause a
substantial depreciation of the currency.
This would result in price increases for imports and serious inflationary
knock-on effects.
Because the British economy is today both more open and more integrated with
its European partners, devaluation would be a less effective weapon than it
was 20 to 30 years ago, or than it still is for the US. Devaluation aside,
there is still much the government can do.
Some clues can be found by comparing the impact of the recession on southern
England and Scotland.
Gross domestic product north of the border has held up better than to the
south.
One consequence is that unemployment in Scotland has risen proportionately
less than elsewhere in the UK.
More significantly, house prices have continued to advance modestly in
Scotland, whereas in south-east England they have fallen by some 30 per cent
since their peak at the end of the 1980s
The reasons behind the recession's uneven impact have to do with the housing
market. Scotland has just over 50 per cent of its housing stock in
owner-occupation compared with nearly 70 per cent in England as a whole; the
figure for the south-east is even higher. In the buoyant late-1980s, the
government's encouragement to home ownership, coupled with easy availability
of mortgages following financial deregulation and the shortage of private
rented accommodation, forced house prices to rise sharply, especially in the
south-east.
Easy credit fuelled the boom, as people increased their consumption
expenditure.
Inevitably, when the government raised interest rates in 1988 to control the
credit explosion, the south was hardest hit.
Property prices fell and thousands of homeowners found themselves with
mortgages exceeding the value of their house. As recession began to bite,
many could no longer afford repayments and house repossessions have risen
sharply. By contrast, Scotland has a much lower percentage of home
ownership. The relative house price stability there has meant that the
impact of recession on consumer expenditure has been less severe than in
England.
Many argue that a period of increased general inflation will be necessary to
rectify this imbalance between asset values and outstanding debt before
recovery can get under way. This seems a counsel of depair. Certainly
something must be done to put some life back into the housing market.
Further encouragement to home ownership through the raising of mortgage tax
relief might give short-term benefit but at the cost of perpetuating an
expensive distortion and compounding the core problem. A mortgage benefit
scheme would be a better idea but would be costly.
But the real oddity of the housing market is the virtual absence of a
private rented sector, a surprising anomaly after 13 years of a Conservative
government pledged to the free market.
Elsewhere in Europe, where there is little local authority-owned housing,
private rented accommodation plays a significant role, both subsidised for
social housing and on a straight commercial basis.
Two factors killed the UK private rented sector: rent controls, which have
now been removed; and competition from the subsidised publicly-owned sector
and from owner occupation, the latter benefiting from mortgage tax relief.
As a result, the quality of private rented housing has deteriorated.
What is needed to lift the private rented sector and the overall housing
market are fiscal incentives of the kind outlined by the housing inquiry
chaired by the Duke of Edinburgh and published by the Joseph Rowntree
Foundation in June 1991.
To ensure these incentives help to generate recovery from the present
recession they would need to be on a sufficiently large scale. This could
probably be achieved only if financial institutions could be persuaded to
invest in the sector and if the incentives were targeted at social as well
as commercial housing.
Critics argue that increased government spending on housing will push up an
already large public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR).
But the PSBR is largely a product of the recession which this expenditure
would be aimed at ending. Increased state spending on housing would in turn
attract much-needed investment from a previously untapped source, helping to
upgrade a poorly-maintained housing stock; it would improve labour mobility,
essential to the health of the economy; above all an enlivened private
rented sector would help to stabilise the housing market both in boom and
recession.

FT  15 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Bimec cancels final pay-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BIMEC, the acquisitive waste treatment, aerospace and engineering company,
yesterday said deteriorating business conditions had forced it to cancel the
final dividend.
The news sent shares plunging from 19p to 6 1/4 p, their lowest in five
years, and left Bimec capitalised at Pounds 7m.
Mr Sam Smith, the chairman who arrived in 1989 and fuelled Bimec's rise from
a penny stock to a peak of 80p in October, said the company continued to
receive the support of its bankers.
He said production in the first few months of the year was more than 20 per
cent down on the previous year. 'Looking ahead, the economy is not too
brilliant,' he said. It had seemed prudent to cancel the dividend.
The company also said that efforts to pull out of aerospace had been
thwarted. Advanced negotiations on the sale of the aero and industrial
division had fallen through. Mr Smith said it could be up to six months
before a sale was completed.
Analysts greeted the company's statement with dismay. 'Something fairly
extraordinary must have happened since the year-end to say they would not
pay the dividend,' said Mr Mitchel Teager, small companies analyst at Albert
E Sharp.
Many analysts had difficulty forecasting the level of interim profits for
the six months to September after yesterday's announcement. Originally,
estimates had been for Pounds 4m pre-tax, compared with Pounds 3m.
For the year to March 31 Bimec reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 6m.
However, that was after a Pounds 662,000 surplus on disposals and the
capitalisation of Pounds 1.2m in development costs.
Gearing has risen since the 69 per cent reported at the year-end.
Earlier this week, Bimec announced the purchase of a building maintenance
company - Pearl Contracts - from Cannon Street Investments. Consideration
comprised the issue of 3.25m Bimec shares, then at 19 1/2 p.
Mr Teager pointed out that the cash position of the company appeared to have
worsened significantly.

MR BOB MORTON, chairman of Vistec, could take a 36.1 per cent stake in MMI,
the financial and corporate marketing and communication group, following a
refinancing.
He is subscribing for 2.1m new shares at 5p and 75 per cent of the shares
not taken up in a 3m offering to existing shareholders. Stratagem Group is
subscribing for 900,000 new shares and 25 per cent of those not taken up.
The refinancing is necessary as MMI's net assets are less than half its
called up share capital. The offering is on a 1-for-2.88 basis at 5p each.
Mr Morton's maximum holding could then be 5.3m shares, or 36.1 per cent of
the enlarged capital with Stratagem having 1.65m or 11.2 per cent. The
Takeover Panel has agreed to waive any obligation for Mr Morton to make an
offer for the company, subject to the transactions being approved at an EGM.
On completion of the placing Mr Morton will become chairman of MMI and could
eventually make it a shell company for his private interests.
MMI also announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 383,000 for the 14 months to
February 28, against profits of Pounds 317,000 for 1990.
There is no final dividend (1p) making the total for the period 0.25p
(1.25p). MMI's shares closed at 7p, down 3 1/2 p.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Countrywide Banking Corporation, of New Zealand, which is 86 per cent-owned
by the Bank of Scotland, incurred an overall loss of NZDollars 40.9m (Pounds
11.6m) in the year to June 30, against profits of NZDollars 16.5m.
The loss included doubtful debt provisions of NZ30.5m, and also allowed for
a write-off of NZDollars 38m on the recent purchase of United Banking.
Countrywide paid NZDollars 182.5m for United and that was initially funded
by Bank of Scotland. Now Countrywide is to meet the purchase price by
raising NZDollars 180m through a share issue, probably on a 3-for-2 basis at
NZDollars 1.65 each.

A CUT in central charges led to LIT Holdings achieving an increase from

Normally, the opening six months is seasonally biased and produces
materially higher operating profits. This time they fell from Pounds 4.05m
to Pounds 3.47m, and the directors 'must anticipate' that the second half
results may be worse than those of 1991 when operating profit was Pounds
742,000 and the pre-tax loss Pounds 636,000.
Central charges of this marketing services, investment and fund management

Earnings per share for the half year were 1.8p (1.7p). A dividend has been
paid on the preference shares.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Deaths ferry to be withdrawn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE IRISH Sea ferry on which two children died earlier this week is to be
withdrawn on Tuesday for modifications to the sewerage system. It will be
out of action for three days.
A representative of Swansea Cork Ferries said the Celtic Pride, owned by the
Polish Baltic Shipping Company, would stay in service over the weekend to
cater for hundreds of already-booked passengers, but without 95 of its
cabins and 210 berths.
The two children, Katherine and James Tomlins, of Truro, Cornwall, died in
the night aboard the Polish-registered Celtic Pride when gases seeped into
their cabin from the ferry's sewerage system.
Since the accident, other people who have travelled on the vessel have said
they had previously complained to Swansea Cork Ferries, the operator, about
strong sewage smells in some cabins.
Yesterday the vessel arrived in Swansea to be met by marine surveyors from
the Department of Transport and was temporarily held for examination.
Afterwards, the British, Irish and Polish authorities agreed that it could
remain in service provided the operators made modifications to the sewerage
system and sealed off the affected cabins in the meantime.
The Department of Transport yesterday issued advice to other ferry companies
operating in UK waters advising them to check that their vessels' sewerage
systems had adequate venting.
The department said it had no plans for an investigation into the accident.
It said that was a matter for the Polish authorities.
The lack of an investigation has caused concern on both sides of the Irish
Sea. In Britain, Ms Joan Whalley, who speaks for the opposition on
transport, urged an inquiry by the Marine Accident Investigation Branch.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Drop in food prices cuts inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP drop in seasonal food prices was the main reason behind the fall in
retail inflation to an annual rate of 3.7 per cent last month.
Although the prices of seasonal foods normally fall at this time of year,
July's drop of 9.9 per cent was steeper than expected and brought the
year-on-year rate of inflation for seasonal foods to minus 9.8 per cent.
The fall was mainly the result of cheaper fresh fruit and vegetables,
particularly salad foods. Prices of potatoes and home-killed lamb also fell.
According to the Central Statistical Office a number of price increases that
were made in July last year were not repeated this year and summer sales for
clothes, shoes and certain household goods continued.
A fall in mortgage interest payments between June and July also contributed
to the drop in the overall index from 139.3 in June to 138.8 last month.
High street summer sales, which cut prices by more than the sales last year
and were spread over a wider range of products, led to a monthly drop of 4
per cent in clothing and footwear prices - the sharpest fall for any July
since records began in 1914. Prices of furniture and electrical goods also
fell as sales continued.
The biggest month-on-month rise for any component of the index was in
house-hold services, which rose by 1.1 per cent. That reflected higher
premiums for house contents insurance and an increase in trade union
subscriptions.
Prices of some other goods crept up, in particular do-it-yourself materials
which increased after special offers earlier in the year and contributed to
the rise in the housing element of the index. That rise was only partly
offset by the fall in mortgage interest payments between June and July.
Service-sector inflation remained significantly higher than food-price
inflation. It was also well above producer-price inflation for manufactured
goods, which was 3.4 per cent last month.
The annual rates of inflation for leisure services, personal goods and
services and motoring expenditure fell in July.
Although car insurance premiums rose last month, price increases for
second-hand cars were not repeated this year leading to no change in the
index for motoring expenditure.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Solvency rules for life insurers eased
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT actuary has told life insurers he will relax regulations
regarding the calculation of solvency margins in the light of recent falls
in equity prices.
The move will ease growing pressure on with-profits life companies to sell a
portion of their equity holdings at what could be the bottom of the market
and move into bonds.
Mr Chris Daykin, chief government actuary, said in a letter to life insurers
that they may breach an existing 'resilience' rule on asset portfolios if
they discuss the matter with his office first. The rule, set in 1985,
requires companies to meet regulatory ratios even if the value of their
equities falls by 25 per cent. With-profits life companies, which pay
bonuses to policyholders based on past, current and future investment
returns, are required to have assets equal to 104 per cent of liabilities.
Mr Daykin said: 'This letter was intended to provide some comfort to those
who might be up against their regulatory minimums.'
The letter says that those companies whose equity portfolios broadly
correspond to the FT All Share Index, currently producing a dividend yield
of 5.29 per cent, may be allowed to assume a more modest fall in equity
prices. This would mean the insurer would need to hold slightly fewer assets
as reserves.
Mr Daykin said it was not intended that the 25 per cent rule should be
reduced significantly. Instead, those with portfolios yielding 5.5 per cent
to 6 per cent would be allowed to assume a decline of about 20 per cent to
22 per cent in equity prices when calculating how much they needed to hold
in reserve. Several insurers have already said that they are committing new
cashflow to bonds rather than equities. Bonds are yielding 9 per cent to 10
per cent, well above the yields on equities.
Mr Daykin said in his letter that the current requirement that portfolios
must withstand a rise of 3 percentage points in interest rates was
reasonable in the market conditions and would not be changed.

THE US defence department will begin emergency airlifts of food to Somalia
'as soon as possible', as international efforts build up to alleviate hunger
in the war-ravaged country, agencies report from Washington.
A big airlift of aid is already being organised by the United Nations - to
include airdrops of food to Mogadishu, the capital, and other communities in
the interior. The new aid move, announced by the White House, comes on the
heels of an announcement on Thursday that the Bush administration is willing
to transport UN troops to help protect food deliveries.
The US also wants the UN to convene a donors' conference to co-ordinate
Somalia relief efforts. It would bring in the main warring groups to try to
win their co-operation in getting food supplies through safely to the
starving population.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, is today to meet the head
of the Keidanren, the country's influential business grouping, for what were
described as emergency talks on ways to buoy the slowing domestic economy.
The talks with Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, who is also chairman of Tokyo Electric
Power, come at Mr Miyazawa's request. They follow a week in which the Tokyo
stock market has touched six-year lows, most economic data have remained
discouraging, and ministries have squabbled over the size and content of a
package of stimulatory measures.
No immediate solutions were expected from the meeting. Equities yesterday
managed their first rally in seven trading days on largely technical
factors. The Nikkei average of 225 leading companies was 52.08 points higher
at 14,820.25.
The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) yesterday revised
upwards its industrial production statistics for June, but an official said
the underlying tone was weak.
Seasonally adjusted production in manufacturing and mining rose 2.5 per cent
from May, Miti said, compared with its preliminary figure of 2.1 per cent.
The index of shipments rose 0.7 per cent month-on-month, but compared with
June 1991, production was down 3.9 per cent and shipments fell 3.5 per cent.
The Bank of Japan meanwhile announced that domestic wholesale prices,
although 0.1 per cent higher in July than the previous month because of
higher electricity charges, were down 0.7 per cent from a year earlier.
Evidence of continued weak consumer demand came yesterday in sales for July
at Tokyo department stores, which were down 3.7 per cent from a year
earlier, the fifth monthly fall in a row.
The Japan Department Stores Association said this was the sector's most
protracted downturn ever, exceeding the four poor months experienced during
the 1982 oil crisis.
The association said high-value goods fared particularly badly, while foods
were the only area to show a rise.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Property: Lashings of Lutyens for country house buyers -
Never before have so many been on the market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HANSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUYERS of Lutyens properties are spoiled for choice. Never before have so
many works by England's greatest architect of country houses (Sir Edwin
Lutyens, 1869-1944) been on the market.
In recent decades, one or two Lutyens properties came on to the market
annually. But now at least 16 are on sale, and five more can be rented.
These include his first country house, Crooksbury, near Tilford, Surrey  -
or at least the major portion of it.
The Tudor-style house, built in 1890, was later extended and then, in 1970,
divided into six units, while the entrance lodge and gardener's cottage were
sold off separately.
Since then, a buyer of part of Crooksbury has pieced together four of the
other parts and 15 acres of mature gardens, which were landscaped originally
by Gertrude Jekyll. All this is now for sale at Pounds 1.25m through
Aylesford (tel. 071-351-2383). There is a prospect that the remaining part
of the main house might become available one day.
Two parts of another early Lutyens house in Surrey, also with Jekyll
gardens, have come on to the market. Chinthurst Hill, near Wonersh, was
built in 1893-95 and split into three in 1954.
Although the main part of the house is not for sale, a five-bedroom portion
called Close House is being offered with seven acres at Pounds 345,000
through Browns of Guildford (0483-31166), while the four-bedroom Gate House,
with 4.5 acres, is priced at Pounds 250,000 by Hamptons of Guildford
(0483-572-864).
For a complete Lutyens house in Surrey, you have to look to Fulbrook House,
near Elstead. Built in 1896-99, it has been restored fully in recent years
by John Morris of Therm-a-Stor, who is looking for offers over Pounds 2.5m
for the property through Hamptons at Guildford.
Unfortunately, there is no evidence that Jekyll designed the 21 acres of
beautiful gardens, although she might have advised Lutyens on the planting.
On the outskirts of East Grinstead, West Sussex, however, is Barton St Mary,
an eight-bedroom house that Lutyens built in 1906 for stockbroker Sir George
Munro Miller. It has 20 acres of gardens for which Jekyll's plans survive
(in California). Offers over Pounds 1m are being sought by Hamptons at
Sevenoaks (0732-460-222).
Marsh Court, a Grade I-listed 20-bedroom Lutyens house near Stockbridge,
Hampshire, with 47 acres of Jekyll gardens, has been on the market for three
years. It was built in 1901-04 for a flamboyant stockbroker, Herbert
Johnson, who sold it in 1945.
Between January 1948 and 1989, it was run as a mixed preparatory school. The
asking price has been cut recently from Pounds 2.75m to Pounds 1.5m by the
joint agents, Savills (0202-887-311) and Knight Frank &amp; Rutley
(071-629-8171).
Nashdom, near Burnham, Buckinghamshire, is a 24-bedroom mansion built in
1906-09. It was converted into a Benedictine monastery in 1926 but has been
empty since the monks sold it in 1987.
For sale with 17.5 acres of Jekyll gardens, offers of Pounds 1.5m are being
sought by Hamptons Giddy &amp; Giddy (0628-663-596) and Weatherall Green &amp; Smith
(071-405-6944). The agents are acting jointly for Arthur Andersen, the
receiver of Land Leisure which had planned to turn the property into a
health hydro.
Planning permission has been given for the Manor House at Ashby St Ledgers,
Northamptonshire, to become a hotel with a new 120-bedroom extension. Once
the home of Robert Catesby, one of Guy Fawkes' gunpowder plotters, it was
bought in 1903 by Lord Wimborne. Lutyens then altered and extended the
13-bedroom house over the next 35 years. It has been owned since 1989 by a
Kidderminster property company, Maltsword (0562-66884), which is seeking
Pounds 2.5m for it.
Yet, Pounds 800,000 would buy Gledstone Hall near Skipton, North Yorkshire,
which is regarded generally as one of Lutyens' finest classical houses with
10 acres of formal gardens by Jekyll. Built in 1922-25 for a cotton
mill-owner, Sir Amos Nelson, it was run as a nursing home by Burley Health
Care until March this year, and is now for sale through the Leeds office of
Knight Frank &amp; Rutley (0532-461-533) and JH Jackson &amp; Co. (0423-323-171).
The cheapest genuine Lutyens house on the market (there are always some
claimed wrongly to be by the master) is the four-bedroom South Sussex Lodge,
one of a pair designed by him in 1890 at the entrance to the Park Hatch
estate near Hascombe, Surrey. Both lodges were paid for with prize money won
by Joseph Godman for his Sussex cattle - a staggering thought when one lodge
is now for sale at Pounds 178,500 by Hamptons Messenger May of Godalming
(0483-417-222).
There is no room to mention all the other Lutyens houses on the market but
it should not be thought they are unsaleable. A buyer has paid almost Pounds
1m for the Salutation, a beautiful house at Sandwich, Kent, designed in 1912
with 3.5 acres of Jekyll gardens.
Nigel Colebrook, of agent Colebrook Sturrock &amp; Co., says: 'Only a handful of
properties in this price bracket have been sold in the south-east in the
past 12 months, and we received more than 100 enquiries and nine offers for
this exceptional property.'

FT  15 AUG 92 / China's peasant traders shake off Mao's shadow: Tony Kelly
haggles with the market traders of Xingyi in south-west China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A THIN blue stream flows up the hill towards me. The tide grows stronger
until by 9am it has become a torrent. Looking closely I can make out the
different specks of blue which make up the flow. Some wear rush baskets on
their backs, holding potatoes or tiny babies. Others wheel bicycles whose
panniers overflow with produce. A few drag wooden carts, piled with
home-made furniture, by hand. Others arrive by horse or ox-cart.
The lucky ones get a lift in a bus or on an 'iron cow' tractor. The unlucky
trudge up the hill with 30ft trunks of bamboo resting on their shoulders, or
dance with bended bees as they struggle to keep their balance, weighed down
by the loads which hang from their wooden shoulder-poles. Many have already
been walking or cycling for three or four hours. Some even left their
village homes the previous day.
This is Xingyi, a small market town of 40,000 in Guizhou province,
south-west China. The town is surrounded by conical limestone mountains and
by fields of rice, wheat and rape dotted with stone cottages. For six days
in every week it goes quietly about its business, and the noisiest sound
comes from the hillside cemetery when firecrackers signal a funeral. But on
Sundays every inch of town is taken over by a noisy and colourful free
market. There are no arguments over Sunday trading here: Xingyi, at the
meeting-point of three provinces, has been a centre of trade since the Ming
dynasty.
I taught English at the teacher-training college for two years and hardly
missed a Sunday market. Outside the college gates, barbers set up shop with
their collections of rusty bowls and instruments, bars of soap and thermoses
of warm water spread out on a cloth. Old ladies squat behind piles of
coriander and cabbage arranged on plastic sheets, while carpenters lie back
in the wooden threshing-boxes which they have made and carried to market.
Second-hand Army clothing is sold from rickety trestle-tables and a
government worker gathers a crowd as he teaches the rudiments of
pig-breeding with the aid of a loudhailer and a poster display.
All traffic has to admit defeat at the hands of the mass of pedlars and
shoppers. Women sell eggs in the road from enormous baskets and cautious
customers hold them up to the sun for inspection; peasants are almost
obscured from view behind the mountains of dried red chillies which they are
selling; incense-makers and chopstick-carvers and stonemasons and
tea-sellers all ply a brisk trade.
At a street library, teenagers pay a mao - about a penny - to borrow a comic
and flick through it as they perch on a wooden stool, while up the road a
group of workers pay to stare in excitement through hand-held projectors at
pictures of the sights in Beijing that they will never be able to afford to
visit.
There is a man selling miniature orange trees, a cyclist with live frogs
tied to his handlebars, a group of Miao nationality women selling hundreds
of herbal remedies - bark, twigs, roots, leaves, bones - from tiny red
pouches. They will even administer treatment on the spot with their
grotesque and ancient instruments. You can visit a street chiropodist or,
worse still, a dentist who will extract your painful tooth using a drill
attached to his motorbike throttle.
And so it goes on, a giant medieval street fair, story-tellers, quacks and
all, with just the occasional incongruous intrusion of 20th-century life. In
a seedy back room off the main square, shoppers watch the latest government
video, a warning of the dangers of AIDS, advertised on the street by a
hand-painted hoarding of a barely-clad white woman lying back seductively
with a rose between her teeth. Road safety police play music and messages
from a tape recorder and display photographs of mangled bicycles and bloody
corpses.
More blood is on offer at the butchers' stalls where severed pigs' heads sit
on tables beside ears, feet, intestines and bowls of lard swarming with
flies. You can have a chicken slaughtered and plucked while you wait, eat
dog-meat straight from the cauldron or watch as your eels are slit open on a
wooden board. You may have your watch or your trousers repaired, buy fresh
lychees or watermelon, order a good luck message in calligraphy for your
front door. You can buy embroidered baby-carriers and bamboo water-pipes and
Taoist tracts and T-shirts and kittens and crucifixes and sugared peanuts
and rock hewn from the mountains and second-hand bicycles and bundles of
toilet roll sold by the kilo and weighed on hand-held scales.
It all seems so natural, yet ten or 15 years earlier it could not have
happened. Markets were condemned in China's Maoist years as an 'incorrect'
line in the incessant class struggle; the ownership of a duck or a potted
plant was a suspect sign of capitalist behaviour. Now the hawkers are back
and as you watch them peddling everything from piglets to plastic trinkets,
it is hard to believe that things were ever different.
Making money comes readily to the Chinese, as Hong Kong so forcibly
demonstrates. And in this era of economic reform, everyone - from the
shoeshine boys at railway stations to the 'model millionaires' who run
computer companies - has become an entrepreneur. After all, you never know
how long it will last. The freedom to become rich appears far more precious
to the Chinese than a political freedom which they have never known, not
even before Communism. Now they are allowed to do once more what they do
best.
At the end of the day the river flows back out towards the villages.
Peasants carry home the prizes - plastic buckets, posters of film stars -
which their week's labours have enabled them to afford. Buses are piled high
with chickens and geese, street-cleaners clear away the debris with their
long-handled brooms. Xingyi can rest in peace for another week until the
next onslaught of market forces.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Cheap tickets to ride - Nick
Garnett finds a company that flies in the face of recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK GARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SO YOU are a small company set up in the 1970s and employing just 15 people
when recession strikes at the end of 1989. What happens?
In the case of Hamilton Travel, turnover since 1989 has jumped fivefold to
Pounds 15m and the workforce now numbers 60. As the economy's green shoots
of growth turn brown, Hamilton expects revenue of around Pounds 25m by next
year.
John Ansell is the majority stakeholder in the London company, which sells
'low cost' tickets on scheduled flights. When the economy is going through a
mini-boom and the scheduled carriers are selling almost every ticket they
have at face value, Ansell is not all that popular with them. But when
airlines struggle to fill their planes, Ansell and his company come into
their own.
'Airlines use us as a marketing arm,' Ansell says. 'They turn the tap on and
turn it off. They use us in bad times to help fill their planes but won't
give us much volume in good times.'
Hamilton, which so far operates only to European destinations, makes a gross
average profit of just 10 per cent on the tickets it sells. But since it is
selling around 1,000 a day, that adds up to several hundred thousand pounds
net profit a year. This is reeled in by young men and women booking flights
on 50 computer screens in a nondescript office behind a nondescript door in
a side street of the capital's West End.
The world of discount tickets and so-called 'bucket shops' is a murky one
which the airlines are reluctant - some might say frightened - to talk about
and Ansell also is reluctant to discuss individual airlines. But Hamilton
actually deals with 29 carriers. British Airways is widely perceived to be
the market leader in offloading discount tickets, although companies such as
Lufthansa and SAS have followed suit. The industry believes that more than
half the revenue of companies such as Hamilton comes from BA tickets.
Ansell denies that Hamilton - which claims to be the UK's largest supplier
of discounted scheduled air fares - is a bucket shop. In fact, 80 per cent
of its business - which is solely in the leisure market - is supplying
wholesale tickets to travel agents.
'Carriers want some central agency like us to help do this so they can keep
some control on it and ensure quality of service,' Ansell says. 'The last
thing scheduled airlines want is to dilute their margins on business
travel.'
That is why a business class return to Nice on Air France is Pounds 568 and
a 14-day Apex lowest published fare (LPF) Pounds 215 - but a low season
Hamilton ticket is Pounds 120. Some low-cost business fares do circulate,
but they are difficult to find.
In some ways, though, Hamilton does operate like a super bucket shop
clearing house. The supply of low-cost tickets works like this.
An airline employs people called yield controllers whose job is to maximise
its revenue from ticket sales day by day. On their computer screens are a
series of price-related ticket classes which mean nothing to most travellers
and very little to most travel agents. Yield controllers move tickets in and
out of these classes as dictated by shifting demand.
Hamilton negotiates the right to buy tickets from, say, class L, on a
particular airline at an agreed fare. It can extract tickets only from that
class and there is no allocation; Hamilton buys a ticket only when it has
been sold. The airlines bill the company once a month.
Thus, Hamilton has no inventory. This helps keep costs down and wages are
modest: a ticket booker earns a flat Pounds 9,000 a year although this can
rise to Pounds 16,000 with bonuses.
Up to last month, travel agents had always obtained tickets from Hamilton by
'phone, but a new computer system introduced by the company now allows them
to look into Hamilton's software system and book tickets using their own
visual display terminals. Hamilton has just sent out information packs on
this to all 7,500 members of ABTA. Unlicenced bucket shops can still buy
tickets from Hamilton, but not through the automatic computer system.
Issuing discount tickets is well organised; Hamilton distributes its own
20-page fare booklet to travel agents. As a mark of the airlines' paranoia
over offloading tickets in the discount market, they are identified by code
numbers rather than names.
Underlining this element of secrecy, the airlines exert some control on
Hamilton's advertising. You might end up with an Aer Lingus or Iberia
ticket, but you will not see those names in Hamilton advertising.
Only 20 per cent of Hamilton's turnover comes from direct sales to the
public, something it started only at the beginning of this year. Ansell
would like this to rise to 80 per cent, lowering the share of wholesale
ticketing for travel agents to just a fifth.
The reason is simple. 'The more direct sales we have to the public, the more
leverage we have with the airlines. The boot would be on the other foot. We
could go to the airlines and say: 'We'll do the honour of selling your
tickets if you sell them to us at good rates'.'
That is one reason why Ansell wants to get into long-haul flights. 'Because
of the size of retail operations, these effectively have a headlock on the
airlines. In long haul, the big retailers dictate to the airlines.' The
other reason is that when (or if) the good times return, Hamilton Travel
will again find itself starved of short-haul discount tickets by the
carriers. Of course, the price of a discounted ticket is only relative. To
an American, a 55-minute flight from England to Ireland still looks like
daylight robbery at Pounds 110.

THE ROVER in the garage may be insured, but what about the one at your feet?
Pet insurance is the latest product to be given a marketing push by the
insurance industry.
The main danger is not that Tiddles will be grabbed by a cat burglar. The
two biggest costs that can hit a pet owner are veterinary fees and the
liability to others if your pet damages property.
Indeed, under the Dangerous Dogs Act, owners of certain types of dog are
required to have insurance to cover the cost of damages, in case the animal
attacks someone.
But just because you have a loveable labrador does not mean you need to be
without third party insurance. If your dog ran into the road and caused an
accident, for example, you could be liable for the damages. Jardine
Insurance cites a more unusual case of an owner forced to pay compensation
after his dog fell through an office ceiling in the middle of a business
presentation.
According to Jardine, however, by far the most common claims are for vet
fees. Everyday matters such as vaccinations or spaying / castration are not
normally covered; the policies are designed to protect against illnesses or
broken limbs caused in road accidents. These can be expensive. The
Association of British Insurers says that treatment for a broken leg could
cost up to Pounds 300 for a cat and Pounds 1,000 for a dog.
And veterinary medicine has advanced so far these days that a cocker spaniel
even had a pacemaker fitted - at a cost of Pounds 800. More mundane diseases
such as skin complaints can also be expensive to treat.
There are a number of plans on the market. Jardine (021-633-3377) has a
policy called PAWS (Pet Animal Welfare Scheme) which is backed by the RSPCA.
Kate Parminter of the RSPCA says the society is in favour of pet insurance
because it is a sign of responsible animal ownership.
The PAWS plan starts with basic cover for dogs at Pounds 49.75 a year and
Pounds 32.50 for cats. Payments rise for those living in Surrey, west
Sussex, London or Northern Ireland and there is a giant dog supplement of
Pounds 6 for breeds such as great Danes.
Jardine also offers a 'moggies and mongrels' policy for non-pedigree pets at
Pounds 39.95 a year for dogs and Pounds 29.95 for cats.
Petplan (0800-282009) has a basic plan at Pounds 49.95 for dogs with a
Pounds 7.50 discount for cats. More cover can be acquired through the
standard plan (Pounds 57.50 a year) or the supreme plan (Pounds 67.50).
The amount of cover varies per plan but in addition to vet fees and third
party liability, pet owners can also receive: death benefit (if a pedigree
pet is killed); advertising costs if the pet goes missing; and emergency
kennel costs.
For those aged over 60, Age Concern Insurance (0883- 346964) has launched a
special scheme. For an annual premium of Pounds 45 for cats and Pounds 54
for dogs, vet fees are covered up to a total of Pounds 1,250. (Policyholders
must pay the first 10 per cent, with a minimum of Pounds 20.)
In addition, the policy covers boarding kennel fees should you have to go
into hospital, recovery costs if you lose your pet and third party liability
of up to Pounds 2m. Age limits normally apply - the PAWS plan, for example,
will offer new policies to dogs aged between eight weeks and eight years.
Cover is not limited to dogs and cats. Horses, which can involve their
owners in enormous expense, tend to have special policies of their own.
What if you have an exotic pet, such as a snake or a spider? Cliverton
Insurance (0263-860388) specialises in this field, providing cover for
creatures that other insurers (and most people) do not want to touch. Philip
Woodley of Cliverton says he has insured pets as bizarre as Cayman
alligators and scorpions.
But a lot of the company's business comes from exotic birds, which are
popular with thieves. Cover can be expensive; preventing a Pounds 1,000
Norwegian blue from becoming an ex-parrot can cost as much as Pounds 127.50
a year.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Pension has been overpaid
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE been notified by my assurance society that they have overpaid my
pension annuity since commencement in 1988. Although they have said they
will not seek the return of the overpayment, can they reduce the pension
after issuing (and my acceptance of) the policy? They are asking for the
return of the policy document for amendment. Do you advise this?
As a matter of good insurance practice we consider that, where a mistake has
been made in your favour, of a modest amount, then a company should live
with this mistake and continue paying the annuity.
If the mistake is so large that it ought to have been apparent to the
trustees of the scheme or their professional advisers, or to you yourself if
you were the person who was shopping around in the annuity market, then the
solution they are proposing is reasonable.
You should not return the annuity policy as they request pending a fuller
investigation. The annuity market is highly competitive and rates often
change, even among the leading companies, on a weekly basis. It would be all
too easy for an insurance company to underquote its competitors, get the
business and then (as in your case) say: 'Sorry, we've made a mistake and
we're going to correct it.'
In other cases, the mistake might be genuine but the employee in the
insurance company who made it could be trying to cover his own tracks.
If, therefore, you judge that you are being overpaid by only a modest
percentage, then we suggest that you write to the chief executive at the
head office of the insurance company in question, making the points set out
in this reply. If that fails to produce a satisfactory result, you should
write to the insurance ombudsman: Dr Julian Farrand, City Gate One, 135 Park
Street, London SE1 9EA.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Offshore switch
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WE HAVE funds in offshore financial organisations in Guernsey. Is it
permissible to transfer these funds to another offshore financial
organisation, either in Guernsey or elsewhere, and continue to defer paying
income tax on the interest until the total balance is returned to the UK?
You have not given us much to go on. But if neither you nor your wife is
domiciled in any of the three countries of the UK, under English law, then
the answer is probably yes - provided that any transfer of funds from
Guernsey to somewhere else is not routed through the UK.
If, on the other hand, both of you are domiciled in one of the countries of
the UK (not necessarily the same one) and you are both ordinarily resident
in the UK, then the answer is undoubtedly no. Furthermore, it might not be
true that you are able to defer paying UK tax even if you leave the present
investment intact.
Many readers, unfortunately, make it difficult or impossible for us to give
them as helpful a reply as we should wish because - like you - they do not
give us enough precise background facts.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: No fun for fund of funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 'FUND of funds' sounds like the ideal unit trust for the first-time equity
investor.
The average investor is probably bewildered by all the different categories
of unit trust - from UK growth to Australasia, from Japan to international
growth. A 'fund of funds' allows the investor to leave that decision to the
professionals, who select the best trusts from a company's stable in order
to create a nicely diversified portfolio.
However, what sounds good in theory has not worked so well in practice. Not
one of the trusts in the sector has delivered a positive return to investors
over either three or five years. The average 'fund of funds' has delivered a
loss to its unitholders, even with reinvested income, over one, two, three
and five years.
Now Midland Bank has revealed plans to reorganise its Managed Portfolio
trust, the biggest in the sector. Instead of investing in unit trusts the
revamped fund, renamed Midland Balanced, will buy equities directly. As a
consequence, it will be classed in the international balanced sector, rather
than in 'funds of funds'.
So what has gone wrong with the fund of funds concept? The main problem has
been the depressed state of the world's stock markets. Five years ago, in
the summer of 1987, shares were trading at then record levels, in the
expectation of years of continued economic growth. Then came the crash of
October 1987. In the UK, the main share indices are still no higher than
they were five years ago; in Japan, they are considerably lower.
There are few unit trust sectors which can show even half-way decent
performance figures over five years. Just six sectors can boast that an
average trust earned the investor a profit, and in two of those cases, Japan
and north America, the overall return has been under 10 per cent. The best
sector has been gilt &amp; fixed interest, where the average investor has
returned 32.4 per cent over the five years to August 1.
Managers of 'funds of funds' therefore have had the odds stacked against
them.
The only way they could have avoided a loss was by concentrating on a
limited number of sectors. But many managers cannot do so - Lloyds Bank
Mastertrust, for example, is required to hold at least 60 per cent of its
portfolio in UK equities.
Difficulties can also arise from the rule which prevents a 'fund of funds'
from investing more than 20 per cent of its assets in an individual trust.
This limits the manager's options, particularly if, say, he feels that gilts
are going to outperform equities.
Poor performance aside, there is another problem - the scope for double
charging. In some cases, the investor pays an annual management charge to
the 'fund of funds' manager, who in turn is buying units in trusts where a
further annual charge is levied.
At least the investor does not have to pay the manager's initial charge
twice. The 'fund of funds' manager can normally buy units at the creation
price, which is essentially the bid price plus the manager's cost in buying
and selling shares (the market maker's spread, commission etc).
There are 43 'funds of funds' in the sector with a total of about Pounds
770m under management on August 1. The revamp of Midland's Managed
Portfolio, which had Pounds 272.9m under management, will reduce the sector
by over a third.
The size of Midland's fund's increased greatly in 1988, when the group
launched unit trust personal pension plans. Most pension investors like the
implied security and stability of a managed fund. But the result was that
the Midland managed portfolio became the biggest single investor in many of
the bank's unit trusts. If the managed fund then wanted to sell its holding,
that caused terrible problems for the other unit trust managers.
Under Midland's plan, the new Balanced trust will be established and
holdings in Managed Portfolio will be transferred into it (subject, of
course, to unitholders' agreement).
Midland will also take the opportunity to streamline its unit trust range,
with five other trusts (Meridian Growth, Meridian Income, International High
Street, Capital and Smaller Companies) also being absorbed by the Balanced
fund.
Midland says the new Balanced fund will have greater flexibility than before
and expects it to be the flagship of its unit trust range.
Investors will certainly be hoping that the new structure will produce
better performance than the old - Midland Managed Portfolio was bottom of
its sector over three and five years.

ON THE first anniversary of its debut on the UK stock market, directors of
Eurocamp have been taking profits. All five of the executive directors each
sold 50,000 shares at 315p.
Shares in the tent and the mobile home rental group have outperformed the
market by almost 40 per cent since they were floated last year. Interim
results announced last month covered the period to the end of April and, as
such, give little away because of the strong seasonal nature of the
business.
Southern Business Group is another stock to have outperformed the market by
40 per cent over the past year. Paul Roberjot has sold 150,000 shares at 94p
in order to meet a personal tax liability. He bought 100,000 shares in April
last year at 102p.
BPB Industries has featured frequently in this column. Alan Brooks, the
joint managing director, has bought 22,000 shares at 159p.
A week earlier, his colleague Jean-Pierre Cuny had purchased 10,000 at
137.5p. Together with Alan Turner, the chairman and chief executive, these
three have been actively building up their personal holdings since November
last year.
Malcolm Dagul, chairman of Southend Property Holdings, has been accumulating
shares steadily since the company's final results were announced on 22 July
1992. In total he and his colleague John Main have acquired 271,000 shares
at prices ranging from 40.5p to 43p. The net asset value per share was
revealed to be 116p at the year end.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Interest blitz by Revenue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AJ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NON-TAXPAYERS who have registered to receive their interest gross from banks
and building societies should ensure that their income does not exceed their
personal allowances.
The Inland Revenue expressed concern this week that a significant number of
people who have registered are, in fact, taxpayers and will have to revert
to receiving interest net of tax.
Since the gross interest scheme was introduced in April, an estimated 15m
accounts - representing about 7m people - have been registered. To be
eligible, their total income must be less than their personal allowances.
But recent research by the Revenue suggests that up to 1m of these people
actually are taxpayers and should be receiving interest net.
The Revenue is stressing that most who have registered probably have
misunderstood the regulations and have not attempted to defraud its
inspectors. These include:
Pensioners who may have forgotten to include their retirement pensions as
part of their income.
People with several savings accounts who may have thought they could
register to receive gross interest on one account if they had allowances to
cover the interest on it.
The Revenue has begun an 'audit' of people registered to receive interest
gross. It will approach either them or their tax offices for information and
will ask banks and building societies to start paying interest net on any
accounts found to belong to taxpayers. It could also ask for tax owing.
If it finds that someone has made false declarations deliberately and
knowingly, it will also considering levying interest on the tax, fines of up
to Pounds 3,000, and penalties up to the value of the tax not paid.
Anyone who believes they have registered wrongly should notify their tax
office or write to Colin Gillbanks, Inland Revenue Claims Branch, Savings &amp;
Investments (BRT), St John's House, Merton Road, Bootle, Merseyside L69 9BB.
Non-taxpayers registering to receive interest gross should complete form
R85. Details are provided in leaflet IR 110.

FT  15 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Publishers defiant in spite of UBS writ on
Smith
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ESCALATING dispute over the book Accounting for Growth intensified
yesterday when UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the securities house, served a writ on
the book's author and its publisher.
Mr Terry Smith, head of the firm's UK research department who wrote the
book, was suspended on Wednesday for allegedly breaching internal procedures
with regard to the book.
The writ is brought in the name of UBS and four of its UK subsidiaries
against Mr Smith and Random House, which is due to publish the book in
mid-September.
It alleges infringement of copyright, disclosing confidential information
used to help prepare the book, 'passing off' by associating the firm's name
with it, and breach of contract of employment.
Accounting for Growth examines a number of techniques used by large UK
quoted companies which have the effect of producing high earnings figures
and make the balance sheet appear less geared than it is.
UBS said yesterday that Mr Smith did not go through the normal channels,
including clearing the book through the firm's own editorial committee and
sending copies to the companies mentioned to check for accuracy.
Mr Smith said yesterday: 'I have no intention of withdrawing the
publication. I have signed a contract and I can't possibly back down.'
Random House said it was going ahead with publication. 'We are confident and
we are going to contest the writ vigorously,' a spokeswoman said.
The book is due to be published on September 15 for Pounds 25. However, it
is understood that a paperback version could be ready for sale as soon as
next week for Pounds 12.99.
The name of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, which was printed on the front cover of the
book below Mr Smith's name, will be removed.
Reports of the book published in the Mail on Sunday newspaper and in
Accountancy Age, a specialist magazine, led to complaints to UBS from Grand
Metropolitan, which was named as using more of the techniques than any other
company.
The report triggered complaints from Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman of
GrandMet, to Mr Rudi Mueller, chairman of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.

FT  15 AUG 92 / UK Company News: End in sight of the paint pot battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOSTILE BIDS are supposed to contain a fair amount of sabre-rattling, but
last week Kalon's bid for Manders (Holdings) produced what might be better
described as penknife-waving.
Earlier in the bid process the rival paint makers had skirmished fitfully,
if not always fruitfully, over management achievements, relative corporate
performances, competition claims and other meaty industrial issues. Day 39
was delayed, came and went, as did the interim results of both sides.
Suddenly a financial molehill, revealed in a circular written by Mr Tim
Steer for James Capel, has expanded into a mountain of hot air and
did/didn't/did/didn'ts. The crux was an Pounds 800,000 provision made by
Manders 'relating to Windeck', the own-label paint business bought for
Pounds 5.66m in December.
Kalon - which had received some local and political stick for saying it
would close the factory - fired off a list of four questions about the
provision and whether and when Manders had intended to close Windeck's
Bingley factory.
Shareholders' minds will focus on the fundamentals this coming week as
Friday's final closing date approaches.

FT  15 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Pressures that threaten to breach the
Chinese Wall - Why independent advice from analysts is being questioned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS PAID Pounds 1bn in commissions to their City stockbrokers last
year. Judging by the row that broke out at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew this week,
they may not be getting very good value for their money.
Mr Terry Smith, Phillips &amp; Drew's head of research, was suspended after a
row with his employers which throws a spotlight on the independence of
analysts in investment banks.
Compared to many analysts, Mr Smith has always been relatively outspoken and
has never been afraid to criticise the companies he researched. At BZW, he
caused severe embarrassment to the management of Barclays five years ago by
saying that the bank's shares were over-valued.
The cause of the latest dispute is a book Mr Smith was preparing for
publication which highlights the accounting techniques used by UK companies
to boost the level of profits they disclose or minimise the level of
borrowings shown in the balance sheet.
Phillips &amp; Drew became embarrassed by reports about the book which appeared
in the Mail on Sunday newspaper and Accountancy Age, the magazine, last
month. These articles highlighted Grand Metropolitan, the drinks and leisure
group, as using more of the accounting techniques than any other company -
though there was no implication that GrandMet was doing anything improper.
Nonetheless, Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman of GrandMet, which is a banking
client of UBS, was so annoyed that he complained to Mr Rudi Mueller,
chairman of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew and head of UBS's UK operations.
Mr Smith says there was a separate complaint from Sir Colin Marshall, who is
a non-executive director of GrandMet. Sir Colin is also chief executive of
British Airways, to which Phillips &amp; Drew is joint stockbroker. British
Airways yesterday refused to comment on the incident.
Phillips &amp; Drew insists that Mr Smith's suspension 'was purely for
misconduct on procedural grounds. It has nothing to do with anything else.'
This unholy row has done little to restore investors' confidence in the
quality of research published by full-service investment banks. Analysts are
supposed to be insulated by so-called Chinese Walls from influence from
other parts of a bank. But as Mr Smith said: 'The Chinese Wall fell on me'.
There have been rumbles before that outspoken analysts have been called to
heel. Last summer Mr Derek Terrington, a media analyst, left Phillips &amp; Drew
to join Kleinwort Benson after the late Mr Robert Maxwell complained of a
circular which told investors not to invest in Mirror Group Newspapers. And
BZW withdrew a proposed research note after companies including Fisons,
Cable and Wireless and British Airways, complained of inaccuracies and
misrepresentation.
Conflicts of interest are nothing new for analysts. They are under constant
pressure to encourage investors to buy or sell shares - the only way they
can generate their commissions. Also, they can be subjected to fierce
assault from companies they criticise.
One analyst who had a run-in this year with a company in the FT-SE 100 index
recalls: 'It was a nightmare. They put more and more pressure on you. Thank
goodness my firm stood by me.'
The analyst, who says he is afraid of retaliation from the company if he is
named, says the company threatened to sue him for libel; hinted that it
would cut off contact, depriving him of the information needed to do his
job; and tried to persuade senior executives of his firm to disown him.
Even before the Big Bang of 1986, firms offered advice both to companies, as
their corporate brokers, and to investors who bought their shares. As a
result, much of the research published by companies' own brokers is
automatically disregarded by investors.
Two things, however, have intensified the pressure - and made the quality of
research more questionable. One is the creation of all-purpose investment
banks, multiplying the potential for conflicts of interest. The other is the
squeeze on profits in the City, which has made independence a very expensive
luxury indeed.
Research departments account for one of the biggest costs of an industry
which is still carrying overheads more suited to the heady days of the 1980s
bull markets than the bearish 1990s. The average level of trading each day
by investors - and hence the commissions earned by brokers - declined by
around 40 per cent between 1987 and 1990.
One result is that analysts are being made to earn their keep by advising
investment banks' corporate clients. That raises doubts about their
impartiality when they come to advise investors on those companies.
Another result is that analysts, being a cost rather than a source of
income, are not expected to rock the boat. All investment banks argue that
their research departments are totally free to steer their own course, and
that it would be extreme folly to try to interfere with their judgments. But
in straightened times, such high-minded thoughts can often be forgotten.

FT  15 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Burns-Anderson shares suspended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BURNS-ANDERSON, the recruitment and financial services group formerly
chaired by Sir John Harvey-Jones, had dealings in its shares suspended at 2p
yesterday, pending clarification of its financial position.
The group, which recorded pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.74m in 1991, has been
in negotiations with its bankers, which include National Westminster,
pending an extraordinary general meeting on Tuesday . The group's net assets
had dropped to less than half the value of its share capital.
Burns-Anderson is the holding company for the country's third largest
network of independent financial advisers, Burns-Anderson Independent
Network.
Mr Alan Taylor, managing director of the network, which has 375 members
registered with Fimbra, the self-regulatory organisation for IFAs, said
yesterday that his company was financially 'ringfenced' from the group.
There were no cross guarantees and there could be no call on his company's
assets were the group to go into liquidation.
Fimbra said yesterday that it was watching the situation closely.
Most of the company's problems have been caused by a downturn in business in
the group's recruitment companies, Morson International and Burns-Anderson
Recruitment.
Sir John Harvey-Jones, former chairman of ICI and renowned troubleshooter,
was on the Burns-Anderson board between June 1987 and March 1991.
The company fell into loss in 1989-90.

AFTER AN upsurge in the first half Portmeirion Potteries is expecting a
satisfactory result for 1992, although a return to the 1990 pre-tax profit
level of Pounds 3.4m is unlikely.
In the six months ended June 30 pre-tax profit came to Pounds 1.42m, an
advance of 40.5 per cent over the depressed Pounds 1.01m. That was affected
by short time working and reorganisation costs, but at the end of 1991 the
profit had reached Pounds 2.61m.
Turnover rose 18.5 per cent to Pounds 10.4m.
Earnings per share worked through at 8.89p (6.47p) and the interim dividend
is again 2.25p.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Plenty of room at the Hotel UK: Occupancy rates are at their
lowest levels for more than 10 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nearly all of Mr Dries de Vaal's 30 British hotels are trading at a profit.
Management has been streamlined. The company has driven down costs.
Unfortunately for the gloom-laden UK hotel industry, this good news does not
come from a hotelier. Mr de Vaal is a partner with accountants and
management consultants Touche Ross. All the hotels his firm controls are in
receivership.
Touche Ross calculates that 125 UK hotels went into administration or
receivership last year. By the end of last month, this year's figure had
already reached 93.
Although Touche Ross can take the credit for the reduced costs and
streamlined management of the hotels under its control, most of them were
trading profitably when they went into receivership.
It was not the plunge in occupancy rates which began with the run-up to the
Gulf war and has continued with the recession that drove the hotels out of
business, although that has certainly not helped. Instead, they fell victim
to the grandiose ambitions of the 1980s and the high debts incurred to
accomplish them.
Owners of single hotels have suffered far more than the larger hotel
companies.
'The main established groups did not buy at inflated prices. They were much
wiser,' Mr de Vaal says.
One of the survivors, Mr Jonathan Hassell, owner of the 10-room Red House
Hotel in Torquay, says that in the pre-recession years, 'there were many
people who moved to seaside resorts and bought modest hotels. These were
people who had not necessarily been in the hotel industry, but the banks and
building societies had a great tendency to lend to them.'
Many country house hotels were also taken over by debt-laden novices.
Mr de Vaal says: 'Hotels were trading hands at values that were too high and
could not be justified by the income streams that were being generated even
before the recession.'
As property values have fallen, lending institutions have called in the
receivers in the hope that something of the business can be salvaged and
buyers found.
It was not just buying hotels which loaded their owners with debt. UK
hoteliers, both new and experienced, borrowed to upgrade and improve their
facilities during the 1980s to meet raised expectations of guests. Mr Derek
Brown, editor of the Michelin guide, earlier this year paid tribute to UK
hotels for raising standards while maintaining or even cutting prices.
Mr Hassell, who is also chairman of the hotel panel of the British
Hospitality Association (BHA), which represents hoteliers, caterers and
restaurateurs, says: 'Standards of hotel furnishings went up during the
pre-recession years. Some would even say they went over the top. I've been
in the business for a long time and I'm more cautious.'
Despite their financial difficulties, Mr de Vaal describes the operational
management of the hotels that have gone into receivership as 'middling to
good'. He adds: 'Nine times out of 10 we keep the existing management team
in place. We take on the role of area manager. We advise them on their
marketing and make decisions on their capital expenditure requirements.'
Buyers for UK hotels are not easy to find. The large hotel groups are
looking elsewhere. Forte, the UK's largest hotel company, is intent on
enlarging its continental European presence. Last April, the Rank
Organisation put 22 hotels on the market, but has so far only sold two small
ones. Mr de Vaal says that between January and May, Touche Ross sold eight
hotels.
Hoteliers whose finances allow them to remain in business say there is no
sign of an upturn. Most report sharply reduced occupancies. The Horwath
leisure consulting group says that hotel occupancy in England during the
first quarter of this year was the lowest since 1980. Occupancy ranged from
30 per cent in January to 45 per cent in April.
Mr Trevor Forecast, owner of the Congham Hall Country House Hotel in Kings
Lynn, Norfolk, says business travel has fallen away sharply. Instead of
holding meetings at his hotel, senior managers are communicating by
conference telephone call. Mr Forecast says he knows of a company whose
senior managers fly from around the world to one airport, hold their meeting
and then fly home. Occupancy at his hotel is currently about 55 per cent,
compared to 75 per cent two years ago. The mix of guests has also changed.
Whereas his customers used to be evenly split between business and leisure
guests, the latter now account for 75 per cent.
Mr Forecast, who chairs the BHA's East Anglia divisional committee, says
coastal hotels are faring even worse. 'While car park numbers are up, the
spend in hotels and restaurants has come down. People are coming for the day
and sitting on the beach eating their sandwiches.'
Some of the options open to manufacturing companies during a recession are
not available to a hotel owner. Staff can only be reduced by so much before
guests begin to complain. Rooms and facilities cannot be allowed to look too
shabby in a market where customers are more discriminating than ever.
Many hoteliers have kept room rates at the same level as last year - a cut
in real terms. Others are offering more drastic reductions, but Mr Forecast
believes these are best avoided. 'Offering two nights for the price of one
and other heavy discounts is just a way of going broke more quickly, in my
opinion,' he says.
As difficult as business is, some hoteliers believe the only way to survive
the recession is to invest even more.
The 51-room St Brannocks Hotel in Newquay, Cornwall, says it has enjoyed
average occupancies of between 80 and 90 per cent this year. Mrs Gill
Merrell, who runs the hotel with her husband and daughter, says the key to
its high occupancy level has been a willingness to send coaches to pick up
guests from almost anywhere in the UK.
The hotel has offered coach travel to its guests for several years, but
previously used outside contractors' vehicles and drivers. Last February,
however, it decided to spend Pounds 150,000 on two coaches of its own.
Direct control of the coaches and drivers helps to ensure higher standards
of customer service, Mrs Merrell says. 'The most important things for us are
repeat business and recommended business.'
But even for hotels that can afford to invest, better service and facilities
are not a panacea.
'What we've done means we've been able to hold our own,' Mrs Merrell says.
'We're still working longer and harder for less. That's the simple truth.'

FT  15 AUG 92 / Letter: UN need for a disaster relief office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN SAUNDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Julian Ozanne writes (Personal View, August 10) that 'for several years
there has been a suggestion that a well-funded disaster relief office be set
up at the UN.' As a consultant to the secretary-general in 1987 I made such
a proposal, intended as a first step in the establishment of a permanent,
powerful body, under the authority of the secretary-general, to lead the
world's action on disasters. I made other suggestions on how the UN could be
ahead of emergencies, as far as possible, abandoning the method of ad hoc
response after the event which had been standard procedure, and sadly still
is.
My proposal was hardly novel, being based on the UN experience of
humanitarian operations, gained over many years, and not least through my
friend, the late Sir Robert Jackson, probably the greatest leader in
humanitarian emergencies the UN, and indeed the world, has ever had. There
were also the remarkable achievements of Maurice Strong and Bradford Morse,
organisers of the widely acclaimed UN office for emergency operations in
Africa. The secretary-general did not adopt my main recommendations, no
doubt because he considered that the member governments were not ready to
face up to the implications for international organisations.
Julian Ozanne's many other proposals have already been put forward by
experts over the years. The actions required have long been understood. What
we do not have are decisions, which must be by member governments through
the UN. If governments will not act, the secretary-general can try to
persuade.
An ironic footnote to Mr Ozanne's main suggestion is that the new
secretary-general did indeed appoint a disaster relief co-ordinator, Mr Jan
Eliasson, on March 1 this year, as part of the re-organisation of the UN.
Given the problem I describe, Mr Eliasson has hardly been heard from, not
surprisingly since he will not have had an opportunity to play a significant
role in the terrible problem of Somalia.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Letter: Suffering of Olympic athletes - ancient and modern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr STEPHEN INSTONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I wonder if the modern Olympics are in essence so very different from
the ancient Olympics. Nicholas Woodsworth has twice suggested that they are,
most recently in his piece 'Marathon a sell-out to commercialism' (August
8), where he suggests that the suffering of the marathon runners at
Barcelona was alien to the ideals of Olympic competition.
It is not immediately clear whose ideals, or what ideals, he is referring
to, but there is plenty of evidence to suggest that ancient Greek athletes
suffered just as much, perhaps more, than modern ones, and that the idea
that the modern Olympics are a corrupt departure from some higher ancient
standard is unfounded.
Pausanias (2nd century AD) tells the following story about Arrachion, a
competitor in the ancient Greek Olympics in the pankration (a brutal mixture
of boxing, wrestling, and general fighting, in which gouging the eyes and
biting were forbidden but anything else allowed):
'Arrachion's opponent caught him, held him in a scissors grip and at the
same time throttled him with his hands; so Arrachion broke one of the man's
toes. Arra chion died by strangling, but not before the strangler gave in
from the pain in his toe.'
Arrachion was the winner - but dead.
The idea that ancient athletes did not have financial motives is also
questionable. The Athenian statesman Solon (probably early 6th century)
awarded Athenian victors in the Olympics 500 drachmas; it is difficult to
evaluate this sum, but rape was punished by a fine of 100 drachmas and five
drachmas were awarded to anyone who brought into the city a wolf.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Letter: Innovation the answer to competitive pressures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr IAN C WYLIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, While we obviously have sympathy with Titan Forge and Cornwell &amp; O'Neil
(UK News, gate-painting photo caption, August 12), the situation they and
many more British businesses are now being forced to face has long been the
reality among our international competitors.
In Japan, for instance, inflationary price increases have been almost
impossible for a number of years due to the intense local competition.
Nevertheless, employees have become used to annual pay increases of almost
double the 2 to 3 per cent inflation rate.
Management has had to adopt two main survival routes - to innovate, hence
commanding better margins for a short period, and to reduce costs/increase
productivity. This really forces a proactive management style, and survival
of the fittest among the middle and lower size companies that make up the
majority of the market.
The extra problem in Europe at the moment is of course the high cost of
money. This is a major deflationary factor which has to be addressed by the
EC as a whole, not just the UK. When recently applied in Japan, higher
interest rates not only cooled an overheating economy, but drastically
reduced growth which will cause further deflationary problems for some time
to come.

   From Mr LAWRENCE SMITH

<TEXT>
Sir, I agree entirely with Samuel Brittan's article on training (Economic
Viewpoint, August 13). However, while the 'credentialist fad' is clearly out
of control in the US and probably more so in Japan, it does have a more
subtle effect. It ensures that training and education are important,
desirable and socially acceptable - which for most of the 83 per cent of the
British workforce without degrees is not the case. For them training is an
occupational hazard, to be taken as quickly as possible, to be forgotten
soon after and avoided wherever possible.
Before training becomes effective, there must be a desire by the participant
to acquire and to use the new skills and information. Otherwise, training in
whatever guise will not benefit anyone.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Battle for Salzburg's soul: A more modern festival is
emerging
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You can still pay up to Dollars 350 (Pounds 183) for an opera performance in
Salzburg this summer, but the choice may be Janacek or Messiaen rather than
Mozart and Strauss. You can still dress in black tie or put on your
favourite tiara, but don't be surprised to find scruffy students and
tourists in the same block of seats.
Salzburg is undergoing an identity crisis. Gone is the extravagant
conservatism of the past quarter-century, when Herbert von Karajan - the
conductor and Salzburg's most famous son after Mozart - presided over its
world-renowned festival.
In its place comes a bolder, more contemporary creed preached by Gerard
Mortier, a loquacious, idealistic Belgian who - as incoming artistic
director - wants to transform the festival's character and bring in a new
public. You can already sense the difference: the atmosphere is less formal,
the audience looks younger. There are fewer stars than before and more empty
seats.
No one doubted the need for change. Critics and commentators believed the
festival had become too elitist and money-oriented. But Salzburg has got
more than it bargained for. Mortier, who made his name with adventurous
opera programming in Brussels, has introduced new and unfamiliar works - to
which Salzburg's traditional audiences have proved resistant. He has engaged
stage directors like Peter Sellars and the Herrmanns, whose radical style is
anathema to the festival's older supporters. He has laid particular emphasis
on the younger generation, awarding the prestigious opening concert to the
Gustav Mahler Youth Orchestra and handing out tickets to students for as
little as Dollars 9.
Mortier couches his programme in lofty philosophical terms, proclaiming
Salzburg as a 'utopia of the new Europe', a cradle of aesthetic
internationalism - a far cry from the pure Germanic tradition on which the
festival once thrived.
Coming from an outsider, this kind of talk makes locals nervous. For much of
the year Salzburg is little more than a quiet, provincial, Austrian town. In
the postwar era it prospered from the festival's up-market status and its
ability to attract swarms of summer visitors. It is suspicious of anyone
trying to graft an alien personality on to its contented Austrian face.
Many festival-goers are prepared to allow Mortier a honeymoon, and some of
his innovations have been enthusiastically received. The appointment of
Peter Stein as drama director, for example, allowed spoken theatre to resume
the central role it had when Hugo von Hofmannsthal and Max Reinhardt founded
the festival in the 1920s. Stein's production of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar
was the popular hit of the opening week this summer, and there will be a
wider selection of drama next year.
Mortier's contemporary music programme is another welcome contrast to the
Karajan years, when living composers received little more than a token nod.
And Salzburg is at last able to hear the baroque and classical repertoire in
state-of-the-art performances by Nikolaus Harnoncourt, William Christie and
other period-instrument specialists. Harnoncourt, an
internationally-renowned Austrian whom Karajan excluded from the festival,
made his debut two weeks ago with a revelatory Missa Solemnis, and will
conduct a Monteverdi opera next year.
Despite these gains - and the continued presence of Solti, Abbado and other
leading conductors - there is a strong undercurrent of resistance to the new
regime. What irks Mortier's opponents is not just the substance of his
programme - the feeling that he is trying to do too much too soon - but also
his outspoken style.
In a series of press interviews, he has trodden on local sensibilities and
alienated sections of the music industry. He accused the major record
companies of using 'mafia tactics' to influence casting during the Karajan
era, and spoke of 'evil people' who exploited their relationship with the
conductor to his dying day. The Karajan estate promptly threatened legal
action, and the mayor of Salzburg called an emergency meeting of the
festival's supervisory body, saying Mortier's statements could cause
irreparable damage.
Mortier has also had a run-in with the local business community. Reacting to
claims that his programme had caused a drop in trade, he told Salzburg's
shopkeepers and hoteliers it was time they started doing something for the
festival 'instead of always milking it'. He also lectured councillors on how
to make better year-round use of Salzburg's facilities, and called on the
city to co-operate with Brussels-based cultural programmes promoted by the
European Community.
Mortier cannot afford to alienate too many people. Ten days before the start
of the festival, Riccardo Muti stormed out of a new production of Mozart's
La clemenza di Tito, claiming the staging by Karl-Ernst and Ursel Herrmann
was an offence to Mozart's music. Although Muti was by no means blameless,
the Tito fracas has been billed as a struggle between the old and the new at
Salzburg. The Italian star conductor has been a festival favourite since
1971: he owns a house in the community where Karajan lived, and talks of the
need to respect festival traditions established by great conductors of the
past.
Muti's supporters include the Vienna Philharmonic, one of the festival's
main power-brokers and a guarantor of its musical standards. So far the
orchestra has co-operated with Mortier, but it has voiced misgivings about
the quality of some guest orchestras he has invited.
Sponsors must also be kept happy: Mortier has signed a five-year agreement
with Nestle, Asea Brown-Boveri and Allianz, who will provide Dollars 2m each
year. And the festival's Friends Organisation must be restocked, after the
defection of rich Karajan loyalists.
Several of the most important events of Mortier's opening season take place
in the final two weeks, beginning tonight with the first of six Boulez
concerts. Monday sees the premiere of Sellars' staging of Messiaen's Saint
Francois d'Assise. Modern interpretations of Strauss and Mozart operas
follow later in the week.
Mortier is hoping these will provide a popular mandate for change and
silence his conservative critics. A battle for the soul of the festival is
under way.

Sir, The Skipton Building Society increased its mortgage rate and the media
immediately takes the opportunity to milk the gloomy aspects of the news.
Your own Lex column (August 12) is no exception. 'Mere talk of possible
higher rates . . . depress further market confidence', and 'Nor does the
foreign exchange market relish reminders . . .'
The truth of the situation may be more to do with market position, financial
strength and the need for competition. The Skipton recently fell from 2nd to
17th in the UBS Phillips &amp; Drew review of the top 20 building societies. It
may just be that investors will require a slightly higher rate of interest
to compensate for the perceived greater risk.
Ten days ago Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, which was rated number one in the same
survey, reduced its interest rate on its popular London Share Account from
10.4 per cent to 10 per cent. Hardly newsworthy]

FT  15 AUG 92 / Man in the News: King of diamonds - Julian Ogilvie Thompson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman of De Beers, the South African company
that controls the world diamond market, spent yesterday in the Northern
Transvaal. It should have been a happy outing, attending the opening of De
Beers' new R1.1bn (Pounds 200m) Venetia mine, a project which should produce
5.9m carats of diamonds a year.
He could have been forgiven, however, if the prospect of more diamonds had
left him feeling slightly queasy. With unfortunate timing, the opening
coincided with what was probably the worst week for De Beers since the
collapse of the diamond market in 1981-82.
Tuesday's announcement from the board, meeting in Kimberley, that there
would probably be a 'substantial reduction' in the final dividend did not
only knock about 18 per cent off the share price but also precipitated a
heavy fall in the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. It led to accusations that De
Beers had misled the market, thus dealing a blow to the credibility of one
of South Africa's best-known companies.
The patrician, self-assured Ogilvie Thompson, also chairman of the Anglo
American mining house and its offshore associate Minorco, may be the world's
most powerful mining executive, but he will have been ill-prepared for the
assault unleashed on his judgment and that of De Beers. Both in
Johannesburg, and to a lesser extent offshore, there has been widespread
criticism of the handling of the dividend cut.
De Beers sought to defend itself with a statement on Thursday which starts:
'The allegations that De Beers has lost credibility are unfair and
ill-founded.' Later in the statement, Ogilvie Thompson adds: 'Our
credibility hinges on our being honest and I believe that is exactly what we
have been . . . it was precisely because we did not want to mislead the
market that we warned of a final dividend cut.'
There is little sympathy for this reasoning in Johannesburg. When things are
going well, people are prepared to tolerate the high-handed behaviour for
which De Beers and Anglo are noted. But when a bitter pill is to be
delivered, companies need better investor relations than those enjoyed by De
Beers and Ogilvie Thompson if a hostile reaction is to be avoided.
The nub of the problem is that until early July, Ogilvie Thompson continued
to predict higher rough diamond sales by the Central Selling Organisation
(CSO) - the De Beers organisation which markets about 80 per cent of the
world's rough diamonds - in the second half of 1992. Although these bullish
sentiments were at odds with market signals, most observers chose to allow
De Beers the benefit of the doubt, given the company's record of accurate
forecasting.
But Tuesday's announcement indicated that De Beers had got it wrong. The
dividend cut and the imposition of quotas, whereby the CSO buys 25 per cent
less than its contractual commitment from producers, reflect the extent of
the error. The board said two factors - which only became fully apparent in
mid-July - combined to stymie their earlier forecast: flat demand, when an
economic upturn was expected, accentuated by the 'precipitous plunge' in
Tokyo's Nikkei index; and the 'sudden and unprecedented explosion' in the
supply of illicit diamonds from Angola.
Some industry analysts do not believe the outlook for the market could have
changed as quickly as De Beers suggests. Of the two factors mentioned, there
is sympathy for the Angolan problem, but little for wrongly predicting an
economic upturn.
Critics suggest that De Beers should not have been so bullish. Part of the
reason why De Beers' announcement was greeted by such a furore this week is
that Anglo and De Beers are famous for their conservative financial
orientation. Ogilvie Thompson exemplifies this conservative culture. Son of
a former Chief Justice of South Africa, and a Rhodes scholar, he has grown
up in the image of the Oppenheimer family, following Harry Oppenheimer,
whose personal assistant he was for four years, to become chairman of the
two groups. Like his predecessor at De Beers, he has cultivated an
exquisitely polite, highly Anglicised manner - reflected in his preferences
for French wines, shooting and fishing.
His manner and tastes sit uneasily in the rough and tumble business world of
Johannesburg. Though his ability and voracious work appetite are
acknowledged, many in the South African investment community are riled by a
regal manner which is too obviously a 'cut above' for many people's taste.
He is regarded as the personification of Anglo's arrogance: 'that arrogance
that people come to Anglo, Anglo doesn't go the people,' in the words of one
observer.
There has been a simple reason for the stand-offishness - De Beers and Anglo
have been financially self-sufficient, neither having had a rights issue.
Neither has, therefore, needed the investment community, which they have
kept at arm's length. Complex interlocking shareholdings, pivotally
controlled by the Oppenheimer family, have also put the companies beyond the
reach of corporate raiders.
This week's controversy has again raised questions about the quality of
management at Anglo. The question is also being asked whether Ogilvie
Thompson isn't spreading himself too thinly by being chairman,
simultaneously, of three large companies.
Pressure is also mounting for improved disclosure from De Beers. Investors
are prepared to accept secrecy when De Beers gets things right, but not when
it gets things wrong.
At the Venetia opening yesterday, Harry Oppenheimer conceded that De Beers
was facing 'grave, immediate difficulties'. He went on, though, to say that
these are 'the sort that we understand and have faced successfully at many
times in the past'. Unfortunately, he was not talking about investor
relations. Ogilvie Thompson may find it harder to rebuild trust with
investors than to bring supply and demand back into equilibrium in the
diamond market - though achieving the latter would doubtless help the
former.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Pressure builds for action: Political tension over the
economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major's instinct is to tough it out. As he left earlier this month
for a summer break in Spain, colleagues detected irritation at the clamour
from some Tory MPs for emergency action to tackle the recession.
But the prime minister retains the sharp political instincts which
catapulted him into Downing Street above more senior rivals. If the clamour
from a minority in his party threatens to turn into a revolt by the
majority, he will be ready to act.
There is no question of devaluation. If anything, the calls from some Tory
backbenchers for a sterling realignment in the ERM have hardened Mr Major's
resolve. If others - the Italians, for instance - decided to move down
against the D-Mark, sterling's central rate would remain fixed at DM2.95.
But ministers are careful to add that within the constraints of the ERM and
the government's commitment to keep a tight grip on public spending, the
prime minister has an open mind on possible schemes to speed recovery.
The view in 10 Downing Street is that a modest package of measures which
bolstered consumer confidence might, just might, prove useful. But with the
emphasis on 'modest', the presentation and the politics would be as
important as the substance.
At present the political pressures are uncomfortable rather than
irresistible. However, ministers have been surprised at the
independent-mindedness of the new intake of Tory MPs, many of whom are cool
towards the prime minister's vision of Britain 'at the heart of Europe' and
are less content to be lobby fodder than their predecessors. The distance
between the government and some of the parliamentary rank and file has been
demonstrated by the critical stance towards government economic policy of Mr
John Townend, the new chairman of the Tory backbench finance committee.
In the approach to October's party conference, most Tory MPs and grassroots
activists are torn between dismay that the promised post-election recovery
has not materialised and an acknowledgement that public squabbling could
undermine confidence still further.
A small but vocal minority of die-hard Euro-sceptics is determined to link
the recession with membership of the ERM and Mr Major's support for
Maastricht. With Lady Thatcher in the lead, they threaten at least the
appearance of serious disarray in the party.
Ministers hope that less gloomy economic statistics next month and a French
'yes' vote on Maastricht will defuse the political tensions. But they are
acknowledging also that no one will yet rule out a pre-conference move to
bolster consumer confidence and calm the nerves of the Tory faithful.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Much ado about doing nothing: Peter Norman examines the
economic options facing the UK government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Norman Lamont finally got away on holiday this week, leaving behind a
chorus of demands for action to revive Britain's recession-bound economy.
Over the past three weeks, bankers, industrialists and, more predictably,
trade unionists and the Labour Party have clamoured for the government to
'do something' to end the longest recession since the second world war. The
proferred prescriptions - to 'kick start' the housing market, stimulate
investment, lower interest rates and even devalue the pound - have been as
varied as their promotors.
In spite of rising unemployment, falling business confidence and a growing
fear that declining industrial orders will lead the economy into a new
nosedive after the summer, the Treasury's instinct is to do nothing.
Officials draw comfort from falling inflationary pressures and faint signs
of rising manufacturing output. They argue that the business cycle will
gradually recover from its present 'corrugated bottom' once consumers gain
sufficient confidence to spend more.
But the do-nothing approach sits ill with political realities. The mandarins
of Great George Street are as aware as the prime minister and chancellor
that Tory back benchers are restive, the constituency parties grumpy, and
that plans must be made to head off dissent at the party conference in
Brighton in October.
So, despite denials, officials are sifting options for action, more, it has
to be said, in the hope of achieving a presentational success than actually
changing the course of the economy.
In fact, the government's hands are largely tied. It has hardly any monetary
leeway so long as it sticks to its goal of low and, if possible, zero
inflation through membership of the European exchange rate mechanism. Short
term interest rates are determined by the Bundesbank where there is little
hope of a fall in the all important Lombard rate from its present 9.75 per
cent much before the end of this year. With the UK's 1992-93 public sector
borrowing requirement expected to exceed the targeted Pounds 28bn and some
pundits projecting a further rise to about Pounds 40bn the following year,
there appears little scope for fiscal activism.
The so-called 'nuclear' options of withdrawal from the ERM or devaluation of
sterling can be ruled out so long as Mr Major and Mr Lamont are neighbours
in Downing Street.
The only conceivable basis for such a policy change would be if a French
'No' to Maastricht on September 20 triggered monetary chaos in Europe,
leading to a collapse of the ERM: a turn of events that would in any case
pose serious problems for the prime minister during the UK presidency of the
European Community.
A review of the possible domestic policy moves also shows that there are no
easy choices. Even the much touted option of a temporary cut in value added
tax from its present 17.5 per cent rate to stimulate consumption has weighty
downside elements. According to its supporters, a VAT cut:
would tackle directly the economy's main problem of sluggish consumer
demand,
could be implemented without delay,
would exert further downwards pressure on retail price inflation, so
improving the climate for eventual interest rate cuts once Germany's policy
eases, and,
would act as an effective substitute for lower interest rates at home. Like
an interest rate cut, a VAT reduction would lower costs for consumers and
businesses and reduce the attractions of saving but have the additional
advantage of not undermining sterling on foreign exchange markets.
However, VAT reductions are expensive. Treasury figures suggest that a six
month VAT reduction to 15 per cent would cost around Pounds 2.5bn to Pounds
2.6bn - a heavy burden at a time of budgetary restraint.
High costs and a strong objection to additional subsidies for home owners
were an important reason why the Treasury reacted with such hostility to
recent suggestions from the Abbey National and National Westminster Bank for
new tax breaks to help the housing market. But this does not mean that no
thought is being given to schemes to boost housing.
One no-cost option would be to change building society regulations so that
credit-worthy house buyers could borrow more than the value of their planned
home purchase. This could help people at present prevented from moving
because of negative equity in their existing homes as a result of falling
house prices. But whether house buyers would take advantage of such a scheme
when house prices are still falling, or whether building society managers
would have the necessary skills to assess credit worthiness in the absence
of full collateral is open to doubt.
There is support in parts of Whitehall for institutional reforms and supply
side measures to improve the economy. Some ideas, such as giving
independence to the Bank of England, could bring long term benefits by
enhancing the credibility of the government's counter inflation policy. But
it is difficult to see such a proposal bringing the party faithful to their
feet in Brighton while a short term risk would surely be that a newly
independent central bank could be inclined to push interest rates higher to
establish its credibility with financial markets.
Another suggestion is that the government should abandon its rule of fully
funding the government borrowing requirement, which requires it to sell its
debt entirely outside the banking and building society sectors. Advocates
say 'underfunding' could lower long-term interest rates. But the supposed
benefits are a subject of dispute among experts and would hardly have voter
appeal.
Some serious thought will be given to bringing forward already agreed
spending on public sector projects as a way of helping the hard pressed
construction industry. Ministers are acutely conscious that local builders
are often local constituency party stalwarts. A few well-timed announcements
would also add strength to the nascent government campaign to clamp down on
public sector pay.
But the general belief in Whitehall is that such moves can only help at the
margin. The emergence of recovery - just like the course of the recession -
will ultimately depend on the behaviour of Britain's consumers.
Here recent trends have made Treasury ministers and officials more confident
that a recovery of sorts is in the pipeline. Yesterday's unexpectedly good
inflation figures, coupled with a sharp deceleration in wage inflation in
recent months, augur well for Britain's long-term competitiveness.
In the meantime, Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary to the
Treasury, claims that in real terms a family of four with a Pounds 30,000
mortgage and on average earnings should be Pounds 35 per week better off
than at the time of ERM entry in October 1990.
If true, that is, as one Whitehall official said this week, 'big bucks'. If
that mythical family of four can be persuaded to part with some of its
gains, Britain's economy may lift off the bottom without overt government
help.

AN EXPLOSIVES worker who resigned when she was told her wages would be cut
by Pounds 10 a week was awarded more than Pounds 6,300 compensation by an
industrial tribunal yesterday.
Mrs Janette Elliot, chief quality inspector at Brock's Explosives, Sanquhar,
Dumfries and Galloway, was given 24 hours to sign a letter agreeing to the
wage cut or lose her job. Mrs Elliot, who earned Pounds 162 a week,
considered the matter overnight and resigned.
The tribunal heard there was no consultation whatsoever about the change.
The company, which did not attend the hearing, said it had a legal right to
vary her wages without her consent.
She was justified in leaving, the tribunal decided, because the company's
action was a unilateral breach of her contract carried out in demeaning and
humiliating circumstances amounting to unfair dismissal.
The letter made clear the company was fully aware her consent to the change
was necessary and that it was determined to push it through with or without
her consent.

An African National Congress inquiry into charges that dissidents were
tortured by ANC officials has uncovered 'shocking abuses,' a newspaper
reported yesterday, AP reports from Johannesburg.
The Weekly Mail said it learned from unidentified sources that the probe
into alleged abuses at ANC camps in other African countries put much of the
blame on former ANC security chief Mzwai Piliso.
'ANC's torture chief named,' said the newspaper's front-page headline. The
anti-apartheid Weekly Mail is widely seen as South Africa's leading
investigative paper and has uncovered stories embarrassing to the
white-minority government and various black groups.
'The ANC's inquiry into the treatment of detainees in its camps in exile has
uncovered evidence of shocking abuses,' the newspaper said.
Mr Piliso, now head of the ANC's personnel department, was 'directly
implicated in some of the assaults on prisoners,' the article said. Mr
Piliso was quoted in the report as saying he was following instructions.
The ANC said yesterday it had no comment on The Weekly Mail report. It has
said the dissidents were undercover government agents.

THREE journalists working for the newspaper Business Times are being

Mr Mano Sabnani, managing editor of English and Malay newspapers for
Singapore Press Holdings, said that Mr Patrick Daniel, editor of Business

Officers of the department searched the offices of Business Times on

investigation of alleged use of classified information was being conducted
under the Official Secrets Act. The investigation appeared to concern a
front-page article in the newspaper on June 29 about Singapore's economic
performance in the second quarter of the year, Sabnani said.
'The early indications point to a second-quarter growth of 4.6 per cent to
4.8 per cent,' the Business Times article said. The government later
released official figures on August 8 giving second-quarter growth as 4.7
per cent.

Taiwan, easing restrictions on economic ties with China, has drafted
regulations which will let local banks deal directly with their Chinese
counterparts, government officials said yesterday, Reuter reports from
Taipei.
Overseas branches of Taiwanese banks will be allowed to negotiate letters of
credit and foreign exchange remittances with Chinese banks, officials of the
Monetary Affairs Bureau said. At present, Taiwanese banks can only deal with
Chinese financial institutions through foreign banks.
Vice-Finance Minister Lee Chung-ying told reporters the reform would assist
the flow of funds between the two sides and make it easier for Taiwanese
banks to profit from the rapid growth of trade and investment. However,
Taiwan will continue to ban its banks from setting up branches inside China.

FT  15 AUG 92 / China launches into space market: New entrant breathes a
sigh of relief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN and YVONNE PRESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA SENT an Australian telecommunications satellite into orbit yesterday
confirming the country's arrival in the commercial space market.
The satellite, Optus B1, will provide television and telephone links for
Australia and New Zealand.
The launch success, which followed a failed attempt in March, was good news
for the members of the Optus consortium: BellSouth of the US, Cable and
Wireless of the UK and the Mayne Nickless group of Australia. They paid
Dollars A200m (Pounds 77m) to buy, launch and insure the satellite to
provide pay TV for Australia and New Zealand.
Jubilation at mission control, Xichang satellite launch centre in a remote
corner of China's south west Sichuan province, was tempered with relief.
The first attempt to launch Optus B1, made by Los Angeles-based Hughes
Aircraft, failed when a short circuit cut off the flow of fuel to the rocket
engines.
Viewers around the world watching the live television coverage saw rocket
ignite then fail to move as flames and smoke billowed from its base.
Neither the rocket launcher, Long March 2E, nor the satellite was damaged.
But the televised failure was a loss of face for the Chinese and a setback
to China's commercial space prospects.
The approach to yesterday's relaunch was considerably toned down, said Mr
Gordon Pike of Optus at the launch site. Everybody was nervous, especially
the Chinese. A launch this time was crucial to the future of China's
commercial space programme, he said.
Optus has said it saved about Dollars 100m by launching the satellite in
China. China charges about USDollars 30m, compared with at least Dollars 50m
on US or European launchers, but the price of a Chinese launch is now likely
to rise because of a deal struck between Beijing and Washington.
China has been trying for several years to break into the commercial
satellite launch business. One barrier was that many satellites are made in
the US, and an agreement had to be negotiated with the US government on
safeguarding its technology and domestic launch market. The US agreed that
China can launch nine US-built satellites over a six-year period as long as
it promises not to undercut too much the price of a US launch. The first
launch, yesterday, was exempted from this pricing rule as promotional.
Washington is trying to protect an industry in trouble. The US is finding it
difficult to win business in competition with the European consortium
Arianespace.
This is partly because the main US rockets available for commercial launches
are made by defence companies McDonnell-Douglas, General Dynamics and Martin
Marietta. They ran down their commercial programmes in the 1980s as the Nasa
Space Shuttle programme grew.
As a result, they were badly placed to pick up business when, after the
Challenger space shuttle exploded in 1987, Nasa said it would no longer
offer commercial launches.
The departure of Nasa also encouraged other countries to examine the
possibility of offering commercial space products.
Among them were Russia, which will probably also be subject to a pricing and
frequency deal with Washington, and Japan, where snags with test firings
mean that the first launch has been postponed to 1994.
Beijing has worked hard to build its head start over Russia and Japan.
It first received international attention with the April 1990 launch of the
Hughes-built Asiasat owned by Hong Kong-based Asia Satellite
Telecommunications.
Yesterday's launch was part of a Dollars 358m contract between Optus and
Hughes to make, launch and insure two satellites. The second launch is due
in October.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations Human Rights Commission yesterday unanimously approved a
resolution appointing a special investigator to compile evidence on human
rights abuses in Bosnia-Hercegovina and elsewhere in the former Yugoslavia.
The investigator will be Mr Tadeusz Mazowiecki, former prime minister of
Poland.
The US-drafted resolution calls for the investigator's report to be
completed by August 28 and presented, with recommendations, to the Human
Rights Commission and the Security Council. US and other western diplomats
say they will then consider what further action might be needed to stop the
abuses. This might include the stationing of permanent human rights monitors
in the region.
The resolution condemns 'widespread, massive and grave' human rights
violations and the practice of 'ethnic cleansing', demands immediate release
of all those arbitrarily detained and access for the International Committee
of the Red Cross to all detention camps and prisons.
Islamic countries, led by Turkey and Egypt, supported the resolution despite
failing to secure changes naming Serbia as the principal perpetrator of
human rights violations and Moslems as the main victims. Western diplomats
said yesterday that specific condemnation of Serbia should follow rather
than precede the special investigator's report, which is intended to be an
authoritative and objective assessment of the evidence. They also expressed
fears that singling out Serbia and Serb forces at this stage could hamper
the investigator's work.
Mr Mazowiecki is expected to start work within the next few days, after
confirmation of his appointment by the UN's Economic and Social Council on
Monday. The self-styled Serb-dominated Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
yesterday pledged its full co-operation with Mr Mazowiecki's investigation.
The US said it was pleased with the outcome of the exceptional two-day
session of the Human Rights Commission, which was convened at Washington's
request.
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said yesterday it had
finally been given access to Omarska, the Serb-run detention camp filmed by
British television crews last week, but had found only 200 or so prisoners
there. US officials warned earlier this week that prisoners were being moved
from Omarska and other Serb-run camps before ICRC visits.
Mr Pierre Gauthier of the ICRC said some of the prisoners previously in
Omarska may have been moved to camps at Trnopolje and Manjaca. Red Cross
officials visited both earlier this week. Mr Gauthier said about 3,500
people were being held in Trnopolje and, at the time of the first visit,
some 2,300 in Manjaca.
The ICRC has also visited a Croat-run camp at Konjic north of Mostar,
bringing to 13 the number of detention centres it has visited in Bosnia.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Bristol &amp; West joins retail group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRISTOL &amp; WEST, the 10th largest building society, has broken ranks with the
rest of the financial services industry and joined the British Retail
Consortium, the retailers' lobby group known for its confrontations with the
banks and building societies over the pricing of financial services.
The consortium said yesterday: 'Bristol &amp; West are on the high street and
they are offering a consumer service.' It said that by including Bristol &amp;
West in its membership it would be better able to understand the ways in
which financial services companies worked.
'This is a big step forward for us,' the consortium said.
However, an official said that she was not certain how an application for
membership from the Big Four high street banks would be received. The banks
have been in a sometimes acrimonious dialogue with the consortium for
several years.
The official said. 'I don't know if they would be interested in joining us.
We would view each application for membership on its individual merits.'
Bristol &amp; West does not issue any credit or debit cards and so is not likely
to find itself at loggerheads with the rest of the consortium. The society
declined to comment on whether it had taken the reactions of other financial
services institutions into account before joining the con-sortium.
The society said the move was a result of its determination to become a
leading high street retailer of financial services, which had been shown in
the opening of five new financial centres in southern Britain.
Mr James May, consortium director-general, said the consortium would be
joining a campaign to persuade the Treasury to extend the moratorium on
stamp duty beyond August 19.
He said: 'Helping the economy by kick-starting the housing market is just
one example of how our membership is working together in the interests of
the retail customer.'

A WEST Belfast man who was acquitted in Germany on IRA-linked bombing
charges was yesterday extradited to Northern Ireland.
Mr Gerard Hanratty, 32, from Andersonstown, who was found not guilty in
Dusseldorf of bombing an army base, was flown to Belfast where magistrates
remanded him in custody on firearms charges.
Mr Hanratty and Mr Terence McGeogh were found not guilty a year ago of
causing an explosion at the Glamorgan Barracks in Duisburg in July 1988 in
which 10 soldiers were killed. The judges decided, after a year-long trial,
there was insufficient evidence against the two and ordered their release.
Mr Hanratty was immediately re-arrested pending extradition to Northern
Ireland. He was charged with firearms offences following an incident in 1984
but failed to turn up for his trial after being bailed.

FT  15 AUG 92 / 'Many football clubs' lose money
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT 70 per cent of English football clubs are lossmaking, according to a
report published yesterday.
'British football is beset with major problems such as high wage costs,
spiralling transfer fees and huge ground improvement costs which have
severely affected profit margins,' says ICC Business Ratios. A total of 10
clubs have wage bills which exceed their turnover.
The report shows that turnover in the former First Division clubs increased
28 per cent in the latest year, compared with an average 18.6 per cent for
all clubs. Nevertheless, the big clubs have increased ticket prices by 20
per cent to try to meet the cost of ground improvements.
The most profitable club, the report says, was Manchester United, which made
a profit of Pounds 5.3m in the year to end-July 1991. The biggest loss was
scored by Queen's Park Rangers with a deficit of Pounds 2.73m in the year to
end-May 1991.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Anger at PW move over salaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DECISION by Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, to raise starting pay
for graduates has angered rival firms, Andrew Jack writes.
Five of the six biggest firms have traditionally kept salary levels
comparable with one another, while Arthur Andersen has maintained a slightly
higher entry-level rate.
But Price Waterhouse has now increased its salaries for students joining the
firm in London in the autumn from Pounds 12,500 to Pounds 14,000.
Price Waterhouse's move comes at a time when the graduate job market is
depressed and accountancy firms are cutting recruitment and staffing.
Two other firms - Ernst &amp; Young and Coopers &amp; Lybrand - have increased
salaries to the same level. KPMG Peat Marwick and Touche Ross have
maintained their starting salaries at Pounds 12,500, while Arthur Andersen
is offering Pounds 15,000 this year.
Mr David Wilson, national marketing partner at Ernst &amp; Young, said the
decision to raise salaries was driven by Price Waterhouse and would cost his
firm about Pounds 500,000 in additional salaries.
Price Waterhouse said last night it had increased salaries as part of a
regular review of competitive rates.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Gateway out of poverty trap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON and LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ANTHONY Carbon was successfully running his London-based business as a
disc jockey. Then he broke with his business partner and had to leave home
for family reasons. At 20 he was homeless and jobless: 'I felt trapped,' he
said.
For nearly a year he slept where he could. When friends ran out of
hospitality he was reduced to living on the streets before finding
accommodation at a hostel.
Mr Carbon was an example of the link between urban homelessness and
unemployment: 'I was looking to restart my career, but with a hostel address
companies weren't interested.'
It was then he spotted a leaflet advertising Gate, a scheme which aims to
break the 'no-home no-job' syndrome. The project guarantees jobs and help
with finding accommodation to homeless people who complete a training course
designed by British Rail and the London Enterprise Agency.
There are now 65 Gate graduates working at BR's Network SouthEast and the
course, which has been going for more than a year, boasts a 95 per cent
success rate. Mr Carbon is on the BR payroll as a trainee train driver and
hopes to leave the hostel soon.
The scheme is based in London where several boroughs come high on the
government 'deprivation index'. This is used in the designation of urban
programme areas eligible for special grants.
Unemployment in these areas accounts for 40 per cent of all unemployment in
England and Wales. The areas host a concentration of measures to alleviate
unemployment such as Employment Training (ET) and Employment Action, which
offers the unemployed work experience on community projects.
The Gate project is a model of what the government hoped would result from
co-operation between public-sector training expertise and private-sector
employers. The idea is the brainchild of Mr Peter Thackwray, the agency's
head of marketing. This year the project won Pounds 70,000 from government
and the European Social Fund and the same amount in sponsorship from the
private sector.
The scheme has not been trouble free. The original idea to take people
directly off the streets was dropped and Gate relies on referrals from
hostels. The recession has meant that the only employer able to offer jobs
was BR.
BR emphasises it does not sacrifice selection standards for philanthropy.
Applicants must pass two interviews, and a medical which includes drugs
screening. Then trainees face a course in basic literacy and numeracy skills
with the final hurdle of a battery of BR aptitude tests.
One of the first Gate graduates was Ms Jackie Sharpe who has passed BR
clerical exams. She is working for BR after successfully completing one of
the four-week courses.
Ms Sharpe is working as a track cleaner while waiting for a permanent
clerical position.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Police pay board calls for 6.5% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLICE OFFICERS' pay is likely to rise by 6.5 per cent this year even though
average earnings, which determine police pay, have risen by less than that.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, will shortly consider the recommendations
of the Police Negotiating Board for a 6.5 per cent rise amid growing
pressure for the government to restrain public-sector earnings. If he wanted
to take a hard line he could press for the rise to be restricted to 6.25 per
cent - saving about Pounds 10m - without breaking the government's pledge to
link police pay to average earnings increases.
The Department of Employment last week revised the average earnings figure
for the year to May - the period which determines police officers' rises -
to 6.25 per cent from the 6.5 per cent reported previously.
A decision to make the rise 6.25 per cent would signal the government's
determination to tighten its grip on public pay but it would infuriate the
129,000 police officers who already feel insecure because of a government
inquiry into their pay and conditions.
The negotiating board made its recommendation of a 6.5 per cent rise before
last week's revision of the earnings figure. Members said yesterday they
would be surprised if their recommendation were overturned.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission is to consider renewing duties on Japanese
photocopiers imported into the EC, reopening one of the largest and most
controversial anti-dumping cases of recent years.
Brussels announced yesterday it would re-examine anti-dumping duties of up
to 20 per cent first imposed in 1987. The duties are supposed to protect
European copier manufacturers from imports allegedly sold at an artificially
low price.
The measures were due to expire this year, but Olivetti of Italy, Rank Xerox
of Britain, and Oce of the Netherlands warned that if the duties are lifted
their business will suffer.
Investment, prices and sales are being depressed by cheap Japanese imports,
according to European manufacturers. Since the mid-1980s, several original
EC complainants have gone out of business or been taken over by Japan.
The 1987 decision to penalise Japanese copier manufacturers led indirectly
to introduction of controversial 'screwdriver' rules by the EC. These aimed
to stop non-EC companies getting round anti-dumping duties on complete
products by exporting parts to the EC or US and assembling them there.
The screwdriver rules were introduced in 1989, after a Brussels
investigation into a Ricoh photocopier plant in the US. They were outlawed
by a Gatt panel in 1990.
A Commission official said yesterday he did not expect the new inquiry into
photocopiers to reopen the debate over screwdriver plants in the EC.
Japanese manufacturers lost their European Court appeal against the original
decision in March. Most of them are involved in the new inquiry. They are
Canon, Copyer, Fuji Xerox, Konishiroku Photo Industry, Kyocera, Matsushita,
Minolta Camera, Ricoh, Sanyo Electric, Sharp and Toshiba.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERAL UK cash dispenser networks do not employ a critical security measure
to protect the secrecy of personal identification numbers, according to a
writ issued this week on behalf of eight customers who claim phantom
withdrawals have been made from their accounts.
The writ lodged in the High Court, but not yet served, names four banks and
one building society which it claims do not properly use computerised
security modules in their automatic teller machine (ATM) networks.
It says these modules should make it impossible for anyone to get into the
systems and learn a customer's PIN - the code a customer must key into an
ATM after inserting a plastic card in order to carry out transactions.
Instead, the writ says Barclays, Midland, TSB and Lloyds banks and
Nationwide Building Society allow their staff to input the master keys which
activate their systems. This means the institutions named in the writ 'rely
upon the honesty of their own staff' to keep the codes secret.
The Association for Payment Clearing Services (Apacs), which represents all
ATM network providers, refused to comment on the allegations before its
members are served with the writ.
Barclays and Lloyds said the writ had not yet been served on either of them
and that they had nothing to say yet. Apacs, Barclays and Lloyds would
neither confirm nor deny whether the security modules are installed.
The multi-plaintiff, multi-defendant writ was applied for in the High Court
on Thursday by Keith Park and Co, a firm of solicitors in St Helens,
Merseyside.
The writ says plaintiffs will also rely on an admission by Barclays in a
letter dated April 29 of 'faults in a computer program which wrongly
identifies the branch at which withdrawals are attempted and made'.

A BURST of confidence sent London and other European stock markets higher
yesterday after encouraging figures on British and German inflation.
News of a 1.3 per cent drop in west German wholesale prices and a sharp fall
in June retail sales raised hopes throughout Europe that the upward pressure
on German interest rates was easing.
In the UK, the government moved closer to its goal of zero inflation as
official figures showed that prices were rising at a much slower rate than
expected.
The annual rate of retail price inflation dropped to 3.7 per cent last month
compared with 3.9 per cent in June after the biggest monthly fall in the
retail prices index (RPI) for 25 years.
The better-than-expected economic data from Germany boosted share prices in
Frankfurt, Paris and London and also gave a fillip to bonds.
Equities in London surged when the news on German retail sales coincided
with the announcement of the drop in UK inflation. The FT-SE 100 index made
its best daily gain for more than three weeks, closing 38.8 stronger at
2,356.8. UK government bonds gained more than a point.
In Frankfurt, the west German wholesale prices data boosted the DAX-30 index
of blue chip shares by 0.4 per cent. Paris equities shook off a bearish week
to rebound by 1.8 per cent. The strong rise reflected bargain hunting in the
hope that continental interest rates might begin to decline before the end
of the year.
Over the past week, the London market had been depressed by fears that
sterling's weakness might force up domestic interest rates, deepening the
recession.
The 0.4 per cent fall in Britain's RPI between June and July added to
evidence that inflation is being successfully squeezed from the economy.
Earlier in the week, figures had shown that the prices of goods leaving
factories - often used as a measure of core inflation - were at their lowest
for 25 years last month. Labour market data on Thursday showed the rate of
average earnings growth slowing sharply to 6 per cent in June.
Yesterday's figures from the Central Statistical Office showed that July's
headline inflation figure was the same as last October's - after which it
jumped back to 4.3 per cent. This month it is expected to resume its
downward path. Excluding mortgage interest payments, inflation fell to a
four-year low of 4.4 per cent, from 4.8 per cent in June.
The news on inflation may well encourage ministers back on to the offensive
over government economic strategy. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has
been under pressure from Tory backbenchers to boost the economy in the face
of rising unemployment, which hit a five-year peak last month.
Mr Tony Nelson, the economic secretary to the Treasury, said the latest
inflation data, along with a modest rise in manufacturing output, were signs
of 'better economic conditions that are to come'.
Last month's fall in the RPI puts Britain's inflation rate below the EC
average of 4.5 per cent but above the 3.3 per cent average of the Group of
Seven leading industrial countries.
The Confederation of British Industry described the inflation figures as
'extremely good' and said the UK was set to have one of the lowest inflation
currencies in the European exchange rate mechanism. The Institute of
Directors warned that wage inflation must be brought more in line with
retail price trends to prevent job losses.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, pointed out that inflation was still
higher in the UK than in Germany, Japan, France and the US.
'Britain has suffered the worst fall in investment, the worst rise in
unemployment, record business failures and a worse economic growth
performance than any of our major competitors,' he said.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Bank under pressure to intervene as pound falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING AGAIN threatened to fall below DM2.81 on the foreign exchanges
yesterday, compounding pressures on the UK government to bolster the
currency's position in the European Monetary System.
The pound finished at DM2.8150 in London, its lowest close since Britain
joined the ERM in October 1990, while in New York it closed at DM2.8146.
It is now less than 4 pfennigs above DM2.7780, its absolute floor against
the German currency in the EMS. If sterling drops to that level, the UK
authorities will be forced to sustain the pound either by heavy intervention
in the foreign exchange markets or by raising interest rates.
Alternatively, as some dealers suggest, the authorities could unilaterally
devalue the currency inside the system or leave the ERM altogether - both of
which the government has adamantly ruled out.
Sterling's fall continues to be driven by the dollar's weakness. Traders are
selling the US currency for D-Marks which raises the D-Mark's value against
European currencies. Although central banks have intervened in the market
three times in recent weeks to support the dollar, the policy has failed to
turn the market. The dollar was still threatening its lows yesterday.
Deepening gloom about the UK economy is exacerbating sterling's position.
Even yesterday's good figure for retail price inflation, down 0.2 percentage
points in July, had little impact on the currency markets.
Some foreign exchange dealers feel that the pressure on the Bank of England
to intervene in support of the pound is now overwhelming. They argue that
while the Italians have raised interest rates to support the lira in the
past, the UK authorities are not providing a good enough rate of return for
sterling investors and should raise base rates. 'The Bank's situation is not
sustainable,' said one London-based analyst yesterday.
Other dealers say the Bank's position is more secure. They argue that it is
increasingly risky for dealers to sell sterling at these levels because the
threat of intervention hangs over the market.
Another factor in sterling's favour is that it cannot technically go below
its floor against the D-Mark. But the gap between sterling and its floor is
small enough for ministers to feel uncomfortable this weekend.
Analysts say there are no significant support levels for the pound on the
downside because the currency has not been at these low levels in the ERM
before. 'We are into uncharted waters,' one dealer said.
Another concern is sterling's divergence from its central rate against the
Ecu, which was at 71 percentage points yesterday. When the EMS was created
in 1979, it was agreed that a central bank would intervene when its currency
diverged by 75 percentage points.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Nato rules out large-scale troop deployment to Bosnia

THE US and its Nato allies yesterday ruled out sending tens of thousands of
troops to Bosnia-Hercegovina in a move confirming the reluctance of western
governments to become militarily involved in the former Yugoslav republic.
Instead, Mr Manfred Worner, secretary-general of Nato, said the organisation
was 'studying a range of options which involved different numbers'. Nato
officials will report back within 10 days. 'We have not yet decided on any
action,' he told a news conference after a meeting of the 16-member
organisation.
Nato diplomats said some western governments were not prepared to commit any
troops, let alone large contingents of ground forces, to protect
humanitarian aid convoys to towns and cities throughout Bosnia besieged by
Serb irregulars for the past four months.
However, France offered to provide a contingent of 1,100 men, Turkey a
480-strong battalion and Spain an unspecified number of soldiers. Earlier
this week, Nato diplomats said small numbers would go nowhere towards
protecting the corridors international aid agencies wanted to establish in
Bosnia.
A Nato diplomat said: 'Either we go in and saturate the place or we stay
out. There is no room for half-baked measures. In any case, it is probably
too late because the Serbs have gotten what they want. They are likely to
allow aid convoys in now.'
The continuing war and the future status of Bosnia will be discussed today
in Brussels under the aegis of the European Community-sponsored talks.
This is expected to be the EC's final session before handing over to a much
wider international conference involving the United Nations and the
52-member Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe.
A plenary session of the EC conference, chaired by Lord Carrington, was held
yesterday with the aim of finalising arrangements for the enlarged
conference. It was attended by Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN's special envoy to the
former Yugoslavia.
President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and his Montenegrin counterpart, Mr
Momir Bulatovic, refused to attend. Mr Milan Panic, prime minister of the
unrecognised rump Yugoslavia, tried to represent them but he was not
admitted into the formal talks.
'I am not so sure Milosevic did not attend yesterday's session because he
was embarrassed about all the international criticism of Serbia's ethnic
cleansing policy in Bosnia and the detention camps,' a US diplomat said. 'I
think it is because he has contempt for the EC because he knows it has no
clout,' he added.
In his bilateral talks with the leaders, Lord Carrington stressed the need
for each of the republics to recognise the rights of minorities on their
territory.
'There is an urgent need for Serbia to accept the principle of special
status within Croatia for the (Serb-inhabited) Krajina and to persuade the
Krajina Serbs to accept this,' he said.
EC negotiators said they were worried that another flashpoint would be
created if Serbs within Croatia declared independence or allied themselves
with Serbia.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Georgia rebels free minister as fighting flares
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DISSIDENTS in the former Soviet republic of Georgia freed a government
minister and most other hostages yesterday, as troops and police clamped
down on their rebellious region, agencies report from Tbilisi.
Mr Roman Gventsadze, the interior minister, who was seized on Tuesday along
with 11 police officials, returned to Tbilisi by helicopter late last night,
looking pale and tired.
He said his captors released him because they were afraid of the big force
being deployed against them yesterday.
The Georgian government based in Tbilisi sent more than 3,000 national
guardsmen and more than 400 police to seal off the rebellious Abkhazia
region in the west of the republic to prevent the hostages being spirited
further away. The hostages were reportedly held in a village 170 miles from
Tbilisi.
The guardsmen blocked bridges, roads and railways throughout Abkhazia, at
times running into resistance.
The sharpest flare-up of fighting came as they swept into the Black Sea
resort of Sukhumi, the regional capital. National Guard helicopters were
reported to have opened fire on Abkhazian forces near the region's
parliament building, and rockets destroyed a runway at Sukhumi airport.
At least 10 people were killed, according to an Abkhazian official, although
other reports spoke of three dead and many wounded.
Abkhazia declared independence from Georgia last month, angering hardliners
in Georgia's provisional government, which is led by Mr Eduard Shevardnadze,
the former Soviet foreign minister
The hostage-taking has presented Mr Shevardnadze with his most serious
crisis since returning to his native Georgia in March as political leader.
Mr Shevardnadze said the 'bandits' were still holding Mr Alexander Kavsadze,
a deputy prime minister taken hostage several weeks ago, and two police
officials. He said the militants at one stage promised to free all hostages
yesterday but changed their minds after talking by phone to Mr Gamsakhurdia,
who has taken refuge in Russia.
Abkhazian leaders apparently did not organise the hostage-taking or have
direct control over the hostages. But the hostage crisis has turned into a
larger political dispute.
Abkhazia's parliament ordered a general mobilisation of citizens to resist
the troops.

<TEXT>
ITALY'S stock brokers yesterday reacted with disappointment to the cabinet's
plan, announced on Thursday, to amend the country's complex capital gains
tax and introduce new measures to encourage share buying and boost the
bourse.
The steps, which fall short of suspending the tax as first thought, offer a
variety of incentives for individuals to buy shares, particularly of new
issues. The draft law, expected to be passed next month after comment from
stock brokers, should help to buoy the flagging stock market and pave the
way for privatisation.
However, Italian equities fell to a new low for the year yesterday on the
back of thin trading and adverse reaction to the decision by Moody's, the US
rating agency, to downgrade Italy's foreign debt. The Comit equity index
fell by 1.15 per cent to 393.70, its lowest since the mid-1980s.
On the foreign exchanges, the lira slipped further against the D-Mark,
closing at 760.02, down from 759.175 on Thursday. The Bank of Italy did not
intervene in spite of the fall, partly because trading was very quiet before
today's Assumption Day holiday in Italy.
Mr Giovanni Goria, the finance minister, reacted angrily to the Moody's
decision, which he described as 'unfounded'. 'This is a wrong judgment,' he
said. Meanwhile, officials at the Bank of Italy were reported as dismissing
the downgrading as being 'out of date' in view of the new government's
efforts to cut the huge budget deficit.
In a television interview, Mr Piero Barucci, the treasury minister, said the
step was 'nothing tragic. It will increase the Italian government's
determination to continue on the road it has chosen.'
Ministers also stressed the stock market's ills could not be attributed
wholly to the government. According to Mr Goria, 'the problems of the stock
market have 1,000 motives', taxation being only one element. Nevertheless,
ministers are hoping the incentives and tax breaks they have unveiled will
stimulate the market once brokers digest their implications.

THE HUMAN BLUEPRINT
by Robert Shapiro
Cassell Pounds 16.99, 432 pages
THE CODE OF CODES
edited by DJ Kevles and L. Hood
Harvard Pounds 23.95, 396 pages
ONE OF the most important programmes of scientific research everdevised is
under way, in a massive cooperative effort in laboratories around the world.
It is the Human Genome Project, and it concerns nothing less than the nature
of man. In his entertainingly clear account, Robert Shapiro explains what it
is and explores the exciting and sometimes alarming possibilities it offers.
Genome research is the province of that department of biological science
called genetics. Genetics is the investigation of how organisms bequeath
anatomical, physiological and behavioural traits to their offspring, and how
such traits express themselves in the formation and development of
individual organisms. Central to this inquiry is the concept of the gene, a
chemical packet of information which is the fundamental unit of heredity.
The word 'gene' was coined in 1909, but the idea dates back to the work of
the 19th century monk Gregor Mendel, who studied heredity in sweet peas and
proposed a mechanism by which characteristics are passed between
generations. Little more than a century has elapsed since Mendel's day, but
genetics has proved to be one of the most important sciences in history.
The sum of all genetic material in a given organism is called the 'genome'.
It is a hugely complex chemical storehouse of information, a code or script
in which is written the secrets of every physical aspect of a living
creature. The quantity of information in a single human genome is equivalent
to the amount of data in a thousand telephone directories each a thousand
pages long.
When scientists can read the code, they will have information about an
individual's genetic make-up which will reveal not only his heredity (for
example, which forebears bequeathed him his height, colouring and other
traits), but something of his fate also - for example, the diseases he has
or might be prone to, and the possibility of his offspring inheriting these
or those characteristics and conditions.
Genetics has already explained much and made many things possible,
especially in medicine, where it has proved itself a powerful tool.
Transplant surgery, prenatal diagnosis, cancer treatments, the manufacture
of insulin for treatment of diabetics: all would be impossible without
genetics. Genetics is crucial in cystic fibrosis research and the attempt to
understand Alzheimer's disease. But these advances are based on limited and
partial knowledge of the human genome, which until recently presented too
large a task for more than piecemeal investigation.
Thanks to brilliant recent discoveries about how to read the genetic code,
together with the bold imagination and resolve of scientists prepared to
work together on a long-term international project, the limits on scientific
understanding of the genome are being pushed back. At a meeting in San
Diego, California, in October 1989, the Human Genome Project was launched,
scheduled to take 15 years and promised Dollars 3bn by the US government
over that period.
With the right techniques established, and high-powered computer technology
available, there is excitement among the researchers. What has been
described as the 'holy grail' of human genetics is close at hand.
James Watson, one of the discoverers of DNA and the Genome Project's head,
has said: 'A more important set of instruction books will never be found by
human beings. When finally interpreted, the genetic messages encoded within
our DNA will provide the ultimate answers to the chemical underpinnings of
human existence.'
Shapiro takes us through the detective story of how genetics developed, and
lucidly explains the nature of the genome and the task of investigating it.
In the collection of essays edited by Kevles and Hood the same terrain is
covered, but more technically. Both books make admirable and successful
efforts to equip general readers with a clear grasp of the issues - an
important matter, because the future of genome research prompts a number of
difficult questions.
This is illustrated by both books when they turn from explanation of the
genome project to the consequences of its successful completion. Armed with
so much genetic knowledge, will we be tempted to manipulate the genetic
material of future people not just to exclude hereditary diseases, but to
make them taller, more intelligent, more athletic? Should employers know the
genetic profile of potential employees, some of whom they might refuse to
employ because they have, say, a genetic risk of early death from heart
disease? What policies should we adopt now to cope with the taxing choices
we shall soon have to make, now that all this knowledge is rushing upon us?
Shapiro, and the contributors to the Kevles and Hood volume, issue us with
an invitation to reflect on these questions while there is still time.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Cricket: Losing the image game
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERESA MCLEAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CRICKET has always had an eye for its image, especially at the higher levels
of the game. It is a spectacle, performed on a grassy stage before a devoted
audience. Admittedly the numbers of the devoted vary, but the potential for
hero worship is constant. Young Pakistani Yorkshiremen waved their way
through the Headingley Test with national flags and rhythmic chants of
'In-za-mam,' the tourists' favourite batting stylist.
Nearly a century ago, The Times produced a fulsome leader celebrating the
testimonial of England's favourite batsman, W G Grace - 'the theme of all
the dinner tables, the railway carriages, the public houses, and, above all,
the public schools. Wherever English folk congregate, they have exchanged
notes of admiration about the hero of a thousand fights and of a hundred
centuries.' (June 17 1895).
Today, English cricket has no Grace, no reason to boast too much about the
heroes of its fights and no strong image. This last lack may not be a bad
thing.
Modern 'profiles' are pumped up by agents to advertise teams' and
cricketers' distinctive persona, which their agents consider invaluable in
an age of media attention. More's the pity.
I respected Yorkshire's policy of only using home-grown players, something
all other counties had abandoned. But, depressed by their failures,
Yorkshire joined the international marketplace and signed Sachin Tendulkar,
the young Indian superstar, as a new breed of glamorous Yorkshireman for
this season.
He does seem to have saved the county from getting trapped in an image of
itself as the home of hard times, after great times in the 1960s and '70s.
He has given the club a transfusion of outside interest.
At the Test level, it is the West Indies who are in abeyance after years of
splendour. A drawn tour in England last summer was followed by a drawn tour
of Pakistan in the winter, which left the Pakistanis eager to prove
themselves the best in the world.
They returned home from the World Cup as beacons of their country's glory.
They feed off this. But they also enjoy a battle. It would be sad if
automatic hostility replaced strategic battle-plans. Nothing undermines the
enemy so much as a fizzing leg-break, as Mushtaq Ahmed can show. But then
nothing provokes Pakistani fury as much as calmness from the opposition,
such as the languid David Gower, or from officials, such as the unfortunate
Roy Palmer at Old Trafford, who was quickly denounced as a member of the
opposition.
Good behaviour is a 20th century innovation in cricket, and a welcome one.
In 1973 Arthur Fagg, a great umpire, bewailed the start of a new era of high
pressure dissent in which we are stuck today. He was so angry with the West
Indian captain Rohan Kanhai's abuse of one of his decisions in the Edgbaston
Test that he refused to go on.
When the West Indies issued an official apology, Fagg agreed to complete the
game, but said sadly: 'If they will not accept decisions, there is no point
carrying on . . . I don't enjoy umpiring Tests any more . . . There is so
much at stake . . . the game has changed, and not for the better.' He could
have been speaking this summer.
Cricket's ever-growing civil service is not the way to keep the peace. Its
legal expansion cannot control the money and politics which let cricketers
behave like prima donnas. The International Cricket Council's match referee
(what an ill-conceived job]) fined Pakistan's substitute fielder Rashid
Latif Pounds 120 for 'serious and obvious dissent' at Headingley. Next time,
perhaps, offenders will have to miss pudding at lunch.
Umpires have always been the walking wounded of struggles for the honour of
the game, and they must keep walking. Respect for umpires is crucial to
cricket. If international pressure affects umpiring appointments or
decisions, the game is done for. Just before the Old Trafford Test, I asked
Javed Miandad, Pakistan's captain, about his country's cricket in England so
far this summer. He was the essence of acquiescence, all happy, all
comfortable.
'You must have been in a good mood after Pakistan's victory at Lords?'
'I'm always in a good mood,' he replied.
This was public relations with a vengeance.
After many further attempts, ranging from food to social life, I had my last
try at reaching an unguarded Javed by asking him whether he was enjoying his
captaincy. He was ready for me.
'What is captaincy? . . It doesn't make any difference to me . . .I wasn't
keen, you know, to take the captaincy on this trip, but I've been forced by
the Board.'
Javed's soft, brown eyes would have melted the rubber off cricket bat
handles. It has almost reached the stage where cricketers have two
languages, one for the field and one for the media.
England at present are a team lacking distinctive features on the field of
play, either of fast or slow pace, captaincy or keeping.
Graham Gooch is a hard-working, not an inspiring, captain. Smooth talk has
never been one of his problems. I hope it will never have to become one.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Motoring: Grand Prix way to road safety
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNBROKEN concentration and good judgment win grand prix motor races. If
everyone showed the same qualities in day-to-day driving, most road
accidents could be avoided.
That is the gospel according to Dr Jonathan Palmer, who drove in 85 Formula
I races, mainly with the Tyrrell team. He was also a highly successful
driver in Formula 2 and 3, as well as touring car and world sports car
championship events for Porsche and Mercedes-Benz.
He still acts as a test driver for the McLaren Honda FI team. But Palmer's
main activity at the moment is running the 1992 Cellnet Driver Challenge.
For three years, Cellnet, the mobile telephone provider, ran a contest to
find the best business driver. It must have felt the need to counter the
popular image of a car 'phone-user as a man in red braces and a Porsche,
making calls while driving one-handed on the M25 at 90 mph and almost
touching the bumper of the car in front.
As the car 'phone market approaches saturation, Cellnet has plans for
another kind of service that 'non-company' people might hope to afford. So,
in preparation, this year's driver challenge was opened to every kind of
motorist: mum in her Metro, cab and delivery van drivers and under-25s as
well as high-mileage businessmen and women. Entry is free.
I joined competitors in the Reading heat this week. There were manoeuvring
and smooth driving tests in a Toyota Carina E provided by Cellnet; a vision
test; a brake reaction time test; a simple written examination on road
safety; and some horribly fascinating road crash case histories on video.
No, I will not be going on to the semi-final but I rated it an enjoyable and
instructive morning. Anything to sharpen a motorist's awareness that
concentration and good judgment are the secrets of safe driving has to be
worthwhile.
THE FIRST nip in the morning air is a reminder that summer is drawing to a
close and the two big motor shows of autumn are not far off. The Paris salon
de l'automobile comes first October 8-18 at Porte de Versailles) while
Britain's international motor show opens at the National Exhibition Centre,
Birmingham, on October 24 for a a nine-day run.
The British show will be unlike any held before, either at the NEC or its
previous venues, Earl's Court and Olympia in London. It will be combined
with the Midlands autumn ideal home show; the same ticket (Pounds 7 for
adults; children and senior citizens half price) admits to both events,
which are on the same site.
There will be no heavy commercial vehicles, which are to have a separate
show of their own at the NEC next year.
The organisers say the razzmatazz confined previously to press day will
extend throughout the show. They do not mean scantily-clad women draped over
car bonnets and tidal waves of champagne but live music and entertainment
for the whole family.
Can it really be that people once went to motor shows just to look at cars?

FT  15 AUG 92 / Motoring: Toyota Corolla arrives in British showrooms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SEVENTH generation Toyota Corolla, the world's best-selling car, arrived
in British showrooms last week.
There is more than a hint of Toyota's top luxury saloon, the Lexus LS400,
about its curvy styling - and the resemblance goes more than skin deep.
One reason why the sepulchral silence of the Lexus shook European executive
class car-makers was the use of steel/bitumen 'sandwich' panels in critical
parts of its vehicle structure. They stifle noise and vibration at source.
The Corollas have them, too, together with gold-plated electrical connectors
for aerospace reliability standards; occupant-protecting side impact beams
in the doors; and a body shell made almost 90 per cent from galvanised
anti-rust steel.
All Corollas have fuel-injected, 16-valve, 1.3 or 1.6 litre engines with
catalytic converters.
Power-assisted steering, central locking, four-speaker radio/cassette
players and 60/40 folding rear seats are standard equipment.
Prices of the new and larger models are little higher than before. They
start at Pounds 9,456 for the 1.3 XLi three-door and rise to Pounds 13,210
for the 1.6 Executive.
Automatic transmission instead of a five-speed gearbox is a modestly priced
(Pounds 605) extra on most models.
A two-litre diesel engine option and a high-performance 1.8 litre Corolla
GTi will be offered early next year.
There are three-door and five-door liftback, four-door saloon and estate car
Corollas, all claimed by Toyota to be class leaders for quietness and
refinement.
Pictured above left is the 1.3 GLi saloon, which costs Pounds 10,910.
Like all Toyotas, the new Corollas come with a three-year or 60,000 mile
(96,600 km) warranty.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Rugby: Botha carries 'Bok hopes - Philip Gawith previews
today's historic Test in Johannesburg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH

<TEXT>
SOUTH Africa's athletes are home after a less than triumphant return to the
Olympic Games following an absence of 32 years. Forty-second in the medal
table, with only two silvers, is not the sort of performance to satisfy such
a sports-mad country. .
Today, however, the countlry's rugby players have an opportunity to make
amends when the Springboks - as they are sure to remain known, despite the
efforts of politicians to kill the 'apartheid' designation - meet New
Zealand's All Blacks at Ellis Park in Johannesburg.
It is South Africa's first official rugby Test since they drubbed a weak
English side in 1984, and the first meeting between the two countries since
the protest-wracked 1981 tour of New Zealand by the Springboks.
In terms of national pride, there is a lot at stake for white South Africans
 -relatively few blacks play the game - over the next week. In keeping with
South Africa's generally somewhat breathless return to world sport, the
Springboks are also due to face Australia's world-champion Wallabies in Cape
Town next Saturday.
It is a schedule that ranks with the country's return to international
cricket last year when, with less than a month's notice, the South Africans
travelled to India to play three one-day internationals. They were
outclassed in the first two but won the third handsomely.
A similar pattern for the rugby players would not be unexpected. For a team
that has been out of international rugby for eight years, and which has
never played together, to take on two such powerful and settled combinations
is extraordinarily ambitious, if not foolish.
There is also the matter of rules. South Africans worry that isolation has
bred bad habits - particularly, lifting in the line-outs - which neutral
referees will penalise heavily. Indeed, the Australian official who will
handle today's match has indicated that he will crack down on illegal
line-out tactics.
There are, therefore, alibis in abundance should the national ego take a
pounding over the next week. Even so, Springbok supporters are pinning their
hopes of victory on two factors: home advantage and 34-year-old Naas Botha.
The Springboks can, of course, be beaten at home - the formidable 1974
British Lions proved that - but it is never easy. Botha, however, is
something else.
Almost certainly, the fair-haired fly-half and captain is the most
controversial rugby player South Africa has produced. He made his debut for
Northern Transvaal in 1977, aged 19, and has dominated South African rugby
ever since, apart from a brief period in American football in 1983 as a
kicker for the Dallas Cowboys and New England Patriots. His involvement in
professional sport caused fierce debate when he was then cleared to resume
his career in the 'amateur' rugby code.
Botha enjoys celebrity status in the Afrikaans media, which dwells lavishly
on his every move. But, despite his phenomenal talents, many rugby followers
outside the Transvaal accord him only grudging respect.
His precocious debut, and later captaincy of Northern Transvaal when they
were near-invincible late in the 1970s and early '80s, won him adulation in
Pretoria but enemies elsewhere.
Much of this was jealousy: rivals resented his match-winning qualities. They
attacked his style of play, criticising him for kicking the game to death
and never tackling. His quick temper did not help: his frequent involvement
in niggling off-the-ball incidents created an image as a poor sportsman.
Botha is certainly no angel, but it is unfortunate that his on-field gifts
have sometimes been obscured by his personality and private life. His
drop-kicking and punting abilities are legendary - testimony to superb
balance and timing - and his tactical sense impeccable.
He also has a well defined instinct of self-preservation. It is likely that
Michael Jones, the speedy All Black flanker, will have the task this
afternoon of trying to stop Botha. If he does not succeed, he can reflect
that other distinguished players, like Ireland's Fergus Slattery and
Jean-Pierre Rives of France, have failed before him.
Today's game and next Saturday's against Australia will be shown live on
ITV.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Golf: Reading the greens, how Faldo does his course work -
John Hopkins follows the Open champion on a 5 1/2-hour practice round
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU can tell a man by the books he reads, then you can tell a golfer by
the way he prepares for a championship. Practice rounds are regarded by most
professional golfers as a time for low jokes and high stakes, a bit of light
relief before the action begins. If your name is Nick Faldo, however, you
prepare painstakingly, leaving nothing to chance.
It was hot in St Louis on Tuesday as Faldo set out on his third practice
round prior to this week's US PGA championship, though he did not have to
contend with the searing humidity of the two previous days when temperatures
approached 100` F and humidity was as high.
Nevertheless, in the locker room Faldo coated his face and fore-arms with
sun screen, munched an apple and placed a banana and several bottles of
water in his bag.
'I want to prepare so thoroughly that when I lie in bed I can visualise
every hole, every shot I am likely to have to play, every putt, every
undulation in a green,' Faldo told me as he practised for the 1981 Open at
Royal St George's.
In St Louis this week it was not at all the same. 'This course is easy to
the point of being boring,' said Faldo. 'There is no element of a links
course here at all. There is no wind to take into consideration. It's just a
matter of hitting from the tee to the fairway, from the fairway to the
green.'
Deane Beman, now boss of the American pro tour, was one of the first to
start measuring distances by mechanical instead of visual means. In the
early 1960s, Jack Nicklaus noticed what Beman was doing, copied it - and
refined it to a black art. Soon every pro used mechanical aids to measure
distances and Bernhard Langer even went so far as to measure with two
wheels, one in yards, the other in metres.
Watching Faldo at practice this week was like watching a carver whittling
away at a block of wood. Often he played two balls from the tee, sometimes
shaking his head with dissatisfaction as his drive veered from its intended
course. 'Give me another,' he would sigh to his caddie Fanny Sunesson,
holding out his hand.
On the third green Faldo stuck a white tee peg in the green and putted
towards it. Then he marched to the edge of the green and hit some shots from
the straggly grass around the fringe. Sometimes he took a long, slow swing
so that the ball flew out in a high parabola, dropped softly and rolled
towards its target.
Other shots were hit with a firm rap to dig the ball out and it flew low and
fast at the flag. On the fourth hole, he must have hit 20 balls from varying
positions around the green and from bunkers.
As he approached each green he would pull an orange-covered notebook from
his back pocket. This showed the size of the green, the likely flag
positions, the distances from bunkers to the flag.
'I am just checking the humps and bumps now,' said Faldo. 'This is
practically all there is left to do in a practice round. I know what club I
am going to take nine times out of ten by the time I have reached the ball.
When Fanny tells me the distances left to the flag that just confirms in my
mind the club I should take.'
As Faldo practised he was followed by David Leadbetter, his coach, the man
responsible for the swing changes that transformed Faldo into the world's
leading player. From time to time Leadbetter would step forward and from
beneath the shadow of a wide-brimmed straw hat and behind a pair of dark
glasses he would say something quietly to Faldo.
It was almost as if he was adjusting a painting, a hand here, a touch there,
a few quick, quiet sentences. 'He's looking awfully good now,' said
Leadbetter. 'There are a lot more majors in him provided he remains
healthy.'
The procession headed by Faldo and his practice partner Mike Hulbert was
marching down the seventh fairway when a fan screamed out at Fanny Sunesson.
He wanted her autograph.
'No, no, no,' said Sunesson, a blush rising to her cheeks. 'Go on,' said
Faldo, walking on and saying over his shoulder: 'It's coming to something
when a player has to wait for his clubs because his caddie's signing
autographs.' He smiled. 'In Sweden they applauded her on to the tee.'
The appeal of Sunesson to Faldo is her professionalism. Her dedication
mirrors his own. 'She is a hard worker,' said Faldo. 'She trains physically
to stay in shape. Humping a 40lb bag around is not easy, specially for a
woman. There are not many men out here who exercise much more than raising
their right arm.'
The 18th came into sight, a welcome relief from a round that had begun 5 1/2
hours earlier. Faldo's meticulous preparation was completed. He had walked
the best part of six miles and, including the hour he spent on the driving
range before he began his round, had hit as many as 200 shots.
He had done all he could to prepare himself. Whether or not he wins his
second major title of the year, and his sixth in all, is now in the lap of
the gods. On Tuesday night Faldo fell asleep over dinner with his wife Gill
and was in bed by 9.30pm, sleeping the sleep of the just.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Travel: Brought down to size in a forest of giants - Julia
Berney marvels at the soaring treescape of west Australia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIA BERNEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I FELT like the incredible shrinking woman when I entered the karri forest
near Manjimup in the south-west corner of Western Australia. These eucalypts
are colossal. When entire forests assume twice usual size you get the
unsettling impression that that is the norm, and that it is you that has
dwindled. The South Western Highway becomes the aisle of a cathedral
landscape, with vast columnar trunks zooming up to a fan vaulting of
branches that admit great shafts of sunlight.
Quality hardwoods such as karri and jarrah are the staple of this region's
timber trade. 'Those,' said one resident bitterly, showing me mountains of
woodchips on the dock at Bunbury, 'are our forests.'
To visitors' eyes, however, there seems to be plenty of forest left. At one
end of the industry is Bunnings, the timber and hardware store giant whose
name above the sawmill seems to proclaim dominion over Pemberton town. At
the other end is a man I met happy and dusty in a pile of shavings, who
empathises with his craft and his environment and does not seem hell-bent on
making a fast buck.
With a studio home on the forest doorstep overlooking Pemberton and a garden
full of chickens and vegetables, the life of Peter Kovacsy, a woodcarver and
turner, seems to epitomise the Perth city-dweller's rural dream.
But Kovacsy understands hard work and professionalism. He is a
perfectionist. He also respects the source that supplies him. He uses mostly
waste wood salvaged from the forest floor to produce the highest quality
bowls, boxes and furniture. Jarrah is an especially beautiful native wood,
being rich red.
Kovacsy transforms burls - basically, huge clotted deformities of the tree -
sculpting them into abstract 'forest free-forms,' or slicing them into
table-tops revealing chaotic whorls and chinks of daylight. His woodcraft is
visual, tactile and fragrant, from the workshop tang of green timber to the
perfume of a finished sandalwood bracelet.
Reaching the Karri Valley Resort too late to appreciate anything but frogs
yodelling somewhere beneath the floor, I discovered next morning that my
room was perched on stilts above a trout lake (trout farming began around
Pemberton in the 1930s). Across the water, huge trees cast ribcage
reflections. Through Beedelup National Park spangled blue fairy wrens
crossed my path and scarves of gum bark floated down.
I decided I could not improve upon the serenity by joining the resort's
games, organised for Australia Day, which included the 'pie and sauce throw'
and 'pin the thong on the yobbo.' Thongs here are not g-strings but sandals
of the type the Brits call flip-flops - regulation footwear for that
archetypal Aussie yobbo, the ocker.
I did not scale Pemberton's Gloucester Tree, either, due to cowardice. At 60
metres this spiral-runged karri is the world's tallest fire lookout tree.
Spotter planes have made most watchtowers redundant. Winter rainfall here is
substantial - many towns' names end in 'up,' the Aboriginal word for water -
yet summer desiccates the forest dangerously. I passed minor bushfires near
Nannup; a week later serious blazes occurred throughout the south-west.
Yet the native flora has evolved with fire a part of its natural cycle; as a
result, eucalypts regenerate from charred wood with defiant speed. In
Walpole's Valley of Giants, one tingle tree has a gutted trunk so big that
people used to park cars inside it until soil erosion necessitated fencing
it. Healthy leaves still crown the empty hulk.
Even a lighthouse can cause bushfire. Rather as you focus sun through a
magnifying glass to burn the back of somebody's neck, so Cape Leeuwin's
lighthouse lens could ignite coastal scrub by reflection - if it was not
curtained by day. Cape Leeuwin, near Augusta, is where the Southern and
Indian Oceans collide across reefs. On the beach stands a petrified
water-wheel.
From Nannup to Augusta the forest gradually resumes normal proportions, with
yellow bull banksia and she-oak that sighs in the wind like a waterfall.
From Augusta towards Margaret River you re-enter karri country with an
under-storey of peppermint trees.
Parallel with the coast and Bussell Highway, the much quieter Caves Road
gives access to subterranean stalactite extravaganzas like Jewel Cave and
small bright white beaches, some deserted even on the year's busiest
weekend. Margaret River's Prevelly Park is popular, however, particularly
with surfers.
Surfer Jack, 18, gave me a crash introduction to his sub-culture. Second to
surfing he listed his pleasures as: doing sadistic things with fish-hooks to
marauding gulls; abusing fluoro-clad novice surfers; peeing in his wet-suit
in the cold Margaret surf; smoking dope and 'generally getting wasted.'
Illegal marijuana plantations flourish in the green south-west. The curative
properties of salt water, Jack reckoned, combat the results of excessive
hooch.
Margaret River is where excess, or at least indulgence, beckons everywhere;
you need lots of pocket-money and no self-discipline. Good restaurants,
coffee-houses and galleries hide in the middle of the bush with only a
discreet signpost inviting you down gravel tracks. Discovering Boranup
Gallery, a rammed-earth construction full of ceramics, furniture and
paintings, deep in the forest off Caves Road, is literally a treasure-hunt.
There are berry farms, stonefruit orchards, cheese factories and hatcheries
for indigenous freshwater crayfish. But it is the wineries that really
dominate the area.
Viticulture was established in the 1960s purely on theoretical advice, after
an agronomist found that the total annual sunshine compared favourably with
Bordeaux. Soon, Margaret River was producing award-winning premium wines.
I began tasting at 10am. Seven wineries later, I wished I had had the
constraint to spit in the bucket from the outset. The sun became soporific
and dead kangaroos by the roadside began to look snuggly and cuddlesome,
like furry animal pyjama-cases.
Every winery has its own atmosphere. Many are small, family concerns
crushing less than 100 tonnes of grapes a year. Some, such as Ribbon Vale,
are basic and unadorned, using nothing but the fine quality of the wine to
lure visitors. Others enhance their individuality with additional
attractions.
Happ's Misty Ridge houses a pottery in its mud-brick buildings; Brookland
Valley vineyard has a gallery devoted to wine arts and limited edition
prints celebrating everything from the grape itself to Bacchus. Leeuwin
Estate takes its association with the arts even further. A 1985 open-air
performance by the London Philharmonic Orchestra was the first annual
Leeuwin Concert on the lawns above Boodjidup Brook. Leeuwin Estate also has
an impressive collection of contemporary art, comprising many leading
Australian painters; all the paintings have featured on Leeuwin's 'Art
Series' bottles.
The art of the wine label seems a microcosm of the whole south-west - a fat,
fertile, creative region which satisfies both the gastronome and the
aesthete.
The south-west tip's Mediterranean climate is ideal for those who find
summer elsewhere in Western Australia too hot. Karri Valley Resort is
central for exploring Pemberton and much of the south coast. Its log cabins
have wood stoves - axes are provided, you chop your own wood - but no radio
or TV, so you can forget the world.
In Pemberton, Peter Kovacsy runs workshops for beginners or professionals
wishing to improve their woodcraft. About 30 Margaret River wineries are
open to the public.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Gardening: Sound advice on the merits of a sage - Robin Lane
Fox explores the multi-faceted salvia family
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATURALLY, gardening columnists know what they are talking about but, this
week, I feel as if I am launching on to half-explored waters, hoping that I
can encourage you to join the journey. The aromatic signposts point to S for
salvia, the family of garden sages. I suppose I should offer you sage
thoughts, sage advice and proven sagacity, but there are now so many
varieties that, like most of you, I am lost.
I do know one sage fact: you can always tell a salvia by stroking it. Every
single one of them has a rectangular stem, a regularity which you can feel
but not see. I also share a sage prejudice. Salvias have been given a bad
name by one stiff and harsh variety. Do not condemn them all because of
those plumes of severe scarlet flower on the bedding salvias which are so
popular in Europe and the worst of Britain in Bloom. These varieties are a
tiny fraction of a superior family and are no more typical than red-hot
pokers are typical of pokers at large.
Grand gardens now use dozens of types of sage to carry their borders into
autumn. I am backing them as one of my top families for the next ten years
of original planting. Most of the best forms are not completely hardy in
Britain, but they seem to be ignored almost everywhere else. At Villandry,
one purple-blue bedding sage called salvia Victoria has found its way among
the ornamental cabbages. In warm European gardens, we ought to be able to do
better than that. Salvias are naturals for expatriate pots and dusty
borders, but gardeners in hot weather seem slow to exploit them.
Last year, my eyes were opened by the range of salvias in the care of Jimmy
Hancock, the National Trust's head gardener at Powis Castle. Short spikes of
glowing red-orange or deep, vivid blue brought colour and a long season to
Powis's long borders and large urns: I coveted the deep blue salvia
cacalifolia and the short orange spikes of confertiflora. The blue one has
just burst into flower among the fuschias in a huge pot of my own. Neither
of these forms is hardy, but they are perpetuated easily from cuttings taken
now and sheltered indoors during winter. If you live within scenting
distance of the Mediterranean, these two salvias ought to be spectacular.
So are the reds - not the reds with stiff plumes of flower from seed but the
reds with small, hooded flowers on plants which grow into nearly-hardy
shrubs. This year, I am growing several, but the best is one called
microphylla Newby Hall. The leaves and flowers are larger and the scarlet
red is particularly clear. It will not survive a hard English winter,
although it is named after one of Yorkshire's finest gardens.
Another good scarlet form is neurepia, which also is a wonderful flower;
grahamii is almost hardy, although I still muddle-up their names. Is
grahamii the nearer of the two to a cherry red ? Certainly, they both root
with ridiculous ease from cuttings and I cannot think why we do not use them
for bedding out as broad bushes at their best from early August onwards.
There is no point in buying big plants of these salvias this month as they
are not safe in autumn frosts. What you need is a cutting from an older
plant which you can root now in a pot and keep indoors until next May. All
the blues and hooded reds are worth this small effort, as is the tall
sky-blue salvia guaranitica and a particular charmer called discolor, the
flowers of which are a mixture of black and pale green.
Up to this point I know what I am doing, but sages are not standing still.
New ones keep turning up from fresh collections in the fields. In 1987,
visitors to China brought back a tall form called Przewalskii which has blue
spikes and is said to be hardy. In 1990, a colony of pink cousins was
discovered in Yunnan and is being released into the trade, although the
colours may vary.
Half-hardy sages are not even half the story. Hardy ones are multiplying
also and, once again, I am struggling to keep up. After four years of
experiments, I can see there is merit in one called blancoana, which spreads
widely with pale grey leaves and spikes of pale lavender blue. On dry soil
it is certainly hardy, and would combine well with many of the older shrub
roses. To my eye, the flowers are a bit too feeble, best suited to a
pussy-cat planting of pastel pinks and pale mauves. Pussy-footers would also
like two of my recent acquisitions called Amethyst and Purple Rain. They are
thought to have a great future, but I find their spikes of gentle
pink-purple too muted for my taste.
Out in deep water, new catches await all of us. What about the meadow sage,
pratensis, which has a special form called Lapis Lazuli with flowers that
are pink, not blue? What about bulleyana, which is said to be coarse with
flowers of purple and yellow? I know some of the special forms of the
violet-purple sages which are hardy in borders: May Night shows the usual
lack of logic by flowering until October if you dead-head it. But what about
Rose Queen, which has flowers of pale pink and ruby above grey leaves: is it
really hardy, as my supplier has just assured me?
Expert fellow-travellers know their square-stemmed sages by touch: with my
eyes shut, I certainly know one which happens to be essential to every
garden. Now is the right time to be planning your salvia turkestanica for
next year. It is just setting seed and, if you sow it outdoors, it will grow
on for transplanting early in spring and will then give you a huge spire of
mauve and white flowers late in June to a height of 3 ft.
It is so good because it continues to look pretty even when the flowers have
faded and died. You cannot possibly miss it. It has the most mysterious
scent: the pungent flavour of hot humanity in a crowded space. Whatever the
future holds in this family, this fine variety is one which I will always
recognise a mile off.

FT  15 AUG 92 / How To Spend It: Edinburgh's festival of bargains - Take a
break from the arts and go shopping. Liz Joseph suggests a tour of the best
Scotland's capital has to offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIZ JOSEPH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVEN WITH its reputation for sound money Edinburgh actively discourages
thrift in August with a range of attractive 'products' to tempt Festival
shoppers.
For traders, this is the pivotal point of the financial year - the make or
break month. So, like the hundreds of thespians flooding into the city for
the Festival and Fringe, the stores have polished up their acts.
The city's shops are looking at their best and you could find that you and
your money are easily seduced as that grey, douce old lady Edinburgh rouges
her cheeks and hoiks up her skirts for one the world's greatest arts
festivals.
The discerning shopper will first visit Jenners, the oldest independent
department store in the world, and then find that it pays to go off the
beaten track into the many interesting by-ways.
From the West End with its bustling clutter of tiny shops to the sadly
rundown Royal Mile with its untidy litter of street traders, Edinburgh shows
many faces. Explore the gorgeous Georgian New Town and visit Stockbridge on
its northern Bohemian fringes, where so many shops specialise in the old,
and then climb the Mound to the Old Town and the Grassmarket, where the new
rubs shoulders with the antique.
Begin in the New Town at Jenners, 48 Princes Street (031-225-2442), which
has authentic tartans, cashmeres and lambswool, high fashion knitwear, as
well as fine glass and china. Visit the splendid food hall which boasts
Scottish shortbreads, preserves and mustards and, until September 7, A Taste
of Scotland promotion offering the opportunity to taste some of the
country's best foods and wines.
Then head for the West End. William Street and neighbouring Stafford Street
are renowned for their small delicatessens and wee shops specialising in
everything from superb teas and coffees and designer labels fashions, to
fresh fish and inexpensive toys, to chic little art galleries and
restaurants.
At the Better Beverage Company, 43 William Street (031-226-6617) David
Halbert sells freshly roasted coffee from five continents, as well as a
pot-pourri of teas and treats such as chocolate-coated coffee beans and
teapots and coffee makers.
Flying Colours Gallery, 35 William Street (031-335-6776) is Jane
Houldsworth's lively gallery deals in work by contemporary Scottish artists,
such as exquisite watercolours of Auld Reekie by Caroline Buchanan (until
August 29) and Jane Rutherford's colourful gouaches and etchings of the
Brazilian rainforest (September 2-30).
Belinda Robertson Cashmere, 22 Palmerston Place (031-225-1057) creates
covetable cashmere. Robertson drapes, folds and accessorises her cashmere
designs into smart day wear and sophisticated evening wear. Cardigans cost
around Pounds 185; matching leggings, Pounds 95; and a cashmere cape, Pounds
300; discounted styles from Pounds 35 are often available.
Further east lie Thistle Street, with its antique shops and fashion clothes
and shoe shops, and the elegance of George Street, where there are several
fine art galleries.
The Scottish Gallery, 94 George Street (031-225-5955) celebrates its 150th
anniversary with an exhibition which includes work by Sam Bough, Orchardson,
McTaggart, Crawhall, Peploe, Fergusson, and Bellany. The crafts gallery
offers ceramics and wood, and jewellery by designers such as Cynthia
Cousens, whose metalwork designs are currently on show.
Across St Andrew Square at 15 North St Andrew Street is one of Edinburgh's
oldest shops. Cunningham &amp; Co (031-556-5142), the hatter, was founded in
1817. Here you will find trilbies, bowlers, caps, panamas, a bespoke
tailoring service from a wide range of cloths including cashmere and Kinloch
Anderson tartans, and scarves and ties.
As you make your way down into Stockbridge visit Howe Street with its
interior design shops selling Russian imports, tiles, fine linens, and, at
InHouse (No 28, 031-225-2888), furniture and lighting, as well as Charles
Rennie Mackintosh-style chairs and the Phillipe Starck toothbrush.
The Kimono Company, 3 Carlton Street (031 332 1519), has antique kimonos,
haori jackets and happi coats in silk or cotton. Prices range from around
Pounds 25 to around Pounds 100.
Montresor, 35 St Stephen Street (031-220-6877), is an Aladdin's cave of a
shop. It houses a dazzling display of art deco and art nouveau costume
jewellery, antique lighting, paste, cut glass and Bakelite designs by
Chanel, Schiaparelli, Dior, Givenchy and Norman Hartnell.
Galerie Mirages, 46a Raeburn Place (031-220-6877) has a huge selection of
woven and embroidered textiles, old silks, kilims, wall hangings, antique
furniture and boxes from Afghanistan, Indonesia, Nepal and Egypt. Until
September 19 there is a selling exhibition of arts from Java, Lombok and
Bali, including masks, puppets, musical instruments and antique carvings, as
well as tribal jewellery and snake chains from India, Puntek beads from
Burma, traditional Afghan jewellery, amber pieces from Arie Vardi and Shula
Shek's intricate collection of silverwork. Prices range from Pounds 2.50 to
Pounds 300.
North West Circus Place offers antique shops where prices compare favourably
with London. But the dedicated bargain-hunter will find many an art deco,
and other, gem can be uncovered at the festival's Grassmarket Fair, 'behind'
the Castle. The fair is on August 15, 22 and 29, from 10am to 4.30pm. Worth
a visit while you are in the vicinity is Mallinson's old curiosity shop,
whose mutton-chop whiskered proprietor is a noted source of coins, military
bric-a-brac, old beer bottles and other eclectic delights, arranged in no
particular order.
Azteca, which has branches at 5 The Grassmarket (031-229-9368) and 16
Victoria Street, sells a range of Mexican folk crafts, including hand-blown
glass, Peruvian and Mexican jewellery, Guatemalan textiles and clothes, and
a superb collection of rustic Mexican furniture, intricately carved with
traditional motifs. Telephone for details of mail order catalogues.
The Arch Leather Company, 88 Grassmarket (031-220-6474) is all that is black
and silver and desperately groovy. Recycled leather jackets lined with old
scarves, from Pounds 99 to Pounds 275; suede shift dresses, Pounds 108;
Fiorelli fun handbags, from less than Pounds 16; and Hi-Tek's amazing
inside-out watches and silver jewellery.
Robert Cresser, 40 Victoria Street (031-225-2181) is a brush maker bristling
with ideas. Here you can buy everything from a tiny shoe brush or a natural

FT  15 AUG 92 / Gardening: Not just a queen for a day - Arthur Hellyer
enjoys a book on the Hemerocallis family
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS always an accolade for a family of plants to have a book devoted
entirely to it. This has just happened with Hemerocallis, Day Lilies, the
simple title of Walter Erhardt's new book published by Batsford (Pounds
17.99).
Such specialist books can prosper only when there is a considerable body of
interest in the plants and, although the sale of day lilies in Britain must
still be minute compared with the US, many people do grow them. With the
introduction of new colours and better performance, that number is likely to
increase, for day lilies are easy to manage.
The main thing holding back expansion in the UK is the reluctance of the big
commercial producers of hardy herbaceous perennials to grow more than a few
(mostly old) varieties. For almost anything new, you must search among the
small specialist nurseries, of which there are a dozen or so for day lilies.
The existence of the Plant Finder has made this task much easier.
There are also three national collections of hemerocallis which are spaced
out nicely. One is in the south-west at Antony House, Tor Point, Cornwall, a
National Trust property. Two others are in public parks - one at East Court
House, Ewell, Surrey, and the other under the control of Leeds city
council's department of leisure services, 19 Wellington Street, Leeds, West
Yorkshire.
Perhaps most useful of all is the excellent permanent trial of day lilies in
the Royal Horticultural Society's garden at Wisley, Surrey, where awards are
given for garden excellence and the naming is very good.
It is no surprise to learn that day lilies have been grown for centuries in
Chinese gardens, for they originate in Asia and Chinese gardeners always
have been quick to pick up good plants. But day lilies have been grown in
the UK since the 16th century, so Britons have had time to get used to them.
The trouble is that the wild species are not themselves particularly
exciting. It is the increasingly complex hybrids made from them, largely in
America, that are most attractive. There is now a bewildering array of
varieties which must be whittled down to manageable proportions by trials,
such as those at Wisley, and by individual growers.
It is easy to get the wrong ideas about day lilies - for example, that their
flowers last for only a single day (which is what the popular name implies).
Erhardt distinguishes three distinct types of flowering which he calls day
blooming, night blooming and extended blooming.
Clearly, the night flowering kinds are not wanted for gardens although they
might have some use in breeding programmes if they have some desirable
quality. Most of the species, and also the older garden varieties, are day
blooming. Somewhat chillingly, Erhardt says that, as a rule, the flowers of
these last long enough to allow you to form an opinion about their worth
even if you are out at work during the day.
However, since many of these species are not really plants for evening
gardeners, the extended flowering types are being sought with increasing
eagerness. With these, Erhardt says, the flowers may last from one morning
until the next or from one evening to the next, which might not be quite so
attractive.
Best of all, and quite possible to obtain, are varieties that open in the
morning and persist until the evening of the second day. I can imagine a
time when all day lilies that are expected to win awards will have to
measure up to this category .
Garden varieties of day lilies now vary enormously in size and shape of
flower, height and habit of growth, and colour. In this last respect, it is
astonishing what has been coaxed out of a family which, in the wild,
produces only yellow and tawny orange glowers.
Now, we take for granted true reds and crimsons, many lovely shades of pink,
apricot, peach and orange, yellows of all kinds and even near-whites
(although, as yet, these are not very satisfactory). There are many
varieties with two or more colours, marked and patterned in various ways.
There are even purple varieties, which some gardeners find very exciting but
seem to me to be rather dull.
One valuable quality of day lilies is their ability to drop faded flowers so
that the plants look smart without the need for daily dead-heading. Unlike
true lilies, day lilies do not make any bulbs and so are planted, like any
other hardy herbaceous perennials, in spring or autumn if moved from the
open ground, or at any time if in containers. They are not fussy about soil
and do not object to lime.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Food: New York greets a dab hand with fish - Nicholas Lander
meets expat Englishman Richard Lord, a true fan of all things piscine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN New Yorkers finally appreciate the pleasures of eating fresh fish, and
when most of the world's 28,000 different species of fish are classified for
their taste as well as their bone structure, a big vote of thanks will be
due to Englishman Richard Lord and his encounter with an article in the
Financial Times.
Lord, now 33, recalls the occasion. Driving on holiday to Cornwall - parents
in the front, children, bored, in the back - Lord handed his son an article
on aquaculture telling him flippantly that it might provide him with a
future.
Lord junior was hooked. At school he did a field project on aquaculture and
spent his summer holidays working on a trout farm. When his mother, Shirley
Lord, moved to America to work, Lord turned his attention to the waters off
Alaska and then enrolled on the fisheries programme at Humboldt State
University in northern California.
He confesses to not having been the university's best student but Lord's
enthusiasm and love of fish, as well as a phenomenal memory for fish
minutiae, may prove even more valuable. During the two hours I spent
listening to him, the facts never stopped. Did I know that there are 385
species of grouper? That the butterfish, particularly prized among the West
Indian community, passes through three colour phases in its life (from red
to yellow to brown), or that the male parrot fish is an hermaphrodite?
Lord knows the answers because, after leaving California, he moved to New
York and became information officer for the Fulton Fish Market, New York's
biggest and oldest. He worked with importers and wholesalers, with the
Chinese, Koreans and Japanese who buy for their shops and restaurants, and
with those of Indian, Spanish and South American origin who buy fish in a
big way to eat at home.
Wholesalers would acknowledge his expertise and come to him with unusual
fish. Only the salary, Dollars 13,000 (Pounds 6,800) per annum, brought this
enjoyable episode to a close. Lord is now hoping to produce an encyclopedia
of seafood. He has catalogued and eaten more than 1,000 species of fish. Any
unusual specimen quickly finds its way into his apartment where he
photographs it, fillets it, examines its bones, analyses its skin and
texture and finally cooks and eats it.
Lord hands the skeleton on to the manager of the fish collection at the
American Museum of Natural History. No part of any fish is wasted.
Being in New York has been a great advantage, says Lord. The city's
cosmopolitan nature, high standard of living and its citizens' willingness
to pay high prices for top quality fish have made his work interesting. So,
too, has New York's geographical position. Whereas the top fish markets of
Europe - Paris, Madrid and London - draw stock from Mediterranean and
Atlantic waters and increasingly from those around Africa, New York draws
its fish from Canada, the Pacific and from South America.
Tuna from Ecuador, black grouper from Venezuela, long fin pomfret from the
coast of Florida and mahe mahe from Hawaii are now as common as cod, halibut
or Dover sole to Lord.
Lord hopes to broaden his knowledge so that he can bring buyers and sellers
of fish together from Europe and America and pursue a writing career for
trade magazines. With his eye for detail he should succeed. As we shared a
taxi downtown he spotted a van, delivering fish to a New York restaurant.
Within seconds his pen and notebook were out taking their details.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Food: Smoke over the Irish sea - The varying quality of
cured salmon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DINISH ISLAND is a few miles off the coast of Kerry; not far from those grim
Skellig Rocks where Irish monks kept European civilisation warm during the
most sombre moments of the Dark Ages.
Our lifeboat had come to a halt some 100 yards from the Irish shore and we
had transferred to a dinghy for the rest of the journey. The boat went
aground on the soft, yellow sand of the island, leaving a yard or so of
water to cross.
Those women in the party who were not wearing stockings were able to remove
their shoes and wade ashore; with varying degrees of success, the men leapt.
Once settled on land we were able to look back at the magnificent Kerry
coastline. Around us grazed a few untended sheep and a great many
uninhibited snails.
But we had not come for the snails. Just off Dinish Island is one of
Ireland's larger salmon farms owned by Salmara Fisheries. Here in the warm,
Gulf Stream waters of southern Ireland salmon grow to maturity rather more
quickly than they do in Scotland or Shetland: a minute smoult will achieve a
saleable weight of 3.5 kilos in just under 14 months. These waters are also
some of the least polluted in Europe. As with the better farms on Shetland
the salmon live far out to sea and inhabit spacious pens to give them a
semblance of life before death.
Irish salmon is far less well known in Britain than its Scottish equivalent.
Exports go chiefly to France, America, Germany and Spain. This must be, to
some extent, a result of an inbuilt prejudice on the part of the British
consumer as the fish can be quite magnificent. I well remember my own first
experience of Irish smoked salmon in the Champagne Bar at the Curragh
race-course. At the time I thought it was the best I had ever eaten.
The Curragh salmon was probably a wild fish. I recall its irregular texture
and the presence of the occasional blood clot. Both these factors now count
as faults in salmon. Idiosyncratic patterns in the flesh relegate the fish
to the pate manufacturers; the fish are systematically bled, although most
knowledgable people in the restaurant business admit that the blood
contributed massively to the flavour.
Pretty patterned flesh is not the sole prejudice which currently gnaws at
the quality of smoked salmon. The need to produce a pretty pink colour
determines the feed of the fish on the farms. Yet, as Remi Benoit (a French
man who owns a smokery near Kenmare) points out, possibly the best smoked
salmon was an ivory white fish from Denmark. The lack of pigment came from
the absence of krill in the Baltic. I have eaten similarly white, but
distinctly oily, smoked salmon in Poland, the oil marking it down as a
farmed fish.
Before the days of refrigeration not only was the fish wild, but the cure
was much heavier to prevent the fish from going off. In our own days we have
seen the removal of this crust, and the trend towards less smoke and salt.
With this modern cure we now experience far more of the flavour of the fish.
Smoked salmon has long since ceased to be a luxury food, and this is very
largely as a result of the mad enthusiasm to create fish farms which has
affected all the more remote corners of the British Isles. Many of these I
feel will come to grief: the prices for salmon are now at rock bottom, with
the margins all being made by the middle men. Stylistic uniformity is also a
problem: one is beginning to regret the passing of the old fashioned cures
which used to abound in certain places, notably in the East End of London.
One highly individual salmon I experienced recently was introduced to me by
my sister. The fish comes from North Uist where it is smoked over a good
deal of peat by George and Rosemary Jackson. The result has the pungency of
a bonfire and I recommend that you eat it with a good, peaty Islay malt
whisky: Lavagulin would be the best.
For anyone whose palate has become saturated with smoked salmon over the
last couple of months, a good alternative is smoked sevruga sturgeon. The
flesh of the sturgeon is very dense and meaty, and lacks the slightly sickly
oiliness of so much farmed salmon. The London restaurant Bibendum, both in
its downstairs fish bar and upstairs in the restaurant, is promoting smoked
sevruga sturgeon accompanied by a portion of sevruga caviar and a glass of
champagne. As a light lunch it sounds like civilisation itself.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Food: All white on the night - Cookery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUMMER brings its own problems for the cook. The sun shines and menus cruise
merrily on a greedy wave of simple foods sauced with such classics as
mayonnaise, hollandaise and avgolemono, before you wake up to the fact that
the fridge is filling up with leftover egg whites.
Why is it, I wonder, that the discovery of them acts as an instant memory
wipe? The mind goes as blank as a computer screen when the electricity is
cut. All recollection of recipes that use more egg whites than yolks is
deleted, and the cook is left grappling feebly with the temptation to chuck
all that slippery albumen down the sink.
For such occasions here is an aide memoire to pin on to the kitchen
noticeboard, a reminder of a few good ways to employ a leftover egg white -
or two, or three - and a recipe that makes such enthusiastic use of egg
whites that it will probably not only swallow up your entire nest egg of
accumulated whites but make you crack into fresh eggs as well - and so
enable you to revert to the mayonnaise, hollandaise and avgolemono cycle . .
.
Egg whites will keep in the fridge for three days providing the eggs are
very fresh, providing your fridge is as cold as it should be (0` to 5`C),
and providing small airtight containers are used. If a lot of air is trapped
in the container along with the egg white, staling will be rapid. Egg whites
can also be frozen for up to six months.
If you cannot remember how many egg whites you put into a container, measure
the contents: two tablespoons equal one egg white.
Egg whites are essential to coeur a la creme, apple (or apricot or damson)
snow, pavlovas and meringues of all kinds. They give sorbets good texture,
can be used to frost grapes and other fruits prettily, and will clarify
consommes and fruit jellies. Whisked egg whites added to batters make the
lightest of pancakes and fritters. Whipped egg whites used instead of cream
make fresher tasting sweet and savoury mousses, and the more egg whites a
souffle contains, the higher it towers.
ANGELCAKE This looks very pretty lightly dusted with icing sugar and
garlanded with sweet geranium leaves. Serve with it a bowl piled high with
fresh berries and a sauce jug of sieved and lightly sweetened berry puree -
say a mixture of blackberries and blueberries, or mulberries when they come
into season. A featherlight angelcake depends on handling the ingredients
very lightly and quickly.
1 oz cornflour; 3 oz plain flour; a good pinch of salt; 10 egg whites; 1/2
lb vanilla or caster sugar; the finely grated zest of 3 oranges; 1
tablespoon lemon juice; 1 tablespoon hot water; 1 teaspoon cream of tartar.
You will need an angelcake pan* or similar mould about 8 1/2 in diameter
across the base, 10 in across the top and 4 in deep with a central funnel
and removeable base. Be sure it is absolutely greaseless.
Sift both flours into a bowl. Add the salt and about one-third of the sugar
and sift the combined ingredients at least twice more, lifting the sieve
high above the bowl to aerate the mixture as much as possible.
Divide the egg whites, lemon juice and water between your two largest mixing
bowls. Whisk the contents of one until foamy, add half the cream of tartar
and whisk again until the egg whites stand in stiff peaks. Use a balloon or
rotary whisk, not an electric one, for maximum volume. Whisk the contents of
the second bowl in the same way, then tip the contents of the first bowl
into the second.
Sift and whisk in the remaining sugar, a spoonful at a time, adding the
citrus zest at the end. Then sift and fold in the flour mixture delicately
yet thoroughly, a little at a time.
Turn the mixture into the mould. Draw a knife through the mixture to release
any large air pockets, and level the surface. Bake at 350`F (180`C) gas mark
4 for 45 minutes or until the surface of the cake feels firm and springs
back when lightly pressed.
Invert the tin on to a cooling rack and leave for 1 1/2 hours or until the
cake is completely cold before lifting off the mould.
*Angelcake pans are usually available from Copperstones, 42a High Street,
Marlborough, Wilts SN8 1HQ (tel: 0672-515074, fax: 0672-512960). This
enterprising kitchenware shop hires out, as well as sells, a good selection
of specialist cookware including raised pie moulds, fish kettles and cake
tins. Mail order available.

FT  15 AUG 92 / A heavyweight of the Basque stones: Inaki Perurena,
superstar of an ancient sport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HENDERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BASQUE pavement artists draw just one living person. Not a politician or
pop star. Nor Basque Miguel Indurain, winner of cycling's Tour de France in
1991 and 1992. The immensely powerful figure that looms between the
religious scenes and Mona Lisas is that of another Basque, Inaki Perurena,
holder of the world's most outstanding lifting records.
Perurena lifts in the Basque style and is therefore comparatively little
known internationally, but the style of lifting - raising traditional,
carefully cut stones from the ground to the shoulder with most competitions
decided by repetitions in a tight time schedule - in no way lessens
Perurena's achievements.
Basque lifting is a demanding, ancient sport, much older than orthodox
weightlifting, closely supervised and widely followed; in summer, 50 and
more competitions can take place on the same day.
Perurena's achievements stretch credulity: supreme records, unbeatable for
15 years and for nearly as long, as a direct result of his dominance,
without direct competition; one of the few both to have dominated a sport
and to have revolutionised its technique and training.
What puts Perurena ahead of Indurain is the fact that he has given more than
5,000 demonstrations, sometimes two or three a day, in just about every
Basque town and village (as well as in the US, Argentina, Japan, France,
Germany and Italy), usually as the highlight of a programme of Basque
traditional sports.
Perurena is a modest, at times, almost shy man, but well aware of his
achievements. He is serious-faced, but with a deep chuckle never far away.
He can show exasperation, but has the Basque's approachability. He has a
rapport with his fellow Basques and is as instantly recognised  - and
admired - in the remotest hamlet as he is in the docks of Bilbao or the
elegance of San Sebastian.
The first adjective that came to mind when I saw Perurena was
'non-effusive'. (Basques in repose tend to be non-effusive). I watched
Perurena arrive at a meeting in a well-used van, a powerful but not massive
man (he does not begin to look his 134 kilos), then stand talking to his
driver, unsmiling. The second adjective was cat-like. He walked from the van
towards a group of other competitors, then grinned and suddenly leapt a pile
of logs to join them.
Perurena's power needs time to sink in. His two-handed record for the
rectangular stone (from the ground to the shoulder) is 315 kilograms, more
than half the weight of a small van. His one-handed record is 263kg.
When the American powerlifter Dwayne Selby bench pressed 300kg and the
Belarussian weightlifter Leonid Taranenko - the silver medallist in the
superheavyweight class in Barcelona - clean and jerked 266kg for world
records in their disciplines, they each made the lifts once. When Inaki
Perurena first lifted 300 kilos he raised the stone three times in the
allotted four minutes. Had his third lift not almost sent the stone clean
over his shoulder he would have achieved a fourth repetition. Only supreme
strength and skill saved him from serious injury.
Perurena met with reserve when he decided that a lifting technique used for
over 200 years was unscientific, and changed it. He he also adapted the
weight training methods of orthodox lifters. Until then, Basque lifters had
trained principally on hill walking and hearty eating. More weight, so they
reckoned, equalled more power.
Perurena is not perfect (and would hate to be portrayed as such). Among
other things, he is not king of the small stones - in Basque lifting, stones
up to 200 kilos are classified, with deadpan nonchalance, as small. He is
also less than perfect at subterfuge.
His strong-willed father, once a top aizkolari (log cutter with an axe)
wanted Inaki to follow in his footsteps. Inaki wanted to be a lifter. For a
while Perurena cut logs by day and lifted by night. Inevitably he was
caught. His love affair with his wife, Mayte, almost never started. She was
not certain that she wanted a flashy (as she then saw him) sportsman
husband. Her parents were certain that they did not want such a son-in-law.
When Perurena finally persuaded Mayte to meet him in a neighbouring village
they were seen within minutes.
Perurena learned about gamesmanship the hard way. Early in his career, he
accepted a challenge match, the hard edge of Basque traditional sport, went
into strict training, and just happened to meet a member of the other camp
in his favourite bar. 'Our man thinks he can beat you without training. He's
drinking too much. I've lost money I haven't got', was the morose message.
Perurena also began to spend more time in bars. When he arrived for the
match he found an opponent in peak condition; and lost.
For someone who has given over 5,000 demonstrations, Perurena's firm, 'I am
not a professional,' at first seems illogical. He earns a good living from
his exhibitions. He could, though make a lot more. But he has never had to
lift to live. Years ago he opened a butcher's shop as insurance against
sickness or injury, then added an equally successful livestock business.
Perurena is 35, he will continue to give demonstrations, but an era has
ended. 'A man cannot break records for ever', is how he recently
acknowledged that commitments elsewhere mean that he can no longer undertake
the training necessary to attack his own records.
One wonders if Perurena is not secretly glad to have escaped the treadmill
of expectation that 15 years of record breaking have created. He is unlikely
to say, but his reputation, his near immortality in the Basque country was
assured long ago. Indurain can continue to outride everybody else. But for
the foreseeable future, the shrewd men of Basque art will continue to draw
just the one living person. It is a unique hall of fame.

NEW CRISES create new reputations, yet old images take time to fade. The
Berliner Zeitung was thinking along these lines in looking at the
ramifications of the Bosnian crisis.
'The cliche of the ugly German is widespread among other peoples. It has,
unfortunately, been formed by the experience our neighbours have had of us.
But one sits up and listens when, almost overnight, the leaders of opinion
in the US - where mistrust runs deep because of the holocaust - point to
Germany as the example to follow. One rejoices all the more because the
metamorphosis of the German image is linked to a humanitarian question, the
Bosnian refugee tragedy.'
The BZ had no great hopes that the new image would prove durable. On the
other hand the Serbs will have problems in overcoming their new reputation.
People like myself who had worked in Serbia before the present horrors
usually found the natives a cheery bunch with whom one could enjoy a few
laughs and more than a few drinks. Today they are known as the originators
of 'ethnic cleansing.' This ghastly euphemism translates into every known
language and has helped ensure that no cartoonist can attempt a picture of a
Serb without making him a wild-eyed fanatic.
As a result history is being revised; references to Sarajevo naturally
recall that that was where the First World War started; today the
implication is that the Serbs started it - but then Serbia never had much of
an image anyway.
Reputations have become fantastically volatile. Until recently in much of
Europe, the average Spaniard was seen as a feckless poseur, either
attempting to entertain the foreign ladies who aestivate on local shores or
a well-born layabout who can hardly afford a shirt but always sports a
flashy cloak.
Today, after the Olympics, Spaniards, or do I mean Catalans, are seen in a
different light - purveyors of efficiency with a human face. The Italians
have revised their opinion: in Corriere della Sera, Cesare Fiumi unwittingly
reworked the traditional Spanish toast - health, money and love] - 'Pesetas,
practice, preparations. Spain in three words.' The Frankfurter Allgemeine
Zeitung, exclaimed, 'The city of Barcelona is the great victor of these
Games.' The French sports paper, L'Equipe was more cautious: 'It may well be
that one of the great victors of these Games is called Spain.'
The previous week France-Soir had paid the ultimate compliment - the record
haul of French medals could be attributed to the hosts and was a contrast
with French failures at Seoul. 'Now, near to their base, in a familiar
country, the family at hand, the frontier nearby, with no time change, their
minds not elsewhere - the French competitors can concentrate on their
objectives and refine their preparations. On the evidence, the Barcelona
Games inspire them. The food there is abundant and appetising, there is a
cheerful organisation supplying just enough of those snags one needs to feel
in a human environment. In fact the French hate being taken for foreigners.
They need their comforts to feel at home.'
So, by the time it was all over the Spaniards knew they had won. The
headline in El Pais was: 'Barcelona ends the 'best games in history' with 22
Spanish medals.'

HOUSE prices in the south-west have fallen by 40 per cent from the 1988
peak, and the decline appears to be steepening. According to the Halifax
building society, average prices in the region in the second quarter of this
year were 8.5 per cent lower than a year earlier. The equivalent figure for
the first quarter was 7.1 per cent.
Only in Greater London and the south-east did prices fall more steeply.
Since those two regions still provide many potential buyers for West Country
properties, the outlook is for more torpor.
Most agree that much depends on the confidence of first-time buyers.
In Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset, where holiday flats now begin as low as Pounds
18,000, Paul Gass of Abbott &amp; Frost says first-timers in the Pounds
35,000-40,000 range are the most active. 'Two- and three-bedroom
semi-detached and two-bedroom detached houses are moving and the retirement
market has also re-awakened over the past three or four months, with some
inward movement notably from West Midlands and the Home Counties.'
But at Castle Carey in the central east of the county, 90 minutes from
London by rail, agent Sue Bradley Hudson says houses costing between Pounds
100,000 and Pounds 130,000 are selling best. 'Part of the problem is that
some properties are offered at too high a price in the first place and then
have to be reduced. Buyers, having seen many reductions, become reluctant to
sign a contract in case they see a better deal next week.'
At Ilminster, in the south of the county - a stopping-off point for
holiday-makers heading for Devon and Cornwall - Andrew Hale of agent
Lawrence Hale says about half of the buyers this year have come from outside
the area. 'There has been a rise in activity insofar as we have been selling
more than we have been taking on since the election. That has led to certain
shortages. Cottage properties up to, say, Pounds 100,000 and good bungalows
are extremely scarce.
'The problem is that although some people want to trade down and raise some
capital, they feel that they might pocket more money when the differential
is greater. Others simply cannot grasp the fact that property values have
come down.'
Hale says the Ilminster market starts at Pounds 25,000 for a studio or
one-bedroom flat and most activity is centred on sales at less than Pounds
80,000. Second-home buyers looking for small cottages can get particularly
good value, with two bedrooms available at not much above Pounds 40,000.
'In 1988, we could sell a one-bedroom house at Pounds 46,000-48,000 but we
would be hard pressed to achieve Pounds 30,000 today,' Hale adds.
Semi-detached houses are the same, down from perhaps Pounds 75,000 then to
Pounds 50,000 now."
At the higher levels there is, if anything, even more inertia - and some
appropriately brave faces. Robin Thomas, from the Exeter office of Strutt &amp;
Parker, says prices are down by 45-50 per cent from their peak of late 1988
and early 1989.
According to agent Michael Waite, of Sherborne, cash buyers are being
cautious in a soft market. He is, however, getting strong interest in Heale
House, a nine-bedroom property set in nine acres at Curry Rivel to the east
of Taunton which is available at a guide price of Pounds 430,000. Part of
the house dates from 1620 and, he says, a number of inquiries has come from
the Home Counties.
A similar pattern of inquiries is reported by Strutt &amp; Parker for Brympton
d'Evercy, a Grade I-listed house in 25 acres two miles from Yeovil offered
at a guide of Pounds 850,000. For another Pounds 500,000, a buyer would get
the surrounding 470-acre farm.
Humberts' Taunton office recently sold Glebe Court, a Georgian House at West
Monkton three miles north of the county town, where about Pounds 500,000 was
paid by a buyer moving out of London.
Humberts' Richard Pawson has noted a slight increase in activity in the
lower market levels prompted by the imminent return of stamp duty. But
despite some other successes this year, he sees little direct cause for wild
optimism. 'Volume is fairly low across the market and vendors have to
encourage interest. Prices, more than ever, have to be realistic.'
For those seeking it, though, there is perhaps a little good news, even if
it is open to interpretation.
Knight Frank &amp; Rutley International has seen an increase recently in
overseas interest in the upper levels of the market, notably in Stavordale
Priory in Charlton Musgrove, on offer at Pounds 1.6m.
According to Michael de Pelet, of the Sherborne office, inquiries on this
and other properties - such as Burford House at Pilton, available at Pounds
375,000 - have come from as far afield as Hong Kong and the Cayman Islands.
If you accept that investors from such places are well practiced in using
their money to the greatest effect, it could just be a sign that the UK
market really has bottomed out.

THE Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has withdrawn a
request that the HK stock exchange suspend trading in Mr Lee Ming Tee's
flagship Allied Group and nine other companies, Reuter reports from Hong
Kong.
An SFC statement said resumption of trading of the shares, all suspended on
Wed-nesday at the SFC's request, was a matter for the companies to arrange
with the exchange.
It also gave reasons for its request that a government inspector be
appointed to investigate Allied Group and four other companies, citing
concerns about a rights issue from Wai Yick, a property investment group.
Earlier, the government said it had appointed Mr Nicholas Allen, of
accountants Coopers and Lybrand, as an inspector to investigate these
companies.
The SFC said it had investigated possible breaches of the Takeovers Code and
the Securities (Disclosure of Interests) Ordinance.
'These investigations were triggered by concerns about a rights issue
proposed by Wai Yick in January 1992 for the purpose of funding the
acquisition of properties from Allied Properties (HK),' said the SFC. It
said it also investigated un-usual share price movements around the time of
proposals to merge Allied Properties (HK), Allied Industries International
and Asia Securities International with Allied Group.

<TEXT>
MGM, the Hollywood studio now controlled by its French bank creditor Credit
Lyonnais, yesterday posted a second-quarter operating loss of Dollars 37.8m,
compared with a deficit of Dollars 33.9m a year earlier.
MGM is still untangling its balance sheet after being run for nearly a year
by Mr Giancarlo Parretti, the controversial Italian financier who officially
lost control of the studio in December.
Towards the end of Mr Parretti's tenure, film production ground to a virtual
halt at the financially-troubled studio. MGM said its development and
production activities have now started to pick up.
'However, due to the long lead time required for the development and
production of feature films, the effects of these increased activities will
not be fully reflected in the company's results of operations until 1993 and
beyond,' it said.
For the three months to June 30, MGM had a net loss of Dollars 59m, or 98
cents, on revenues of Dollars 195m, against a deficit of Dollars 59.3m, or
99 cents, on revenues of Dollars 208.3m the previous year. Its pre-tax loss
narrowed to Dollars 50.3m from Dollars 62m.
The results were muddied by a one-time items, including about Dollars 20m in
gains from the settlement of litigation and a higher tax provision in the
latest quarter.
For the first six months, MGM had a net loss of Dollars 113.7m, or Dollars
1.89, on revenues of Dollars 493.9m. This compared with a loss of Dollars
159.9m, or Dollars 2.67, on revenues of Dollars 500.8m for last year's
corresponding period.

Datastream operation

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DUN &amp; Bradstreet, the US business information group, is selling its
Datastream International operation to Primark, a Virginia-based holding
company, for Dollars 191m.
Datastream, based in London, provides on-line investment information,
research and portfolio accounting services on securities internationally.
Its revenues in the year to end-November were Dollars 94.5m, and it employs
around 640 people worldwide.
Dun &amp; Bradstreet acquired Datastream in 1984 for Dollars 102m.
The New York-based company tried to sell the operation - with its
Interactive Data subsidiary - in 1990, but called off the auction in
November that year. Yesterday, Primark said it had been a 'very interested'
buyer then. When D&amp;B received renewed inquiries about Datastream this
spring, discussions with Primark restarted.
Until recently, Primark was a utility-based conglomerate. However, under the
chairmanship of Mr Joseph Kasputys, a former acquisitions chief at
McGraw-Hill, it is steadily being transformed in an information services
group.
Primark has already made two recent purchases in this area: Wellmark, an
electronic clinical and financial information system for medical centres and
insurance carriers and The Analytic Sciences Corporation (TASC).
Yesterday, Mr Kasputys said Primark planned to market Datastream more
aggressively in the US, and hoped to expand the information services. He
cited data on 'emerging' stock markets, in the merger and acquisition field,
and added portfolio valuation services as potential growth areas.
He also suggested co-operation between TASC and Datastream could bring
technological improvements.
Under the deal, Primark will pay D&amp;B Dollars 145m in cash, and approximately
Dollars 46m in zero-coupon notes (on an original issue discount basis).
Mellon Bank and Barclays Bank have provided a commitment letter for Dollars
80m of loan finance.
D&amp;B said yesterday that it had no plans to open another auction for its
Interactive Data subsidiary.

FT  15 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Mandatory puzzle for Trimoco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRIMOCO, the motor dealer on the receiving end of a Pounds 25.9m cash offer
from Hartwell, has a semantic problem.
In its offer document, posted on Tuesday, Hartwell which is ultimately owned
by the private Saudi Arabian Jameel Group, described its offer as mandatory.
But some Trimoco shareholders have understood this to mean that they must
accept it.
Trimoco wrote to its shareholders yesterday saying: 'This is not the case.'
Just to emphasise the point it put the phrase in capital letters.
Hartwell's offer arose when it swapped its holding of Trimoco convertible
loan stock into ordinary shares. Adding these to its existing holding of
29.8 per cent of Trimoco's ordinary shares gave it a 39.4 per cent stake.
Under Rule 9 of the Takeover Code, Hartwell was then required to make an
offer. It is, in Takeover Code parlance, a 'mandatory offer'. However, the
compulsion is on the offeror not the offeree. The Takeover Panel does not
feel that this is confusing.
The bid is of 17 1/2 p a share in cash, the market price at the time
Hartwell converted its shares. Trimoco's share price yesterday was unchanged
at 20p.
Observers find it difficult to say if Hartwell's offer is serious. Companies
making Rule 9 offers often hope that they will not be accepted. Hartwell's
offer document is low key, lacking the usual exhortations to accept. Trimoco
is taking it seriously, if only because Hartwell has such a large stake.

FT  15 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Conder loss nears Pounds 23m leaving
negative funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOSSES IN 1991 at Conder Group, the construction and property concern based
in Winchester, grew from Pounds 19.3m to Pounds 22.6m pre-tax and the
unaudited balance sheet at the year-end showed negative shareholders' funds
of Pounds 5.95m.
Mr Alan Lovell, chief executive, said that KPMG Peat Marwick would have
qualified the accounts had they been published. As it was, the auditor was
'unable to express an opinion as to whether or not it is appropriate to draw
up the accounts on the basis that the group is a going concern'.
October 8 is the deadline for publication and Mr Lovell said it was planned
that Conder would have done enough by then for the accounts to be
unqualified.
'Enough' amounted to the sale of IEI, the building services arm providing
mechanical, electrical, ventilation and air-conditioning services on a
design and construct basis.
Mr Lovell said he felt the management was not doing the work of receivers,
though he admitted that IEI was core and its sale 'disappointing'. It would
be sold 'way above' book value, he said, and its sale would repair the
damage to the balance sheet.
He added that the management had already done sufficient to produce 'modest
profitability' in May and June and to make the now smaller group viable at
the moment, though it had made an undisclosed loss in the first half of
1992. Conder was 'operating within facility levels' agreed with NatWest, its
bank. Mr Lovell said an independent future was possible but disposal of the
group was not ruled out.
Turnover tumbled to Pounds 183.4m (Pounds 289.1m) with 40 per cent of the
fall from disposals and 60 from decline in continuing businesses. Operating
profits of Pounds 7.19m turned into losses of Pounds 7m before exceptional
charges of Pounds 6.05m (Pounds 22.2m) which related to the losses of
Elmeta, the closed curtain-walling company, and Pounds 7.12m (Pounds 3.52m)
for property write-downs and rationalisation costs. Losses per share were
54p (39p) and the shares fell from 13p to 8p.

27m at six months

<TEXT>
TRANSATLANTIC Holdings, the life assurance and property group, yesterday
reported a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 34.2m to Pounds 26.6m for the
first hallf of 1992.
The company's dominant shareholders are South Africa's Liberty Life and
France's UAP insurance group. The results were TransAtlantic's first since
obtaining a listing on the London Stock Exchange in the aftermath of its
acquisition of property development group Capital and Counties.
Changes in accounting methods obscured comparisons with the previous year.
Interest on Capital and Counties' Thurrock Lakeside properties was
capitalised in 1991, effectively adding Pounds 15.8m to income in that year.
TransAtlantic's board expressed disappointment with the company's share
price, saying that yesterday's opening price of 188p reflected poor market
conditions rather than the underlying value of the company.
Analysts said that its exposure to property and insurance had weighed on the
price, despite the underlying health of the businesses.
Transatlantic said its property interests, largely in shopping centres, had
held up well, although there had been some pressure on rental income.
Earnings emerged at 5.08p (9.16p) and the interim dividend is a same-again
6p.
Sun Life, the insurance company in which TransAtlantic has a 50 per cent
stake, saw a significant increase in new business with total new premium
income up 39 per cent to Pounds 886.1m. However, premiums may be adversely
affected by Sun Life's decision to limit sales of its single-premium
with-profits bond to Pounds 300m this year.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Baker faces formidable challenge: Latest opinion polls show
Bush continuing to lag behind Clinton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICAL America took stock yesterday of the impact of Mr James Baker's
return to the White House and the messages of a fistful of new public
opinion polls released before next week's Republican convention in Houston.
The polls demonstrated how formidable Mr Baker's task will be to bring
victory in November for President George Bush over Mr Bill Clinton, the
Democratic candidate. But at least they show some narrowing of the gap
between the two.
A Wall Street Journal/NBC survey had the Arkansas governor ahead by 54-36
per cent, while one conducted for USA Today and CNN showed him leading by
56-37 per cent. Both were below his 20 point-plus lead in most other polls.
At the same point four years ago Mr Bush had virtually caught up with Mr
Michael Dukakis.
Both surveys showed Mr Bush's job approval rating at near-historic lows.
Equally disturbing for his party, the Journal/NBC poll found the electorate
more inclined than ever before in the Bush presidency to vote for the
Democrats in Congressional races.
Mr Bush and Mr Baker would also find bleak reading in a compilation by the
newsletter, The Hotline, of the 29 state polls taken since the Democratic
convention last month.
Mr Clinton is ahead in all but one, Utah, where he has nearly caught the
president. In 20 states, with more than enough electoral college votes to
win the presidency, his lead is bigger than the usual margin of polling
error.
Mr Baker's assumption of the political reins was generally welcomed by
Republicans, including those on the right known to distrust him.
Conservative luminaries, including Mr Dan Quayle, the vice president, and Mr
Jack Kemp, the housing secretary, agreed he could bring focus to a
disorganised campaign.
Some of the inherent divisions within the party were re-emphasised yesterday
with the publication of interviews with Mrs Barbara Bush. The president's
wife said she did not think the question of abortion had any place on the
party platform, which, as drafted this week, includes the demand for a
constitutional amendment banning it.
She also criticised Mr Rich Bond, Republican national chairman, for his
personal attacks this week on Mrs Hillary Clinton and said she did not like
the scrutiny of Mr Clinton's private life. But she did think his avoidance
of military service in the late 1960s was a legitimate area of inquiry.
Mr Clinton, meanwhile, continued to take on the president in his presumed
area of strength, foreign policy. In Los Angeles late on Thursday, he said:
'In a world of change, security flows from initiative, not inertia.'
Directly addressing Mr Baker's recitation of administration successes
abroad, he said: 'The notion that the Republicans won the cold war reminds
me of the rooster who took credit for the dawn.' Communism, he went on,
'rotted from the inside out, with heroes both famous and unknown leading the
way'.
'From the Baltics to Beijing, from Sarajevo to South Africa, this president
has sided with the status quo instead of democratic change,' an approach
that would change if he became president.
He cited Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt as men who went to the White
House straight from governorships and who led the country to victory in two
world wars.
It was, he said, all a matter of personal strength, values and judgment.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Banks call Efim loans into default
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOME 150 international banks yesterday called into default their loans to
Efim, the Italian state holding company, marking a further deterioration in
relations between the Italian state and the international financial markets.
The banks had been angered by the Italian government's move last month to
put the holding company into liquidation, and its announcement on Thursday
that banks would receive substantially below market interest rates until
their loans are repaid.
The Italian Treasury expressed surprise at the action. It said banks should
have been well aware of the group's poor financial health, given the
'particularly high' interest rates that were paid on its debt.
Bankers, however, said they regarded Efim as virtually an arm of the Italian
Treasury. One foreign banker, head of a syndicate which lent money to an
Efim subsidiary, said: 'I can't think of the last time a G7 country was in
default on its quasi-state debt. The implications for the republic in the
international financial markets must be severe.'
The default followed a meeting in London on Thursday of banks which lead
Efim's main banking syndicates. They agreed to co-operate, and chose the US
banks Citicorp, Chase, Chemical and Bankers Trust and Mitsubishi Bank of
Japan to co-ordinate their actions.
The formal announcement of default was in part a technical step to protect
the position of the banks. However, its timing, a day after the decree which
set the interest rate on bonds to be issued to creditors, was intended to
signal what one called 'extreme displeasure'.
One member of the co-ordinating group suggested that the move was a warning
that any Italian state holding company could be called into default. They
are already technically in default, having been transformed from state
entities into joint stock companies, although banks have not taken any steps
on this move.
Mr Piero Barucci, the Treasury minister and an ex-banker, noted that, under
the plan to issue bonds to creditors, foreign and Italian banks would
receive equal treatment. 'I hope all creditors will see the Efim problem as
part of the big effort the Italian government is making to reassure
creditors and prepare for all eventualities,' he said.

FT  15 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Modest uplift for Dow as
bonds recover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
A RECOVERY in bond prices and a bigger-than-expected rise in industrial
production failed to lift US stock markets noticeably yesterday, and amid
light summer trading share prices registered only modest gains, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 15.67 at 3,328.94. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended slightly firmer, up 2.23
at 419.96, while the Amex composite closed up 0.09 at 386.82 and the Nasdaq
composite 2.14 higher at 573.13. Turnover on the NYSE was light at 167m
shares, and rises outpaced declines by 1084 to 609.
For the second consecutive day, share prices were unable to break out from a
narrow trading range either side of opening values. The fact that bond
prices bounced back sharply, having fallen more than a point yesterday on
concern about the outlook for reducing the huge federal budget deficit, had
little impact on equities.
The announcement of a 0.4 per cent rise in July industrial production also
failed to stir much interest, in the market, probably because investors
heeded the words of analysts who noted that most of the rise in output was
covered by one-off gains in utility use and mining production.
Among individual stocks, Chrysler fell Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 20 5/8 in
turnover of 1.7m shares on reports that a few banks in a 152-member
consortium are refusing to renew their loans to the carmaker, which could
jeopardise the entire Dollars 6.8bn lending package. In contrast, the other
big manufacturers carmakers were higher, with General Motors up Dollars  3/8
at Dollars 36 7/8 and Ford Dollars  1/2 firmer at Dollars 41 1/2 .
Black &amp; Decker dropped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 18 7/8 in turnover of 1.6m
shares after the broking house, County NatWest, slashed its third quarter
earnings estimate from 38 cents a share to 23 cents a share.
On the American Stock Exchange, ASR Investments dropped Dollars  7/8 to
Dollars 2 7/8 after the company reporting a second quarter loss of 47 cents
a share after a 32 cents a share charge. Last year ASR made a profit of 28
cents a share.
Wang Laboratories, also traded on the ASE, fell Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 1
5/8 in heavy trading on speculation that the company, which has just paid
employees two days early and is still delaying its fourth-quarter results
announcement, may be preparing to file for bankruptcy protection under

after it the company adopted a shareholder rights plan to protect them from
any takeover attempts through 'unfair tactics'.
Somatogen rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 20 1/8 after broking house Merrill
Lynch initiated coverage of the stock with an intermediate rating of 'above
average'.

TORONTO STOCKS returned to a more normal pattern of range trading and light
volume, partly recovering from moderate to heavy losses earlier this week,
dealers said.
The TSE composite index ended up 8.02 points at 3,368.47. Advances led
declines 280 to 233 on a volume of 21.0 m shares valued at CDollars 199.2m.

FT  15 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: BOC lifts on market optimism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REVIVED hope for the near term outlook of the London stock market was
reflected in the strong rise of industrial gases group BOC yesterday. The
company has no significant exposure to Germany whose better than expected
inflation news prompted the rise in the UK market. Neither is it a stock
that usually responds to economic optimism as it is perceived to have
defensive attractions.
However, on a day when the market was short of stock after a fall of seven
consecutive days in the FT-SE 100 index there was a general scramble to buy.
Tightly-traded BOC was also helped by recent encouraging figures and a
subsequent rash of buy notes. Among securities houses recommending the stock
Hoare Govett has been discussing its merits with Scottish institutions and
Smith New Court has been pointing out recent underperformance. The shares
jumped 20 to 620p.
Cadbury easier
Currency worries knocked Cadbury Schweppes as some observers fretted over
the effect of a weak Australian dollar on company earnings. Some 15 per cent
of operating profits are earned in Australia. Cadbury edged a penny lower at
441p.
Yesterday, Smith New Court changed its stance from a buy to a hold and
advised clients with more active funds to take profits. The house also
completed its profits downgrades on Cadbury started on Thursday, forecasting
Pounds 343m for this year, down Pounds 7m and Pounds 374m for 1993, a
reduction of Pounds 14m. SG Warburg trimmed its 1992 estimates to Pounds
347m from Pounds 358m.
Food manufacturers again came in for a bout of profit revisions as analysts
continued their downgrades amid talk of sluggish sales and falling prices.
Dalgety was among yesterday's victims, Credit Lyonnaise Laing reportedly
trimming its estimates. The shares shed 6 to 390p. Low-cost food supplier
Hillsdown fell 7 to 120p as James Capel was said to have cut its forecast.
Talk of more downgrades in United Biscuits failed to materialise but
unsettled the shares, which tumbled 7 to 294p. UB has been under pressure
following worries over trading at its US subsidiary, Keebler.
Magazine publisher Reed International was down as one agency broker pointed
out the relative high price of the shares compared with its sector
stablemate Pearson, publisher of the Financial Times.
James Capel was suggesting that, in the short term, investors might benefit
from switching some of their portfolio from Reed, the group having
outperformed the All-Share index over the past year. Pearson, on the other
hand has underperformed the market over the same period. Both companies are
seen as solid pillars in the media sector but a number of analysts feel that
the potential benefit of Pearson's stake in satellite TV group BSkyB has
been overlooked. Reed was weak all day and closed 4 off at 471p, while
Pearson rallied 3 to 325p.
Insurers saw a two-way pull with some held back by worries over exposure to
mortgage indemnity, while others benefited from recent positive results.
Royal Insurance and Sun Alliance are the companies principally exposed to
covering lenders against losses on sales of repossessed homes. Royal managed
a gain of only a penny to 166p, despite a buy recommendation from County
NatWest which says the stock is 36 per cent below a projected end-of-year
net asset value of 255p.
Sun Alliance fell 5 to 242p following a press report yesterday which said
Sun has more than 20 per cent share of the domestic mortgage indemnity
market. Meanwhile, General Accident jumped a further 22 to 440p following
encouraging results on Tuesday, while Commercial Union recorded a rise of 19
to 477p after good results on Wednesday. Tobacco and insurance group BAT
Industries jumped 23 to 723p.
International conglomerate BTR experienced a volatile session. The shares
shed 5 to 420p early in the day after broker Smith New Court trimmed its
current and following year profits forecasts for the group. Smith downgraded
the current year figure by Pounds 20m to Pounds 930m, and that of the
following year by Pounds 35m to Pounds 1,075m, blaming weakness of the
Australian dollar.
However, the shares bounced back with the market to end 7 up at 420p, on the
day, with turnover reaching 3.5m.
English China Clays jumped 25 to 482p with demand boosted late in the
session by an announcement that the company is to sell its waste disposal
subsidiary. Thursday's buy recommendation from Smith New Court continued to
boost Tomkins where the shares gained another 6 to 422p.
Selected building stocks, which have been among the hardest hit as the
market has fallen, bounced strongly. RMC jumped 11 to 460p, Tarmac 5 to 64p,
Barratt 6 to 54p, Mowlem 8 to 62p and Raine, helped by a push from Hoare
Govett, 9 to 89p.
Glassmaker Pilkington also surged 8 to 87p making it the best performing
stock in the FT-SE 100 in percentage terms.
Disappointment over the estimated level of oil reserves in the Cusiana field
in Colombia held back BP, which is the operator of the field and holds a 40
per cent stake. The shares were down 5 in early trade against a strong
market and closed unchanged at 187 1/2 p.
News from Bimec Industries, the aerospace, waste products and engineering
group, that it will not pay a final dividend, took the market by surprise,
sending the shares tumbling. They closed 12 3/4 down at 6 1/4 p, with one
analyst commenting: 'Too many questions remain unanswered.' A stock overhang
in Hartstone caused a sharp retreat in the shares. They gave up 16 to 129p.
Talk that some brokers were about to drop profit estimates for Greenalls
upset shares in the regional brewer, which were off 7 at the close at 364p.
Grand Met continued its bounce, helped by a renewed push from County
NatWest, the shares jumping 8 to 425p. The stock was also helped by
consideration of the North American Free Trade Pact, the company having
interests in the Mexican market. Also helped were Allied Lyons, up 6 at
603p, and Guinness, ahead 4 at 507p.
Chemicals group British Vita rose 7 to 231p, benefiting from a buy
recommendation by Kleinwort Benson ahead of interim results on September 7.
The securities house pointed to recent underperformance in the shares over
the past three months and expects positive acquisitions in the next year.
Waste management group Attwood was held back after US investment house Alex.
Brown and Sons cut its rating on the company to neutral from buy and lowered
its 1992 and 1993 earnings estimates. The shares were unchanged at 109p.
US buying of pharmaceuticals group Medeva was said to be behind a rise of 18
to 176p. Smith New Court reiterated its buy stance on the stock saying that
currency worries had been overdone.
Spurious talk that Forte was close to a deal on catering subsidiary Gardner
Merchant were dismissed by sources close to the company. The shares rose 6
to 133p.

FT  15 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Inflation news drives equities higher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT BEGAN as another unimpressive session on the London stock market
yesterday took a decided turn for the better after good news on inflation in
Germany and the UK drove share prices sharply higher. Although traders
warned that the advance was led by the futures and involved a good deal of
hasty activity by marketmakers caught on the wrong foot, the gain of 38.8 on
the FT-SE index was the best performance since the end of last month.
The final reading put the Footsie at 2,356.8, contrasting sharply with
earlier readings which saw the index down to the 2,311 area. The turn came,
quite clearly, when the German Federal Statistics Office sent stock markets
ahead across Europe with the news that retail sales had fallen by a real 6
per cent, nominal 2.6 per cent, in June. Almost simultaneously came the
disclosure that the UK retail price index had gained at an annualised rate
of only 3.7 per cent last month, significantly better than forecasts in the
City of London, which had ranged to 4.2 per cent.
The change of tone was first reflected in the stock index futures market,
and soon brought widespread gains among the interest-related stocks. There
were gains in the construction and building sectors which have suffered
severely from the pressures over interest rates, which had been renewed this
week when mortgage rates came into question again.
Also very firm were the retail and store stocks which have been depressed by
the collapse in consumer spending that has been blamed on high interest
rates. At the same time, firmness in the dollar boosted the big overseas
earning stocks.
However, market strategists were cautious of sounding too optimistic in the
wake of yesterday's unexpected gain in the stock market. Share prices were
driven ahead by a shortage of stock, and marketmakers, taken aback by the
suddenness of the upturn, found themselves forced to bid for shares in
markets which have become extremely thin and difficult to trade.
Seaq volume of 449.7m shares compared favourably with the 441.3m of the
previous session. Thursday's retail, or customer, business was worth only
Pounds 816.9m, less than satisfactory for marketmakers. However, Sharelink,
the execution-only broker, said that private investors had been heavy buyers
of UK stocks this week.
Retail business in equities has remained poor, and below last year's daily
average levels, inflated by trading programmes by securities houses.

FT  15 AUG 92 / International Company News: First City Banc plans reshape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST CITY Bancorporation, the troubled Texas bank, yesterday put forward a
recapitalisation plan which, it said, would bring its finances into line
with regulators' requirements. The scheme would involve the disposal of
about one third of the bank's assets.
However, it would not in-volve assistance from the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation, the government agency which oversees the restructuring of
troubled banks.
The FDIC provided almost Dollars 1bn of a Dollars 1.5bn rescue package for
First City in 1987, and has been anxious to avoid a second major cash
injection.
Mr Ivan Wilson, the company's new chairman, claimed that over the past year,
First City had 'achieved significant reductions in the level of problem
assets and resolved its most troublesome litigation'. He said: 'We believe
the combination of these two factors should enable us to attract new capital
without the need for FDIC assistance.'
First City also unveiled second-quarter losses of Dollars 18.5m after tax,
against Dollars 58.9m a year earlier, taking the loss after tax in the first
six months to Dollars 92.3m (Dollars 130m). First City is one of the largest
remaining independent banks in Texas under local ownership. Mr Robert
Abboud, the Chicago banker who led the 1987 bailout, resigned a year ago in
the face of mounting loan losses.
The recapitalisation plan will require approval by regulators and
shareholders. A shareholder meeting has been scheduled for December 8.
Under the proposals, First City would sell 13 of its banks - about a third
of its assets - but retain its banks in the Houston, Dallas-Fort Worth,
Austin, San Antonio, Corpus Christi, Alice, Aransas Pass and McAllen areas.
This move, it estimated, should raise upwards of Dollars 210m, while
renegotiation of some above-market leases and the settlement of certain
guarantees and other obligations to the FDIC, should yield another Dollars
140m of capital. An additional Dollars 100m would be raised by a private
placement of stock and a rights offering to existing shareholders.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US BANKING group Citicorp revealed last night that it has restated its
previously announced second-quarter results from a profit of Dollars 171m to
a profit of Dollars 143m in the wake of an examination of the US mortgage
business by bank regulators that was completed after Citicorp filed its
second-quarter earnings.
Citicorp also confirmed yesterday that it signed an informal memorandum of
understanding with federal regulators earlier this year agreeing to keep
regulators more closely informed of moves by the bank to strengthen its
capital position.
On the issue of its restatement of earnings, Citicorp said that although its
management and its independent auditors had agreed that the original
second-quarter earnings report was consistent with Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles, net income had to be adjusted by Dollars 28m to
reflect the regulators' different judgment on the level of future repayments
of mortgages.
The bank admitted, however, that because of the recent change in interest
rate expectations, it would have taken an identical charge against
third-quarter earnings even with its existing approach to mortgage
valuation.
In a separate accounting move, Citicorp said that it had also changed the
balance sheet classification of Dollars 149m of mortgage properties. The
classification was switched from 'delinquent consumer mortgages' to 'other
real estate owned' to reflect circumstances where the borrower has
effectively relinquished control over the property although foreclose has
not occurred.
The net effect of the change, which Citicorp said had no impact on earnings
because of previously established reserves, has reduced consumer loans at
June 30, 1992 from Dollars 89.5bn to Dollars 89.3bn.
The Student Loan Marketing Association revealed yesterday that it has made a
preliminary offer to acquire the Dollars 2.5bn of guaranteed student loans
owned by Citibank.

THE GRAND TOUR IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
by Jeremy Black
Alan Sutton Publishing Pounds 17.99, 354 pages
IN A FAMOUS passage of his Sentimental Journey, Laurence Sterne mocks the
travellers Smelfungus and Mundungus for the 'spleen and jaundice' with which
they approach things foreign. Those who take a similarly splenetic view of
travel will be encouraged in their moroseness by Jeremy Black's account of
the Grand Tour, which charts a formidably diverse array of difficulties.
He notes that 'tips were a constant drain' and 'venereal disease was indeed
a problem.' 'Some tourists found their drivers and postilions fraudulent,
others simply troublesome.'
The chapter on War, Disputes, Accidents and Crime offers Black particular
freedom to indulge his penchant for disaster: 'Travellers fell down stairs,
had accidents with guns and ran the risk of being knocked over in Paris,
where there was an absence of pavements.'
The Grand Tour in the Eighteenth Century is, however, careful not to ignore
those Englishmen and women who, undaunted by the dangers proliferating
around them as they progressed around Europe, threw themselves into the
pursuit of pleasure. Embarking on a chapter headed Love, Sex, Gambling and
Drinking, Black is at first discomfited by the lack of first-person
descriptions of foreign sexual adventures in 18th century letters and
diaries. He suggests hopefully: 'Some obscure references in journals may be
sexual.' One anonymous tourist referred to being 'introduced to 2B' in July
1754.
Fortunately, such comments are supplemented by the speculations of the
English press. In 1725, Mist's Weekly Journal declares that the experience
of English travellers in Paris 'is generally no more than a journal of how
many bottles they have drunk, and what loose amours they have had.' The
London Journal of 1731 noted: 'It is highly probable that, by means of our
ladies travelling, some of our noble families may be honoured with a French
dancing master's son for their heirs.'
Black displays surprisingly little interest in the more voyeuristic
pleasures of travel. Most 18th century writings about Italy express immense
fascination with the custom of cicisbeism under which a married woman was
expected to form a relationship with a cicisbeo - a male companion who
escorted her to social occasions and devoted much of his time and attention
to her.
The book mentions the enthusiasm with which Englishmen participated in this
custom, and the fears of one English traveller that cicisbeism set a bad
example to Englishwomen in Italy. It says nothing at all, however, about the
elaborate, steamily circumlocutionary speculations of travellers as to
precisely what went on between the woman, the cicisbeo and the husband.
This is typical of Black's down-to-earth approach. At many points in the
book, he clearly is concerned not simply with the activities of English
travellers (overturnings of carriages and dalliances with opera singers),
but also with prevailing impressions of particular regions ('Homosexuality
was regarded in Britain as a foreign vice of Mediterranean origins, as
indeed was sodomy'). Nonetheless, he never shows any inclination to analyse
what Edward Said, in Orientalism, terms 'imaginative geography:' the range
of themes, concepts and descriptive strategies by which one region of the
world is classified as distinct from another.
Black's stolid empiricism does not mean, however, that he allies himself
with the old-fashioned anecdotalists who have dominated the study of the
Grand Tour in the past. He is, if anything, slightly less indulgent towards
the flamboyant, anecdotal digressiveness of travel writing than overtly
'theoretical' writers - who usually harbour a lurking fondness for ribald
detail and striking turns of phrase. (Said, scrutinising 19th century
writings on Egypt, permits himself a moment of mild hilarity at an alarmed
account of the dangers of excessive 'freedom of intercourse' with the
natives).
In contrast to both theorists and anecdotalists, therefore, Black adopts a
tone of extreme sobriety and caution.
The main task which he sets himself is that of assembling evidence. His
comments on his material are restrained to the point of eccentricity: in
many cases, definite conclusions are drawn only when they can be assumed
safely to be unchallengeable.
The travellers whom he cites are themselves so ebullient and irrepressible,
however, that the flatness of the commentary is, in fact, oddly successful
in setting them off. This is a book to which anyone interested in the Grand
Tour will turn for a vast range of carefully ordered material, most of it
from sources not available to the general reader.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Mortgage rates pressure eases - But
the future for home loans looks uncertain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MILLIONS OF property owners in the UK sighed with relief this week on
learning that the large building societies have not followed Skipton, the
14th biggest society, by putting up their home loan rates.
Skipton raised its mortgage interest rate from the industry standard of
10.75 per cent to 11.25 per cent on Tuesday, triggering fears of a more
widespread increase.
Skipton has only 60,000 borrowers compared with Halifax's 1.8m, and the
increase still leaves its rate slightly below most of the centralised
lenders. Some small societies have, unnoticed, been charging this rate for
several months. Nor is the extra which Skipton customers have to pay
particularly onerous - Pounds 165 a year on a Pounds 40,000 mortgage after
tax relief, according to John Goodfellow, Skipton's chief executive.
However, Goodfellow expects other societies to put their rates up before
very much longer. 'I simply do not believe it will be possible for them to
sustain the present standard mortgage rate until the end of the year.'
Goodfellow, and others in the mortgage industry, believe that there may well
be a political upset before very long - possibly triggered by an event such
as a French 'no' vote in the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty - which
will lead to a devaluation and a fall in interest rates.
The alarm seems to have reflected two underlying anxieties. One is that even
a slight increase in mortgage rates would ruin any lingering chance of an
early recovery in the property market, since it would come at precisely the
time that stamp duty has been reimposed by the government on house
purchases. The other problem is a gut fear among the public of a return to
higher interest rates.
With inflation running at the lowest level in many years, the second danger
is not immediate. Most economists argue that real interest rates are much
too high and ought to fall rapidly. If that is the case, it may not be
sensible to go for the fixed rate mortgage products which looked so
attractive a year ago. Anyone now entering the housing market is less likely
to need a cap against rates going back up to very high levels, than the
ability to take advantage of a fall in rates.
That said, there are still plenty of fixed rates on the market. Long term
fixed rates at below 10 per cent seem to be less abundant than many might
wish, and the present crop of fixed rates will not look like a good idea if
the day comes when the base rate falls to 6 or 7 per cent.
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester has withdrawn its two year fixed rate at 9.6 per
cent and replaced it with a four year fix at 10.75 per cent. It is available
for up to 80 per cent of valuation and is fully portable. The application
fee is Pounds 250 and the early redemption penalties amount to Pounds 250;
repayment and interest-only mortgages welcome.
Capital Home Loans is offering mortgages fixed at 10.25 per cent for either
three years or five years. There is a Pounds 295 completion fee and
compulsory building insurance. One attraction of this mortgage for the
self-employed is that Capital Home Loans is temporarily accepting
self-certification of income.
John Charcol, the leading specialist mortgage broker, has set up a reducing
mortgage on which interest drops from 9.99 per cent (APR 11.6 per cent) to
8.99 per cent over the first six years of the loan. There is a fairly stiff
Pounds 395 application fee. Customers who do not take Charcol's buildings
and contents insurance pay an extra 0.25 per cent on their mortgage interest
rate. There is a six months interest penalty for early redemption.
However, the week's most interesting mortgage deal comes from the Mortgage
Corporation, the centralised lender which has been taking a low profile in
the market for most of this year. It is offering new customers Pounds 200
towards the cost of their legal fees; Pounds 200 towards valuation fees;
free insurance against being gazumped; and a free deposit guarantee voucher
worth Pounds 100. There is also a contribution of Pounds 300 to the costs of
remortgaging. That said, the TMC mortgage rates are not so different from
the rest of the market: 10.4 per cent (APR 11.3 per cent) for four years.
TMC has also set an example to other centralised lenders by lowering its
standard variable rate to 10.99 per cent, bringing its APR of 11.5 per cent
for existing customers in line with most building society rates.
Most surprising, it is offering a small discount as a bonus to existing
customers who have a standard TMC mortgage and who have not missed a payment
in three years. Such a bonus would have been unthinkable a few years ago.

WHEN Deacon Hoare, the Bristol-based banking institution, was placed in
liquidation on June 10, depositors with tax-exempt special savings accounts
(Tessas) were left bewildered.
Most of the 200 depositors with Deacon Hoare had opened Tessas there,
attracted by the exceptionally high interest rates being quoted - 15.87 per
cent on February 9 1991, for example.
The next highest rate, out of more than 110 accounts on offer, was 15.5 per
cent while the average at that time was below 14 per cent.
Tessas are covered by the Bank of England's deposit protection scheme, which
ensures that depositors get compensation of up to 75 per cent of Pounds
20,000. But what has been less clear is whether this 75 per cent should also
cover interest that would have accrued.
The problem is caused because interest on a Tessa is tax-free only if the
capital is left untouched for the full five-year term.
Deacon Hoare was liquidated before that period, so the question arises:
should investors be compensated for the interest that would have been earned
had the Tessa run its normal course?
This question was asked by an FT reader who has been shuffled between the
deposit protection board, Deacon Hoare, its liquidators, and another bank to
which he hoped to transfer the Tessa. He had placed the maximum amounts
allowable by depositing Pounds 3,000 in the first year of the Tessa and
another Pounds 1,800 this year.
By the end of March this year, he noticed that Deacon Hoare had dropped the
interest rate on its Tessa by more than 1.5 per cent, which pushed it below
that paid by most institutions. When he tried to transfer his Tessa to
another bank, he was told by Deacon Hoare he would have to wait a calendar
month before he could do so.
By the time the cheque for Pounds 5,509.40 - including the accrued interest
 -was received by the other bank, Deacon Hoare had gone into liquidation,
leaving our reader in limbo.
The Bank of England and the Inland Revenue have now reached agreement on
what should be done about Tessa compensation. Victims of a collapsed
institution with a Tessa will have a choice.
One option is for them to take compensation of 75 per cent of their Tessa.
This amount would comprise the capital and accrued interest up to the date
the institution went into liquidation.
This is despite rules under which gross interest normally cannot be paid
before five years. But a Revenue spokesman explained: 'These people will
have lost more than they earned in interest, so we are writing off tax on
that interest.'
Alternatively, investors who want to continue holding a Tessa can do so by
opening an account at another bank. This would be regarded as a transfer for
tax purposes.
The 75 per cent compensation for the original investment and accrued
interest would be paid into this account, and the Tessa would expire five
years after it was first opened with the collapsed institution.
So far, so good. The bad news is that the investor will not be allowed to
top up the Tessa to the full amount for that year.
In other words, if our reader - whose Tessa balance stood at Pounds 5,509.40
on the day Deacon Hoare went into liquidation - wants to transfer it,
compensation of 75 per cent of this amount (Pounds 4,132.05) will be paid
into the new account.
But the Revenue says he will not be allowed to top this up to Pounds
5,509.40 because he would have already paid in the maximum Pounds 1,800
deposit allowed in year two.
What makes this situation particularly anomalous is that, in certain
circumstances, the full amount could be transferred.
If our reader held another account at Deacon Hoare with, say, Pounds 5,000
in it, he would receive a single cheque for Pounds 7,882.05, comprising 75
per cent of Pounds 5,000 and the Tessa compensation. He would be able to
transfer Pounds 5,509.40 of this amount into the Tessa at the new bank or
building society.
The Revenue says this is because such a transfer would not involve any
violation of the Tessa rules - an additional deposit to that allowed for the
year is not being made.
It also says that investors with more than one account in a collapsed bank
will have lost proportionately more than those holding a single account.
'We are trying to bend over backwards to be helpful,' said the spokesman.
'However, we do not think we can go further than this in the Tessa tax
rules.'

FT  15 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Check those statements - Banks rush to
calm customers after computer problems hit dealings with credit cards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
USERS OF credit cards should check their statements with particular care
following news this week of glitches in the computers processing their
accounts.
Those affected most are the 250,000 holders of National Westminster gold
cards although problems also have been reported by users of Visa, Access and
Mastercards issued by the Midland, Lloyds and the Royal Bank of Scotland.
Among the difficulties reported have been:
Cards swallowed by cash machines.
Cards refused authorisation when retailers request it.
Wrong charges for late payment.
Incorrect charges for interest.
Delays in direct debits.
Fees for non-existent cash advances.
Incorrect amounts debited.
Wrong transaction dates on statements.
The banks moved hastily this week to calm customers. Lloyds stressed that
errors had affected only about 40 of its gold card clients and concerned
direct debits which were paid incorrectly. It said it had contacted all
these customers to correct the errors.
Midland said it was aware of about 100 cases in which payment received
against the bill for the previous month had not been shown on the most
recent statement.
Royal Bank of Scotland said the errors it knew about totalled 'well under
three figures.' These concerned cards not being authorised and the problems
had been sorted out.
NatWest appears to have had far more trouble than the others. It said it was
still unable to determine exactly how many customers had been affected but
it considered the difficulties significant enough to send letters to all its
gold card-holders.
It said most of these errors concerned relatively small amounts, such as
fees for cash advances not made or late-payment fees where payments had been
received.
NatWest also is sending a letter - which will be enclosed with their next
statement - to every one of its other 4.75m card-holders explaining that
incorrect transaction dates may be shown. The bank also has stressed that no
customer will be left out of pocket because of errors.
The problems were caused last month during conversion from one piece of
computer software to another, more modern version by First Data Resources,
which processes 10m credit card accounts from its centres in Basildon and
Southend. Executives now are confident that the remaining problems have been
ironed out.
The new software is designed to operate more quickly and is more secure. It
also can offer a range of new facilities.
For example, card-providers now can supply statements to their customers
with two columns for dates: the existing column, which shows the date on
which money has been debited from the account; and a new column which shows
the date on which the original transaction took place.
Gary Tobin, a senior vice-president at First Data Corporation, the parent of
FDR, stresses that there are many stages at which problems with credit cards
can arise. Often, these are not the fault of the computer processors, he
adds.
Cards may be refused at cash machines because these have run out of money;
and by either machines or retailers because a customer's credit limit has
been reached. There can be faults with telephone equipment or with the
computers used by the banks.
At least one positive element for the banks has come from all this week's
negative publicity: persuading customers to look at their credit card and
other bank statements more closely.
Royal Bank of Scotland says: 'We would recommend customers at any time
making a point of checking their statements against their vouchers.
Actually, it is an anti-fraud measure against abuse.'
Midland adds: 'We would always advise people to check their statements for
their own peace of mind.'

FT  15 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The week ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MONDAY sees interim results from Argos, the catalogue retailer. The figures
are hard to forecast as the first half of the year is far less important
than the Christmas trading period. There are also costs and losses
associated with the new furniture chain. Most estimates are in a range
between Pounds 8.5m and Pounds 9.5m pre-tax, against Pounds 10.7m last year.
Long awaited annual figures from Ratners, the jewellery retailer, are also
expected some time this week. Since January the group has made a series of
statements about the figures for the year to February 1, which are expected
to show a loss of Pounds 125m pre-tax after forecast exceptional costs
relating to rationalisation measures of Pounds 98m and likely interest
charges of around Pounds 27m. More interesting will be reports of the
group's talks with its bankers and, perhaps, news of a capital
restructuring.
BICC, the cables and Balfour Beatty construction group, is likely to
announce on Wednesday a pre-tax profit fall of roughly Pounds 10m from the
Pounds 66m in the first half of '91. A key question will be whether profits
are holding up from the European cables business.
Marley, the building products manufacturer which announces interims on
Wednesday, is expected to show a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 9.3m to
about Pounds 8m. The bad news should be softened by a maintained interim
dividend of 2.1p for the third consecutive year - albeit uncovered. However,
the company may indicate a cut in the final pay-out.
Rentokil Group, the environmental services and property care concern, is
expected to stay on course for a 20 per cent earnings increase which when it
announces its half-year results on Thursday. Forecasts are for about Pounds
53m compared with Pounds 42.3m. Profits should have been boosted by strong
growth from environmental services, which in the past has more than offset
the decline in property earnings.
Soft insurance markets in the US and a weak dollar will have depressed
Sedgwick and Willis Corroon, the UK's two biggest brokers, which report
interim figures on Tuesday and Thursday respectively. Analysts expect
pre-tax profits of between Pounds 54m and Pounds 63m at Sedgwick, compared
with Pounds 65.3m. Willis's pre-tax profits could fall to between Pounds 55m
and Pounds 65m, from Pounds 69.4m.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Wise words on Lloyd's risks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH profitability appears to be returning to Lloyd's of London, the
risks for Names, the individuals whose assets provide the market's capital
base, have never been greater.
Lloyd's losses of Pounds 2.06bn for 1989, which were reported in June, were
heavily concentrated among a minority of Names unfortunate enough to be
members of the worst-performing syndicates.
The pattern could be repeated in 1990 and 1991, so it is more important than
ever for Names to know as much about the syndicates they are joining and the
agent who will handle their affairs.
Three new publications should therefore be of interest to Names.
For the first time in its history, Lloyd's itself has published its own
comprehensive statistical report on syndicate performance. Limelight:
Lloyd's syndicate results 1991, a 600-page report, costs Pounds 30 and
contains information on the breakdown of the separate classes of business
written by syndicates which has not been previously available.
The Association of Lloyd's Members (ALM, 16 St Mary at Hill, London EC3R
8EE) is upgrading its syndicate statistics. The ALM guide contains slightly
less statistical information than Limelight, but it does offer commentary on
syndicate performance and prospects.
The ALM has has also published a new guide (Lloyd's 1992 Members Agents
Profiles) to the members' agency community at Lloyd's, which gives figures
for the average returns obtained for Names by every members' agent and many
other details.
Both books, as well as the ALM's newsletters and other publications, are
offered to ALM members as part of their Pounds 90 a year subscription.
Meanwhile, the next issue of Chatset's Lloyd's League Tables, the
longest-established guide to the market, is scheduled for publication next
month.
The Society of Names (the Old Rectory, Adstock, Buckinghamshire MK18 2HY),
also publishes its own syndicate guides.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The up and down world of savings rates
 -Investors have faced a rollercoaster ride in the past few weeks. Philip
Coggan and Scheherazade Daneshkhu explain what is on offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN and SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAVERS CAN be forgiven for being confused. Most UK financial institutions
seem to be reducing rates at present, with the Halifax and the Alliance &amp;
Leicester leading the pack this week. But in the midst of the cuts, the
Skipton building society raised its rates, citing the need to keep
competitive.
Meanwhile, many commentators believe that interest rates will fall in the
1990s as the world moves into an era of low growth and low inflation. But in
the short term, the UK government cannot reduce rates until the Germans do
so.
The result is an enormous range of choice for the average saver, depending
on how much he wants to invest and for how long. Nor is choosing the highest
rates necessarily the best decision.
Often the best returns are offered by some of the smallest names. Some may
be doing so because they have lower costs; others may offer high rates
because they urgently need to attract funds. While there is no point in
risking capital to chase an extra half of a percentage point of interest, it
is difficult for the small investor to tell whether an institution is
'safe'.
There is some comfort in the compensation schemes. Sterling bank deposits
are covered up to 75 per cent of the first Pounds 20,000, and building
society deposits 90 per cent of the first Pounds 20,000. A policyholder's
protection scheme offers 90 per cent cover (without limit) on insurance
company policies such as guaranteed income bonds.
So, with the important caveat of safety, here is a guide to products and
rates on offer.
VARIABLE RATES
Instant access
The market is fluid at present and banks and building societies may yet
react to this week's changes. Halifax has cut the rate on balances of Pounds
500 and above in its Instant Xtra Plus account to 7.15 per cent gross from
7.5 per cent and, on balances of Pounds 25,000 - wary of losing 'high net
worth' customers - there is a smaller drop from 8.9 per cent gross to 8.8
per cent.
Alliance &amp; Leicester's rates on its Instant Access account fell from 7.5 per
cent gross to 7.3 per cent on Pounds 500 and from 8.4 per cent gross to 8.2
per cent on Pounds 25,000.
However, savers with Pounds 25,000 in Skipton's Sovereign Shares account saw
an increase from 9.2 per cent gross to 9.6 per cent gross, although those
with Pounds 500 saw no increase in the rate of 7.5 per cent gross.
Elsewhere, the highest rates are to be found on postal accounts. Investors
are pre-issued with withdrawal and paying-in slips and deal with the
institution by first class post.
On Pounds 5,000, Moneyfacts (0692-582103) says the highest rates are being
paid by Bristol &amp; West on its Balmoral postal account, with 10.45 per cent.
North of England's Edinburgh (postal) account pays 10.25 per cent, while the
rate at Norwich &amp; Peterborough on its Postmaster account is 10.05 per cent.
You can get 10 per cent gross interest with Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester's London
(postal) share account and Scarborough's First Post.
On Pounds 25,000, Bristol &amp; West's Balmoral account pays 10.9 per cent,
North of England's Edinburgh account pays 10.75 per cent, while the rate at
Confederation bank is 10.25 per cent on its Liquidity account. Other high
rates are available from Leeds &amp; Holbeck (10.5 per cent) on its Albion
postal account and Norwich &amp; Peterborough (10.3 per cent) on the Postmaster
account.
Notice accounts
On Pounds 5,000, only Allied Trust Bank beats the postal rates, paying 10.91
per cent on its three month notice account; Teachers building society, which
is run from a single office in Dorset to help members of the teaching
profession with their mortgages, is paying 10.4 per cent on its Minster 90
(a 90 day notice account).
The highest rates on Pounds 25,000 are from Allied Trust, 10.91 per cent;
National Counties building society, paying 10.75 per cent on its 90 day
notice account; City &amp; Metropolitan building society, Exeter bank, Julian
Hodge bank and Greenwich building society are all paying 10.5 per cent
gross. The first is a 60 day notice account, the others are 90 day accounts.
Tessas
Tax Exempt Special Savings Accounts are a five year commitment. Interest is
paid tax free subject to the capital being left untouched for the full five
years The annual limits on deposits are Pounds 3,000 in the first year and
Pounds 1,800 in the subsequent four years, subject to a Pounds 9,000
ceiling.
Apart from the headline rate, investors should consider other factors. These
include the minimum investment required, the effect of bonuses and any
penalties involved in transferring to another operator.
Remember that the worst that can happen if you withdraw capital from a Tessa
is that you pay tax on the interest and have to close the account. Since
many Tessa rates are higher than savings accounts, the canny saver can open
a Tessa even if they are unlikely to last the full five year term.
Allied Trust Bank, which is owned by Barclays Bank, has been paying a
consistently high rate, now of 12.68 per cent on its Premier Tessa. However,
you need to provide the full Pounds 9,000 upfront - the annual limits are
put into the Tessa and the rest earns 10.36 per cent gross in a feeder
account. Two months notice is required for a transfer, plus an
administration fee of Pounds 25.
National Counties has offered a consistently competitive rate since Tessas
were launched. You have to put in the annual maximums to earn the present
rate of 12 per cent. The notice period is 90 days.
Cash Unit Trusts
These offer money market returns by investing in the deposits of large
banks. Rather than paying interest to unitholders, the value of the units
rises steadily as the fund accumulates income.
Current gross rates range between 9.5 and 9.9 per cent; in net terms, this
is between 7.125 and 7.275 per cent. An investor who put in Pounds 10,000 at
the start of the year would expect his holding to be worth about Pounds
10,720 at the end. Returns are paid net of basic rate tax, but non-taxpayers
can reclaim the tax. Most cash unit trusts have no bid-offer spread; the
only charge is an annual management charge which is deducted before the
quoted yield.
The advantage of such trusts is that they are likely to offer a return close
to money market rates. There is a slight risk of loss of capital if a cash
unit trust invests in a bank which fails, such as BCCI.
The best cash unit trust over the year to August 1, according to Micropal,
was Prudential Cash Haven with a net return of 8.33 per cent.
FIXED RATE PRODUCTS
Gilts
Gilts are bonds issued by the UK government. Most pay a fixed rate of
interest, with the exception of index-linked issues where the income rises
in line with the Retail Prices index. Buying a gilt at current prices allows
you to lock in a return of between 9 and 10 per cent. If interest rates
fall, you will have an above-average income and a modest capital gain; but
if rates rise, you will have a below-average income and a capital loss.
Most gilts have a face value of 100 and will be repaid at that level (again,
index-linked are an exception; their repayment value is linked to the RPI).
So, if you buy a gilt priced at under 100 and hold it until it is repaid
(the maturity date), you will be certain of a capital gain. Profits on gilts
are exempt from capital gains tax; income tax is payable on the interest.
However, a gilt trading at below 100 will offer a lower income; whereas if
you buy a gilt trading above 100, you will receive a higher running income
at the expense of a probable capital loss.
National Savings
The First Option Bond now pays a fixed rate for one year of 7.25 per cent
net, equivalent to 9.67 per cent gross on a minimum of Pounds 1,000. The
rate increases to 7.55 per cent net on Pounds 20,000 and above. Interest is
paid net of basic rate tax; non-taxpayers can reclaim it.
National Savings certificates are tax-free and are therefore well suited to
higher rate taxpayers. The new 38th issue certificates, which go on sale
from August 24, will pay 7.5 per cent per annum, if held for five years. The
maximum investment has been cut to Pounds 5,000 from Pounds 7,500, although
an additional Pounds 10,000 from matured certificates can be reinvested.
A new series E of Capital Bonds, also available from August 24, will pay 10
per cent compound per annum when held for five years. These are particularly
suitable for non-taxpayers as interest is paid gross. Taxpayers are liable
to pay tax on the accrued interest each year.
Tessas
There are a limited number of fixed rate Tessas on the market. According to
Moneyfacts, Britannia is paying the best rate - 10.25 per cent - but you
have to find Pounds 8,250 for a feeder account. The penalty for early
closure or a transfer is 90 days loss of interest; withdrawal of interest is
not allowed.
Confederation Bank offers 10 per cent on its fixed-rate Tessa provided you
invest Pounds 8,350. The transfer or closure penalty is stiff, with a
requirement for a six month notice period and loss of six months' interest.
National &amp; Provincial will pay 9.7 per cent on a minimum of Pounds 100 in
its fixed-rate Tessa. You suffer 180 days loss of interest for early closure
or transfer.
Guaranteed income bonds
Buying a GIB involves investing a lump sum with an insurance company for a
fixed period, and in return being paid a guaranteed rate of interest. The
original sum is returned at the end of the period.
The interest paid is net of basic rate income tax; higher rate taxpayers
will normally have to pay the extra 15 per cent. The basic-rate tax cannot
be reclaimed, so Gibs are not suitable for non-taxpayers. Interest can be
paid at monthly intervals but the highest rates tend to be on those paying
annual interest. The rate depends on the amount invested and the length of
time the capital is to be tied up, usually one to five years.
Rates are tracked regularly by Baronworth (081-518-1218). The highest rates
available on Pounds 5,000 this week are: Acuma 7.16 per cent (one year);
General Portfolio 6.99 per cent (two years), 7.15 per cent (three years) and
7.37 per cent (four years); Hill Samuel 7.6 per cent (five years). Better
rates are available on bigger sums - see the table supplied by Moneyfacts on
Page V.
Building societies
Most building society fixed-rate investments require a large initial deposit
but on Pounds 500 you can get 10 per cent gross interest from the Portman
building society on its one year Fixed Interest Bond and the same rate at
National &amp; Provincial fixed until March 31 1995.
The highest rate on Pounds 5,000 is from Chelsea building society which is
paying 11.75 per cent gross on its Premier Account 111, fixed until October
1. The interest on Woolwich's Premium Investment account is 10.2 per cent
gross on Pounds 25,000 and 10.5 per cent gross on Pounds 50,000. Both rates
are fixed until January 1 1993.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Markets: Summer doldrums bring chill to New York - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SUMMER doldrums have arrived on Wall Street, even if New York's weather
has done its best to throw everybody off their stride (temperatures actually
fell into the 60s this week, prompting the reappearance of fur coats on
Fifth Avenue).
Investors are staying away from the market, trading volume has slumped, and
traders have had nothing better to do than tell new Dan Quayle jokes.
(Question: What's the difference between Dan Quayle and the 30-year Treasury
bond? Answer: The Treasury bond eventually matures.)
The same 30-year bond was centre stage for a while this week, after it
plunged more than a point on Thursday, dragging an already wobbly stock
market down with it. The trigger for the 30-year bond's sharp fall was some
remarks made by James Baker, the outgoing Secretary of State and new chief
of President Bush's re-election campaign.
Announcing his resignation at the State Department, Baker indicated that
lower taxes should be a key element of the President's campaign and second
term. The bond market took fright at this suggestion, which implied that
government borrowing, and with it the budget deficit, will rise if President
Bush is re-elected.
The talk of deficit-widening fiscal policies could not have come at a worse
time for bond dealers and investors, who were trying to digest the Dollars
10bn in new 30-year bonds the Treasury had auctioned off that afternoon. The
subsequent plunge in bond prices set off a wave of computer sell programs on
the stock markets as institutional investors shuddered at the sight of a
sharp uptick in long-term bond rates.
There was an even more panicky response to Baker's comments in Chicago,
where the Treasury bond futures pit went into a frenzy of selling, while on
foreign exchange markets, the dollar also wobbled.
The sustained weakness in the dollar - which required two more rounds of
concerted central bank intervention this week - has, in turn, been upsetting
bond markets, which fear that there is no more room for further cuts in US
interest rates with the dollar trading near its all-time low against the
D-mark,
Thursday showed just how jittery US financial markets have become during
this presidential election season. The big lead in the polls that Democratic
nominee Governor Bill Clinton has built up (the latest puts the gap at 18
points) continues to worry the markets, which believe that a Democrat in the
White House will be bad news for the economy, and even worse news for hopes
of a lower deficit.
Next week's Republican convention in Houston may provide some temporary
relief, assuming Bush receives the 'post-convention bounce' in the polls
customarily afforded to incumbents and challengers.
If the pre-convention bickering between hard-line conservatives and the more
centrist Bush camp is anything to go by, however, Houston could offer more
political drama than the organisers may have bargained for. A publicly
divided Republican party is the last thing financial markets want.
At least investors had some economic news to cheer this week, although, as
always, it came heavily laden with qualifications. Retail sales and
industrial production were both up in July, consumer and producer prices
barely budged last month, while the latest weekly jobless claims fell
sharply.
The 0.5 per cent rise in retail sales, however, was announced alongside a
big downward revision of the previous month's estimate of sales. Industrial
production rose, but the gain was due almost entirely to a weather-related
increase in utility use and a rebound in the mining sector following the
early summer rail strike. Otherwise, manufacturing output was flat last
month. The big drop in new jobless claims was also the result of a one-off
factor - the previous week's figures had been inflated by the temporary
closure of some General Motors' plants.
Unemployment is unlikely to fall significantly until the big US corporations
have completed their post-recession round of restructurings. The latest
shake-up came from McDonnell Douglas, the defence and aerospace group, which
on Monday announced plans to consolidate its six military contracting units
into two divisions, to find a buyer or a partner for its helicopter
business, and to close its aircraft parts plant in Ohio.
The news may not have gone down well in Columbus, where 1,000 people will be
made redundant, but the restructuring was well received by investors, who
rushed to buy McDonnell stock, sending it up 20 per cent to Dollars 43 in
four days of hectic trading.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Markets: Big brother casts cloud over water stocks - The
Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOMETHING odd has been happening to your water shares. The 10 privatised
water and sewerage companies, which were planned as conservative, almost
predictable, investments, have spent the year being anything but.
For one thing, water has been the best-performing sector in the stock market
this year, gaining almost 30 per cent relative to the All-Share index. For
another, share prices have fluctuated wildly so far this month, rising and
falling by several per cent each day.
The gyrations are less mysterious than they appear. But they raise a valid
question. After such strong gains, is it not time to take some profits and
seek growth elsewhere?
There are two reasons water stocks have performed so well. First, they were
oversold ahead of the election on fears of a Labour victory and possible
political interference. When Labour lost, the shares rallied even faster
than the market.
Second, as gloom about the economy mounted again during the summer,
professional investors switched into water shares for their defensive
qualities.
Water companies are affected by recession because businesses go broke and
houses go unoccupied. But because they are monopolies, the companies are
protected from much of the downturn. And because of the pricing structure
agreed before privatisation, they have been able to raise prices regardless.
They also have the added attraction of guaranteed dividend growth, at least
for the next couple of years. The water industry is being asked to invest at
least Pounds 30bn on water and sewage improvements during the decade. To
fund that investment, higher dividends are needed to keep institutional
shareholders happy.
Last year, dividends grew 10 per cent, compared with 3-4 per cent for the
market, and similar growth is expected this year.
As a result, water companies' shares are yielding just over 7 per cent, a 25
per cent premium to the market. With other companies, this could be a hint
investors expect the dividend to be cut. But with dividends from the water
sector secure, and with bigger companies like BP cutting their payments,
water stocks still have plenty of supporters.
'If you think the market is motoring ahead, it's probably time to take a
profit,' says Bill Dale, an analyst at SG Warburg. 'But if there's still
more bad news to come, it is not time to dump your water shares. '
The question mark hanging over water stocks, however - and a contributory
reason for their high yield - is regulatory.
On Thursday, Ian Byatt, director-general of the regulator Ofwat, began a
long process of negotiations with the companies which will end in 1994's
periodic review of their pricing levels.
The market was worried ahead of his presentation in case he started getting
tough on companies, as the gas and telephone regulators have done. In the
end, he concentrated more on the costs of meeting tough environmental
standards and scarcely addressed the more sensitive issues of pricing and
profit.
Shares in Thames Water fell 7.5 per cent ahead of Byatt before recovering
nearly all the gains once the market realised it was a false alarm. Welsh
Water, thought to be at risk from regulatory clampdown, fell 6 per cent but
then clawed back most of the losses. The sector index climbed nearly 4 per
cent on Thursday alone.
This kind of market turbulence is likely to become chronic in the lead-up to
the periodic review.
Next month, Byatt releases his thoughts on last year's profits. Next
February, companies will submit business plans to Ofwat. The regulator will
then discuss, and by 1994 decide, price caps for each company. It will also
decide effective rates of return on investment and suggest levels of
borrowings. Companies' unregulated profits, made in new areas like waste
management, will also be reviewed.
It is too early to say what effect the review will have on profits. But the
regulatory regime is most likely to get tougher. Companies' K numbers, the
amount they can raise prices ahead of inflation, are likely to be lowered
when their interest bills will be rising to pay for new investment. Real
dividend growth could fall from about 5 per cent to 1 per cent a year.
Some observers say potential bad news is reflected already in share prices.
Others remember that markets detest uncertainty. Either way, and even if
market fears are exaggerated, the sector looks to be heading towards a
period of underperformance until these issues are resolved.
If so, the question is one of timing. In the short term, prices will be
supported by general economic worries. Investors who switch out of water
when there is a general upswing in market confidence will be placed best.
Those who do not trust their timing can afford to make good this year's
gains and wait.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Markets: The ghosts of depression - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD stock markets have not had a very happy summer. The continuing decline
in the Tokyo market has rekindled fears of a 'meltdown' in the Japanese
financial sector. European shares have been depressed by the Bundesbank's
determination to keep interest rates high.
Some commentators are muttering that the 1930s are repeating themselves,
with the big trading nations obsessed with their own problems and failing to
take the concerted action needed to shake the world economy out of lethargy.
One fund manager who takes a gloomy view is Nils Taube, of Global Asset
Management, who says: 'I am more depressed than I was earlier this year. I
am getting very suspicious of meltdowns in individual areas. We have already
had the problems in Japan and we have pretty nearly had a meltdown in Italy.
'Deflationary forces are well in place', he adds. 'If you measure it in
D-mark terms, there has been a real shrinkage in world money supply.' Taube
is not too impressed by the authorities' ability to solve these problems.
'When you had closed economies, it was easy to manipulate a domestic
market', he says. 'Now, with open economies, it takes concerted
international action. Take the US, where reducing interest rates has proved
to be like pouring water on to sand.'
Mark Holowesko, director of research at Templeton International, is worried
about the impact of declines in the Japanese real estate market. 'The
Japanese real estate market was the biggest financial bubble in the history
of the world. At its peak, the market was probably valued at between Dollars
16 trillion and Dollars 18 trillion. If it falls in half, that's a loss of
Dollars 8 trillion to Dollars 9 trillion, more than the value of every stock
market in the world.'
Generally, however, Templeton has a stock-picking investment approach and
Holowesko says: 'We have an over-exposure to the capital goods sector rather
than consumer stocks. The consumer is not in good shape round the world but
the capital goods sector should benefit from massive infrastructure
spending, particularly in Asia. We particularly like US capital goods stocks
because American capital goods companies still dominate worldwide markets
and currently have the benefit of a low cost of capital.'
Indeed, Templeton does not see the US market as overvalued. 'Price-earnings
ratios may look high but earnings have been distorted by huge write-offs. On
more normal earnings numbers, the price-earnings ratio is around 15 to 16,
which is not cheap but is not too expensive either.' Holowesko says
Templeton has been increasing its exposure to the UK market. 'Most UK
investors take too short term a view of British companies', he says,
focusing on the ability to pay dividends and neglecting the long term
potential.
Nick Knight of Nomura thinks that the Japanese market can establish its
floor at around 15,000 on the Nikkei index. 'The market is beginning to
throw up value and the Bank of Japan and other authorities will start to
move heaven and earth to support the economy', he says.
'Clearly the US market has done better than most people's expectations,
having withstood the collapse of the Japanese equity market. The problem is
how it can move higher, and there is significant downside risk. An economic
recovery would vindicate investors' earnings expectations but force the
Federal Reserve to push up interest rates to appease the bond market; the
alternative is that the US slips back into recession, which ruins earnings
forecasts.'
In the UK, Knight says the problem has been sterling's position within the
Exchange Rate Mechanism, which has caused the corporate sector considerable
headaches. He fears that interest rates may rise. As for Europe, Knight
feels it is 'boring at best. The only hope is a bounceback from oversold
positions while we are being strangled by tight German monetary policy.'
Ken Inglis, head of investment at Allied Dunbar, also has worries about
Japan. 'Japanese banks will need a lot of trading out of their current
difficulties. There is a concern that they will repatriate foreign assets
and one wouldn't want to be long of US treasury bonds if that happened.' On
Japanese equities, he sees no early signs of relief, believing that any
rally in prices will bring forth plenty of sellers.
In Europe, share prices are 'hostage to the tensions between Frankfurt and
Bonn' as the Bundesbank cracks down on inflation. Inglis says there is a
need to watch the difference between the Bundesbank's rhetoric and its
actions.
Paul Manduca, chairman of fund management group Touche Remnant is more
optimistic. 'In general, we think there is considerable value in world share
prices. We don't think there is a chance of a global meltdown. That only
happens when people get over-enthusiastic and become overstretched.
'Our only caveat is about the US, where we think share prices are tending to
be overvalued, although that position could continue for some time. The UK
market obviously needs the sniff of an interest rate cut to get it moving.
But eventually traders will start looking at next year when German interest
rates are going to come down.'

FT  15 AUG 92 / Markets: Harold has a message for John - London Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST thing on Friday, the FT reported that the dividend yield on the
FT-Actuaries All-Share index had closed the previous day at over 5 1/4 per
cent. A few hours later, the government announced that retail prices had
risen at just under 3 3/4 per cent in the 12 months to July.
Taken separately, these two figures are unremarkable. The surprise lies in
their juxtaposition. Subtracted one from another - to show the real, or
inflation-adjusted, yield on equities - they reflect something that has
happened in only a few months during the past quarter-century. On the basis
of those numbers, UK equities this week are providing a real yield of over 1
1/2 per cent.
As the chart shows, that level was achieved for a couple of months in the
summer of 1986, and for a couple of years in the mid-1960s. Otherwise, real
yields on equities have stayed well below that; indeed, for most of recent
experience, they have been negative.
By itself, that might be a mere curiosity. But periods of positive real
yields appear to have usually been followed, in the past quarter-century at
least, by a sharp rise in the stock market, pushing yields down in both
nominal and real terms.
So, does the current level of yields reflect one of those extraordinary
buying opportunities that come along once a decade or so? You would not have
thought so, to judge from the mood of the market for most of the week. As
day followed day, each bringing a lower closing figure for the FT-SE 100
index, the gloom mounted.
On both Tuesday and Wednesday, the FT-SE dipped at times below 2,300. Though
it clambered back above that level on each occasion, Wednesday's closing
figure of 2,303.1 marked the seventh successive day of decline, the longest
unbroken fall since calculation of the the index began in 1984.
The mood of the market was not the only reason for mistrusting the buying
signal that the level of real yields might be thought to be providing. If
you look at the chart, which stretches back to the early days of the
All-Share index, there is one sustained period during which yields are
consistently positive - from 1965 to the spring of 1968. The turn came in
November 1967, when real yields peaked at 2 1/4 per cent.
To anyone over the age of 40, those dates are indelibly engraved on the
memory: they represent the Wilson government's years on the cross, the
gruelling and ultimately unsuccessful struggle to cope with an overvalued
currency. In November 1967, Harold Wilson gave in, and the pound was
devalued. That very month, real yields started to fall.
Then, as now, sterling was trapped in a fixed-exchange-rate system. Then, as
now, the pound appeared over-valued against some currencies; and interest
rates had to be kept up to defend it. If the analogy is a relevant one, then
one risk is that this time high real yields may last until John Major
follows Harold Wilson's example.
There are a couple of important differences between the mid-1960s and now,
however, and the events of this week illustrate them nicely. One is that
some, at least, of big British manufacturing companies are coping better
with this recession than with the slowdowns of previous decades. On
Thursday, for example, the engineering group Glynwed reported half-year
profits up 48 per cent, even though turnover was lower. If British
manufacturers are better able to cope with high interest rates and a
possibly overvalued pound than they were 25 years ago, dividend yields may
not need to be quite so high as they were then.
A second, perhaps more substantial, difference is that the ERM, unlike
Bretton Woods, ties the UK to the D-Mark rather than to the dollar. British
interest rates are now set by the Bundesbank, which keeps its attention
focused single-mindedly on German inflation. When German inflation is
unacceptably high, so are sterling interest rates. Lower German inflation
would permit lower German - and British - interest rates, and allow ERM
currencies to weaken against the dollar. They would offer John Major's
contemporaries the sort of escape from high real yields that Harold Wilson's
could only find in a formal devaluation.
The really significant news on on Friday, therefore, was not the mildly
encouraging inflation figures from the UK, but some much more surprising
numbers from Germany. West German wholesale prices dropped sharply in July,
the government reported, to a level 0.9 per cent below those of a year
earlier, the first such decline for two years. The figures were accompanied
by televised comments by Hans Tietmeyer, vice-president of the Bundesbank.
He said he and his colleagues would re-examine German interest rate levels
in a couple of months, a comment which the markets interpreted as ruling out
a further rise in rates for the time being.
Once markets had digested all this, they rallied across Europe. In the UK,
gilts closed up a point, and the FT-SE finished at 2356.8, up 38.8 on the
day and 6.7 on the week. Interest-rate sensitive stocks, such as retailers,
were big gainers.
A couple of other influences lay behind London's recovery of spirits. By
Friday, it had become clear that big building societies were not going to
follow the Skipton society's example and push up their mortgage lending
rates, so fears of a further downward spiral in the housing market had
abated. And on Thursday, industrial output numbers had been mildly
encouraging, reflecting a rise of 0.4 per cent in both the first and second
quarters.
The pound was weaker still on Friday, closing at DM2.8150, probably the
lowest since sterling entered the ERM. It was an ominous reminder of Harold
Wilson's years of travail.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Kleinwort Benson's TOPSI-100 Index is made up of the 100 largest equities
with historic yields over 120 per cent of the yield on the FT-A All-Share
Index. In the past, high yielding shares have often been good performers -
but not in the current recession. As the graph shows, the TOPSI Index has
substantially lagged the FTSE-100 since the start of 1991. High yields
normally indicate that the market believes a company will have difficulty
maintaining its dividend, or even paying any dividend at all. In many cases
over the past two years, market fears have been justified.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar dipped to a new low for the year this week, when it fell to
Dollars 1.93 against Pounds 1 sterling in London on Thursday's close. The US
Federal Reserve bank and other central banks intervened by buying dollars
for D-marks on Tuesday to limit falls against the German currency.
Today's rate is a far cry from February 1985, when the dollar almost reached
parity with sterling. It makes the US attractive for British holidaymakers,
but those who want to speculate on a dollar recovery should note that US
deposit accounts are paying a mere 3 per cent.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Dieppe, a disaster beyond words: Fifty years ago this week,
20 journalists were allowed to accompany the Allied raid: one of the first
big propaganda exercises of modern warfare. What they, in fact, saw was a
tragic and costly fiasco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUZANNE BARDGETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD LOVAT, commanding officer of No. 4 Commando, was in expansive mood as
he talked to his men on the eve of the Dieppe raid. 'They tell me the
propaganda's terrific,' he told them. 'All our families will be glued to
their radio sets when they hear the BBC announcement tomorrow morning.'
Among the many preparations discussed at the London headquarters of Combined
Operations in the early months of 1942, publicity had indeed been a
prominent issue. The war was not going well for the Allies. The year had
begun with the fall of Singapore; troops in the Western Desert had suffered
a series of reverses; Hitler's armies were advancing across the Soviet
Union. A successful raid on the French Channel port was a chance to boost
morale at home and reassure Britain's hard-pressed Russian and American
allies.
Public relations was a new-fangled notion, foreign to the training and
temperament of most senior British officers. But at Combined Operations'
headquarters, Lord Mountbatten's youthful and eager PR team  - which
included several ex-Hollyood professionals - took a more opportunistic view.
COHQ's brief - to mount raids on occupied territories - clearly offered
tremendous scope for action stories.
Cameramen and reporters had accompanied raids on the occupied Lofoten
Islands and Vaagso, in Norway, with gratifying results. The film record of
Vaagso, in particular, with its shots of flaming factories and commandos
creeping across snow-covered terrain, was convincing proof of the propaganda
value of allowing the media into the front line. Hopes were, therefore, high
for Dieppe - far more ambitious and code-named 'Operation Rutter.'
The plan involved an attack by a force of 6,000, largely Canadian, on a
10-mile front of the French coast. Flanking raids on the villages on either
side of the port would be followed by an attack on Dieppe itself, after
which troops would move inland to attack the Luftwaffe fighter base at St
Aubin and the divisional headquarters at Arques la Bataille. The whole
enterprise would be supported by naval destroyers and squadrons of the RAF.
It would be the greatest amphibious operation since Gallipoli and the first
time in history that tanks would be landed on beaches in the face of enemy
opposition. Dazzled by the opportunities that such an operation would surely
bring, and blind to the possibility that it could fail, Mountbatten's
publicity officers set about making Dieppe the greatest story of the war.
The press men covering the enterprise needed to be physically fit and, in
the spring of 1942, a hand-picked few were given a taste of assault warfare.
The Daily Herald's Sandy Austin found himself despatched to a remote part of
Scotland where a new type of flat-bottomed tank landing craft was being
plunged in and out of lochs. Then, late in June, six reporters were shipped
to the Isle of Wight where they joined a big Canadian force rehearsing the
raid on the island's cliff-rimmed coastline. Anticipation was running high;
however, bad weather gave the planners doubts and, on July 7, what was to
have been Operation Rutter was cancelled. But at the end of July, the raid
was revived under the code-name 'Jubilee' and scheduled for the night of
August 18-19.
Confidence must have been high, for the re-assembled press party had now
swollen to 20. Secrecy was crucial and, to ensure that no word got out,
COHQ's public relations officers played out an elaborate ruse, transporting
the entire press team to Bristol where it was put up in hotels and told to
have no communications with third parties. Two days later, a canopied army
truck appeared and the journalists were taken on a lengthy cross-country
journey, arriving eventually at Newhaven, East Sussex. These efforts at
subterfuge were admirable but a touch superfluous: at least three of the
party - Austin, Frank Gillard and John McVane - had been given full
briefings on the plan the previous month.
On the night of Tuesday August 18, more than 200 ships carrying nearly 6,000
troops set out under pale moonlight. The sea was calm and, for several
hours, the only sound came from the throb of propellers and the sloshing of
water against hulls. But as the vessels neared the French coast, there was a
sudden burst of light, with golden and red sprays criss-crossing the sky.
No. 3 Commando had run into a patrol of German E-boats. For 20 minutes the
raiders watched the spectacle, unaware that it was the first and most
serious of the mishaps that would turn the whole show into a disaster.
The first landings took place just before dawn. First ashore of the press
men was Austin with No. 4 Commando. Machine-gun fire sounded from the
cliff-top, but the commandos blew up the barbed-wire defences and made their
way up a gully that led to a great howitzer battery at Varengeville. Later
that morning, Austin was pressed into service with the troops, helping to
carry messages and mortar shells up the gully. Eventually, he conveyed the
triumphant news: 'Battery demolished. 6.50.'
A couple of miles closer to the port, Wallace Reyburn, a 29-year-old
reporter for the Montreal Standard, landed with the South Saskatchewans at
Pourville. With him were two members of the army film and photographic unit,
Lieutenant WT Lockeyear and Sergeant Ron Holloway, the latter only recently
recruited and on his first assignment. At first, all went well. A number of
German prisoners was rounded up. Then, mortar shells appeared from nowhere
and Reyburn found himself heaving wounded Canadians on to stretchers.
The troops advanced towards Dieppe but were met with ever-fiercer shelling,
and Reyburn lost track of his photographer companions. (It emerged later
that Holloway had been wounded in the eye but carried on recording the
battle, only to be hit again, this time fatally - the only press man at
Dieppe who did not return).
Reyburn found a house where, for several hours, he was able to watch the
fighting. Eventually, a wireless message was sent requesting that the
landing craft come and take the raiders off. With Nazi troops advancing
towards the town it was, as Reyburn reported, 'a toss-up who reached us
first.' When the boats finally arrived at 11.00, Reyburn witnessed one of
the most harrowing episodes of the raid as 800 troops raced from the cover
of the sea wall - only to be mown down by machine-gun fire. Reyburn had
spent nearly six hours ashore.
To the east of Dieppe, Canadian Press reporter Ross Munro accompanied the
Royal Regiment of Canada to Puits, code-named Blue Beach. A 15-minute delay
lost the raiders the cover of darkness and, in haste to make up for lost
time, the landing craft engines were revved at full speed, alerting the
shore defences.
Munro wrote: 'Down went the ramp and out poured the first infantrymen. They
plunged into about two feet of water and machine-gun fire laced into them.'
Munro later was stunned to realise that, of the 80 men in his craft, only 20
had re-boarded. 'On no other front have I witnessed such a carnage,' he
wrote in 1946. 'It was brutal and terrible and shocked you almost to
insensibility.'
Some miles out to sea, Quentin Reynolds was the first of the press party to
appreciate how far things had gone wrong. A personal friend of two of
Mountbatten's staff officers, he had sailed on the headquarters ship Calpe,
where he had direct access to General Roberts, commander of the Canadian
Second Division. In Roberts' control cabin, he now heard the commmander's
urgent wireless message: 'Calling Red Beach. Calling Red Beach. Calling Blue
Beach.' Seemingly hours later, a faint crackle came back: 'Red Beach
calling. We are being strafed by Focke-Wulfs. Situation serious.' From Blue
Beach, there was silence. The headquarters signaller had been killed and his
transmitter smashed by bullets.
For the 14 press men hovering in boats offshore, events could only be
guessed at from the gruesome evidence that now and then floated into view.
Landing craft emerged from under the smoke-screen, half-filled with men -
some dead, some dying, the water lapping red around their bodies.
From those able to speak came dazed accounts of the past few hours: 'The
bloody Jerries were waiting for us.' 'We had to land in daylight.'
'Machine-guns at 50 yards, and the place lousy with mines and mortars.' A
pale lieutenant, asked how things were going ashore, could only repeat: 'You
may well ask.'
Back in London, with news now arriving from the Calpe, Mountbatten's
publicity team faced a crisis of mounting proportions. A communique issued
at 06.00 that day had produced its intended effect of galvanising the
nation's news desks, and telephones were ringing incessantly. To which ports
would the soldiers be returning? Could reporters be sent to interview them?
With furrowed brows, the officers turned to the second communique, drafted
in advance but now patently in need of revision. There was a hasty telephone
call to Mountbatten at RAF Uxbridge, in north-west London. A confidential
note to editors warned: 'Losses must be seen in the light of valuable
experience gained.'
For a full seven hours, the sky over Dieppe shook with the roar of the air
battle. In the Calpe's wardroom, two doctors tried to save the wounded,
dealing eventually with 500 men. At one point, the bedraggled figure of
Reyburn appeared. 'This is one hell of a story,' he gasped at Reynolds. Then
he passed out.
Around midnight, the returning ships reached the south coast ports. The
press men drove to their London offices, typed their reports and then sped
over to Combined Operations headquarters where a press conference had been
arranged for 10.00. The briefing was on the fourth floor. 'It was a long way
up,' recalled Reynolds, 'especially for Wally, whose wounds were smarting
now.' Mountbatten's expression gave nothing away. His spokesman gave a
carefully-worded summary: there had been some casualties but they had no
particulars yet. It was true that not all the raid's objectives had been
achieved, but the main purpose had been accomplished: 'We sent a large naval
force to Dieppe, kept them there for more than nine hours and suffered the
loss of only one destroyer.'
The reporters went away and tried to incorporate the official view into
their stories, although it was scarcely compatible with what they had seen
and heard. The rest of the day was spent wrangling with the four sets of
censors - COHQ's and the three services' - until a version of each
reporter's account could be agreed.
Overall, the balance sheet read badly. The pictures taken by Holloway in the
heat of the fighting in Pourville were lost. The much hoped-for film
coverage was derisory: the British Movietone News cameraman had been aboard
No. 3 Commando's leading gunboat, and his film amounted to little more than
shots of the damaged boat and wounded crew. But things could have been
worse. By a stroke of luck, the only British newspaperman to land in France
had seen the one phase of the raid that had gone according to plan. With a
clear conscience, Austin was able to file a gritty story about No. 4
Commando's storming of Varengeville battery, and it was this - to the
censors' relief - that was blazoned across every paper's front page when the
story finally reached the news-stands on Friday morning.
As the weeks passed, however, word got about that all had not been well at
Dieppe. There had been faults in the planning - inadequate intelligence and
a serious miscalculation of German strength - while poor communications, bad
luck and bad timing had let the operation down. 'Was it all worthwhile?' was
the question asked by many.
Within months, three of the reporters present wrote books about it -
accounts which, although they gave more details than the first reports,
remained faithful to the line that the raid was justified by the lessons it
had taught. It was hardly the action of dogged seekers-after-truth who,
having discharged their distasteful duty in reporting the raid to the
authorities' satisfaction, might have been expected, thankfully, to lay the
subject to rest. To be fair, the number of deaths had not at that time been
released, so that the raid had not acquired the tragic aura it has today;
but it is still surprising that Reyburn, who had seen the very worst of the
mayhem on Pourville beach, could open his book with an earnest and reasoned
defence of the official line.
The fact is that those reporters given access to front-line units did so
accepting that they were part of the propaganda arm. The three weeks of
training for Operation Rutter had produced among the press an admiration for
the raiding force that was close to awe. To have responded with carping
criticism would have been to jeopardise future opportunities. The reporters'
acquiescence earned trust and privileges that were crucial if the public was
to be given anything more than reports drawn on official communiques. By
entering this accord, though, the media lost their objectivity - perhaps an
inevitable consequence of war.
At the end of the day - as one of their number, author John Steinbeck, put
it - the correspondents of the Second World War were a 'curious, crazy, yet
responsible crew.' For the sake of the war effort, and because the war
against Hitler was considered a just one, they did what was required of
them. Dieppe - where nearly 1,000 men were killed and 2,000 taken prisoner -
showed how well the system worked.

FT  15 AUG 92 / The Long View: Meeting the history man
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY

<TEXT>
THE familiar tones of Steve the strategist came on the line this week. 'Just
passing through,' he said. 'I thought I needed to get an update on the
latest ERM tensions. Looks like the rest of the year could be all about
currencies.'
When we met, it turned out that Steve, as a leading global investment guru,
was busy gathering material for the autumn conference season. He showed me
his diary for September and October, and I decided airline and luxury hotel
stocks should go on the buy list for a start.
'Client calls drop right away in August,' he said. 'Time for a bit of
longer-term thinking or, at least, a bit of longer-term re-formatting.' This
was a new phrase to me. I thought that format was a button on my computer
that I didn't know how to use. Presumably, though, it was all part of the
idea that presentation beats content any day.
'Why do journalists get so cynical?' complained Steve. 'Still, it's true
enough that there are very few good new ideas - just a better supply of new
ways to package old ones. Right now, the clients are into history. They want
1992 put into the context of the 1920s and the 1930s, or maybe even the
1890s if you want to be fancy.
'Personally, I think history is junk, certainly for predicting the stock
market. But if the clients expect me to have mugged up on Keynes and
Schumpeter and Galbraith, then at least I need to have skimmed through the
executive summaries. And when the clients want everything formatted in terms
of supercycles, they get it.'
You can become cynical through talking to global strategists, I thought. Out
loud, I said that the clients just might have something. The markets didn't
seem to be following the rules or the trend lines that they had for 20 or 30
years. For instance - in the UK, at any rate - analytical devices like
bond-equity yield ratios were outside their normal ranges, so strategists
who called the market cheap when the ratio hit the normal 2.0 floor were
looking exposed now it was down to under 1.8.
'Sure, I've looked at the UK numbers and the dividends are looking exposed,'
Steve agreed. 'Dividends have stalled in the past year. But in the five
years before then, they rose 90 per cent, or call it 40 per cent in real
terms. But the British economy is now only 10 per cent bigger than it was in
1985, and might still be shrinking. Those are the relationships to look at.'
Did he think it was worthwhile skimming through the history books to gain
insights into this kind of problem? Surely it was fair enough to look at
some longer-term data for a better perspective?
'Maybe,' said Steve, 'but you can't make money by doing in 1992 what you
should have done in 1932. Look how the Wall Street crash of 1987 was
misinterpreted. On the 1929 precedent, the Dow should have collapsed to
about 350. Instead it's gone 10 times as high. To me, there's only one way
of getting it right in any era and that's to look at what's cheap and what's
expensive and feed off the market's illusions.'
I said that the expensive junk often seemed to be the kind of stock peddled
by his firm's new-issue salesmen. 'Sure,' he said, 'you have to sell into
strength. The corporate clients have a surprisingly good feel for when their
stock is overvalued.
'There is valuable feedback for me, too. Of course, I have to be careful
what I say to clients. But look at what has happened in health care, which
soared out of sight last year when investors were desperate for
recession-proof earnings. New stock by the billion has poured out, including
Wellcome. I see that even ICI is trying to do the splits and dress half of
itself up as a fancy bio stock. You can bet it will miss the boat and the
dull old heavy chemicals rump will outperform.'
But switching between growth stocks and cyclicals had proved a tricky game
over the past year, I remarked. Small company stocks, which were among the
most sensitive to economic recovery, had been having a rough time.
'It's my longer-term play,' said Steve. 'Remember that Japan has lost the
zero cost of capital that allowed it to undermine returns on capital in
tradeable manufactures worldwide during the 1980s. Stands to reason that
manufacturing in the US and Europe will gain competitiveness through the
1990s. But don't hold your breath.'
He added: 'What worries me now is currencies. I was right to go short of the
dollar earlier in the year, but US interest rates have nowhere much lower to
go. Meanwhile, in Europe the pressure from cheap, dollar-based goods is
threatening to bust the ERM apart. Assuming the Italians go down, who will
they take with them?'
Just suppose, I said, that the French say 'non' to the Maastricht treaty on
September 20 and the Bundesbank puts up the Lombard Rate. Then, Bill Clinton
could win the US election. At least the winner won't be Ross Perot in a
three-way split, but the financial markets would not be at all happy. And we
should remember that US Treasury bonds yield less than German bunds. Was
that the real order of credit quality?
'You're right to worry. Everybody's worrying,' said Steve. 'But I have to
look at it the other way around. What if none of those things happens? A lot
of the risk is fully priced into the markets now. Suppose Bush wins -
remember, your John Major was a no-hoper before April, according to the
opinion polls - and suppose German short-term rates come down before
Christmas. Imagine what that might do to the dollar, and then the heat would
be right off the ERM. On that scenario, I might even buy the UK stock
market.'

FT  15 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Precious metals
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is not surprising that platinum led precious metals down this week.
Worries over the Japanese economy, which accounts for just over half of
world platinum uptake, coincided with General Motors' confirmation that
further car plant closures were likely. With catalytic converters now de
rigueur, any further fall in car output will dent platinum demand.
For gold the picture is more technical. Speculators fretting that gold had
failed to break the chart level of Dollars 360 an ounce were made more
nervous by the platinum fall and some selling by US mutual funds and
Australian gold producers. With the gold price now back near the year's lows
in dollar terms - and at new lows for the year in other currencies -
attention switches to the longer term. Bulls argue that Russian gold sales
will continue to fall because mined output is falling and reserves were
raided heavily in 1990 and 1991. Low US interest rates have tempted a few
investors in, and the instability in Bosnia may also offer support.
But with inflation low, there is little long-term reason for gold to resume
an investment role. As a pure commodity, supply is more than adequate to
meet anticipated industrial and jewellery demand. Then again, as a
commodity, gold ought to have a floor just above the marginal cost of
production - around Dollars 300 an ounce. Central banks are a wild card. If
others follow Belgium and liquidate holdings, further price falls are
possible. Even the threat that they will do so is enough to depress
sentiment.

FT  15 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Wellcome
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Wellcome share sale was always likely to face sniping from institutions
which benefited from the traditional method of selling equity in the UK,
including the lucrative system of sub-underwriting. Last week's sudden cut
in the price at which the issue was supported, leading to an 18p fall in the
shares on Tuesday, seemed to offer the critics further ammunition.
However, US-style support or stabilisation is meant only to smooth the
progress of an issue absorbing shares not held firmly by investors. By
maintaining the support price at 800p the lead manager felt itself in danger
of creating a false market. As the chart shows, Wellcome had outperformed a
falling market by 4 per cent in the previous week. This was clearly more
than is implied by stabilisation. It remains to be seen whether Wellcome
will now find a firm floor. The shares closed the week at 787p, only 1 per
cent behind the market since the issue started trading on July 27. Of the
40.5m shares available to the lead manager for stabilisation, perhaps 15m
are still held in reserve. Perhaps more important, they were trading
comfortably above the new 777p support price, suggesting a fragile
equilibrium of buyers and sellers.
However, the quality of placement achieved by the book building process
remains unproven. Some institutions must be expected to take profits if the
shares rise above the 800p sale price. Other than a couple of large
liquidations by UK institutions, however, there was little sign of nervous
selling last week.

FT  15 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Sterling
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sterling's fall against the D-Mark has been slowed this week by the strength
of the escudo and the peseta within the ERM. But at DM2.8155 it is now less
than four pfennigs away from its absolute floor of DM2.7780. Perhaps more
important psychologically is its proximity to the DM2.80 resistance point.
Were it to breach that level, the market would begin to ask itself serious
questions about the government's readiness to live up to its commitment to
the DM2.95 central rate.
There is, of course, no formal obligation on the authorities to do anything
until the currency is at its absolute floor, but some in the market would be
looking for a response if the divergence indicator against the Ecu reached
minus 75 (it is now minus 71). Given the severity of the blow to confidence
that would follow from a base rate rise, it is natural for the authorities
to hold their fire. Pressure on sterling may yet abate, especially if the
dollar manages to stage a recovery.
The risk remains, however, that lack of official action will simply provoke
the market into testing the absolute D-Mark floor. The task facing the
authorities might be easier if the UK were not so hooked on base rates as an
indicator. Continental central banks often seem more flexible in the range
of signals they can send to the markets.

FT  15 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Continental drift
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It must certainly be gratifying for the government to see British inflation
fall to 3.7 per cent. For financial markets the slower rate of price
increases is of limited interest as long as monetary policy is constrained
by what happens in Germany. In that context, yesterday's 39 point jump in
the FT-SE may owe more to July's 1.3 per cent fall in German wholesale
prices, though the London market is probably deceiving itself if it believes
that this will lead to a speedy cut in D-Mark interest rates.
ERM membership was always likely to shift London's focus away from Wall
Street and align it more closely with continental Europe. The period since
the FT-SE peaked on May 11 is a telling example of how far this process has
gone. London has fallen by 14 per cent, broadly in line with both Paris and
Frankfurt. The Dow is down by less than 3 per cent. It is almost certainly
no coincidence that prices rebounded in all three European centres at once
yesterday.
Yet Frankfurt's rally was the least convincing of the three, amounting to
less than half a per cent. Investors there apparently believe a falling rate
of headline inflation is not in itself enough to convince the Bundesbank to
relax. The central bank remains concerned about the credibility of its
efforts to control money supply, still growing at around 8.5 per cent. This
week it has been draining liquidity from the local money market. That said,
yesterday's FT-SE advance gives some indication how smartly London could
rebound when the Bundesbank does decide to move. Whether it will then still
be marching in time with the Frankfurt equity market is less clear. That
will depend on whether the latter is more sensitive to lower interest rates
than to a weak economy and disappointing corporate earnings.

FT  15 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets: Hard line investors trim Switzerland's
gains - The professionals have been merciless since the news began to change
for the worse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Warnings started to go out a few weeks ago that most of the forces which had
made the Swiss stock market the best performer in Europe during the first
half of this year had played themselves out.
The rest of the year, according to many analysts, promises to be much less
buoyant. 'There is no reason to be aggressive on the Swiss market now,' says
Mr Serge Ledermann, head of equity research at Lombard Odier &amp; Cie in
Geneva. Mr Robin Seydoux of Credit Suisse agrees. 'There is little potential
for the Swiss market at the moment,' he says.
This is not, however, a unanimous view. Some feel that even though times are
tougher the Swiss market will continue to outperform many other European
markets, mainly because the profit outlook for the top Swiss companies
remains surprisingly good. 'We still favour the Swiss market as one of the
best in Europe,' says Mr Martin Gollner at Barings in London.
The all-share Swiss Performance Index (SPI) started the year at 1,053 and
rose smartly to the 1,200 level in early May. It remained there for a month
before sliding back to yesterday's close at 1,119, leaving it still some 6
per cent up in the year to date. The SMI index of leading shares has
followed a similar pattern, rising from 1,670 at the beginning of the year
to a peak of 1,988 in early May. It is now back at 1,791.
Among the factors contributing to the market's rise were very high profit
growth last year by leading Swiss companies and expectations of more good
results this year. Also, there were indications early in the year that
inflation and interest rates were about to fall and the recession in
Switzerland to end.
Lastly, there was the great leap forward in transparency and investor
friendliness achieved by many Swiss companies as the implementation of a new
companies law in July approached. Share splits and better financial
reporting were particularly appreciated by foreign investors, and analysts
agree that it has been foreign investors who have driven the market so far
this year.
In the past few weeks, most of these trends have been supplanted by less
pleasant ones, both political and economic. Probably the most important new
consideration has been the postponement of anticipated interest rate
reductions following Germany's discount rate hike a month ago.
Since then, Swiss economists have been revising down their already modest
1992 GDP growth forecasts. Credit Suisse, for example, cut its forecast from
0.8 per cent to 0.3 per cent. The dimmer economic outlook has naturally
raised worries about corporate profits. Credit Suisse has revised downwards
its estimate of profit growth for the 21 SMI stocks from 18.4 per cent to
15.1 per cent.
Investors have been merciless in recent days with companies which have
indicated in interim reports that business was deteriorating. Elco Looser, a
popular maker of high technology burners, said on August 4 that its profit
growth would not be as high as it hoped, and the shares have since shed
SFr150 to SFr2,400. Logitech has been similarly hit, with the shares down
SFr11 to SFr139 in just over a week.
The noticeable exceptions to this trend have been the big bank stocks, which
have been firm in spite of the gloomier interest rate outlook and warnings
in the interim statements of Credit Suisse and Swiss Bank Corporation of
higher than expected provisions this year.
Mr Gollmer observes that inflation has halved in the past year and he thinks
that interest rates have finally peaked. Thus it is probably time to start
looking at the banks and insurance companies again. This view was reinforced
last Wednesday by BZ Vision, an investment holding company which launched a
SFr200m rights issue in Zurich to boost its investments in financial company
shares.
Then there are the looming milestone decisions concerning Switzerland's
future relations with the European Community. On September 27, the Swiss
will vote on an Alpine transit treaty with the EC, providing a good guide on
how they will vote in December or next year on joining the so called
European Economic Area (EEA). Both votes will undoubtedly be influenced by
the result of the September 20 referendum in France on the Maastricht
treaty.
Mr Beat Philipp of Bank Vontobel in Zurich believes that political
uncertainty over European integration is 'the major force' driving European
markets at the moment. In terms of the influences on the Swiss market, he
believes a rejection of Maastricht by the French would be positive,
restoring a bit of the safe haven patina to Swiss securities. But the Swiss
vote on the EEA is much more important, and a 'No' vote would be very
negative because failure to join the EEA would weaken the country's economic
growth potential.
At present, the likelihood of a Swiss rejection of the EEA treaty is in our
view seriously underestimated, especially by observers outside our borders,'
Mr Philipp argues ominously.
The political factors alone suggest that there could be a high level of
volatility in the market in the coming months. And that makes most analysts
tend to fall back on the very strong, and relatively inexpensive
multinationals like Nestle, Sandoz, Roche and Ciba-Geigy, the latter two on
p/e's of 13 and about 10 1/2 , while US competitors in the pharmaceutical
industry, like Merck and Pfizer, are on around 20.

FT  15 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): German economic slowdown gives
bourses confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEWS that German wholesale prices fell by 1.3 per cent in July from
June, and 0.9 per cent from July, 1991, gave bourses something to bite on
yesterday afternoon, writes Our Markets Staff.
The question was whether investors were really moving, or just talking about
it, while traders covered their short positions and tried, on a Friday
afternoon, to make a little weekend spending money.
PARIS was encouraged by the German economic data and comments by Bundesbank
deputy president Mr Hans Tietmeyer, interpreted as implying no immediate
change in German interest rates. The CAC-40 index, which hit a year's low on
Thursday, closed up 31.10 at 1,753.46, still 1.3 per cent down on the week.
The futures market reacted quickly to the German news, having been depressed
in early trading, and this enthusiasm was quickly taken up by equities.
However, in spite of the mild euphoria that greeted the unexpected change of
direction, turnover remained moderate at FFr1.62bn.
Some FFr102m of that was accounted for by dealings in Eurotunnel which
continued to rise on earlier reports that settlement may be in sight over
the dispute between the group and contractors. Its shares advanced FFr2.60
or 8 per cent to FFr35.10.
FRANKFURT had little time to react to the prices data and the DAX index,
while it rose 6.82 to 1,547.80 on the day, still closed 3.8 per cent down on
the week. There were signs in London, later, that blue chips were recovering
further in the post bourse.
Turnover fell from DM6bn to DM4.9bn. During the session, the carmakers BMW
and Daimler dropped DM1.50 to DM530.50 and DM3.50 to DM617 respectively.
Dealers said that the weaker dollar has been weighing on exporters and Mr
Hans Peter Wodniok, of James Capel in Frankfurt, expected a sizeable drop
when the July car registration data come out in about a week.
Mr Wodniok said that yesterday's was a technical recovery, perhaps with some
shorts covered, but that after the severe depression of sentiment on Tuesday
and Wednesday in particular, people were beginning to think about equity
investment again.
AMSTERDAM, encouraged by its neighbours, moved ahead with the CBS Tendency
index gaining 1.5 to 113.3. But weakness throughout the rest of the week
resulted in the index shedding 2.2 per cent over that period.
Wessanen, the food products group, stood out with a rise of Fl 2.20 to Fl
87.70 after earlier reporting a 13 per cent rise in first half earnings.
ING, the insurance group, rose 20 cents to Fl 46.20 on news that it was not
to take a 5 per cent stake in Banque Bruxelles Lambert.
MILAN weakened on Moody's downgrading of Italy's foreign currency debt
rating, the Comit index dropping 4.58 to 393.70, 5.6 per cent lower on the
week, in very low volume.
Investors ignored preliminary measures to enliven the market, and to advance
the government's ambitious privatisation programme, announced late on
Thursday by the finance minister Mr Giovanni Goria.
Traders did note, however, that the insurance sector posted gains in
after-hours trading, partly on rumours of a devaluation of the lira, which
has been under speculative pressure. Ras closed down L265 to L13,744 but
recovered to L13,908 later, while Alleanza fell L206 to L11,069 but
recovered all of that and L2 more to end at L11,277.
MADRID followed Europe up, the general index finished 2.09 higher at 207.58,
3.8 per cent lower on the weak, but dealers said that the higher prices had
hardly any support in volume terms.
Banks were the outstanding feature, led higher by Santander which gained
Pta130, or 3.9 per cent to Pta3,500. Banesto added Pta65 to Pta2,160 and
Popular Pta180 to Pta8,800.
OSLO rose for the first time in eleven trading sessions, the all share index
ending 3.49 better at 351.33, still 3.1 per cent lower on the week.
VIENNA ended the week stronger with the ATX index up 13.12 at 696.08, but
3.3 per cent lower over five days.

SMALL-LOT short covering and index-linked buying supported share prices, and
the Nikkei average rose for the first time in seven trading days, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei closed up 52.08 at 14,820.25, down 4.5 per cent on the week.
Option-related selling, linked to the settlement of August option contracts,
brought it down in the morning to the day's low of 14,657.27, but as dealers
and investors tried to cover short positions in the afternoon and the index
hit the day's high of 14,928.54.
Volume swelled to 280m shares from 197m. Traders said option related
activity accounted for about 90m to 100m shares. Advances led declines by
568 to 350 with 152 unchanged, the Topix index of all first section stocks
rose 5.63 to 1,123.13 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 2.50 to
935.84.
Traders noted small-lot bargain hunting by US pension funds. 'They are
interested in averaging down prices on their holdings of blue chips, but the
orders are not large enough to support the overall market,' said Mr Ross
Purdie at SG Warburg Securities.
Issues which had been sold heavily recently rebounded on short covering.
Nippon Housing Loan, the financially troubled housing loan company, surged
Y16 to Y118, along with Nippon Credit Bank, the long-term credit bank facing
increasing property related problem loans, which advanced Y250 to Y3,950.
Dealers bought back speculative theme stocks, previously lower on profit
taking. Okamoto Industries gained Y80 to Y930 and Meiji Milk Products rose
Y21 to Y770.
Highly-priced issues, previously sold by investors facing margin calls,
rebounded on bargain hunting. Sega Enterprises gained Y30 to Y7,680 and
Seven-Eleven Japan added Y140 to Y6,290.
Motorcycle makers advanced on the sharp rise in last month's motorcycle
exports to the US. Yamaha rose Y21 to Y822 and Suzuki Motor Y3 to Y736.
Suzuki has outperformed the market by over 25 per cent during the last three
months, due to rumours of an acquisition by a leading US car company.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 97.13 to 15,770.22 in volume of 13.2m shares.

FT  15 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FAVOURABLE economic data in the UK and Germany generated a squeeze sending
stock index futures sharply forward, writes Joel Kibazo.
September opened at 2,322 and traded sideways in a tight range for the next
couple of hours and briefly dipped to 2,317 at around 10am, the low point of
the day.
Bear closing thereafter helped September gently forward, before the release
of favourable UK retail price figures and good wholesale figures in Germany
led to strong demand for the contract.
The contract continued forward during the afternoon with buying interest
boosted by the strong performance in the gilts market, though a positive
opening on Wall Street was said to have had no impact on the day's trading.
September closed at 2,390, up 61 on the previous session and around 21
points above its estimated fair value premium of about 12. Turnover was
9,128.
The traded options saw an improvement in activity of the stock options.
Total volume reached 29,137 contract with the FT-SE 100 option trading
9,222. BTR was the busiest stock option at 2,152.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the Markets): Precious
metals prices plunge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLUNGING PRECIOUS metals prices gave market commentators an opportunity to
explore the racier reaches of their vocabularies this week.
'The bears have really got the bit between their teeth,' commented one
dealer as London gold and platinum prices fell by Dollars 8.10 and Dollars
16 a troy ounce respectively on Thursday. 'It came down so fast you would be
a mug to touch it,' said Mr Wiktor Bielski, analyst with Carr Kitkat &amp;
Aitken. In the aftermath the market looked 'horrible', he added, and Ms
Rhona O'Connell, of Williams de Broe, suggested that there were 'an awful
lot of shell-shocked people out there'. Mr Ted Arnold, metals specialist at
Merrill Lynch, seeing no strong buying on the horizon, thought Dollars 355
an ounce, a level last seen less than two weeks ago, 'now looks like the
Matterhorn'.
The pace of the decline slowed yesterday, though the technical correction
some traders had been hoping for failed to materialise. The 'bears', having
presumably let go of the bit, were still 'hovering' over the market, one
dealer told the Reuter news agency.
Gold's Dollars 2.80 fall on the day left the price at Dollars 335.45 an
ounce, down Dollars 15.50 on the week and only 256 cents above the 1992 low.
Contributing to the metal's weakness was a fall in the US Commodities
Research Bureau index, which is widely watched as an inflation indicator,
and Australian selling encouraged by the weakness of the Australian dollar.
But the main influence was the extreme weakness of the platinum market.
The platinum price slide began quietly enough with a Dollars 2.25 fall in
London on Monday to Dollars 375 an ounce. But the decline accelerated
overnight on the New York market, where the October futures position's
Dollars 8.30 fall to Dollars 370.30 an ounce broke a chart uptrend line.
Concern about sharp falls in equity values in Japan, the biggest buyer of
platinum, and improving hopes of the resumption of constitutional talks in
South Africa encouraged a continued bail-out by US investors as the week
progressed. As the South African hopes faded yesterday morning there were
suggestions that a pre-weekend rally was on the cards. But downtrend was too
firmly entrenched and New York platinum futures continued downwards. The
October position was at Dollars 343 an ounce in late trading, down Dollars
4.90 on the day and Dollars 35.60 on the week. In the afternoon the London
price had been fixed at Dollars 346.25 an ounce, down Dollars 31 on the
week.
The seasonal slackening in base metals demand during the northern hemisphere
summer was much in evidence at the London Metal Exchange this week. All
contracts except tin ended lower.
The sharpest fall was in lead, demand for which is generally slack at this
time of year as the replacement car battery market nears the low point of
its seasonal cycle. Cash lead closed yesterday at Pounds 329 a tonne, down
Pounds 5.50 on the day and Pounds 19.50 week.
The copper market dropped through the floor of its recent trading range in
mid-week but then found support at the equivalent of Dollars 2,480 a tonne
for three months metal. The three months price closed yesterday at Pounds
1,316.50 a tonne, down Pounds 10 on the week. In dollar terms the price was
Dollars 2,481 a tonne, down Dollars 31.50 on the week.
At the London Futures and Options Exchange cocoa and coffee prices were in
retreat. In the absence of a clear fundamental explanation traders
attributed cocoa's fall, which left the December delivery position Pounds 23
down at Pounds 644 a tonne, to bearish chart patterns and 'tired long
liquidation'.
London's robusta coffee market suffered by association with the New York
arabicas market, which came under pressure because of an over-supplied
situation that may be exacerbated by increased Colombian exports if reports
circulating this week prove correct.
In contrast, robusta supplies are tight, and London traders could find no
fundamental justification for this week's fall, which took the November
futures position to Dollars 723 a tonne, down Dollars 40 on balance.
In New York both cotton and orange juice prices were pushed to
life-of-contract lows during the week. Cotton was depressed by an estimate
in a US Department of Agriculture crop report that world production was
significantly higher than the trade had thought at about 16.5m bales. Orange
juice's weakness was influenced by reports of a big and early Brazilian
orange harvest and prospects of a bumper Florida crop.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Inflation figures ease D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE D-MARK eased against the US dollar and European currencies yesterday
after good wholesale prices figures in Germany suggested that inflationary
pressures there may have abated, writes James Blitz.
After significantly strengthening against all currencies on Thursday, the
D-Mark closed one pfennig softer against the US dollar at DM1.4690. However,
analysts said that this may be only a temporary respite, and that traders
could try and test the dollar's lows again next week.
A better-than expected set of German wholesale prices for July suggested
that inflationary pressures there have eased, and reduced dealers' fears of
another Lombard rate rise. Wholesale prices plunged 1.3 per cent from the
previous month and was down 0.9 per cent from a year earlier - the first
year-on year decline since 1990.
Some currency dealers interpreted the figures as one of the most promising
signs yet that the Bundesbank will not need to raise its interest rates
again. One analyst suggested that the dip in inflation will force the
Bundesbank to abandon M3 money supply as the gauge by which it fixes
interest rates, in the same way that the British government did in the
mid-1980s.
However, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank Vice-President, softened the
impact of the figures in a German TV interview by suggesting that they did
not signify a fall in indigenous German inflation. "It is partly the result
of import prices and exchange rates," he said. The forex market will also
have to wait for the publication of the M3 money supply figure for July, due
on Wednesday, before it can interpret the Bundesbank's next move.
Sterling's recent fall against the D-Mark was slowed by the German inflation
figures, although Britain's own figure for headline inflation in July, down
0.2 percentage points from the previous month, had little impact. The pound
closed at DM2.8150 from a previous close of DM2.8170. Analysts say that
sterling's immediate fate will be decided by two factors: the strength of
the dollar and next Wednesday's figure for Second Quarter GDP, which is
expected to be poor. Pressure grows on the Bank of England to support the
currency in the open market.
The lira remained weak against the D-Mark, as dealers continued to be swayed
by Moody's two-notch downgrading of Italy's foreign currency debt on
Thursday. There was no change in Italian interest rates yesterday, although
dealers continue to feel that the Bank of Italy's recent cut in its discount
rate was premature. The lira closed down at L759.9 from a previous finish of
L759.3. The French franc finished up against the D-Mark at FFr3.389 from
FFr3.392.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Money Markets: Strong futures rally
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING futures opened down from their previous levels yesterday as the
market remained concerned by the pound's performance on the foreign
exchanges. But good inflation figures in Germany and comments from a
Bundesbank official boosted them in heavy trading later in the day.
The September short sterling contract opened down 3 basis points, at 89.60,
as dealers took stock of sterling's recent fall below DM2.8200 against the
D-Mark. However, an
UK clearing bank base lending rate 10 per cent from May 5, 1992 unexpectedly
sharp drop in Germany's wholesale prices for July, which were down 1.3 per
cent from the previous month, suggested that inflationary pressures - and
the pressure on the Bundesbank to raise interest rates - may be abating.
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank Vice-President, helped to make the mood
more bullish by saying that the German central bank would look at the
possibility of changing interest rates in two months time, putting on ice
the prospect of higher German rates.
The September contract rose in the afternoon, closing at 89.74, up 14 basis
points from its opening level. The December contract also closed up 16 basis
points from its opening level at 89.82. Both rallies were in tandem with a
strong performance in Euro-Deutschmark futures: the September Euromark
contract closed up 6 basis points at 90.21. One discount house trader
suggested that the bearish mood of recent months might even be coming to an
end.
Dealers in the sterling cash market were less impressed by the news from
Germany and the fall in UK inflation. Three-month money closed fractionally
down at 10 7/32 per cent on the offered side from a previous close of 10 1/4
per cent. Both 6-month and 1-year money ended unchanged at 10 5/16 per cent
on the offered side. Uncertainties about the future of European Monetary
Union continue to take their toll.
Short dates softened after the the Bank of England's shortage of Pounds 750m
was quickly removed. In early operations, the Bank purchased Pounds 650m in
a repurchase agreement (repo) at 9 15/16 per cent. In the afternoon, it
purchased Pounds 101m in Band 1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent.
The overnight rate consequently softened to 8 per cent from a previous close
of 9 1/2 per cent.

FT  15 AUG 92 / International Company News: Semi-Tech to invest in joint
venture in Shanghai
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SEMI-TECH, the Hong Kong owner of the Singer Company, yesterday announced a
major thrust into the mainland Chinese market. It unveiled plans to invest
USDollars 14m with Singer in a sewing machine joint venture in Shanghai and
up to USDollars 100m over coming years in related ventures in China.
Semi-Tech and Singer will join with Shanghai Yah Chong Sewing Machine
Company to form Singer (Shanghai) Sewing Machine Company. Singer will own 70
per cent of the venture and its Chinese partner, which will contribute
USDollars 6m, the balance.
Singer will provide manu-facturing technology and management for the joint
venture which is expected to occupy a 40,000 square metre site in the
Shanghai Minhang economic and development zone of the city. The factory
there will produce multi-function zig-zag machines which can be operated
either manually or electrically.
The company will be permitted to sell up to 70 per cent of its production on
the Chinese market - the highest percentage yet offered to a foreign
joint-venture - and export the remainder, principally to Africa and the
Middle East. Singer will be allowed to repatriate profits in equal
proportion to its foreign sales, company executives said.
Production is expected to take place in three stages. From October this
year, the company will import 20,000 knocked-down machines for assembly. By
1994, production is expected to reach 200,000 units as imports are phased
out in favour of domestically produced machines. Phase three, to be
completed by 1995, will result in full production of 400,000 units a year.
Singer plans to open a chain of up to 100 stores throughout China to market
not only its sewing machines but other consumer durables. Three sites have
already been chosen in Shanghai and two in Guangzhou (Canton).
Mr James Ting, chairman of both Semi-Tech and Singer, said that, with
Singer's retail distribution expertise and Semi-Tech's intimate knowledge of
the China market, 'we are confident that Singer Shanghai will succeed and
grow with the rapidly developing China market."
Mr Ting said that over the next three years Semi-Tech would invest up to
USDollars 100m in other joint ventures currently nearing agreement.

FT  15 AUG 92 / International Company News: Tapie to take finance group
private
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR BERNARD Tapie, the controversial French businessman and politician, has
ended months of uncertainty over the future of Bernard Tapie Finance, his
holding company, by returning the group to private status this autumn.
The decision to withdraw from the stock market marks a watershed in the
fortunes of BTF and in the rags-to-riches story of Mr Tapie, who earlier
this summer was forced to resign after a seven-week stint in the French
cabinet because of his involvement in a fraud case.
BTF emerged in the 1980s as one of France's fastest growing companies during
an acquisition spree in which Mr Tapie, who comes from a working class
family, bought a series of bankrupt businesses.
Two years ago, Mr Tapie pulled off the coup of his corporate career in the
acquisition for FFr1.6bn (Dollars 323m) of Adidas, the German company which
is one of the world's best known sporting goods groups.
However, BTF struggled under the debts amassed in the Adidas deal. It was
forced to sell off minority stakes in Adidas and almost all its original
businesses.
Last month it sold its remaining 58 per cent stake in Adidas' parent company
to Pentland Industries, the UK consumer products company, for FFr1.64bn.
The disposals have left Mr Tapie with a cash surplus of FFr900m which will
be used to reconstruct BTF.
The only industrial interests left within BTF are Testut-Teraillon, a
weighing machine manufacturer, and Sciame, a small industrial concern. It is
now in the final stages of negotiating to sell both companies and expects to
complete the disposals this year.
BTF, capitalised at about FFr900m on its suspended share price of FFr130,
has begun the process of returning to private status.
It plans to withdraw its quotation on France's secondary stock market on
November 7, the day the Adidas deal is due for completion.
The company said yesterday that an offer will be made to buy back the shares
still in public issue. These account for less than 5 per cent of the total.
The offer will be based on an external valuation of BTF's net asset value
which is expected to be completed next month.
Once BTF has returned to private status, Mr Tapie plans to reinvest his
FFr900m. However, this time he is expected to look for investment
opportunities in the financial and service sectors.

FT  15 AUG 92 / International Company News: ING rejects 5% stake in BBL
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONALE Nederlanden Group (ING), the Dutch banking and insurance
company, turned down a chance to buy a 5 per cent stake in Belgium's
second-largest bank, Banque Bruxelles Lambert, but reaffirmed its interest
in raising its 10 per cent stake.
ING is eager to create a second 'home' market in Belgium but yesterday
rejected an offer from SBH Investment, a subsidiary of Unipar, the Italian
holding company, to acquire its nearly 914,000 shares in BBL at BFr3,800
(Dollars 125) each, about 10 per cent above their current market value.
BBL's major institutional shareholders belong to a syndicate which
stipulates that members must offer each other the right to first refusal
when divesting their holdings.
BBL said 'no shareholder in the syndicate decided to buy the shares at the
price fixed by SBH Investments'.
This leaves the Italian company free to find other buyers for the shares,
provided they are sold at BFr 3,800 each.
If it lowers the price, it must approach syndicate members again, starting
with Groupe Bruxelles Lambert (GBL) which owns a 13.5 per cent stake, but
which controls 24.2 per cent thanks to allies Royale Belge and UAP of
France.
ING said its decision was based on a 'complex of factors' but declined to
elaborate.
Analysts believe one factor is a Belgian law requiring that a public bid be
launched if an investor buys shares at a premium and thereby acquires
control of the company.
The 5.2 per cent holding would have formally made ING the single biggest
shareholder in BBL at 15.2 per cent, ahead of GBL. ING is seeking to
conclude an insurance partnership with BBL as part of its European expansion
plans, but GBL and some other Belgian institutions would prefer the bank to
forge links with the publicly-owned Belgian credit institution Credit
Communal.

FT  15 AUG 92 / International Company News: LTV bankruptcy moves step closer
to resolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the most complex and fractious US bankruptcies moved a step closer to
resolution, after a Manhattan judge gave LTV Corporation, the large steel
company, permission to sell its missile and aircraft divisions for Dollars
475m late on Thursday.
The buyer of the LTV businesses is a group comprising Loral Corporation,
Northrop and Carlyle Group, an investment banking firm. Loral will take over
the missile unit for Dollars 261m and Northrop/Carlyle will buy the aircraft
operations for Dollars 214m.
This bid, of which Dollars 450m is in cash and Dollars 25m in preferred
stock, topped a Dollars 440m rival offer from Martin Marietta.
Under the terms, the Loral group could be liable for a Dollars 100m payment
if it fails to close the transaction, while Martin Marietta gets a Dollars
5m fee, in return for releasing LTV from its earlier pledge to accept its
bid.
The bankruptcy judge acknowledged the role Martin Marietta had played in the
sale process, but declined to approve a Dollars 10m fee, suggesting Dollars
5m instead.
The sale is probably one of the last dramas in the LTV bankruptcy, which has
run for over five years. The company devised a reorganisation plan earlier
this year which is likely to win creditor approval, but the sale of these
businesses was a prerequisite to its adoption.
If the reorganisation scheme goes ahead, LTV would emerge from bankruptcy as
the nation's third largest steel maker and a major supplier of oilfield
equipment.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Where schools are going wrong: Andrew Adonis takes issue
with a Godly prescription for education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ALMIGHTY, it seems, has a key role in English education policy. A
chapter of last month's education White Paper is devoted to 'spiritual and
moral development.'
Religious education and collective worship, it argues, have a crucial role
in promoting 'the spiritual and moral dimension in schools.' From them will
come a 'clear vision' of community values, 'respect for people and property;
honesty and consideration for others; trust, fairness and politeness.'
It is the Christian - nay, Catholic - God that John Patten has in mind. The
education secretary's views on the importance of eternal damnation in
promoting discipline and obedience among the young were outlined while he
was minister for law and order. 'Dwindling belief in redemption and
damnation has led to a loss of fear of the eternal consequences of goodness
and badness,' he wrote. 'It has a profound effect on personal morality,
especially on criminality.'
The White Paper is more low key. 'Proper regard should continue to be paid
to the nation's Christian heritage and traditions,' is the most bureaucrats
can muster. Lady Blatch, schools minister, followed that by telling local
authorities to produce religious education syllabuses which 'reflect
Christian traditions while taking account of the teaching and practices of
the other principal religions.'
Now, crime is crime, whatever its causes; and Christian leaders ought to
condemn wrongdoing, even if they think more should be done for the
under-privileged. No corner should be allowed to the moral relativism so
prevalent among our comfortable literati.
Although uncomfortable with hell-fire and damnation, I am even among the
small band of Anglicans who attend church and am at one with Housman:
since, my soul, we cannot fly
To Saturn nor to Mercury,
Keep we must, if keep we can,
These foreign laws of God and man.
For all that, Patten's policy is flawed. It confuses ethics and
Christianity. (In Germany, pupils study one or the other). It will offend
the non-Christian communities comprising many of Britain's most troubled
districts. It is also based on the dubious assumption that formal worship
and religious instruction in schools have much effect on belief in society.
In the US, levels of Christian observance are three to five times higher
than in Britain. Yet, the constitution prohibits worship in state schools
and urban crime levels make Bristol and Birmingham seem havens of peace.
What is the cause?
There is no empirical evidence that goodness and fear of the Lord go
hand-in-hand. Belief in God, or heaven and hell, is not a pre-requisite for
living a moral life. Many Christians are 'good,' but enforcing Christian
worship and instruction among rebellious adolescents is unlikely to slash
crime figures.
It will, however, create problems in the state's relations with
non-Christian minorities. If there are Catholic schools with tough
regulations on school worship and RE, why not Moslem schools with compulsory
Koran and selective admission based on observance?
The government is right to feature high standards of behaviour and community
values in its education policy. But compulsory prayers and RE will not
promote them where they are lacking: what is needed is a greater sense of
responsibility among some parents, and a stronger involvement by state
schools in extra-curricular and community activities.
The education system cannot reform neglectful parents but it could do more,
with local agencies, to help those unable to cope and to shield children at
risk. One priority is a national policy for children who need, or would
benefit from, boarding education. Most of Britain's boarding sector is only
for the wealthy. The assisted places scheme does not cater for boarding, and
social service departments rarely can afford to pay for children to board.
What does the white paper say about this? Nothing.
It is hardly more forthcoming about extra-curricular school life - the
sport, drama, music, travel, voluntary work and societies which used to play
so large a part in schools and did so much to foster 'community values.' In
New Zealand, these are dubbed not extra- but co-curricular activities.
The biggest disaster in British education in the past 15 years has been the
shrivelling of that side of state schools. How many comprehensives still
field sports teams on Saturday mornings? Even music is under threat because
of shortages of funds and teachers.
Strikes by teachers in the mid-1980s, plus ill-judged ministerial onslaughts
upon the profession, are the main culprits. But whoever is to blame, the
consequences are clear: too many state schools now shut with the last bell,
their co-curricular activities minimal or non-existent. Reviving them should
be a priority.
When you compare Britain's independent and state sectors, the greatest
contrast lies in how much more goes on outside classrooms in the private
sector. And, no, it is not all done by the chaplain.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Private View: Playwright seeks fair trial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIX YEARS out of Cambridge with a history degree, aged 28, Rod Williams has
never had a proper job.
But he is not unemployed. He sits in his bedsitter at the top of a house in
Kentish Town, north London, for up to seven hours a day, typing. When he has
had a good day he treats himself to a curry. When things have gone badly, he
doesn't.
Supported by the dole, a bank overdraft, part-time teaching and the
occasional windfall - an Arts Council grant, a privately-funded prize - he
spends about Pounds 100 a week. He has no wife, lover or children to worry
about.
Rod Williams is a playwright, in a country where the creative artist is too
often regarded as an eccentric supernumerary and at a time when the market
for new plays has probably never been smaller.
'If it rains', he said, 'I get wet feet. All of my shoes have got holes.'
This is not a hard luck story. Williams has volunteered for his life on the
fringe. He is not obsessed, not driven by an imperious Muse. Furthermore, he
has had a success.
His first play, No Remission, a gripping study of three lifers in a prison
cell, was awarded second prize in the Mobil/Royal Exchange competition in
1988, was staged on the Edinburgh Festival fringe in 1990 and today comes to
the end of a highly-praised run at the Lyric Studio in Hammersmith, London.
Success may be intoxicating but it does not pay many bills. Williams has
earned terrific plaudits from No Remission and Pounds 600 in cash. Poverty,
he told me, is a grind.
'The only way to improve as a writer is to write. It's a bit like clocking
up mileage. On the other hand, writing is a very solitary activity and the
poorer you get the more solitary it becomes because your social life withers
away. You don't meet people through work.
'I've certainly felt over the last two or three years 'My God, now I know
what the grind of poverty is like.' Of course, I'm not homeless or anything.
What I'm experiencing is nothing compared to real poverty, but it's a grind
compared with what I've been used to.'
Williams is used to a comfortable middle-class life in the Home Counties.
His father is a Canadian lawyer who moved to England and married a British
girl. His parents divorced when he was 11 but he was able to go to Bedales
School and won a place at Trinity College, Cambridge.
He is quick-witted and softly spoken, a bit earnest in the articulation of
his views, occasionally comic. He has a sophisticated, sceptical and very
independent mind, and plays Scriabin on the piano. He wrote his first play
at the age of nine, a country-house murder story. For it, he bought large
quantities of fake blood which he stitched in sachets to the schoolboy
actors' T-shirts. Unluckily, the blood leaked out long before the planned
finale of multiple stabbings.
At Cambridge he made three short films. Then BBC Scotland showed interest in
a TV play and Williams, though by now realising that very few people make a
living from playwriting, was committed.
After No Remission he wrote Creative People, the story of a power struggle
in a telephone sales company caused by the arrival of a cult-trained new
manager. Again the BBC has shown interest, again without result.
His third play, finished last week after two and a half years, is a satire
about cryonics, the fashion for having your body deep-frozen after death for
eventual revival when science solves the problem of how to do it. The Life
of the World to Come, involving seven characters, Americans, in a Caribbean
tax haven is intended not so much to mock cryonics as to satirise what
Williams regards as the primitive superstition of even advanced societies.
I asked the author why, in No Remission, he had chosen a subject and a
vernacular so far from his own experience.
'I think you have an intuition, an instinct. It sounds like a crazy idea: I
hadn't been to prison. People warned me that however good the play was it
wouldn't ring true, and if it did ring true, nobody in the theatre would
know it and would suspect that it didn't. But when you decide what you're
going to write about, nothing is going to stop you.
'It was another crazy idea to write a play in a foreign language, American.
But you're driven to write when you have a hunch that you'll be able to do
it.'
A former lifer from Barlinnie jail declared No Remission to be the best play
about prison he had seen. A group of convicts' wives were reduced to tears
by it and said it was too strong to be shown to inmates.
'I've written a play about prison,' Williams said, 'but prison is just
bricks and iron, a destination where people end up. In a way prison
represents - I don't want this to sound too high-falutin' - their fate for
at least two of my characters.'
Fate, as personified by ancient Greek tragedy, played a large part in
Williams' inspiration. He has become an avid reader of Aeschylus and
Sophocles and finds confirmatory solace and stimulus in Aristotle's Poetics.
'For me style and form are subordinate to content. The problem of drama is
how to compress so that everything is essential - how to avoid the prosaic.
That is something into which Aristotle had tremendous insights. Every time I
read the Poetics a new sentence will spring out.'
Are you fatalistic yourself?
'Not in any superstitious sense. Only in the sense that character is fate
and in so far as I think your cognisance of your own character is much more
limited than you realise. I think that's also true of a culture and it's a
kind of hubris to claim to understand it more than you do.
'To me, socialism was a form of hubris. It claimed an understanding of
society and culture and economics: the boldness of its claims was so total
and yet so completely wrong.'
What are your politics, then?
'I regard Left and Right as terms which have been used to bamboozle minds
that should have known better. Who is anything now? There's no longer any
excuse for being Left or Right. Those are just ways of preventing yourself
looking at society and its problems.'
No Remission has been been called an old-fashioned play, a criticism which
Williams takes as a compliment to his craftsmanship.
'I get very easily bored in the theatre,' he said. 'You know, I'm not a sort
of theatre buff. A good play is about a specific environment in which
everyone can be interested. It should be immune to fashion.'
What about feminist and ethnic plays?
'A play's a play. It's either good or bad.'
Even if it's written for a designated audience?
'Well, I haven't any time for that. Political plays, like melodrama, become
obsessed with the villain - in this case Late Capitalism is usually the
villain and it has to be personified in a totally implausible way.'
For a play to last it should create its own life, he continued. Too many
relied on current topics or opinions to give them a third dimension. 'In ten
years' time those plays will just look two-dimensional again.'
Then what motivates you to write plays?
'I look at it this way. I write for myself: I write for me as the audience.
I hope there will be another big audience for what I write. There's the
pleasure of writing and polishing dialogue. There is a pleasure in being the
God of your own world. I suppose I'm rationalising post hoc: I haven't got
pat answers . . .
'I suppose the desire to force people to see things your way. I suppose
that's what you do. You give them a vision of reality and they have to
accept it. The nice thing is you never know what people are going to say.
'I want them to enjoy themselves, that's another thing. But I haven't got an
agenda. The writing of the play is an end in itself. Obviously I want it to
be enthralling. People might misunderstand it. But if they enjoy it and they
get something out of it, that's the bottom line.
'There is a view that a writer wants to change the world. I just don't know
if I do or not. I think it is true that I want people to look at the stuff
and say 'Yes, this is real, this is plausible.'
You cannot doubt the seriousness of this dramatist. Yet he says he is not
resigned to living a life of poverty. If he cannot make it, he will stop.
'You can make a living but it may take a very long time. On the other hand,
one good play can be very, very valuable. So I motivate myself with that
fantasy. If I can't get anyone interested in this new play I shall be forced
to do something else. I won't mind that. Sooner or later there has to be a
reckoning.'
If that moment arrives, I asked, what would you do instead?
'I don't know. I had thought of training to be a graphologist as a source of
income. That also fascinates me. You see, there is a view that writers just
have to write, that whatever the objective circumstances they'll do it.
There's a certain amount of truth to that but there's a lot of nonsense as
well.'
In that brotherhood of anonymous toilers Rod Williams has had the
self-confidence, talent (and luck) to be 'discovered'. But in these days of
rising costs and ultra-cautious producers the detection of new talent is
only the first step. Will the author of No Remission now get a proper
hearing?

FT  15 AUG 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Major Major Major
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I FIND John Major puzzling. Nothing ever daunts him. The British prime
minister has backed himself into a shockingly tight corner on the UK economy
and the European exchange rate mechanism, yet he just keeps smiling. Bullets
bounce off him. He is unmarked by criticism. No foe can vanquish him. He
continues to watch cricket and to enjoy simple food. He is obviously a happy
man, loved by the people. He smiles like a saint.
I think I have found the reason. I stumbled on it this week when reading
Barry Gifford's novel, The Wild Life of Sailor and Lula, in which Gifford,
en passant, recounts the story of the five Chinese brothers.
The five Chinese brothers were identical and lived with their mother. One
brother could swallow the sea; another had an iron neck; another could
stretch his legs an unlimited distance; another could not be burned; the
fifth could hold his breath for ever.
The Chinese brother who could swallow the sea went fishing one morning with
a small boy who had begged to accompany him. The Chinese brother allowed the
small boy to go with him on condition that he obey the brother's orders
promptly. The boy promised he would do so. At the shore, the Chinese brother
swallowed the sea and gathered some fish while holding the water in his
mouth. The boy ran out and started to collect items of treasure.
The Chinese brother signalled for his companion to return but the boy did
not pay any attention. The brother motioned frantically for the boy to come
back, for he knew he would burst unless he released the sea. But his friend
did not respond. The brother let the sea go and the boy disappeared.
The Chinese brother was arrested and condemned to have his head severed. On
the day of execution he asked the judge if he could be allowed to go home
and say goodbye to his mother. The judge agreed, and the Chinese brother who
could swallow the sea went home. The brother who returned was the brother
with an iron neck.
All the people in the town gathered in the square to see the sentence
carried out, but when the executioner brought his sword down, it bent, and
the head was not severed. The crowd became angry and demanded that he be
drowned. On the day of execution this brother asked if he could go home and
bid his mother farewell. The judge permitted it.
The brother who returned was the one capable of stretching his legs. When he
was thrown overboard in the middle of the ocean he rested his feet on the
bottom and kept his head above water. The people were furious and decided he
should be burned.
On the day of execution the Chinese brother asked permission to go home and
say goodbye to his mother. The judge said: 'It is only fair,' and agreed to
it. The brother who returned was the one who could not catch on fire. He was
tied to a stake and stacks of wood were lit, but the Chinese brother
remained unscathed.
The people became so infuriated that they decided he should be smothered to
death. On the day of execution, the Chinese brother asked to be allowed to
go home to see his mother. The judge agreed. 'It is only fair,' he said. The
brother who returned was the fifth brother, the one who could hold his
breath indefinitely.
He was pushed into a brick oven filled with whipped cream and the door was
locked tight until the next morning. When the door was opened and the
Chinese brother emerged unharmed, the judge declared that since they had
attempted to execute him four different ways, to no avail, he must be
innocent, and ordered the Chinese brother released, a decision supported by
all the people. The fifth Chinese brother then went home to his mother and
he and his brothers lived happily ever after.
I read this story with mounting excitement. Later, I dialled No 10 Downing
Street and asked to speak to the first John Major. You can do this if you
have the special codes and if they know you.
I was connected at once. 'How extremely nice of you to telephone me,' said
the first John Major.
Ten minutes later I dialled again and asked to speak to the second John
Major. I was connected at once. 'How extremely nice . . .' he said.
I dialled three times more. There are five John Majors living in Downing
Street. I believe they are there for good.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Prince Charles is seeing . . .: Dominic Lawson spills the
beans about the secret life of gossip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DEAR friend, whom I shall have to call Mrs A---, was startled at a recent
cocktail party. A woman, who had never met my friend before, said to her in
a tone of strictest confidence: 'My dear, have you heard, the Prince of
Wales is having an affair with Mrs A---.'
'Well,' my friend replied, when she regained her composure: 'I am Mrs A---,
and if the Prince of Wales is having an affair with me, he could at least
have had the courtesy to let me know.'
At this point her interlocutor retreated in some confusion. But my
sympathies are partly with the gossip. If she had addressed her fatuous
remarks to any other person - with the exception of the Prince of Wales
himself - she could have been sure of a credulous response.
The information would soon have been hurtling around le tout Londres. Indeed
it is quite likely that many of Mrs A---'s friends had already been apprised
of the non-existent scandal - and were talking to each other of little else
that week.
It does not take long for society - which in these undiscriminating times
includes the higher ranks of the journalistic profession - to be utterly
convinced of any number of imaginary illicit relationships. Of course it may
be that one or two of them may happen to be real. But how would anyone
actually know that X was Y's lover? There really is such a thing as 'just
good friends'.
In the days when divorce was almost impossible to obtain without evidence of
adultery, it was necessary for the 'guilty party' to contrive to be observed
 -usually by a private investigator - in flagrante delicto with the lover.
Nothing else would satisfy the court's desire for genuine evidence.
The same degree of proof tends still to be demanded by the libel courts,
which is why the journalistic element of cafe society is reluctant to
publish even a fraction of what they claim to know about the love affairs of
the famous and high-born.
In a way it would be much better for the victims of gossip if the libel laws
were less demanding. Once the tittle tattle has appeared in print it is at
least possible for the victims to damn the stories publicly as lies. Instead
they are subjected to an interminable whispering campaign, which it is as
easy to counter as it is to shoot a ghost.
In the corridors of the Palace of Westminster and in the air-conditioned
open-planned offices of Fleet Street's diaspora the names of mistresses of
the most senior cabinet ministers are bandied about insouciantly by the
know-alls who know nothing.
Lower down the gossip ladder the names of these phantom women are less
readily available. Instead one is told that Cabinet Minister X's girlfriend
'is black and lives in Brixton' as if such apparent detail was proof that
there must be something in it.
The recent 'revelation' in the tabloid New York Post that George Bush had
had an affair with Jennifer Fitzgerald, the deputy chief of protocol of the
White House, perhaps came as something of a surprise to the US people, but
was stale, stale news to the cocktail party whisperers on both sides of the
Atlantic. Why, everybody knew that.
Of course they did not know it, and now that the New York Post - operating
in a country with relatively lax libel laws - has tried to do its bit for
the Democratic presidential campaign, Bush has for the first time had the
opportunity to denounce as a 'sleazy lie' one of the shiniest old items of
Washington gossip.
It being August we are unfortunately in the height of the gossip season: the
vacuum of real news is the environment in which trivia seem of compelling
importance.
So all I can do is offer two retorts, useful for countering the party
trawling gossip whose stories you wish to squash without actually being rude
about it. They are: 'How interesting. What is your evidence for this
fascinating piece of information?' or, more archly 'Oh really? And are you
personally acquainted with the lady?'
Dominic Lawson is Editor of The Spectator.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Arts: Quest for the bare essentials - Susan Moore meditates
on the uneasy British attitude to nudity in art
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE British have never been entirely at ease with the idea of nudity
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
even in art. The moral authority of the classical or Renaissance nude, no
less, failed to assuage the lurking sense of shame or embarrassment that had
its roots in the chill climate of puritanism. Witness the vast plaster fig
leaf that used to be hooked on to the cast of Michelangelo's David every
time Queen Mary visited the V&amp;A.
For its second display in the 'Crosscurrents' series, the Tate Gallery dips
into the irresistible subject of the nude in art. The 22 paintings,
supplemented by two sculptures, are drawn exclusively from the gallery's
holdings. Revealingly, they constitute virtually its entire holding of nudes
by British artists.
William Etty, unusually, delighted in the art form, attending daily life
classes at the Royal Academy Schools long after his student days were over.
His depiction of the tale of Candaules, King of Lydia, exhibited in 1830, is
typical of the subjects from classical history that allowed him to clothe
his nudes with a modicum of respectability.
Herodotus records how Candaules, being so proud of his wife's beauty,
insisted that Gyges, his favourite officer, should spy on her in her
nakedness. Etty audaciously places the Queen centre-stage and paints her as
a voluptuous full-length nude, albeit viewed from behind. In its hot,
sensual colour and succulent glazes, it harks back to the great Venetian and
Flemish masters. It was far too suggestive of the pleasures of the flesh:
the picture was deemed indecent.
Perhaps the inhibited viewer was also affronted by the Queen's revenge.
Having sensed Gyges' presence - as we see here - she later summoned the
soldier to offer him the choice of dying himself or murdering the king and
taking the kingdom - and her as his bride. He chose the latter course. Poor
Candaules. Poor Etty. 'I have been accused of being a shocking and immoral
man,' the artist lamented.
Etty marks the end of one great European tradition and hints at another.
Beside this contrived Candaules hangs a striking life study. Although the
model is still idealised, and her features discreetly lost in shadow, it has
an honesty and a substantiality that prefigures Courbet. Only a Courbet,
however, could have the temerity to take a life study and call it a finished
work of art.
Sickert is the first artist here to take on the earthy realism of the
French. He wanted his art to deal 'joyously with gross material facts'. He
depicts La Hollandaise - Balzac's prostitute - as her customers might have
found her, lying on a bed, with her breasts, thigh and calf catching what
little light there is in the expectant gloom of a small, shabby room. The
picture positively reeks of sex.
The pitch of eroticism wavers between the steaminess of Sickert and the
chaste Love Locked Out of 1889 by Anna Lea Merritt - although eyes less
innocent than Mrs Merritt's might find homo-erotic appeal in her youthful
Cupid. The picture is in fact a memorial to her husband who died three
months after their marriage. Etty whets the voyeur's appetite, Mark Gertler
offers the male fantasy of the harem. His odalisque is a hideous, over-ripe
and ruddy-toned creature, a real poor-man's Renoir. Contrast her with Sir
William Nicholson's truly sensual stretched-out wife.
Lord Leighton's bronze Sluggard has langour, Euan Uglow's Zagi a cool
objectivity. Dod Proctor's Impressionistic orchard scene is the only erotic
female nude here painted by a woman.
Mrs Merritt and Maurice Greiffenhagen perpetuate the Renaissance notion that
any concept or emotion could be expressed by the human body. There is an
affecting tenderness too in Victor Pasmore's intimate oil of his wife curled
up on the bed, her flesh stroked by gentle touches of pink, yellow, white
and grey. That emotion is given monumental expression in Glynn Williams'
Ancaster stone waking couple, who lie side by side, holding hands and
touching feet.
The nice distinction between nudity and nakedness is exploited this century.
Steer's seated nude of around 1900 was indecorous because his model, by
wearing a fashionable black hat, made it clear she did not represent a
classical ideal but a modern woman who had taken her clothes off. Gwen
John's Nude Girl, painted a decade later, is not idealised, unmistakably
naked and uncomfortable. Perhaps the ever-sensitive Gwen John remembered her
own experiences as a model.
The academic practice of drawing and painting the nude from life may have
survived (and accounts for many of the canvases here) but the notion of
perfecting Nature had long gone. The Nude was hauled off her pedestal and
not so much recorded warts and all as bared, and exposed. In the recent
Lucian Freud here, the human body is less exposed than interrogated under
harsh electric light, and brutalised by pigment.
What unites the realism of Freud, Auerbach and Uglow is an intense,
intrusive scrutiny. Their canvases sometimes take years to complete. They
seem to believe that if they look long and hard enough they may find the
essence of their subject.
Uglow's scrutiny is more dispassionate. In one sense Zagi's carefully
observed and meticulously placed flesh tones are not so far removed from the
art-for-art's sake harmonies of the equally remote Reading Girl by Theodore
Roussel (an honorary Brit because he studied with Whistler). Yet he, too,
attempts to pin down his quarry. His eye has a precision that might almost
come from focusing through the cross-wires of a telescopic sight.
'The Painted Nude: From Etty to Auerbach' continues at the Tate Gallery
until December 7.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Arts: Milhaud and Honegger - Record Review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD CRICHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO of the century's leading composers, Darius Milhaud and Arthur Honegger,
celebrate their centenary this year. About the least important thing about
them is their belonging to the short-lived group Les Six. Even during the
early Twenties Milhaud and Honegger wrote much music that had nothing to do
with that remarkably successful PR operation. None the less they were
regarded as pillars of the avant-garde, surviving that precarious status to
become respected figures.
Honegger died in his sixties, Milhaud outlived him by 20 years. He wrote
such a quantity of music that it is hard to find one's bearings. The shoal
of recordings published for the centenary, some new, many transfers to CD,
give a fair idea of his range and versatility. So many works are involved
that one cannot name them all, let alone give a complete list of performers.
The two single-disc 'volumes' The Darius Milhaud centenary on the Praga
label are live performances recorded in Prague over the past two decades -
Milhaud's music has long appealed to Central Europeans. Two distinguished
visitors are included among the Czech performers. Many of the recordings,
like the fine Violin Sonata no. 2 of 1918, were made at a time when
technical means were limited. Rough surface does not dull the passionate
playing of the Belgian violinist, Andre Gertler. This first 'volume' (PR 250
007) is titled, not quite accurately, 'Musician of the twenties'. The only
work from the ambiance of Les Six is the inescapable Le Boeuf sur le toit.
In this, and in the Carnaval d'Aix for piano and orchestra, rhythms are a
shade stiff - a reminder that Bohemia is a long, long way from Brazil.
The second 'volume' (PR 250 008), is all chamber music. It includes the
familiar Suite d'apres Corrette for three winds and the irresistible
Chansons de negresse sung by Brigitte Fassbaender. Most valuable, because it
is becoming clear that his choral music is among his finest, are the Two
Poems by Blaise Cendrars for unaccompanied voices.
There are two striking choral works among Chant du Monde's Darius Milhaud
(LDC 278 1069). La Mort du tyran ('The death of the tyrant') is a setting of
an extraordinary piece of rhythmic prose by Diderot, from the Latin,
describing the Roman mob furiously clamouring for a successor to an
unpopular emperor. Le Chateau du feu ('The castle of fire') was written
later, after the holocaust, for a big manifestation in honour of the French
Resistance. Small orchestra, antiphonal chorus, grinding dissonance. A
disturbing, harrowing work. The ever-welcome Suite provencale brings balm,
likewise the miniature song-cycle Catalogue de fleurs, limpidly sung by
Irene Joachim, a famous Melisande whose name is not given. Nor does one find
the names of the bodies who, under the composer's direction, sing and speak
the two choral works so ferociously.
Also new is DG's record (435 437-2) of the Symphonies Nos 1 and 2 with the
invaluable Michel Plasson conducting the Capitole Orchestra of Toulouse.
These symphonies come from the series for large orchestra begun in 1939 with
a commission from the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. They are distinct from the
earlier 'chamber' symphonies, one of which is included in the first Praga
volume. Textures tend to be thick and busy (it may be relevant that Milhaud
admired the paintings of Kokoschka) but there is plenty to enjoy once you
accept that he wasn't writing in the Viennese classical tradition.
The purely Mediterranean side of Milhaud can be heard in his piano music,
much of it simple, presumably intended for private use. In the solo disc
from Arcobaleno (Darius Milhaud 1892-1974, SBCD-5400) there is an engaging,
lyrical melancholy about the two Printemps suites and Automne, the latter
written after a visit to Portugal. Automne ends with an 'Adieu' as haunting
as a distant fado. The sympathetic pianist is Billy Eidi.
The other centenarian, Honegger, makes his appearance on a Pearl disc
(Honegger and Milhaud conduct their own music, GEMM CD 9459) which revives
some very old memories. Honegger's once celebrated picture of a steam
locomotive, Pacific 231 remains a successful genre piece. The companion
piece Rugby is less convincing. The main attraction is Milhaud's La Creation
du monde, a smoky masterpiece made out of blues and Bach. It was this
performance by crack French wind players that won me for Milhaud's music
years ago.
Honegger takes the stage by himself in the Erato transfer to a single CD
(2292-45800-2) of the 1971 recording of the once widely popular 'symphonic
psalm' Le Roi David. Charles Dutoit conducts, with Eda-Pierre and Eric Tappy
among the soloists. This is Honegger at his most Swiss - skilled, solid,
wood-smelling craftmanship and fresh if not blazingly vital ideas. The
original scoring for chamber orchestra is used. It proves surprisingly
effective, especially in dramatic moments where one might expect the
contrary (the scene with the Witch of Endor is one example). Even with Jean
Desailly to speak them, the narrations somehow suggest a grown-up Peter and
the Wolf (recitative was right out of fashion). But for much of the time
King David still makes good and grateful listening. The transfer is
admirably done.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Arts: Pressure builds on opera chief - Off the Wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
IS THERE a conspiracy to oust Jeremy Isaacs as director-general of the Royal
Opera House ? The evidence is impressive. In the past few weeks there have
been three leaks to the media, all of them light on fact but all calculated
to undermine his position as the Covent Garden board prepares to consider
his re-appointment.
The first emphasised the personal antagonism between the rumbustuous Isaacs
and his equally robust paymaster, David Mellor, the heritage minister. The
report was denied vigorously, especially by Mellor. Then there was the
floater that the government wanted to close down Covent Garden and the
English National Opera and build a new opera house on the South Bank. Since
the suggested site was impossible, the cost laughable and the outcry fast
and furious, the only result of the story was to hinder badly the rebuilding
plans of both opera houses.
Then this week, the committee led by Lady Warnock - which is investigating,
for the Arts Council, the running of Covent Garden - was said to have
produced a report stating that the opera house was run 'with incredible
amateurism' and that 'the only thing to do is to shut it down and start
again.' Since the Warnock report has yet to be written, and will not go into
personalities, its widely-publicised phoney details merely gave the 'Isaacs
must go' bandwagon another push.
So where did the canard come from ? The Warnock committee is drawn from the
Great and the Good and members do not look at all like leakers. The Arts
Council is the obvious alternative. It sometimes thinks out loud about what
it could do with the money - Pounds 18.9m this year - it gives its largest
and most troublesome client.
The council, however, is still a conscientious English quango which tends to
be reactive rather than active. Its chairman, Lord Palumbo, has never shown
that degree of interest in Covent Garden. As for Mr Mellor, although he
loves putting rockets under established institutions and would not lift too
many fingers to save Isaacs, he hardly has the time, energy or
small-mindedness to organise a coup.
Perhaps the biggest argument against a vendetta is that Sir Angus Stirling,
chairman of the Covent Garden board, does not believe one exists. 'We are a
goldfish bowl,' he says. 'The media love speculating about us.'
But there can be a crisis without a conspiracy, a ground swell of hostility
which encourages rumour. There are many in the arts establishment who are
fed up with Covent Garden. The other Big Three - the RSC, the National
Theatre and the ENO - seem to have sorted themselves out, but Covent Garden
lurches from one cash shortfall to another. Isaacs, pugnacious and verbally
unrestrained, naturally attracts criticism. He is the bear to be baited and
his position is becoming intolerable.
He is ordered by the Arts Council to clear his Pounds 3m deficit; he can do
this only by putting up seat prices. This then draws the wrath of Mellor,
who wants Covent Garden to be more accessible. His new productions are torn
apart and his programming compared unfavourably with the ENO; but when, this
year, he notches up a string of critical successes, he is upbraided for not
being popular enough in his repertoire. The high attendance figures for
Covent Garden, even though below target this season because of the
recession, invariably are ignored.
Everyone agrees the basic problem: Covent Garden is under-funded. If it
received as much subsidy as equivalent European opera houses, its travails
would disappear from the headlines. But there are other, less important,
problems which it could remedy.
It could be more charming to sponsors and potential sponsors; it is not
surprising that it has attracted no corporate backers for its 1992-93 new
productions. It should have grasped the nettle of the unions years ago: it
failed to implement the labour savings suggested in the Priestley report,
and the Warnock report will not allow it to forget that.
Isaacs' management style often seems off-the-wall, which can provoke
unnecessary conflict. If there is a strike this year over the Garden's
projected pay freeze, it could be interpreted as a sign of past weakness
rather than present resoluteness.
And, of course, there is the question of timing. The real threat to the
future of Covent Garden is the condition of its building. Its redevelopment
plan just missed the last property boom and looks a dead duck. But the opera
house needs renovation: indeed, so bad are conditions backstage that there
is a danger it will be closed down as a safety risk.
The Warnock report is likely to be critical but factual. It will arrive in
September, at the same time as Covent Garden's own analysis commissioned
from accountant Price Waterhouse. On the basis of both, the board will
decide Isaacs' future. It could bluff it out and re-appoint him; the Arts
Council would accept the situation. But the board must know that, if it did
replace him, it might get more money on the lines of a new team and a new
strategy. There could even be a government promise to underpin the
redevelopment plan. Mellor undoubtedly wants Isaacs to go.
But the possibility exists that, if there is a total re-think, the days of a
high-profile impresario as director-general would be over. After all, the
three companies - opera, ballet and Birmingham royal ballet - which share
the Covent Garden subsidy all are run by their own artistic directors.
Could the opera house perhaps get by with just a general manager, a super
accountant who looks after the money while the creative trio deliver on
stage? Of course, this is moonshine and, in practice, a figurehead would
emerge. Since opera attracts most of the attention, it would almost
certainly be Nicholas Payne, the much-lauded new director from Opera North
who arrives (providentially) at Covent Garden next summer - just before
Isaacs' contract expires.
FOR ONE day last week you could hardly move at Sovereign, the exhibition at
the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum which provides a peep show of the Queen's home
life. The screening the previous evening of the television programme
Elizabeth II left more than 1,500 royalists panting for more.
For a moment, the museum hoped that attendances were finally picking up at
what has proved one of the more disappointing shows of recent years. The
three sponsors - Pearson, Reed International and the Daily Telegraph - must
have been hoping even harder that the cash tills would ring and their
guarantee against loss, which eventually totalled Pounds 1.85m, would be
scaled down.
But when the money is counted, they seem reconciled to paying just under
Pounds 1m for the privilege of backing Sovereign. The target was 2,000
admissions a day, but attendances are likely to average just over 1,000 when
the exhibition closes on September 13.

ONLY Radio 3 matches its drama to a Summer Season, and now we have survived
the Test Match Specials, it is reviving three of last year's cricket plays.
Sunday's Taking us up to Lunch was by Peter Gibbs, who once opened for
Derbyshire, but (like Jonathan Agnew) is equally at home in the field or in
the commentary box.
His tale is modest - commentator Frank, angry when fellow-commentator Leslie
laughs at his difficulty over a Welsh name, hits him, and Leslie uses some
rough language, which Jimmy, covering the play, fails to keep off the air by
switching off the mike.
The play concerns the prospect of the producer's retaliatory action; but for
dramatic symmetry, a six brings the ball into the box, hitting Frank, and he
uses rough language of his own. Jane Morgan's direction, rich with
background sounds, was convincing. Watch out for I Always Take Long Walks on
September 6.
Earlier on Sunday, on Radio 4, was Colin Douglas's Smart Boy Wanted, also
about men at work. Action shifts between five candidates for a Senior
Registrar's job in an Edinburgh hospital, and their superiors upstairs who
will make the choice (rightly depending a little on Rugby ability).
It is rather like a quiz, with the result as elusive as an Agatha Christie.
Medical chat is not as entertaining as cricket chat, but insiders may have
been amused. The director was Patrick Rayner.
More important drama (I am enjoying my own Summer Season) came on Radio 4's
Monday play, Martyn Wade's The New Party. This is a survey of the eponymous
New Party of the Thirties, as it affected its leaders, Sir Oswald Mosley
('Tom' to his friends) and Harold Nicolson, then running the Londoner's
Diary in the Evening Standard.
Nicolson (whose voice older listeners will recall too well to accept any
other, though Christopher Cazenove is convincing) is more fully drawn than
Mosley, for we have Vita Sackville-West in the margin. Neither is as fully
drawn as they both have been since, for they must be seen as the potential
electors of the time would have known them.
Mosley's Youth Movement, his newspaper Action, (which Nicolson kindly, but
unsuitably, edited, complete with Vita's Gardening Page), boxer Kid Lewis
vetting callers at the office, reveal him as a potential Hitler, though
Mussolini was the top Fascist of the day, and that was where Mosley got his
ideas. 'Solidarita]' was what he picked up from his visit to Rome.
The New Party won no seats, and the author hardly puts enough emphasis on
the public disturbance its political activities caused.
In the end, Nicolson had to break with Mosley and resign himself to a
literary life; while in due time Mosley went to jail, then into exile.
This account of their activities was full of interesting detail, especially,
no doubt, to those strange to the period; but it had not enough human
concern to make it even a Shavian play. Cherry Cookson directed.
Before I quit my Summer Season, a word for Nigel Baldwin's Cordoba, a
six-part serial thriller that began late on Thursday. Alison Steadman (I
always wait up for her) plays DT Mitchell, an undisciplined woman reporter
on a Welsh newspaper. We have two good deaths already. Jane Dauncey directs.
Besides drama, I listened to two science programmes. On Radio 3, Lewis
Wolpert talked with Professor Jared Diamond, who is both a molecular
physiologist and an ornithologist. He had good things to say about the
difference between the field sciences and lab sciences. Clearly field
sciences were favourite; he rhapsodised over the bower birds of New Guinea,
and he called Rutherford 'despicable, destructive'.
On Radio 5's Rock Solid, Anna Grayson's geological tour of Edinburgh was for
tourists, but a bit short in describing the unusual items she told of.

BRUNO Schulz was a Polish artist and writer of short stories in the period
between the two world wars. He was shot in the street on his way home from
the bakery by a member of the Gestapo in 1942.
He inhabited, and seldom left, a city called Drohobycz in what used to be
called Galicia. There was at least one event which brought the place into
the news: oil was discovered nearby and there was a kind of Klondike. The
Street of Crocodiles, full of western commercialisation, grew up in the
inner city as a result.
If you knew all that before, forgive me. It was unknown to me until I looked
it up in the past day or so. Indeed the only reservation about the new
production at the Cottesloe is that, without some of the background
information, you may find it difficult to follow and possibly
incomprehensible.
The Street of Crocodiles is the title of one of Schulz's best-known stories.
Here, however, it is used in very general terms. The play throws in lots of
his tales, most memorably one called August, and is presented partly as a
biography of Schulz. As in real life, he is shot at the end, though not as
far as I could see by the Gestapo: the execution seems to come more from the
stifling atmosphere in which he lives.
Simon McBurney, the director, writes in a programme note that Schulz's
writing 'provides no obvious key to dramatisation'. This production by
Theatre de Complicite, of which McBurney is the founding head, comes up
through the National Theatre Studio, where they experiment, question every
word and generally make it up as they go along. It is the same process that
recently produced a magnificent Uncle Vanya.
Crocodiles in its way is magnificent, too. There is a wonderfully sustained
musical accompaniment, composed and adapted by Gerard McBurney (brother of
Simon) which certainly reminds us in what part of Europe we are. There is
some remarkable staging. At the start, one character walks down a vertical
wall, pausing only to put on his hat. Another emerges from a dustbin that
looks far too small to have concealed him.
The technique is that about every 10 minutes everyone goes into a frenzy.
There is almost as much physical movement and dance as dialogue. Yet this is
not inappropriate to the world Schulz describes in his stories. Here is a
family subject to internal and external strains. Joseph, the son and plainly
Schulz himself, is a quiet intellectual, still impressed by his father, once
a dry goods merchant, now an amateur scientist fascinated by insects and
eggs. Around them is a collection of women, hangers on and half-wits. It is
also Poland in the 1930s. There is the recurrent sound of marching feet. So
it is not surprising that they all go wild from time to time.
It is less clear why the tone and the music should become increasingly
religious, though apparently this was a turn taken by Schulz later on. There
is no obvious gain in playing a lot of the lines in German and some in
Spanish unless a) the dialogue does not mean too much or b) the Cottesloe
audience is more multilingual than one imagines. For all the central
European claims, Crocodiles struck me as rather Irish.
This is an ensemble production, but it would be churlish not to mention
Cesar Sarachu who captures the loneliness of Joseph. The other abiding
memory is of the faces of the women: Annabel Arden as the mother, and Lilo
Baur and Hayley Carmichael as the maids. Schulz has a line in the Crocodiles
story about all the girls having a flaw in their beauty. All of these
actresses demonstrate physical and facial acting to perfection: squints and
all.

SUMMER chamber-music festivals proliferate. Leading musicians, whether
singly or in groups, long to step off the international concert circuit of
one-night stands in far-flung cities; and when the weather improves, the
craving to come to roost among like-minded spirits for music-making in
reposeful, artistically refreshing circumstances grows in parallel.
The inauguration of the Marlboro Music Festival in Vermont in 1950 was
Rudolf Serkin's method of satisfying just such a desire; other methods have
been found by - to name only a handful - Richter at the Granges de Meslay,
Hermann Prey at Hohenems, the Sibelius Quartet cellist Seppo Kimanen at
Kuhmo, and most recently Andras Schiff at Mondsee. Indeed, the number of
lively variations on the theme prove that the combination of special place,
programme rationale and performers can, when successfully judged, hold a
precious appeal for artists and audiences alike.
A new Swiss festival can be added to the list. It is the Kyburgiade, which
owes its name to the castle (8 miles south of the city of Winterthur) in
whose courtyard most of the events are held. It has been devised by Stephan
Goerner, cellist of the Zurich-based Carmina Quartet, and consisted of a
Thursday-to-Sunday succession of five concerts with a tight thematic binding
to their programmes (music of the 1824-29 period).
The cast of players was limited: the Carmina, the Hagen from Salzburg and
the Vogler from Berlin - three of the most celebrated young string quartets
of today; the baritone Wolfgang Holzmair (who sang the 'Schwanengesang',
admirably, in the acoustically mushy Winterthur town hall); the cellist
Heinrich Schiff and the clarinettist Paul Meyer to add voices to quintets;
and the piano trio of Hans-Heinz Schneeberger, Thomas Demenga and Jorg Ewald
Dahler (who gave a Sunday matinee in the town hall).
Small beginnings. If the pleasures and, not least important, the box-office
results of last weekend's first Kyburg outing are any thing to go by, the
prospects for the festival seem alluring. The road to the castle, gently
rising through the wooded hills outside Winterthur, is the first of those
pleasures; the arrival in the 10th-century Schloss Kyburg itself is the
second - up a winding cobblestone pathway, across the fortified entrance,
and into a superb enclosed courtyard resting beneath fortress towers,
bright-painted half-timbered walls and geranium-filled window boxes.
The mixture of imposing and inviting physical features is exactly balanced,
as it generally proves to be in all the best festival locations; one feels
exhilarated merely by being there. But the make-or-break issue is, of
course, acoustics. The courtyard offers warmth, surprising intimacy. As a
youth, Goerner, a Winterthur native, attended summer-serenade concerts there
and dreamed of making the place his own musical home.
The Carmina has now joined the elect among the world's quartets, and the
dream has been made flesh - with the assistance of (it appears) every living
Goerner relative and friend, and with a liberal dash of the Swiss genius for
organisation that is efficient without being overbearing.
A wooden platform, resting over the courtyard fountain, serves as
centrepoint for the 900-or-so seats spread in a round. The exposure to the
skies gives delight as evening fell; it also made for unscripted dramas
during all three Kyburg evening concerts. During the first, given by the
Hagen and Schiff, sudden breezes impishly turned score-pages of the
Beethoven B flat quartet, Op. 130. Insects stung bowing hands during the
Schubert Quintet (for the rest of the festival the entire platform was
rubbed down with insect repellent).
During the second, given by the Vogler, distant lightning began to flash,
and after the interval a fierce wind brought a magnificently concentrated
account of the Schubert G major quartet to a midpoint close: the Swiss Radio
microphones - all the concerts were being broadcast live - had been
insufficiently weighted, and were about to crash down upon the players.
Winds, again, blew and clouds gathered during Sunday evening's Carmina
finale; the threat of storm (though realised only next morning) lent urgency
to the proceedings.
In spite of every such hazard the spirit of chamber music flourished in this
outdoor 'chamber'. The programme provided a continual source of stimulation
in forging links between the carefully juxtaposed programmes.
Similarly, there was continual interest and illumination in contrasting the
technical styles and interpretative modes of address of the three quartets:
the Hagen, lyrically relaxed (sometimes to a fault; and the first
violinist's intonation wavered far too often); the Vogler, athletic in the
very best sense, building up an energy in their Beethoven Op. 135 that was
at once vigorously intellectual and thrillingly physical; and the Carmina,
whose breadth of phrase, close-blended ensemble and unforced corporate
musicianship joined to communicate interpretative maturity of the richest
and deepest kind.
Above all, the four days offered cumulative testimony that the festival
ethic, when treated as an ideal rather than merely a tourist attraction,
retains imperishable cultural value. Future Kyburgiades will surely expand
their programmatic range and length, will no doubt deal with the incursions
of the elements hardened by this year's alarms and excursions. The basis of
the enterprise is already firmly founded, and the future looks bright.

IDEALLY, the body is found in a library; and, in the classic tradition, the
library is part of a comfortable vicarage or a spacious country house. But
even the great Agatha - or Jane Marple or Poirot - occasionally ventured
farther afield: to the Caribbean, to France, and, of course, to the Near
East.
Combining features of the travel book with the basic ingredients of the
murder story often produces fruitful, appetising results. But, mismanaged,
the formula can generate one of those tedious examples of instant erudition,
cluttered with unfamiliar technical terms, insiders' jargon, with only thin
narration.
Gwen Moffat's knowledge of mountaineering has been acquired over a lifetime,
and her Miss Melinda Pink has climbed in various parts of the world,
exploring exotic terrain and solving criminal puzzles with equal amounts of
underplayed skill and discreet enthusiasm. In Veronica's Sisters (Macmillan,
Pounds 13.99, 189 pp), the indomitable Melinda is in New Mexico; her (and
the author's) passion for the area is infectious but never gushing.
Moffat conveys tangibly the all-consuming heat, the strange geological
features, the menace of rattlesnakes and flash floods, and the isolation of
the inhabitants, which on the one hand welds the community together and, on
the other, fosters eccentricities and aversions. Far from being an
extraneous element, the physical setting virtually creates the criminals and
the crimes. This book is irresistible.
For many of us, Los Angeles is just as exotic as New Mexico but a good deal
less alluring. Fortunately, the Police Department, as represented in Iain
Pears's The Bernini Bust (Gollancz, Pounds 13.99, 192 pp), is much more
acceptable than the real-life racist bullies seen on a famous amateur video
some months ago.
Pears's story takes place in the artificial world of ultra-rich
philanthropists, ambitious museum directors, scrupulous and less scrupulous
art dealers. The English expert, Jonathan Argyll, and his Italian beloved,
Flavia di Stefano of Rome's Art Theft Squad - this is their third Pears
appearance - deal with the real-unreal California art scene nonchalantly and
effectively, then wisely catch the first plane back to Italy.
Michael Kenyon works for laughs more obviously, but he gets them and
deserves them. In his latest, Peckover Joins The Choir (Macmillan, Pounds
13.99, 224 pp), the poetaster Chief Inspector Henry Peckover and his
expensively educated black associate, Detective Constable Jason Twitty, are
obliged to join an amateur provincial choir, learn a demanding programme
ranging from Anon to Mozart to G&amp;S, and - what's more - catch a crook and
deal with a murder in Ghent.
There, they have to establish a liaison with the Belgian police, partly
represented by a fiercely bigoted sergeant. Kenyon has a lot of fun with his
characters, Brit and non; and Peckover and Twitty continue to constitute an
engaging and persuasive pair.
Perhaps because of the built-in shock created by crime in a church, murders
in ecclesiastical ambiences have long flourished, and The Snares of Death by
Kate Charles (Headline, Pounds 15.99, 281 pp) is an excellent example of the
sub-genre. The author cuts a broad swath, taking a wry, impartial view of
Animal Protectors, high Anglo-Catholics and sanctimonious Evangelicals,
dubious TV art historians and filthy-rich factory-farmers.
Juggling half-a-dozen stories at once (and all of them interest-catching),
Kate Charles skimps on the actual murder story itself so, after some
leisurely, digressive storytelling, the solution arrives in a rush; but
never mind, love conquers all, the book ends with a happy feast, after the
wonderful set piece - the National Pilgrimage to Walsingham - which is the
novel's climax and great achievement.

IT sounds harsh but it must be said. Michael Moorcock's 'Pyat' trilogy is
the finest work to date of a 22nd-rate writer. But wait a second. Given a
scale of literary excellence in which the top tier is occupied by Joyce,
Dostoyevski and Proust, it is no mean achievement to be classified as 22nd
rate.
That corrected perspective is essential for the reader approaching Jerusalem
Commands (Jonathan Cape Pounds 15.99, 577 pages), because vastly inflated
praise has been lavished on the earlier volumes, Byzantium Endures and The
Laughter of Carthage.
Consider these comments by the literary heavyweights. Robert Nye writes that
this trilogy 'puts Michael Moorcock right into the front rank of
contemporary English novelists'. Peter Ackroyd insists that these novels
'will be seen. . . as an imaginative record of our own time'. Angus Wilson
had set the ball rolling as long ago as 1977 when he described the final
novel of Moorcock's Jerry Cornelius tetralogy, The Condition of Muzak, as
'one of the most ambitious, illuminating and enjoyable works of fiction
published in English since the war'. This work went on to win The Guardian
fiction prize. All this does a disservice both to Moorcock and the reader.
Michael Moorcock appears to have jettisoned the SF and Fantasy-powered
vehicle on which he ascended to literary stardom. He has 50 or more books to
his name, including the 30 volumes of the Eternal Champion romances;
sword-and-sorcery formula titles which mined a rich, best-selling seam
throughout the 1970s.
His career has been almost as protean as that of his brain-child Jerry
Cornelius. He has appeared in his time with the cult rock band Hawkwind and
he edited the influential science fiction magazine New Worlds from 1964 to
1971.
His metamorphosis from cult science fantasy writer to mainstream novelist
and darling of the British literary establishment was effected largely by
his book Mother London, a series of sharp contemporary cameos set in his
native city, which was shortlisted for the Whitbread Prize.
So what can soberly be said about Jerusalem Commands? This latest instalment
in the memoirs of Major Maxim Arturovitch Pyatnitski of the Don Cossacks,
inventor manque, cocaine addict, genius and bigot, shows Moorcock at his
most assured and entertaining.
Its early backdrop, Hollywood in the 1920s, is minutely drawn and convincing
(in sharp contrast to the vague St Petersburg setting of much of Byzantium
Endures). Moorcock is a picaresque storyteller, at his best when evoking a
colourful milieu of this sort (in The Laughter of Carthage, his prose
creates a fine virtual reality of Istanbul which is sustained for page upon
page).
The author's comic deployment of his protagonist Pyat as an 'unreliable
narrator' is also at its most sophisticated. Its funniest instances concern
Pyat's ephemeral affair with Esme, the teenage whore he rescues from
Istanbul's fleshpots and who follows him to the US, only to abandon him for
a rich Mid-Western cattle tycoon as soon as her liner docks at the New York
quayside. The black humour of all this is lost only on Major Pyat.
The lonely ravings of the much-travelled, proselytising 80-year-old inventor
(running a second-hand clothes store on the Portobello Road in his old age)
which connect the narrative episodes are too frequent for my taste; there is
only so much anti-Semitic and generally racist cant and rant I can take.
These passages are meant to be heavy-handed and self-satirising, but their
effect is finally tedious.
The novel takes an unexpected and cruel turn, when it becomes clear that
Pyat's film company on location in Egypt is bent on something far more
sinister than making a movie about Tutenkhamun. thereafter, it was like a
bargain-basement Nabokov at work, complete with the blood-spattered horror
but without the crystalline purity of prose which alone renders it bearable.
Jerusalem Commands and its companions together form a diverting, sometimes
disturbing, often amusing series of novels. The hushed, reverential tones
employed to describe them in certain literary quarters are completely
undeserved.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Arts: Wagner contra Wagner - Dramas both on and off the
stage at Bayreuth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS been an oddly unsettling summer at Bayreuth. The 'younger' generation
of the Wagner family (most of them now comfortably middle-aged) launched an
attack of unprecedented vehemence on Wolfgang Wagner, the composer's 72-year
old grandson who has run the festival single-handed since the death of his
brother Wieland in 1966.
By opening its doors to Placido Domingo, Bayreuth succumbed to star fever,
prompting questions about how far the festival is moving down the road of
commercialism. Otherwise this year's performances failed to generate much
heat (notwithstanding baking temperatures in the Festspielhaus), largely
because for the second year in a row there were no new productions.
And yet the artistic balance sheet has been unexpectedly positive - not just
in Der Ring des Nibelungen and Der fliegende Hollander, the relative merits
of which have been extensively discussed on this page in past summers, but
in the more unlikely area of Wolfgang's own productions of Tannhauser and
Parsifal. Originally staged in 1985, Tannhauser returned with a new cast and
conductor, and some modifications to the decor. The Parsifal staging has
matured since its rocky debut in 1989, and has been transformed by Poul
Elming, singing the title role for the first time at Bayreuth (before being
shunted aside by Domingo for the final two performances).
It has become fashionable to dismiss Wolfgang's productions as out-of-date,
a pale imitation of the New Bayreuth style pioneered by Wieland. His
approach certainly has not changed much since the 1960s. The decor for both
works - neither abstract nor naturalistic - is austerely geometrical, with
dim lighting and a thin wash of colour; the static (and sometimes wooden)
poses adopted by the cast make a stark contrast to the current German vogue
for extreme mobility, exemplified by the Kupfer Ring; and the choreography
of the flower-maidens and Venusberg scene is banal.
But what these productions lack in novel interpretation, they gain in their
focus on timeless symbolism. There is no gimmickry, no ideological baggage.
They have a kind of pre-ordained logic, achieving their goal by simplified
understatement.
This works especially well in the Grail scenes of Parsifal, which are set in
a gloomy hexagonal mausoleum and benefit from a strong sense of communal
ceremony. The knights' silent ritual, married to Wagner's serene music and
the unique Bayreuth acoustic, seems to inhabit its own time-world,
generating a glow which is not easily dismissed or analysed  - even after
the audience has spilled out of the side-doors for the first interval. No
other theatre (nor Gotz Friedrich's anti-traditional Bayreuth production of
the 1980s) offers a comparable experience.
Some sequences in the production have been profitably reworked since it was
new, but the main improvement comes in the casting of Poul Elming as
Parsifal. The Danish tenor brings to the part the same qualities of
musicianship and stagecraft which have so distinguished his Siegmund. Tall
and lanky in stature, he showed just the right kind of disingenuous pleasure
at the flower maidens, swarming round him like the tentacles of a sea
anemone. He met Waltraud Meier's radiant Kundry on equal terms in Act 2, and
carried off the last act with dignity.
The voice never sounded less than fresh and free, while his diction and
phrasing were exemplary. With a Parsifal as natural as this, who needs
Domingo? And yet it is the Spanish tenor's face - with the identical
furrowed look that invariably graces the covers of his opera recordings  -
which is plastered around Bayreuth's shop windows, and will no doubt form
the centrepiece of the video of this production.
Manfred Schenk was the other newcomer - an experienced and reliable Bayreuth
performer who made a more sympathetic Gurnemanz than Hans Sotin, but was
still far from ideal. Bernd Weikl repeated his noble Amfortas and James
Levine was once again the conductor. The self-conscious slowness of previous
years has disappeared, the music was spaciously, seamlessly unfolded but
never becalmed. And the orchestral playing was faultlessly clean. With the
Bayreuth chorus at its glorious best, the performance had many solid
virtues.
So too did Tannhauser. Donald Runnicles, in his festival debut, offered a
characteristically dynamic account of the score, whipping up the Act 2
choral procession into a frenzy, turning the Act 3 prelude into a soft,
world-weary lament, emphasising the music's brilliance and extreme contrasts
of mood: a young man's Wagner. The focus on episodic pleasures, however,
tended to overshadow the wider span.
The new Tannhauser was a little-known tenor from Dusseldorf, Wolfgang
Schmidt, a capable actor with the right vocal stamina. His singing was
secure and stentorian but lacked elegance. Tina Kiberg's tall and slender
Elisabeth was a pale substitute for Cheryl Studer when the production was
new. Eike Wilm Schulte, one of Germany's most eloquent baritones, proved a
curiously ineffective Wolfram. The other Minnesingers, including Ekkehard
Wlaschiha as Biterolf, were handsomely cast, and the chorus again played an
outstanding role.
So it has been a year for appreciating Bayreuth's traditional strengths. But
the debate about the festival's long-term direction - and particularly what
will happen after Wolfgang goes - has begun in earnest, with the German
press stirring the issue like a British royal scandal.
The immediate future is clear: the east German dramatist Heiner Muller, who
has never staged an opera before, will produce Tristan und Isolde at the
1993 festival, and Domingo will sing all Parsifal performances (with Deborah
Polaski as Kundry). The following year, when Wolfgang turns 75, will see a
new Ring conducted by Levine and staged by the radical producer Alfred
Kirchner. This summer may well have been the calm before the storm.

MY HOUSE IS ON FIRE
by Ariel Dorfman
Methuen Pounds 13.99, 167 pages
BLACK DIAMOND
by Rachel Ingalls
Faber Pounds 14.99, 279 pages
THE JEWESS
by Irene Dische
Bloomsbury Pounds 14.99, 213 pages
WITH Death and the Maiden, his play about torture and recrimination, Ariel
Dorfman burst on London last year as the most exciting and original voice to
come out of South America for a decade. The play is now packing houses in
the West End and on Broadway; Dorfman's new collection of stories, My House
is on Fire, clamours for as wide an audience.
Playgoers will recognise the ingredients. First, the imaginative sweep with
which Dorfman depicts his unique world of impetuous hearts pushed to the
edge by politics, and family conflicts shocked into life-and-death crises by
Chile's regime of terror. Then the buoyancy and physicality and whooping
beauty of the prose, racing along at breakneck speed, its psycho-thriller
pace punctured by reversals, reflections, satires.
Are the children playing house in the title story hiding from a real or
imaginary enemy? Is the soldier-boy returning to confront his companero
father in for a worse shock than the one he is to give? Dorfman pares down
to essentials, then twists away from the suspense he has been building up,
into a new climax. It's a technique perfect for the slim, concentrated
story, as is his ability to create character and define narrative
consciousness through an individual's language and tenor.
Everyday emotions from Oedipal conflicts to petty vanities are set against a
backcloth of real fear. But the ironic edge never lets up, making Dorfman,
like Nabokov, a writer's writer, as well as a storyteller of almost mythic
intensity.
Rachel Ingalls is a more tentative, quiet writer, but as with Dorfman, her
mastery of the short story lies in a sense of when to turn the fictional
screw at an unpredictable angle. Her characters, troubled mid-Atlantic
spirits, are mousy and uncertain; she shows them tumbling to awareness in
giveaway moments - booking a holiday, intercepting a letter, falling in love
 -which unleash nightmare consequences, from murder and plane crashes to
lost babies and a wedding in a madhouse.
'The Archaeologist's Daughter', about a girl whose fears of adulthood last
to her thirties and are symbolised by blackmail from a possibly illegitimate
sister and a group of Eygptian statue-collectors, is the best; reserved,
fastidious style, slow rhythms, balance horror and magic. The effect is of
an Anita Brookner character transposed to Thomas Pynchon land. When she can
manage the descent from the normal to surreal, keeping a veneer of
logicality, Ingalls is idiosyncratic and enjoyable. But too often she
wallows in sentimental farce, as in the story of the adopted boy who
searches out his true parents only to kill them in an incestuous orgy.
Ingalls is one of a cluster of American women writers whose short stories
are being trumpeted to English readers by Faber. Zany yet cautious, Ingalls
has her own style; she also has an unerring feel for social and period
setting: the pressure in the optimistic, puritanical 1950s on teenage
lovers; the cultural knowingness of an arty family with homes in
Switzerland, Paris and New York are both evoked with a few deft strokes.
The subtitle of The Jewess: Stories from Berlin and New York reveals the
trouble with this collection. A flurry of defectors and clandestine
operators; a candle business from Dresden; an ageing American virgin turned
rapist on the Kurfurstendamm - American writer Irene Dische lets rip with
trendy Berlin settings, but all the east-west tensions of a thousand
collapsed iron curtains won't fire the imagination if the writer cannot
transform her material beyond travel brochure titillation.
Occasionally she forgets about local colour, as in 'The Passion of Nanny
Jackie', about a nanny who nurses a poet in his last months, and an
individual voice seems on the point of emerging. But mostly this quirky
talent is lost in Dische's gushing High School enthusiasm for her adopted
city. Buy a guide book instead.

biography of Broadway legend Fanny Brice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
FANNY BRICE: THE ORIGINAL FUNNY GIRL
by Herbert J. Goldman
Oxford Pounds 17.50, 308 pages
'NO OTHER comedian succeeded so well in giving expression to the life of
that audience, in raising it to a kind of art.' TS Eliot's encomium of Marie
Lloyd applies equally well to Fanny Brice. In her case, it was the life of
the largely Jewish audience of New York's Lower East Side in the 1920s that
she raised to 'a kind of art' - but let us throw caution to the winds and
just say to Art.
Fanny, whose ebullient personality was re-created in the Broadway musical
(and later film) Funny Girl, was born Fania Borach to a New York Jewish
couple in 1891. The family of Rose, her mother, came from Hungary and that
of Charlie, her father, from French Alsace.
The name Brice was borrowed from Irish friends by Fanny when, as a young
girl, she began to get work as an entertainer. Fanny used a Yiddish
intonation in her early comedy routines. This tone, cultivated deliberately,
was not exactly her ordinary voice. From the start of her career, she
plugged the ethnic strain to create a unique rapport with her audience.
'Mrs Cohen at the beach' became one of Fanny's standards, a one-woman sketch
she performed over many years, giving rise ultimately to impressions by
other comediennes of Fanny doing it. Luckily, a recording of Fanny herself
doing it exists.
Like a gutsy Joyce Grenfell, and at about six times the speed, Fanny, in her
monologue as Mother, evokes the presence of all the others as they picnic on
the beach at Coney Island. A deckchair attendant suddenly appears and
demands she pay for one of the children occupying a deckchair. 'But she's
only five years old,' protests Fanny. 'Only five] She looks much older,' he
ripostes. To which comes the reply: 'Can I help it if she worries?'
It was from these vaudevillian beginnnings that Fanny, a gawky lady with a
prominent nose, graduated to becoming the elegant Broadway legend
re-incarnated in 1968 and 1975 by Barbra Streisand in the films Funny Girl
and Funny Lady. Those visually stunning biopic movies were produced by Ray
Stark, the husband of Fanny's daughter, Frances. Did they bear any relation
to the original Fanny?
A new biography of Fanny, written brashly but compiled painstakingly, gives
the answer. The outline of Fanny's chequered life, including her second and
third husbands - Nick Arnstein (Omar Sharif) and Billy Rose (James Caan) -
was broadly accurate. Fanny's slapsticky song 'Sadie Salome Go Home' was
replaced by Styne and Sondheim's clever, catchy 'Sadie, Sadie, Married Lady'
and, by the end, the female Jewish clown was eclipsed by Streisand's
elegant, agonised torch singer.
The torch song, in which Fanny specialised when she became a star, came into
fashion in the prohibition era. A female singer would come on in a dimly-lit
speakeasy to shed a flood of illumination on her inner life. This always
concerned a man - or, rather, 'That Man' - to whom she was in a state of
hopeless emotional bondage; a man who was unfaithful to her systematically
and disappeared without trace for days on end; a man who was a complete dead
loss in every way except one.
The standard contents of the torch song mirrored exactly the course of
Fanny's second marriage (the first one lasted only a few days) to the shady
wheeler-dealer and gambler Nick Arnstein, by whom she had two children and
to whom she remained loyal during his spells in prison.
Fanny took the torch song out of the speakeasy and on to Broadway as a
show-stopping item in the Ziegfeld Follies, where she was one of its
greatest stars. Her famous song 'My Man' was acquired from Paris, where it
had been sung since the turn of the century by Mistinguette as 'Mon Homme'
(in whose rendering it sounds like 'marn-arm-er'). Cleaned up a little in
the words, but with the same infectious music by Maurice Yvain, it served
Fanny extraordinarily well.
After Arnstein came Billy Rose, a small man with vast showbiz ambition and
mafia connections. His alliance with Fanny lasted harmoniously for a number
of years as he grew in power and influence in the entertainment industry.
Then, Billy cheated with the main attraction of one of his swimming
spectaculars, the ex-Olympic champion Eleanor Holm. Saul Bellow in his
wonderful novella about modern American Jewishness, The Bellarosa
Connection, sees deeply into Rose's character under the guise of fiction.
So, finally, did Fanny and divorced him. By then, she was getting a little
too old to appear in glamorous roles on stage and, in her private life, she
preferred the company of women friends like Beatrice Lillie. She turned down
an offer of re-marriage by the 70-year-old Arnstein.
What saved her sanity, her professional pride and her bank balance was radio
comedy in its golden era. Rose had noted Fanny's trick of lapsing into baby
language when she was piqued, and he got Moss Hart to write a sketch for her
as Babykins. By the Follies of 1936, the idea had evolved into the character
Baby Snooks, a precocious infant who delivered home truths as uninhibitedly
as Mr Bones in the old minstrel shows. Fanny appeared as Baby Snooks on
radio in Maxwell House's Good News of 1938, after which Snooks became a
radio series with an avid nationwide audience. It ran steadily until the
1950s, comparable in popularity and hilarity to Britain's Goon Show but with
only one main star and massive commercial backing.
In her last years, during the period after the Second World War, Fanny
worked only in the broadcasting studio, rehearsing the latest episode of
Snooks and spending the rest of her time as a lady of leisure. She died in
1951 leaving an estate worth Dollars 2m. The rabbi who gave the funeral
address quoted from the Bible: 'The heart ennobles any calling . . . ' It
would be good to have Fanny's comment capping that.
Goldman's volume traces her career in full with many quotes from
contemporary newspaper critics, and it includes useful lists of Fannyana
covering books, magazine articles, records, stage, film and radio
productions. Fanny does not seem ever to have appeared on television.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Books: Slave trade's market forces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ELON SALMON

<TEXT>
BLACK IVORY
by James Walvin
HarperCollins Pounds 20, 365 pages
'AS A result of the slave trade, more than 11 million Africans were
deposited in the Americas', Walvin writes. 'But a huge number did not reach
the colonies; millions more died en route to the African coast and on the
slave ships in mid-ocean. The 11 million who arrived were the survivors of
perhaps more than 24 million enslaved in Africa.'
The chief reason why such a massive transhumance of slaves was possible in
the first place is that slavery was an established practice in Africa and
has indeed survived there to this day. Africans enslaved Africans: the
Europeans were the big buyers of the day, who raised the pace of slave
trading into a growth industry, complete with solid back-up support systems,
including forts at the points of embarkation on African soil.
African chieftains wanted European goods, chiefly guns. Europeans, for their
part, needed slave labour, because long before the cotton fields of
America's southern states became the symbol of negro slaves' misery,
Europe's growing appetite for sugar, tobacco, coffee and rice was turning
these from luxuries into consumer commodities. Without the muscles of the
African slaves, the plantations in the Americas could not have prospered and
the considerable commercial benefits to Europe would not have materialised.
Without slavery Liverpool would not have become the boom port it was during
the 18th century. Thus, economic forces - then, as now, often a sanitised
term for greed - encouraged too many Europeans to bend Christian ethics so
as to view the African as a creature somewhat inferior to a human being.
The history of African slaves shipped to the New World begins in the latter
part of the 16th century. Abolition of the slave trade by Britain and the US
came in 1807. But the trade continued in bootleg fashion well past that date
and beyond 1838, when slavery was altogether abolished in Britain.
The appalling degradation the slaves endured, on the way to their terminal
servitude and thereafter, is well-catalogued here. The main thrust, however,
is the mutual influence between the enslaving societies and the emerging
Creole culture of the enslaved Africans. Slaves ran away, revolted, had
Christianity thrust upon them, but above all they evinced a sustained
resilience which eventually enabled their descendants to inherit a vibrant
ethnic identity.
The process of symbiotic coexistence could often produce fine irony, as in
the case of Lady Nugent who, visiting Jamaica in 1802, wrote in her diary:
'The Creole language is not confined to the negroes. Many of the ladies, who
have not been educated in England, speak a sort of broken English . . . I
stood next to a lady one night, near a window, and by way of saying
something, remarked that the air was much cooler than usual; to which she
remarked 'Yes, ma-am, him rail-y too fraish.''
An irony of graver historical import surfaces in connection with the French
Revolution, the seismic ripples of which soon washed over the slave and
enslaving communities in the Americas to telling effect: a series of armed
revolts in the former, fear and repression in the latter. Yet for all the
Revolution's message of hope to mankind, French slaves were not emancipated
until 1848.
In Britain, the fight for the abolition of slavery often resembled in tone
today's argument for a green world. Opposition to it was often voiced with
astonishing reasoning: 'In 1789, the London MP and former Lord Mayor of
London Nathaniel Newnham opposed abolition because it would, if carried,
fill the city with men suffering as much as the poor Africans. Another
London MP, presenting a petition against abolition, thought that ending the
slave trade was 'repugnant to every principle of humanity, of justice, of
common sense, and of reason.''
With one mild reservation, this is an excellent comprehensive study,
containing anecdotal gems which make the book a pleasure to read. The
reservation is its seemingly unfocused intellectual framework.

WHAT IT TAKES: THE WAY TO THE WHITE HOUSE
by Richard Ben Cramer
Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 20, 1,040 pages
PRESIDENT REAGAN: THE ROLE OF A LIFETIME
by Lou Cannon
Simon &amp; Schuster Pounds 17.99, 948 pages
THE TURN
by Don Oberdorfer
Jonathan Cape Pounds 25, 514 pages
AMERICAN journalists love to write big books. What It Takes - which is a
description, at length, of how George Bush and other aspirants campaigned
for nomination as presidential candidates - runs to more than 1,000 pages.
President Reagan: The Role of a Lifetime, which views his eight years at the
White House as starring role in a political drama, weighs in only a little
shorter.
A lot of Americans feel over-awed, if not mesmerised, by the office of the
presidency, as if it is more than a mere political job. Otherwise, why
produce such tomes, which have to be lifted with two hands? The merits of
brevity seem never to have crossed their publishers' minds. At least The
Turn, an insider's account of the Cold War, manages to pull up at a mere 500
pages.
There is another reason why these sort of books are produced by members of
the White House press corps. Political life in Washington is so much more
open than in Whitehall, where the first instinct of officials is to pull
down the blinds on insider gossip and put any comments they do venture off
the record. By now, experience surely has shown politicians of presidential
calibre that everything they do or say it is going to be noted down and,
quite soon, written up.
Granted, there is a kind of 'true life confessions" appeal in the revelation
of the minutiae of politicans' tactics, their back-room confabs and front
office poses. What It Takes, by a former Philadelphia Inquirer reporter,
seeks to answer the question 'What are these guys like?' in relation to Bush
and Dole on the Republican side and four Democrat aspirants (a couple of
whom already have faded into obscurity).
Bush is now the only relevant figure. From his going out on the baseball
field and fluffing the first pitch in a ceremony opening the new season, an
inordinate amount of close observation is devoted to him. But even when Bush
finally sees he can make it to the White House, he remains a hollow man. Is
this the man or is it the style of the telling?
For the overwhelming detail of this book is like a diet of meringues. Here,
to take one of a thousand instances, is Dole combing his hair: 'Now Dole
stood and cranked his left arm around his back, stretching to his right-rear
pants' pocket, and pulled out his barber's comb . . . Four strokes with the
comb through the thick black hair . . . He twisted to replace the comb again
and, as his left arm came around front again . . . the arm shot out ahead of
him in a strange, twisting lunge . . . ' And so on.
It is vivid, it is realistic, it is done admirably - the narrative is based
on interviews with more than 1,000 people - but this is, properly, the
techique of fiction. The inspiration for such writing comes, obviously, from
Tom Wolfe: but then, he knew how much to leave out.
By contrast, President Reagan by Lou Cannon, a senior correspondent of the
Washington Post, is a classic reporter's biography. Balanced, affectionate,
but not afraid to be critical, it offers a mature account of the man and his
presidency. Reagan, with his crinkly smile and cowboy gait, his quips and
his courage and - as is clear - his ignorance of so much of the affairs of
state, never lost the affection of the American people.
Yet, there is a part of the man which no one could reach, not even Nancy
(whose supporting role emerges as much more likeable and sensible than has
been supposed). He liked to see the bright side of life but he was more
complex than is realised; ' . . . he was a classic adult child of an
alcoholic who had learned early in life to retreat from discord and
unpleasantness.' This book, focusing on key episodes of the presidency,
offers a series of extended close-ups.
Reagan's greatest achievement was in moving so decisively to bring the Cold
War to an end. In another insider's account, Washington Post journalist Don
Oberdorfer slips in and out of the Oval Office and the corridors of the
State Department as if he were there in person. Diplomatic exchanges and
private conversations are reported in detail. The sources are first-hand.
The result is informative but the technique, weaving in so much anecdotal
material, is rather tiring in the end.
The folksy old president, whose simple view of the Soviet Union as 'the evil
empire' set the stage for confrontation in a new arms race, was turned by
the experience of super-power diplomacy into a family friend. It was like a
happy ending in one of his old movies. At the Washington summit, when he
trotted out the old Russian maxim 'trust but verify,' Gorbachev protested
good naturedly: 'You repeat that at every meeting.' When the laughter died
down, the old Hollywood trouper replied with a grin: 'I like it.'
The key to these momentous events, which were to transform the former enemy
and super-power into not merely an ally but a recipient of American aid, lay
in Reagan's own conversion. He saw the new opportunity, rose to meet it, and
set the impress of the American eagle upon events. In the process, he
confounded the many experts who derided his evident limitations.

<TEXT>
OPTIMISM IS an increasingly rare commodity in the British economy. Yet the
pall of gloom, which seems to thicken by the week, is making matters worse.
There are some more hopeful signs, for those who are willing to look. But
they remain few and far between; and the government's claims that all will
soon be well have proved to be counter-productive.
The economic news this week was certainly better than expected. Industrial
output in June was flat, but manufacturing output has now risen for two
consecutive months. And yesterday's fall in retail price inflation to an
annual 3.7 per cent capped a good week for the government's
anti-inflationary policy. Producer prices are rising at their slowest rate
for 25 years, the fall in pay settlements in the service sector is catching
up with that in manufacturing, and both wage and underlying price inflation
are falling faster. The rise in unemployment in July was painful, but the
rate of increase has moderated in recent months.
Yet to claim, on the basis of these figures, that the recession is over, or
that the battle against inflation is won, is misleading. Changes in
unemployment are lagging indicators of current economic conditions, but so
are official output figures as the chancellor repeatedly argued last year.
Survey evidence, he said, is a better guide to the future. But the recent
industrial trends survey from the Confederation of British Industry
suggested falling confidence, output and orders over the next three months.
Raising spirits
Raising business spirits prematurely can deepen the gloom if spending fails
to respond. The slight pick-up in manufacturing output probably reflects
decisions made in March and April in anticipation of a post-election
recovery once the threat of Labour's tax increases had receded. The more
recent gloom arises from the failure of that recovery to materialise. Next
Monday's CBI retail survey is expected to show that sales are still falling.
The extra manufacturing output is probably sitting in factory stores rather
than consumers' kitchens.
The markets certainly seem to have become more cynical following the
disappointments of the the last few months. The FT-A All-Share Index rose by
13 per cent from April 9 to its post-election peak but has since lost all of
that ground and more. The index ended the week unchanged on last Friday's
close, despite the ups and downs of the week, while sterling remains at the
bottom of the European exchange rate mechanism.
International events are unlikely to come to the rescue. Growth remains
sluggish to non-existent throughout the developed world, and Britain's stock
market weakness is more than matched by falls elsewhere. Shares on Wall
Street fell slightly over the week while German share prices ended yesterday
3.8 per cent down on the previous Friday's close. Japan beat all-comers,
with the Nikkei falling 4.5 per cent over the same period down through its
15,000 floor.
The fall in German share prices could herald some good news for the rest of
Europe. The growing sense among west German companies, backed by falling
orders, that slow growth is about to turn to no growth might once upon a
time have tempted the Bundesbank to ease interest rates. But the
Bundesbank's sights these days are fixed firmly on rapid broad money growth
which is well outside its target range, despite falling consumer inflation
and absolute falls in wholesale prices.
No panacea
Lower interest rates are no panacea, even if they were on offer. Easier
monetary policy in the US and Japan is having no more than a marginal effect
on consumer spending and business investment. The Republican election
campaign is therefore stuck: the deficit precludes any meaningful fiscal
boost. The Japanese government is also stuck, but its problem is Ministry of
Finance officials who retain the power to block its desire for a sizeable
fiscal boost.
All the factors which have depressed UK consumer confidence and spending
over the last two years remain in place. House prices are still falling,
interest rates are in double figures and consumers and banks are burdened by
heavy debts. None is likely to lift any time soon.
Interest rates, in particular, look stuck at least until the end of the
year. The prospect of many more months of slow growth in Britain means that
wage inflation should eventually fall to sustainable levels within the ERM.
But while falling inflation may be good news in the long run, for now it
merely compounds the pain by raising the level of real interest rates that
debtors face.
The most likely outturn is that the UK economy will follow the US example
and enjoy a temporary quarter of barely positive growth before slipping back
into moderate recession again.
Cheerleading based on wishful thinking, rather than solid evidence, may lift
spirits in the short term. Prospects of anything other than an
unrecognisably sluggish recovery remain bleak. The government should tell it
as it is.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Belfast yard loses two ship orders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Belfast Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HARLAND &amp; WOLFF, the Belfast shipbuilder, has lost orders for two bulk
carriers for Hong Kong-based China Navigation Company - part of what was
said to be the biggest merchant shipping order placed with a UK shipyard.
The cancellation is a setback for the yard, which has lost the orders for
five of the six ships in last year's record Pounds 230m deal. Work has just
started on the single remaining ship for China Navigation for delivery at
the end of next year.
China Navigation, a subsidiary of British shipping company John Swire and
Sons, agreed last August to buy three of the yard's Capesize vessels at a
cost of about Pounds 37m each. The weakness of the dollar has increased the
real cost of its ships, and China Navigation says it can afford only one.
One hundred temporary workers are to be laid off as a result of the
decision.
Last month Cenargo International, the UK-based shipowner, pulled out of a
deal to buy three of the ships.
Harland &amp; Wolff is to go ahead and build the ships, which will be operated
by Trassey Shipping, a Harland subsidiary, probably on a charter or joint
venture basis.
The orders for the six ships, which represented nearly half the yard's order
book, appeared to safeguard employment of the 2,500-strong workforce at the
yard until 1995. Cenargo and China Navigation had co-operated in placing the
order, which was won against competition from Korean and Japanese yards.
The order was the first for new ships won by the shipyard since it was
privatised three years ago, other than for ships associated with Fred Olsen,
the Norwegian shipping company that owns 47 per cent of Harland &amp; Wolff.
Mr John Parker, Harland &amp; Wolff chairman, said China Navigation had
cancelled its ships because of deteriorating conditions in the world
shipping market over the past six months, exacerbated by the world recession
and the exceptionally high level of sterling against the dollar.
He said: 'China Navigation is very disappointed that it can't go ahead at
this time. The company thinks the strength of the pound at around Dollars
1.93 is completely distorting the deal they did at around Dollars 1.65 less
than a year ago. All shipping deals are conducted in US dollars.'
Harland &amp; Wolff has retained the option to resell two cancelled contracts
and has been concentrating its efforts on marketing the Capesize - built to
its own design - directly to end users, particularly Australian companies.
Mr Parker said: 'The outlook for the medium-to-long-term shipping and
shipbuilding markets remains optimistic, but the next 18 to 24 months is
likely to be a very difficult period for shipowners and builders alike,
particularly if the world recession does not abate quickly and the pound is
not realigned to more acceptable levels against the US dollar.'
The 162,000 tonnes deadweight Capesize ships are designed to transport coal
and ore around the Cape of Good Hope.
They will be faster than conventional bulk carriers and built with less
high-tensile steel, allowing greater strength.
The ships are designed to combat the problems of break-up associated with
bulk carriers, highlighted in a report by Lloyd's Register, which certifies
ships' seaworthiness. The report blamed structural weakness for the loss of
34 bulk carriers at a cost of more than 250 lives since 1990.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Lenders watch their security crumble: A development which
sums up the problems of the leasehold system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVEN without estate agents' hype, Stone Manor, in Stroud, Gloucestershire,
must have seemed an attractive proposition 10 years ago. It provided
affordable flats in a listed Cotswold stone building, with quiet gardens and
views over the River Severn.
Now the development is a sad illustration of almost everything that can go
wrong with the English leasehold property system. Building societies could
lose more than Pounds 1m, and up to 150 residents are threatened with
homelessness because Stone Manor's upkeep was neglected for years. Its
landlord is now in liquidation.
Mr Rodney Morant, chief solicitor of Nationwide building society, which has
seven borrowers at Stone Manor, says that the combination of decaying
leasehold flats and bankrupt landlords is an intractable national problem.
Stone Manor was built as a workhouse in 1837 and has been used as a billet
for troops, an old people's home and a municipal store before it was bought
in 1980 by Mr Peter Emms, a builder, to convert into residential property.
The 45 flats and 14 houses which he sold on long leases were not expensive,
largely because the conversion was of a basic standard. Cheap softwood was
used for doors and windows, no damp-proof course was installed, and roof
tiles were salvaged from elsewhere. The Cotswold limestone used in the
original construction is attractive but is prone to erosion and needs
attention.
Unlike most developments, the lease makes no provision for monthly
maintenance charges or a management company to oversee maintenance. The
landlord is responsible for repairs when demanded by leaseholders, who are
obliged to pay their share of the bills. There was no regular maintenance
system, so very little was done.
When the landlord's company, PL Emms (Properties), went into voluntary
liquidation in 1989 the liquidator took responsibility for Stone Manor's
upkeep. By that stage repair work was long overdue.
Now the flats and houses are unsaleable because of the disrepair and the
potential liability of buyers for big bills. Four chimney stacks are
dangerously unstable, 90 per cent of the masonry needs attention, the window
frames are rotten, and many flats are damp.
No local estate agents or solicitors will touch the place. One unit is on
the market for Pounds 15,000 and there are still no takers.
The liquidator has to sell the freehold to satisfy shareholders, but must
first make it sellable by renovating the building. Estimates are between
Pounds 600,000 and Pounds 1m - up to Pounds 20,000 per flatowner, which is
more than some paid for their flats and more than any of them can afford.
The liquidator has the power to demand the money. If residents do not pay he
can apply to court for forfeiture of their leases, which would leave them
homeless and the lenders with no security on their loans. The only way for
lenders to recover their investment would be to pursue homeless ex-residents
for payment. The residents could take over the freehold for a nominal Pounds
1, set up new leases and a management company and carry out repairs
themselves, possibly using cheaper contractors. An estimate for immediately
essential repairs is Pounds 5,000 per flat.
The residents' association wants to take over the freehold, but would then
have to persuade all residents to agree to change the leases and find the
money for renovation. It has turned to the building societies for help with
both - as a source of further funds, and as a means of applying pressure on
residents who will not co-operate. About 14 lenders, mostly building
societies, are involved in Stone Manor, with exposures ranging from a few
thousand pounds to more than Pounds 250,000. The societies are considering
lending about Pounds 5,000 to each leaseholder to make the flats saleable
and therefore protect their own security.
Many residents would normally be turned down for further advances because
they already have mortgage arrears, low incomes, or have negative equity on
their property. Some could not afford an increased mortgage and would need
special terms. But building societies have a duty in law to invest prudently
to protect the savings of their investors.
In cases such as Stone Manor they must decide whether it is prudent to lend
more in the hope of being able to secure part of the original loans, or
whether to write off the debts and leave residents to sort themselves out.
Mr Morant says: 'It is a question of whether we can throw money down what is
an apparently bottom-less pit.'
Planned changes in the law would allow leaseholders to force landlords to
sell freeholds. That, and a new type of flat ownership called common hold,
which does away with leases, might help others in the same situation if they
see the problem early enough and decide to take management of the property
into their own hands. But the changes will not protect flatowners against
arguments with neighbours over money and priorities or paying for
maintenance.
Mr Anthony Learmonth, the lawyer acting for the residents, says the real
difficulty is not the law but its application. 'If things are done properly
the machinery already exists to ensure that leaseholders have control over
their properties.
'There is no doubt that there are some absolutely appalling leases around.
That is not the fault of the leasehold system, it is the fault of the
lawyers who draw up and approve those leases,' he said.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Valuation warning on council tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SIGN of potential contro-versy over property valuations for the council
tax was given yesterday in figures from the Association of London
Authorities which estimate that more than 400,000 of the capital's 2.8m
properties are likely to be overvalued.
The council tax will be based on property valuations at April 1991, with all
properties allocated to one of eight bands according to value, with the
lowest band A including properties of up to Pounds 40,000 and the highest
band H taking in homes valued at more than Pounds 320,000.
The figures from the Labour-dominated association are based on government
figures for the likely number of properties in each band. The figures are
qualified by an estimate by Morgan Grenfell, the merchant bank, that by
April next year house prices in London will be 15 per cent lower than two
years previously.
On that basis, 420,000 households stand to pay an average of Pounds 93 a
year more than if their properties were valued at 1993 prices. Since the
decline in house prices has been sharpest in the south-east, homeowners in
London stand to lose, compared to those in the Midlands, north and west.
The Pounds 93 is calculated from estimates by an independent consultant.
These suggest that next year's council tax for households with two or more
people will vary from Pounds 359 for those in the lowest band to Pounds
1,079 for those in Band H.
Figures released by the Inland Revenue's Valuation Office indicate that
valuations are likely to come out lower than anticipated by the Department
of the Environment. Some 45 per cent of properties across England are likely
to be allocated to the lower two bands, compared to the government's
estimate of 35 per cent.
Since the basis of valuation is intended to be constant across the country
as a whole, however, the perception of relative injustice and over-payment
could remain strong. Homeowners will have no general right of appeal based
on post-1991 declines in the values of their homes, but they will be able to
make a challenge where they believe their property has been allocated to the
wrong band on the basis of its April 1991 valuation.
Mr Steve Bullock, vice-chairman of the association, said: 'With London house
prices falling more rapidly than elsewhere, homeowners will end up paying a
surcharge because the valuations will be two years out of date. Councils
will be inundated with appeals but people will be annoyed when they find
that there are no grounds in the legislation for such appeals.'
The Department of the Environment dismissed the association's figures as
'speculation'. The valuation register will be available for inspection in
the autumn, but local authorities are under no obligation to notify
homeowners of their banding before the issuing of the first council tax
bills next spring.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Proposal seeks to spread road costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW WAYS of making dev-elopers pay for the traffic growth they generate were
proposed by the Department of Transport yesterday.
The aim is to ensure that companies carrying out big developments pay their
fair share towards the cost of any trunk road or motorway improvements
needed to serve developments.
Under the existing system developers are not required to contribute to the
cost of improving trunk roads if the traffic growth they generate can be
accommodated by existing roads. If they are joined by another company whose
proposed development just tips the balance by requiring new trunk road
capacity, that last company has to meet the whole cost of the improvements.
The department plans to examine local authorities' draft development plans
and identify where potential developments are likely to make improvements to
motorways or trunk roads necessary.
It will then set out the estimated costs of the improvements and create a
formula for sharing the contributions among all the companies involved. The
formula will be based on how much traffic each part of the development is
expected to generate.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said the lack of a fair method of
allocating highway costs sometimes resulted in developments being blocked.
The new system would enable more developments to go ahead.
Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, said the proposals would result in
better links between land-use planning and the planning of transport
infrastructure.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Writ alleges cash dispenser security depends on staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY and ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FOUR banks and one building society expected to be named in legal
proceedings alleging phantom withdrawals from cash dispensers rely on
security systems which place too much reliance on the honesty of individual
members of staff, according to the writ lodged with the High Court on
Thursday.
The writ questions the adequacy of the security systems of the banks -
Barclays, Midland, TSB and Lloyds - and Nationwide building society. Instead
of automatic updating of master keys by security modules, the five
institutions are alleged to rely more on the honesty of their staff in
keeping secret the keys that activate cash dispensers. The modules are
responsible for encrypting and decrypting the messages which run dispensers.
They comprise small computers in tamper-resistant boxes. Alarms go off and
electronic information is destroyed if anyone tries to open them.
With hardware security modules in place, nobody should be able to discover a
customer's personal identify number (PIN), which has to be keyed into a cash
dispenser after inserting a plastic card with its magnetic strip giving
account details. It is claimed that the banks are using a much less secure
system involving two members of staff, each possessing half the master key -
a unique number - which activates the system.
Security therefore would rely on the staff both keeping their part of the
master key secret and not colluding to break into the system.
Once inside, experts agree, it would be possible to learn customers'
transaction details.
It is known that UK banks are still considering whether to include a
'message authentication block' in the encrypted transaction message which
passes from the dispenser to a bank's computer. This is a special set of
codes which virtually guarantees the authenticity of any message sent over
the system.
A number of ways in which 'phantom transactions' could come about are
emerging. One involves errors in the card management software, which could
result in genuine cards and PINs being sent to customers with the wrong
information encoded on the magnetic stripe. Another involves the banks' own
testing procedures. Dummy banks and dummy accounts are frequently set up to
test software developments. There are concerns that this category of a
dispenser transaction may be run outside normal security measures.
Finally, there are concerns that because banks' dispenser systems are
linked, faults in one bank's software could create unpredictable errors
elsewhere in the network.
FOUR men will appear in court today in connection with the seizure of more
than 200 forged bank cashpoint cards.
They were arrested in Sydenham, south-east London, by officers from Scotland
Yard's central cheque squad who recovered cards and computerised encoding
equipment.
The four, charged with conspiracy to defraud the central clearing banks,
will appear before Greenwich magistrates.

FT  15 AUG 92 / New ratios offer a reprieve to equities: The effect of
relaxing portfolio margins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LIFE insurance companies, looking with concern at UK equity prices
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
which in spite of yesterday's rise in the FT-SE index of nearly 39 points
are still 381 points below the year's high - can breathe slightly easier
following the relaxation in regulations on minimum solvency ratios.
The relaxation also offers a reprieve for the UK stock markets, where prices
could have been depressed even further if life insurers were forced to dump
equities and switch into higher yielding bonds to meet regulatory ratios.
Mr Peter Turvey, senior life insurance industry consultant at actuaries
Mercer Fraser, said: 'The message to life insurers is 'Don't panic'. They
are saying there is no need to get out at the bottom simply to meet
regulatory rules which were drafted for better times.'
The mechanics of the relaxation, the handiwork of the Government Actuary's
Department, centre on the manner in which with-profits life companies
calculate the value of asset portfolios. When asset prices fall - as stock
prices have been doing all year - companies find they may not have enough
assets to meet regulatory capital ratios.
Broadly speaking, with-profits life insurers are required to have enough
assets to meet 104 per cent of liabilities. Calculations of liabilities must
take into account 'the reasonable expectations of policyholders', roughly
interpreted to mean that life insurers may not simply renounce all bonuses
for a given year for regulatory capital purposes. Bonuses payable to
policyholders in any given year and bonuses declared but not yet paid out in
previous years constitute liabilities. But the value of assets - typically
stocks, bonds and property - varies daily.
Since 1985 the actuary's department has insisted that the 104 per cent
minimum be met even if the value of equities in the portfolio falls by 25
per cent.
Life insurers must also see that asset values meet a 'resilience test'. That
means they must assume the value of property holdings could fall by 25 per
cent and fixed-interest investments could be undermined by a rise in rates
of as much as 3 percentage points.
So to have assets of 4 per cent in excess of liabilities insurers must hold
more than that. How much more has become increasingly at issue as equity
prices have sagged throughout the year.
Mr Trevor May, life insurance industry analyst at Nomura Securities, said
the slide in stock prices of about 16 per cent since the beginning of this
year had brought a number of life insurers perilously close to their
regulatory minimum ratios.
Industry sources said at least one mid-sized life insurer made a large
switch out of equities into bonds after the general election in April to
meet regulatory requirements. Other smaller switches are in train.
In a letter dated July 31 Mr Chris Daykin, the government actuary, told life
company actuaries that for those whose equity portfolios had already sunk in
value to the point where dividend yields were 5.25 per cent, it might not be
necessary to build in assumptions of a further 25 per cent fall. The
dividend yield on the FT-All Share Index on Friday morning was 5.29 per cent
and some companies have portfolios yielding more than that.
Mr Daykin said the industry had been concerned about the resilience test for
some time. While 25 per cent might be too great a margin in circumstances
where a significant price fall has already occurred, it might be too low for
the type of frothy market which preceded the stock market crash of October
1987.
Indeed, in early July the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, the
professional body for actuaries, issued a temporary practice note saying
that life company actuaries should insist on a resilience test they deemed
appropriate rather than simply relying on the existing guidelines.
Mr Daykin appeared to open the door to a more liberal interpretation of
resilience tests for property assets, which have been written down
significantly in many life companies' portfolios.
'Property portfolios tend to differ widely. They tend to be rather lumpy,'
he said. Hence, particularly in the current environment, it would be
difficult to apply an across-the-board resilience test to decide on a single
appropriate safety margin for property.
