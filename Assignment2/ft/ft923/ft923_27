FT  03 AUG 92 / Letter From Paris: Mitterrand finds it hard to cool it
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
France is grinding to its customary summer halt in a tetchy and
unpredictable mood.
As more than a third of the workforce starts its holiday, the weather is
suffocatingly hot, with forecasts of violent thunderstorms. So is the
political situation.
Try as it may, the government cannot cool the country's temperature.
President Francois Mitterrand dearly wants to ensure a reasoned, unemotional
campaign leading up to the referendum on European union, set for September
20. By that time, he hopes, the disgruntled populace will still be bronzed
and relaxed enough to say yes to Maastricht.
Instead, just about everything that can go wrong for the ruling Socialists
has gone wrong, creating a build-up of anti-Mitterrand sentiment. A feeling
that the government is not entirely in control started to intensify in June
when farmers mounted motorway blockades to protest against European
agricultural policy reforms, even laying siege to Euro Disneyland. That was
nothing like as disruptive as the truckers' spectacular blockade at the
start of last month. They were protesting against tough new driving
regulations under which offenders can lose their licence if they clock up
six penalty points.
While the government deserves credit for not giving in to the truckers'
demands to repeal the penalty system, it did look embarrassingly powerless
for a few days. The strike also showed how deeply out of touch the
government was with the feelings of truckers - who fear European competition
 -and with most French people, who sympathised despite the inconvenience.
No sooner were the motorways clear than the judiciary started to add to the
trouble by casting a haze of moral dubiousness over the Socialists. An
examining magistrate in Rennes summonsed Mr Henri Emmanuelli, president of
the national assembly and former Socialist party treasurer, to appear in
court in mid-September - just before the referendum - to face charges of
political corruption. The magistrate, Mr Renaud Van Ruymbeke, observing
national tradition, promptly went on holiday, leaving the storm to gather.
Mr Mitterrand has defended Mr Emmanuelli, but he has been unable to dispel
the suspicion over the party.
Adding to the damage to the Socialists' image, there is the trial of four
senior health officials who face charges of allowing HIV-contaminated blood
to be distributed to haemophiliacs. Since the trial started in late June,
television and newspapers have been full of heart-rending accounts of some
of the 1,300 infected by the contaminated blood and the more than 250
haemophiliacs to have died as a result.
The scandal is on everyone's lips. A remark by Mrs Georgina Dufoix, social
affairs minister at the time of the infections seven years ago - that she
was 'responsible but not guilty' - has even been taken up as an ironic
popular catchphrase.
The impression that the Socialists are in some way responsible for the
tragedy was underlined when three former ministers, including Mr Laurent
Fabius, now first secretary of the Socialist party, were called to the
witness box last week. While showing suitable respect for the victims, they
did not succeed in absolving themselves from responsibility in the public's
eyes. One, Mr Edmond Herve, former junior health minister, admitted knowing
that contaminated blood was being distributed.
Against this murky background, it is no surprise that Mr Mitterrand's
popularity has taken a fresh plunge, down to 26 per cent in mid-July,
according to one poll. That is the lowest rating for the president since
before last March's regional elections, when the Socialists' showing was
very poor. The polls have even signalled an end to the honeymoon period for
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the straight-talking prime minister, who took office in
April. He received a 32 per cent satisfaction rating, compared with 39 per
cent who expressed dissatisfaction.
So far, the government's attempts to focus minds on Europe have gone
comically wrong. A television and radio campaign devised by Mr Mitterrand's
former presidential campaign publicity manager had to be cancelled after the
CSA broadcasting authority warned it might contravene a law against
broadcasts of political advertising.
So the government is relying on a press and poster campaign featuring
photographs of friendly-looking people mouthing pro-European sentiments:
'Maas . . . tricht? Apart from its being unpronounceable, I am rather in
favour,' is one particularly feeble example. The anti-Maastricht wing of the
opposition Gaullist party plans to hit back with its own poster campaign
today.
French people on holiday will not be able to escape. Politicians who support
and oppose Maastricht are campaigning on beaches and at popular holiday
destinations, reminding citizens of their Euro-duty.
How the French will respond is anybody's guess. Most political observers
believe there will be a solid majority in favour of Maastricht, but the
polls show this is diminishing. At the last count three weeks ago, some 55
per cent favoured ratification.
Will the public get irritated enough with its mostly pro-European political
establishment to vote against Maastricht? To take an appropriate French
expression, a lot will depend on how people feel in their tripes when they
return.

FT  03 AUG 92 / International Company News: Dutch electronics group pauses
for thought - The gloom at Philips has been deepened by the delayed launch
of DCC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The top managers at Philips face a formidable task when they return from
their summer holidays this week to announce the Dutch electronics group's
first-half results on Thursday.
They will be at pains to bolster investors' confidence in the group, as they
report a substantial drop in the second-quarter figures and a less-than-rosy
outlook for the rest of the year.
News last week that the group would delay the launch of its digital compact
cassette (DCC), an important new consumer product, due to manufacturing
problems, dealt a blow to its reputation, which had already suffered a
number of dents recently.
Over the last two months Philips's shares plunged after it surprised the
market with a profits warning. This was followed by the resignation of two
leading figures responsible for the development of compact disc-interactive
(CD-I) and high definition television (HDTV), two of three products Philips
is counting on to lead the recovery of its consumer electronics business.
The decision by Tandy, a leading US consumer electronics retailer, to stop
manufacturing CD-I machines added to concerns that the product is not doing
well in the US, where it has been on sale since last autumn. Philips's delay
in launching DCC means that of the three products it is staking its future
on, the one which had seemed most likely to gain quick market acceptance, is
facing problems.
The move has damaged confidence in the group, which had been buoyed because
DCC was being brought to market well ahead of its potential rival: Minidisc,
to be launched by Sony.
Additionally, the announcement that DCC would only be sold in the UK, the
Netherlands, France and Germany, rather than throughout Europe, appeared to
show flagging confidence in the product's prospects.
Without more information, however, it is difficult for investors to assess
the extent of the manufacturing problems causing DCC's postponement, or
determine how soon it will be sold worldwide. Philips says the problems are
minor and that the machines will be available 'well before the Christmas
selling season'.
Perhaps the worst outcome of the recent events has been to undermine
Philips's reassurances, so that its share price has fallen nearly 37 per
cent from Fl 38 on June 16 to Fl 24 at the end of last week.
'There is a feeling that it is a company that is just failing to deliver
what it promises,' one analyst commented. While Philips is not alone in
suffering depressed consumer demand, a continuing difficult outlook and
worse than expected results, it is particularly vulnerable to investors'
disappointment, because they see it as a bellwether of Europe's ambitions in
consumer electronics.
There are also growing doubts over the three products Philips has positioned
as its main profit earners and over whether they will be able to deliver the
profits necessary to ensure its future health.
Philips is venturing into unknown territory with CD-I.
The success of this product depends on the appeal to consumers of the
software, but the availability of software titles has been disappointing in
both the US and UK.
The future of HDTV, and its precursor, wide-screen TV, has been under a
cloud as broadcasters have remained reluctant to commit themselves to agreed
formats, and as efforts to develop digital television, a further
technological advance, both in the US and Europe have gained momentum.
Meanwhile, there are doubts whether DCC will be a big enough success to lift
consumer demand overall. The world-wide market for recordable digital sound
equipment over the next five years is estimated by Nomura Research
Institute, to total a little as Dollars 7bn.
Mr Miles Saltiel of Nomura, says: 'Even assuming Philips gets a third of
that, it doesn't represent a big enough market to rectify Philips's
problems.'
The most positive defence that Philips can make is that it is too early to
judge the success of the three products. New products invariably take time
to win acceptance. It took compact discs five years to reach 5 per cent
penetration of the European market, while video cassette recorders took
seven years to reach that level.
Given these timescales, at least one of Philips's new products could become
the big success it desperately needs.
However, the pressing question for Philips in the short term is whether
investors are prepared to give it the time it needs.
As one analyst says, whether Philips succeeds in winning back investor
confidence depends largely on how it conducts itself at the meeting when it
reports the first-half results.
The task for top managers is to convince investors that everything is under
control and the outlook is not as bad as it seems.
They are unlikely to be relishing their role.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Thai military leaders demoted for their part in May
shootings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR Anand Panyarachun, the Thai prime minister, demoted the country's senior
military commanders at the weekend for their part in the killing of at least
50 pro-democracy demonstrators shot by troops on the streets of Bangkok in
May.
The long-awaited announcement followed a series of moves by Mr Anand and his
cabinet to reduce military influence in politics and business, and fulfils
Mr Anand's promise to deal politely but firmly with the generals who have
held sway in Thailand for the past 60 years.
Over the past few months, the military establishment's powers have been
challenged and eroded by the middle class citizens of Bangkok at the
forefront of the May demonstrations and who have backed Mr Anand's political
and economic reforms.
But recalcitrant generals can still call on the support of shadowy rightwing
organisations and powerful provincial politicians. Only the most optimistic
commentators are ruling out the possibility of future military intervention
in politics.
Mr Anand demoted Air Chief Marshal Kaset Rojananil, the supreme commander
and head of the air force, to the meaningless post of 'inspector general',
while Gen Issarapong Noonpakdee, the army chief, became a deputy permanent
secretary for defence affairs. Gen Chainarong Noonpakdee, Gen Issarapong's
cousin and the commander responsible for dispersing demonstrators in May,
was appointed head of the Institute of Army Academics.
The new army chief is Gen Wimol Wongwanich, who is regarded as a tactful and
competent soldier. Air Chief Marshal Gun Pimarnthip, the new air force
commander, said he would try to steer officers along professional lines 'and
would not allow them to become political or business soldiers'.
Opponents of the military welcomed the demotions, and the Confederation for
Democracy praised Mr Anand for what it called his 'political courage'.
However, the general in charge of the junta which ran the country after last
year's coup d'etat was quoted by the Thai press as saying that the changes
were 'too drastic'. An unrepentant Gen Sunthorn Komsompong also said it was
unfair to blame only the military for the May killings. 'What about the
people who instigated the riot?' he asked at a ceremony for his 61st
birthday.
Mr Anand, a businessman and former diplomat appointed interim prime minister
by the King after the May shootings and the resignation of the previous
premier, is running the country until new elections in September.
He made the announcement after receiving a report on the events of May from
the defence ministry. The timing of the demotions means that the former
military commanders will have no say in the annual October reshuffle of
senior officers, will play no important part in the celebrations of the
Queen of Thailand's birthday, and will not be able to register as election
candidates because the deadline has passed.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Pretoria warns of job losses as S Africa braces for strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA faces widespread disruption this morning as a 48-hour general
strike starts a week of protest intended to force an early transition to
majority rule.
Government and business leaders have warned that job losses are inevitable
and billions of rands will be lost, undermining an economy now in its third
year of recession.
But both government and employers - a group of whom unsuccessfully attempted
to avert the strike last month - have resorted to a generally low-key
response, prepared to sit out a campaign which most of them believe will run
out of steam after the first two days.
The main fear on all sides is that the protest could lead to clashes between
rival black parties, and confrontations between strikers and the security
forces.
Speaking at a meeting in the eastern Transvaal town of Driefontein
yesterday, Mr Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress president, said:
'All we want to do is to pressurise the government into accepting an interim
government and democratic elections.
'If the government shows signs of good faith, the ANC would return to
Codesa' - the negotiating forum where talks ended in deadlock last May.
A less conciliatory note was struck by Mr Ronnie Kasrils, a member of the
South African Communist party and one of the main organisers of the protest.
The massacre in June of 42 residents of the township of Boipatong made
people realise that President FW de Klerk 'has blood on his hands', he said.
Strong opposition to the strike, and the three days of rallies and sit-ins
that are to follow, has come from Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the
mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom party.
Inkatha supporters have said they will defy the strike, organised by the ANC
and its Communist party and trade union allies.
Also opposed to the strike is the radical Pan Africanist Congress - usually
part of an uneasy alliance with the ANC - which last night complained that
'massive intimidation' was 'rampant'.
As significant as the strike is the presence of a 10-member United Nations
team of observers which arrived in the country yesterday.
The team is more symbolic than practical, its members being spread out
across the country. But it marks the first stage in the UN's involvement in
efforts to end South Africa's political violence and break the deadlock in
constitutional negotiations.
Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN envoy who completed a fact-finding visit on Friday,
is expected to propose an expanded UN role when he reports back to the
security council this week.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Telephone companies may offer personal numbering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DAYS of not daring to leave the office for fear of missing a vital
telephone call are nearing an end. British telephone users may soon be able
to have their calls follow them wherever they go.
Several companies, including Mercury Communications and BT, are considering
launching services as early as next year which would give subscribers
lifelong 'personal' numbers, on which they could be called at any telephone
in the country.
'Rather than have a telephone number associated with a place, it would be
associated with a person,' says Mr Jeff Maynard, development director at
Mercury, which hopes to launch its service next summer.
Mercury plans shortly to test-market the service, for which it would charge
a small initial fee and a subscription of a few pounds a month.
Users would not necessarily have to subscribe to Mercury's telephone
network.
A user of a personal numbering service would tell a central computer where
and when to direct calls by dialling a special code into any available
telephone. The services could be instructed in advance to transmit calls
regularly to a particular telephone at a specified time of day.
Callers trying to reach someone with a personal number would be told
automatically whether they had to make a long-distance call to do so.
Mr Maynard expects the market for personal numbering services to exceed
Pounds 100m in five years. At present, Mercury plans to offer its service
only in Britain but is exploring the possibility of delivering calls
internationally.
Backers of personal numbering say it would have advantages over mobile
telephones, because calls could be received on telephones of any kind. The
planned services would also be much more flexible and easier to use than
existing computerised call-forwarding services.
Mr Stanley White of IIISS, a US group which plans to offer a personal
numbering service in Britain, says it will be 'the darling of the 1990s, as
cellular telephony was in the 1980s'.
US telephone companies recently began offering personal numbering on a
limited basis.

FT  03 AUG 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Christie steadies UK nerves - After
the drugs fuss Britain's 100m victory was a tonic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRANGELY, one of the beneficiaries of British sprinter Jason Livingston's
positive drugs test is his training partner, Linford Christie, whose victory
in the Barcelona 100 metres on Saturday is being hailed as one of Britain's
brightest-ever gold-medal performances.
Livingston's disgrace has drawn attention to the number of random drugs
tests British athletes have faced - at home under local jurisdiction and at
international sports meetings. When it comes to samples, Christie has filled
almost as many bottles over the last 12 months as a Coca-Cola plant - and
every one of them free of artificial additives.
The absence of Livingston and the presence of Canada's Ben Johnson in the
first rounds of the 100m served as a reminder that no Olympic 100m medal
these days comes without the tarnish of suspicion. Johnson won the Seoul
100m four years ago but was found to have taken drugs, and lost his medal.
As Tony Ward of the British Athletic Federation said last week: 'No one
could make any assurance that no other members of the (British) team are
taking drugs.' By showing that, in Britain, some cheats are being caught,
Livingston polished Christie's gold a little brighter.
Christie won impressively. Frankie Fredericks of Namibia, who won the
silver, and Bruny Surin of Canada (fourth) made better starts, though it is
an illusion that sprinters accelerate through the race. Most runners stop
accelerating at between 20m and 40m. Christie ran that stretch in 1.71
seconds to draw level with Fredericks.
Subsequently, Christie alone held his speed while all around were losing
theirs. He ran each of the last three 20m stages in 1.74sec. As Christie
surged away from the field, the crowd's roar grew, for Christie has an
appealing dignity and was a European breaking the US stranglehold on world
sprinting.
Christie's victory in the blue riband event relegated Spain's judo gold
medal to the rank of front-page filler in Spain's Sunday papers. Vanguardia
ran a huge colour picture over the headline 'The sprint returns to Europe',
although by Page 2 Christie had become 'a Jamaican with a British passport'.
It matters little. On Saturday he was the world's fastest man.
By the standards of top-class 100m races, Christie's margin of victory -
0.06sec - was crushing. In Tokyo in the world championships last year,
0.06sec covered the first fourfinishers, with Christie in fourth. Christie
ran 0.04sec faster that day than on Saturday, but in the Olympic final he
beat two of the Americans who headed him then.
After his win, Christie was asked repeatedly about the man who had won in
Tokyo, but was not even entered in the Barcelona 100m: Olympic multi-gold
winner Carl Lewis of the US. Christie merely smiled and shrugged.
As Dennis Mitchell, the US winner of the Olympic 100m bronze, said when
asked about his race: the 100m is a race of tiny margins; a runner has to be
perfect to win. It is not Christie's fault that the US selection system
doubles the number of times a sprinter must be perfect and spreads them over
two months.
Christie is 32 - 'going on 33', he remarked with relish. The next oldest
finalist was Ray Stewart, 28. Christie is the oldest Olympic 100m champion
and knows that at his age he was lucky that his body was in perfect shape at
the right time.
He also knows that Lewis was extremely lucky to win six consecutive world
championship and Olympic 100m golds without once having an imperfect day.
Following Tim Witherspoon's injury in the 100m semi-final, Lewis should now
get a chance to appear next Saturday in the 4 x 100m relay.
However, a row is simmering in the US team over whether its other dominant
runner, Michael Johnson, will be allowed to bring down the curtain on the
last full day of the Games in the 4 x 400m relay. Officials told Johnson
that he would be picked for the relay even if he did not run in the 400m
trial.
Apparently no-one told the other triallists, who are not happy.
Either way, Christie will be among Johnson's 200m rivals, though this event
has always been Christie's second string. Just 36 hours after filling yet
another bottle, his lust for victory may be pleasantly dulled.

FT  03 AUG 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Mind over matter as arrows fly - To
a degree, top archers are split personalities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE always pictured archery as a thrilling sport. If it was not men in
Lincoln green shooting down stags in forest glades, it was bands of yeomen
good and true splitting each other's arrows in merry village competition.
But it is not that way, at least not in the Olympics.
I had a very good seat in the stands last Friday at the men's individual 90
metres and 70m elimination event. Directly in front of me, their backs to
the stands and their arrows pointing down-field at 25 brightly coloured
targets, spread a long line of 75 archers. The competition began merrily
enough with drumming from Spanish supporters in medieval robes. But when the
arrows began to fly, it became very confusing indeed.
To the naked eye the yellow inner ring of an archery target 90m (more than
295ft) distant is about the size of a pinhead. Even with my binoculars, I
had difficulty seeing arrows strike anywhere. Viewed end-on, an arrow is a
tiny thing - archers themselves use scopes to verify their shots. With
groups of three competing archers firing simultaneously at a single target,
it was impossible to tell whose arrow belonged to whom. My lasting
impression is not visual at all, but aural: a great twanging of bowstrings
as hundreds of arrows flew invisibly to their destinations.
Archery is not a popular spectator sport. There is no fast and furious
action, no build-up of tension, no climactic moments of victory or loss. Yet
for those who practise it, it is the most competitive and demanding of
sports. Deep down in every archer, under the cool nerves and air of
contemplation, a tremendous battle of conflicting wills is taking place.
The battle is one that assumes cerebral, near-spiritual proportions. All
accomplished archers are, to some extent, split personalities. On one hand,
after years of daily training, they possess an instinctive, automatic and
sub-conscious mastery of their art.
On the other hand, on the day of competition they are like lesser mortals:
their conscious minds are worrying about the strength of the opposition,
calculating the chances of success, or fretting over the heat, the humidity
or the effects of last night's seafood paella. In other words they are
nervous, and nerves are the archer's greatest enemy.
The art of archery, then, is to still the conscious mind, block it out no
matter how desperately it wants to help, and let the sub-conscious master
inside take over. It is a subtle skill, and to achieve it many archers use a
meditational technique - constant repetition of a word or phrase,
meaningless in itself, that stops conscious thought processes interfering
with the inner mind's control of the body.
Britain's Steve Hallard, who has competed in world championships or Olympic
Games every year since 1983 and qualified on Friday for further elimination
rounds, repeats the three words 'smooth constant draw' incessantly to
himself throughout his matches.
'Mentally you have got to be right,' he says. 'I shoot with my unconscious.
Those who are consistent winners are the ones who get on a high mental
plane.'
Such techniques are far from gimmicks. These days it is being recognised
that the psychological component in sport is all-important. Archery's mental
techniques, however, originated long ago in the Far East, where technical
development of the laminated bow dramatically changed the nature of warfare.
The bow's power gave it almost magical status in battle, and a symbolic,
ritual role in peace-time.
For educated mandarins in China, archery became a form of meditation in
itself: adepts would induce a ritual trance before practising their art, and
found it so satisfying spiritually that they developed a school of Zen
poetry extolling archery's virtues.
In Japan, more than 50 separate schools of archery evolved. Some were
quasi-religious in nature, others more exhibition-oriented: in 1870
president Ulysses S Grant witnessed the last public performance of
inouimono, an event where mounted archers took turns shooting specially
constructed whistling arrows at packs of released dogs.
There were no dog-shooting events in Barcelona on Friday, but the
predominant role of archery's mental discipline was evident.
One indication was the physical make-up of the archers. They come in all
sizes, from tall and thin to short and solid. Physical strength has little
importance in archery. One might imagine that brawny arms make a good
archer. In fact a straight arm, unencumbered by muscles, allows the
bowstring to pass unhindered from the face to the bow; the arms are used as
levers so that the pressure of drawing the bowstring is transferred to the
shoulders and the back. If an archer develops muscles, he is doing something
wrong.
If the necessary mental balance is achieved, so is perfect physical balance,
and that, in mechanical terms, is what archery is all about. The archer's
skill lies in maintaining absolute equilibrium while at the same time
accommodating two opposing forces - the push necessary to hold the bow away
from him with one hand and the pull required to draw the bowstring towards
him with the other. The slightest tremor or imbalance means an arrow out of
true: a deviation of just  1/16 -of-an-inch will cause the archer to miss
the target entirely.
So consistent are good archers in their aim that just one or two arrows gone
astray out of a round of 72 can mean the difference between winning and not
placing. In Friday's competition, the winner, the Unfied Team's Vladimir
Echeev, did not have an arrow in his first 66 shots out of the 4 1/2
 inch-diameter bull's eye.
But then Echeev has archery's age-old mental and physical discipline in his
blood. He is a Tajik from the steppes of central Asia. His cheekbones are
high and angular, his complexion oriental, his eyes long and narrow. With
those looks he might be descended from Ghengis Khan himself.

FT  03 AUG 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Pelota, blink and you'll miss it
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LITTLE in one's sporting life can prepare the Anglo-Saxon reporter for the
confusion - and impact - of pelota. First the confusion. There are ten
varieties of pelota, none of them played in Barcelona until the Olympics
arrived.
'Basque pelota?' murmured my Catalan friend Enric when asked for
information. 'I think we had a project about it in school. But I remember
nothing.'
Lesson 1: pelota may be big in the Basque country, Mexico, south-west France
and even Uruguay but in Barcelona it is the big zero. Its presence at the
Olympics as a demonstration sport owes everything to regional politics and
trade-offs within Spain.
Then Enric remembered an acquaintance who had once been pelota specialist
for the respected El Pais newspaper. This caused a degree of mirth in the
company comparable to naming a real tennis correspondent for The Sun.
Unfortunately our expert was away on another assignment. Probably covering
caber-tossing in Scotland.
All this was forgotten and forgiven when confronted with the spectacle
itself. Long-court pelota is the fastest ball game in the world. Top
professionals serve the hard leather ball at around 160mph. It emerges from
the curved wicker basket the players wear strapped to their wrists with the
speed of a well-struck golfing three-iron. Squash is slow motion in
comparison.
Marble is the only cladding material for the walls of a pelota court. They
have tried concrete but it pitted and crumbled under the impact of these
tangerine-sized projectiles. All of which contributes to the enormous cost
of a pelota court, for it is 60 yards long, 20 wide with walls 44ft high.
Barcelona has built a special complex, the Pavello de la Vall d'Hebron, for
pelota at the Olympics. It is a brick blockhouse, resembling London's
Battersea power station but without the charm of the chimneys. Local
taxpayers grumble at the Dollars 6m cost and wonder who exactly is going to
use it once the Games are gone, but if it keeps the Basques happy and the
bomb count at zero ..
With the softer and slower varieties of the game, hand singles (with no
racket and a rubber ball), and palette, played with a simple wooden bat, the
front wall is of plexiglass to allow the raucous and riotous tiers of
spectators an adequate view. In full-length cesta punta a steel mesh net,
rather than glass, is required to contain the velocity of the ball safely .
Only the very best co-ordinated ball players have any hope of being able to
scoop this leather bullet into the basket from mid-air - given the speeds
involved, it seldom touches the floor - and give it a two-handed
acceleration that has been recorded at up to 185mp. Many of these shots must
be performed in mid-air, leaping for the ball.
Danger exists, too. As with squash, some of the trickiest plays involve a
ball travelling parallel to and very close to the side wall. Hurling
themselves across the court, players have split their heads open and died.
Each pair must now wear crash helmets but broken bones still occur.
The hand variation of the game is similar to fives, although with older
roots. Women play a gentler variation still.
Research has show that Egyptians, Greeks and Romans played a game very
similar to pelota. Curiously, considering the later invasion by the Spanish,
there is also some evidence that the Mayan civilisation enjoyed a variety of
the game. Paintings from the medieval period around Bilbao show pelota being
played in church squares and the porticos of grand houses.
Since this is the final year for demonstration sports at the Olympics,
pelota is probably making its first and last appearance outside the Hispanic
world. Catch it now on TV or, if you are passing a curious brick bunker on
Passeig Vall d'Hebron, drop in.
Blink, and you will miss it.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Property fears on Sunday trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REMOVAL OF restrictions on Sunday trading might inflict 'real and
long-lasting' damage to the value of retail property and impose added
pressure on town centres, according to an academic study.
Unrestricted Sunday trading would raise labour and other costs more than it
would increase turnover, and in consequence restrict the funds available to
pay rents, according to an article in the Journal of Property Valuation and
Investment. Eventually it might force weaker retailers out of business,
leading to an excess supply of retail sites, which would put continued
pressure on rents.
Town centre shops, particularly those outside the prime shopping areas,
would be most vulnerable, according to the study. They would, it is feared,
lose market share to out-of-town shopping centres, which are more
leisure-oriented and so would be most likely to benefit from family shopping
on Sundays.
Mr Richard Barkham of the University of Reading said his research showed
that deregulation of Sunday trading laws was 'not in the long-term
commercial interests of most retailers, insurance and property companies and
the pension funds'. He added: 'A further expansion of capacity which will
lead to an increase in costs but not turnover will simply prolong this
depression in the retail investment market.'

rents. Journal of Property Valuation and Investment, 2-3 Cornwall Terrace,

FT  03 AUG 92 / Farmers attack EC wheat move: Millions in subsidies at risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH farmers have strongly criticised a European Community decision that
will deprive them of wheat subsidies worth millions of pounds.
EC officials working on reforms to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)
decided during the weekend that from November 1993 only wheat used to make
bread will be eligible for subsidies.
Wheat used for animal feed, which represents about 80 per cent of the UK
crop (some 13.5m tonnes), will no longer be eligible. In the past, both
categories of wheat would be bought and stored by the EC if the market price
fell below a certain level.
'It was an irrational decision,' the National Farmers' Union (NFU) said.
The union believes that the impact on British farmers will depend on the
market price of wheat, 'but it means the safety net is not there, as we
would have liked'. Last year about 20m tonnes of grain fell into the net, of
which a significant proportion was British wheat.
The NFU said it was also angered by the UK government's failure to back its
farmers by seeking a more relaxed rule on the moisture content of British
wheat, as other member states have done.
UK wheat must contain only 14.5 per cent moisture, while other EC countries
have won the case for a 15 per cent limit.
'The two things together make a nonsense of the idea of a level playing
field,' the NFU said.
The Ministry of Agriculture said yesterday that British feed wheat would
still be bought by the EC if its price fell 5 per cent below the price of
bread wheat.
It said: 'There is still a safety net. We haven't needed to rely on
intervention in this country before now because the price of wheat hasn't
been that weak.'
The NFU said it would continue to press for changes to the new regime.
Although the government had negotiated a good deal for UK farmers overall,
it said, it could have won more concessions when it came to the detail of
CAP reforms.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Directors' pay outpaces profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY DIRECTORS enjoy substantial pay rises although their companies perform
poorly, according to the latest survey of directors' pay by the Labour
Research Department.
LRD found 462 top executives in 217 companies earning at least Pounds
250,000, with 69 being paid between Pounds 500,000 and Pounds 1m, and 17
more than Pounds 1m.
Seventy-eight top directors received a rise while company profits fell.
The most extreme mismatch between directors' pay rises and corporate
performance is reported at Britannia Hotels.
There, Mr Michael Morton and Mr Alexander Langsam received a 98 per cent
rise, taking their pay to more than Pounds 4m each, while the company
recorded an Pounds 8.5m loss.
Mr Robin Biggam of BICC had a 22 per cent rise as profits fell 56 per cent;
Mr Geoffrey Maitland Smith of Sears had an 8 per cent pay rise while profits
fell by 45 per cent; and Mr Ron Nathan of Waterglades received a 161 per
cent rise when the company lost Pounds 5m.
Sir James Blyth of Boots received a 67 per cent rise to Pounds 571,000 while
the company's profits rose only 7 per cent.
At the Kalon paint group, Mr Mike Hennessy received a 619 per cent pay rise
to Pounds 910,319 while the company's profits increased by 57 per cent.
LRD found that just over half the directors on Pounds 250,000 or more were
either chairman, chief executive or managing director of their companies. Of
those, 172 received a pay rise and 47 saw their pay fall. The average pay
rise was 9.3 per cent.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Pop goes the music business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE cancellation of Michael Jackson's Wembley performance on Saturday -
minutes before he was due to perform to 72,000 people - may dent the star's
image. But it will cause only slight consternation to the music promoters
that have earned large fees from this summer's series of big pop concerts
around the country. The large number of events has helped to lift the
spirits of another industry knocked by the recession.
The Jackson concerts are among 40 large rock events staged recently around
the country, by bands such as Simply Red, Guns'n'Roses and Genesis, which
are expected to gross about Pounds 60m by the end of the summer.
The five-day Michael Jackson extravaganza that began last Thursday is
expected to gross Pounds 12m - a figure that some small quoted companies
would be happy to make in a full year, and which equals the total for the
whole of 1991, when only three large acts played in the country.
Observers say this year's bonanza represents one of the last echoes of the
Gulf war. The previous summer was out because managers tend to book summer
tours in January or February. In January 1991, in the midst of the Gulf war,
nearly all the big US acts except Guns'n'Roses pulled out. But, for all the
glamour of the mega-gigs, not even rock can escape the ravages of recession.
The signs have even been seen at concerts once expected to generate strong
demand. This was striking at a recent Stevie Wonder concert where the star
played to a less than full Wembley Arena - the smaller, indoor venue that
has a capacity of 12,000.
For the last of Dire Straits' London concerts the promoters were forced to
resort to continuous radio advertising.
The impact has been greater at smaller venues, although some, such as the
3,500-seat Hammersmith Odeon in west London, say they have benefited with
increased bookings from bands frightened by the prospect of playing at half
empty, larger venues.
It is records, cassettes and compact discs, the mainstay of the industry,
with retail sales in the UK last year of Pounds 1.26bn, that have really
suffered. According to figures from the industry's trade organisation, the
British Phonographic Industry (BPI), in the four-year period 1989 to 1992,
albums delivered to retailers fell by 15.2 per cent, and singles fell by 8.3
per cent. The most recent figures disclosed that the downward trend was
continuing with a 5.7 per cent fall in album deliveries in the year to March
1992.
Mr Maurice Oberstein, chairman of the BPI and of PolyGram UK, said: 'The
music industry is not recession-proof. Young people who make up a large part
of our audience are usually the first to become unemployed.'
As well as unemployment, demographics have also had a part to play. A trade
still heavily geared to teenage consumption has had to contend with a fall
of 1.5m people within its target audience in the six years since 1986.
Computer games have proved strong competition.
With the UK still in the grip of recession, predictions earlier in the year
by some in the industry of a return to the Christmas bonanza, traditionally
the most lucrative part of the year, now appear to be premature and
optimists have been forced to scale back expectations. That is a feeling
that some Michael Jackson fans only know too well.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Bleak decade forecast for advertising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE advertising industry faces a bleak decade, according to a study
published by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy and management consultancy
firm.
Economic recovery will be modest, it says, which, with an increasing shift
of competitive power from advertising agencies to their clients will be the
main obstacle to a repetition of the boom years of the 1980s.
Advertising revenue grew in nominal terms from some Pounds 2.5bn in 1980 to
more than Pounds 7.5bn in 1990, with the top 10 agencies' revenues estimated
to have grown annually by more than 13 per cent in nominal terms over the
decade. In real terms, the sector grew by some 3 per cent annually.
Nevertheless, the sector took a battering last year, with some estimates
suggesting a real decline of 11 per cent.
The report endorses the view that, given no real growth in the underlying
economy this year, advertising agencies face the prospect of growth
restricted to 2.8 per cent in real terms in 1992 and 4 per cent next year.
The report criticises the 'extravagant image' that advertising developed in
the last decade and gives a warning that 'the 1990s will see clients turn
away from agencies maintaining such an image as they place increasing
emphasis on qualities such as professionalism, communication and
cost-effectiveness'.
The study highlights several factors that it says might help to ensure that
those agencies which have survived the last two years will profit from
enduring slow economic growth.
Agencies must:
Re-evaluate their international options, ensuring that expensive overseas
networks are set up only where rewards are certain to be commensurate with
additional costs involved.
Review their range of services.
Reassess their pricing structure, with an emphasis on flexibility and value
for money.
Control their cost base and ensure their systems are capable of providing
increasingly sophisticated information.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Most employers found to flout disabled quotas law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY employers flout legislation designed to promote jobs for disabled
people and get away with it, according to a report out today
Three quarters of employers, some 25,000, fail to ensure that 3 per cent of
their staff are registered disabled, says the report published by the
independent Employment Policy Institute.
It is not an offence to be under quota but it is for companies below quota
to recruit a new non-disabled worker.
The law is undermined by exemption certificates, poor monitoring and
under-registration of disabled people, the report says. There have been 10
prosecutions since the law was passed in 1944.
The report says rigid government definitions of unemployment 'hide' high
unemployment among disabled people and therefore cover up widespread
discrimination against them by employers.
The official monthly count of those out of work and claiming unemployment
benefit excludes many disabled people.
Mr Patrick McLoughlin, employment minister, has urged employers to review
recruitment and promotion policies to guard against discrimination. His
comments came after a report found that Asian and young black people have
more difficulty in getting a job than white counterparts.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Cadbury proposals prove unpalatable: Reaction to the report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT SHOULD have been a story of apple pie and motherhood. After all, how can
you object to proposals intended to improve the performance of British
companies?
But, surprisingly, the draft report of the Cadbury committee on financial
aspects of corporate governance has in the main drawn reaction ranging from
little more than polite applause to a resounding raspberry.
At its heart, the committee's recommendations set out a code of best
practice to be followed voluntarily by corporate boards. The code covers
everything from the role of non-executive directors to the composition of
board committees to disclosure of important financial data.
While compliance is voluntary, the committee has recommended - and the Stock
Exchange has endorsed - a proposal for a listing requirement under which
companies will have to disclose the extent to which they comply with the
code. Where they do not comply, companies will have to explain themselves.
There is universal agreement with the Cadbury committee's goals, and indeed
widespread - although not unanimous - support for its recommendation that
government remain out of the picture. But a number of those most affected by
its recommendations feel the report either goes too far or not far enough in
trying to raise standards on boards of directors.
Those who set up the Cadbury committee were careful to include
representatives of every group that would be affected by its
recommendations. The brainchild of the Financial Reporting Council, the
Stock Exchange and the accountancy profession, the committee included
representatives of industry, shareholders, accountants, academia and the
Bank of England. Thus it should have had the endorsement of all those
groups.
Last week, though, the Confederation of British Industry said it opposed
proposals that would make the Cadbury committee's recommendations
enforceable. In particular, it objected to the proposed Stock Exchange
listing requirement, saying it would lead to more bureaucracy. The Stock
Exchange is said to have been privately dismayed by the CBI's reaction,
particularly since there was a CBI representative on the committee that made
the recommendation in the first place.
That the CBI has opposed the mild enforcement mechanism proposed by the
committee is also surprising, given the widespread view among committee
members that companies may bring new legislation upon themselves if they do
not voluntarily improve practices.
Further, the Institute of Directors said it objected to assigning a special
role for non-executive directors. Sir Peter Morgan, director-general of the
IoD, said: 'It sounds out the wrong signal that there should be two groups
on the board of directors - the doers and the checkers.'
Meanwhile, institutional shareholders have complained that the voluntary
nature of the committee's recommendations means they are unlikely to be
followed closely.
Sir Ron Dearing, chairman of the Financial Reporting Council and a Cadbury
committee member said the group had decided against radical reforms because
they were unlikely to be complied with and would therefore require
legislation. New laws, he said, would be likely to stifle innovation and
enterprise.
'We felt in the end the best way to go was the co-operative route encouraged
by the Stock Exchange,' he said, explaining why no new regulations are being
sought.
Investors have also expressed disappointment that the report did not urge a
greater role for them in certain areas.
Particularly, shareholders said they would have preferred to see shorter
service contracts for directors, improved disclosure of executive pay in
corporate accounts and better financial information. They also were dismayed
by the committee's refusal to question the so-called Caparo decision, which
ruled that auditors have no special duties to shareholders.
Indeed, the Institutional Shareholders Committee, the umbrella group of
shareholders that has been at the forefront of the corporate governance
movement, declined to give the Cadbury report a ringing endorsement at a
recent meeting.
The influence of accountancy groups on the committee's final recommendations
was considerable, but they have not been entirely satisfied.
The Chartered Institute of Management Accountants urged that the code of
best practice be made mandatory, and other accountancy bodies had pressed
for a recommendation that interim financial statements be audited.
Among the committee's greatest supporters, however, is the Stock Exchange.
In addition to giving the report an unqualified endorsement, the Stock
Exchange said it would consider adopting one of the recommendations - the
inclusion of balance sheet information with interim statements - as a new
requirement of listing. The Stock Exchange also said it welcomed the
suggestion that the code's effectiveness be reviewed after two years - a
door the committee left open for new regulation - and said it hoped to be
part of that review itself.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Willis debate threatens to eclipse TUC agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARGUMENTS over trade union legislation and the return of the maverick EETPU
electricians' union to the fold are likely to be the flashpoints of this
year's Trades Union Congress early next month, judging by the preliminary
agenda published today.
Both, though, may be over-shadowed by the future of Mr Norman Willis, the
much criticised TUC general secretary. Although some motions on the
reorganisation of the TUC are implicitly critical of his leadership, there
is as yet no open movement urging his removal.
Nevertheless, several key union leaders are increasingly impatient with his
handling of the TUC. One senior colleague said yesterday: 'Norman is seldom
in the office at the moment, he seems to have mentally given up.'
Other TUC officials speculate that Mr Willis, who theoretically has another
five years in office, will announce his early retirement at this year's
congress.
One of those officials also warned that Mr Willis could sometimes be
indecisive and that he might not readily make up his mind about whether to
make a statement.
The debate on the return of the electricians, via merger with the AEU
engineering union, hinges on how far the union has to go in atoning for the
actions that caused its original suspension from the TUC - particularly its
acceptance into membership of breakaway groups from other unions.
There is only one motion - from the National Union of Journalists - on the
electricians, which requires them to give up thousands of their newest
members. It is unlikely to be passed, but unless behind-the-scenes attempts
to reach a compromise are successful there may still be a damaging split on
the issue.
On employment law, the left-led TGWU general union, the biggest TUC union,
has reverted to its demand to repeal 'all Tory anti-union legislation'.
Leading up to the general election, the TUC managed to present a common
front with the Labour party and accepted that not all the Tory legislation
should be repealed. That position is now in jeopardy, with the TGWU backed
by other big unions, such as Nalgo, the local-government union.
The debate on the future of the TUC will try to set priorities for the next
four years and beyond, but is unlikely to result in significant further cuts
to the organisation itself. There has been a 20 per cent cut in staff and
the 'super unions' that support further cuts still cannot agree where they
should fall.
More British Airways cabin staff last night voted not to strike tomorrow
over reorganisation of domestic services.
An emergency meeting of BA stewards and stewardesses at Heathrow and Gatwick
rejected a call to strike for 24 hours from midnight today.
Crews based in Belfast had already voted not to stop work and BA said it
hoped that crews in Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow would follow suit.
The Transport and General Workers' Union has said the dispute was over BA's
decision to move crews to a subsidiary company with inferior salaries and
conditions. Crews affected are based in Birmingham, Manchester and Scotland.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Italian party tries to patch up split
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S Christian Democrat party starts one of the most crucial weeks in its
history today as party leaders gather in Rome to try to paper over serious
internal differences at their national congress.
The party moved quickly at the weekend to put forward Mr Emilio Colombo, a
veteran member, to replace Mr Vicenzo Scotti, the Christian Democrat who
resigned as foreign minister last week after less than a month in the job.
However, the appointment of Mr Colombo, 72, a former premier who becomes
foreign minister for the sixth time, still leaves yawning gaps between the
factions, which are likely to be exposed to the glare of publicity this
week.
At the weekend, Mr Arnaldo Forlani, the former party secretary, withdrew his
resignation in an effort to lower tensions. In-fighting over a successor to
Mr Forlani, who had threatened to resign before, had become public, and may
have been one of the factors behind Mr Scotti's heavily criticised decision
to give up his ministerial post.
Mr Scotti's move was ostensibly a reaction to a new party rule that
ministers should give up their parliamentary seats.
But Mr Scotti is close to Mr Giulio Andreotti's faction in the party, and
his action has been interpreted by some as an attempt by the former
Christian Democrat prime minister to exploit divisions within the party to
his benefit. Mr Andreotti has denied such motives.
Rebuffed by the electorate in northern Italy and heavily tainted by the
political corruption scandal now gripping much of the region, the party will
seek to use this week's congress to regroup.
Speaking on Italian television, Mr Forlani explained his decision not to
step down as a way of stimulating the changes in the party demanded by
electors - such as greater accountability and transparency.
However, many younger Christian Democrats, notably the reformists grouped
around Mr Mario Segni, who has pushed for constitutional change through
referendums, will see this as yet another attempt to paper over divisions
and keep the same faces in power.
Mr Forlani's step has already prompted Mr Mino Martinazzoli, a senior party
member and more reform-minded candidate, to withdraw his bid for the party
leadership.

<TEXT>
WORKERS at Politika, Yugoslavia's biggest newspaper publishers, have
suspended a two-day strike after Mr Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia's president,
demanded reconsideration of a controversial nationalisation law, Reuter
reports from Belgrade.
Politika's three daily newspapers appeared on newsstands yesterday, and the
strike committee said its 15 periodicals would also resume work. The group's
television and radio stations did not interrupt broadcasts.
The strike began on Thursday when the Serbian parliament voted to
nationalise the publishers. Opposition deputies accused the government of
seeking complete control over the press and threatened to boycott elections
scheduled for the end of the year if freedom of the media was not assured.
Mr Milosevic asked parliament at the weekend to reconsider the law, saying
experts believed that some of its clauses conflicted with the Serbian
constitution.

FT  03 AUG 92 / Secrecy review by accountants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INSTITUTE of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales is considering
opening its disciplinary proceedings to the public after recent criticism
over secrecy.
A paper to be submitted to the institute's council lists options for opening
some parts of its hearings to observers.
Concern has arisen that wider public access might jeopardise free and frank
provision of evidence. Other worries include issues of defamation, contempt
and breach of confidentiality over the details of the material being
discussed.
Officials emphasise that very few other professional bodies make their
disciplinary hearings public, and do not face the complex questions posed by
proceedings against accountants, in which sensitive information about their
work for clients might be disclosed.
Even so, institute members have come under pressure for more openness on
disciplinary matters from individuals including Mr Douglas Llambias, a
member of the council and of its disciplinary committee.
Mr Llambias was recently refused access to the committee considering the
case against two partners from Coopers &amp; Lybrand in connection with an
alleged breach of ethical codes in their appointment as administrators to
Polly Peck International.
The recommendations follow a series of other reforms to disciplinary
proceedings in recent months, including much stiffer fines, simplified
administration, the appointment of an independent ombudsman and greater
willingness to announce that an investigation is taking place.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Olympic News In Brief: UK weightlifters may be allowed back
to compete
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO British weightlifters sent home from the Games for failing
out-of-competition drugs tests may be allowed back, the British Olympic team
said yesterday.
Spokeswoman Caroline Searle said the cases of Andrew Saxton and Andrew
Davies, both Commonwealth champions, were being reviewed at meetings in
Barcelona and London.
'There is a possibility of their reinstatement which is currently being
examined,' Searle said.
She said she could not say why the test results were now under doubt and
made clear that a decision on their possible reinstatement was unlikely
before today.
The cases were being examined last night at a joint meeting by the British
Olympic Association (BOA), the International Olympic Committee medical
commission and the International Weightlifting Federation.
Saxton and Davies, both 25, were sent home from the Games on Wednesday after
the BOA informed them pre-Olympic random tests done out of competition in
Britain had shown traces of the stimulant and anabolic agent Clenbuterol.
The BOA announced their expulsion on Thursday along with that of sprinter
Jason Livingston, the European 60m indoor champion. Searle said on Thursday
that a drugs test on the sprinter had shown traces of a banned steroid.
Saxton and Davies both intend to appeal and have both publicly denied taking
banned drugs. They had been due to compete in Barcelona in the 100kg and
110kg weightlifting categories respectively tomorrow and Monday. Livingston
was to have raced yesterday in the 100m heats.
The International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) said Saxton and Davies had
both passed the IWF's own separate, compulsory test in Barcelona. 'Both of
them were negative,' IWF president Tamas Ajan said.
Ajan confirmed 'it is possible' that Saxton and Davies could be allowed to
compete at the Olympics after talking to British team chief Dick Palmer. 'It
is not exactly finalised. Tomorrow we will give some information,' he added.

FT  01 AUG 92 / LSE bids Pounds 65m for County Hall: University's governors
concerned over pressure on finances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNORS of the London School of Economics are worried about the viability
of the Pounds 65m bid submitted yesterday for County Hall, the landmark
London site it is seeking as its new headquarters.
At least one fears that the move could bankrupt the social science
university unless it is supported by a direct government subsidy.
In cash terms, the LSE bid is almost certainly lower than the Pounds 60m
sale price agreed with the Japanese Shirayama Corporation for the riverside
building alone.
The building comprises less than half the County Hall site which is the
subject of the LSE bid.
The LSE believes the 'public interest' aspects of its bid justify the
shortfall.
However several of its governors are understood to have expressed concern at
a meeting on Thursday that some of the assumptions upon which the bid is
based  - notably the LSE's ability to dispose of its existing Aldwych site
for about Pounds 100m within three years  - are unrealistic.
They are also concerned that the cost of servicing a loan of up to Pounds
50m would put unsustainable pressure on the LSE's finances. Mr John
Ashworth, the LSE's director, is believed to have assured them that the
offer was not irrevocable, although the government told the LSE last week
that its bid should be 'unconditional'.
Mr Ashworth said his bid, submitted just before the government's
end-of-month deadline, was 'very sensible  - not just financially, but in
the national interest more broadly'.
Hambros Bank, the LSE's financial adviser, said it was 'entirely happy' with
the bid, and was prepared to lend a 'substantial' part of the sum.
However, the Universities Funding Council is believed to be unwilling to
indicate support for the bid without further justification.
Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, will take a final decision by
early September.
Mr Makoto Toyota, Shirayama's London agent, called for the bid's 'immediate
rejection', on the grounds that it was neither competitive nor
unconditional. Shirayama intends to pursue its legal action for damages from
the government for losses caused by the continued refusal to rule out an LSE
bid.

FT  01 AUG 92 / SFO drops final Blue Arrow case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK's Serious Fraud Office has finally abandoned its Blue Arrow
prosecution by dropping proceedings against four City advisers still charged
with fraud over the affair.
The SFO's widely expected decision to scrap the next two trials followed the
Court of Appeal's criticism earlier this week that the first trial  - which
lasted a year and cost Pounds 35m  - was a 'costly disaster' which should
never be repeated.
The four advisers who will now be acquitted of conspiring to mislead the
markets are Mr Charles Villiers, former chairman of County NatWest, Ms
Elizabeth Brimelow, County's former compliance director, and Mr Paul
Smallwood and Mr Tim Brown, both former equities directors with UBS Phillips
&amp; Drew.
The SFO decided there was no longer any public interest in prosecuting these
four in the light of the appeal court's criticism, made during its judgment
explaining why it was quashing the convictions of four other advisers found
guilty of conspiracy to defraud.
Mr Nicholas Purnell QC, who brought the ill-fated prosecution for the SFO,
will tell the trial judge, Mr Justice Brooke, on Monday that no evidence
will be offered against the remaining four. The decision to drop the charges
came as no surprise in the City. One regulator commented: 'In the light of
the outcome of the first trial the SFO could not have done anything else. It
would not have been fair.'
It is widely accepted that the four played only peripheral roles in County's
and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew's handling of the issue.
A UBS Phillips &amp; Drew official said the firm was 'absolutely delighted' with
the decision.
The company still employs Mr Smallwood and Mr Brown, although neither has
been involved in investment work since their arrests in November 1989.
Restrictions placed on their working by the Securities and Futures Authority
are expected to be lifted next week.
Neither Mr Villiers nor Ms Brimelow would comment yesterday in advance of
Monday's court hearing. Mr Villiers is currently the head of corporate
development at Abbey National. Ms Brimelow has been out of work for almost
three years.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Channel 4 fined for refusing to disclose source
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHANNEL 4 yesterday escaped possible sequestration of its assets and the
threat of closure for refusing to reveal the source behind a television
documentary on Northern Ireland.
Instead Lord Justice Woolf imposed a total fine of Pounds 75,000 on the
channel and Box Productions, the company which produced Committee, a
programme alleging systematic collusion between the Royal Ulster
Constabulary and Loyalist death squads.
Channel 4 and Box, which argued that they could not identify their main
source without endangering his life, will decide how to share out the fine.
They will also have to pay costs estimated at between Pounds 150,000 and
Pounds 200,000.
Lord Justice Woolf said in the High Court that Channel 4, which was found to
be in contempt under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, should have borne in
mind that the programme would undermine the reputation of the RUC and the
rule of law  - just what terrorists were trying to do.
He had decided against sequestration of assets, which could have destroyed
Channel 4 and Box, because it was clear they were not going to disclose the
name of 'Source A'.
No one could doubt the dilemma the companies faced or their desire to
co-operate with the law so far as they were able, the judge said. The fine
was therefore substantially smaller than it might have been.
Even more significantly Lord Justice Woolf said there should be no further
proceedings either against the companies or any individuals involved. Sir
Richard Attenborough, Channel 4 chairman, said the judges had recognised the
company's dilemma.
'Although they had no real option but to fine the companies for contempt,
and although there remains a gulf between the views we and the court take on
the duties of serious journalists, no draconian penalties were levied.'
Lord Justice Woolf hoped both companies would reconsider their positions.
While accepting they had a genuine dilemma, it was of their own making.

Wall Street
WALL STREET consolidated its mid-week rally by posting modest gains
yesterday as the market headed toward record levels, writes Karen Zagor in
New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.89 to close at 3,393.78 after
briefly breaking above 3,400 at 12.45pm. The Dow reached a record high of
3,413.21 on June 1.
The overall tone of the market, however, was mixed with advancing issues
leading those declining by a slim margin of 970 to 783. NYSE volume was
fairly light, with just over 174m shares changing hands.
The market's restrained advance was reflected in the broadly-based Standard
&amp; Poor's 500, which rose 0.32 to 424.20. The Nasdaq composite was up 2.03 at
580.83. The Dow, which started the week at 3,285.71, added 12.70 on Thursday
to close at 3,391.89.
Among the economic news of the day was the release of stronger-than-expected
new factory orders for June, which rose 2.3 per cent. Orders for durable
goods were revised up to 2.7 per cent from an earlier reported gain of 2.3
per cent. In addition, personal consumption expenditures rose 0.5 per cent
in the month, while personal income was flat.
Equities were largely unmoved by the deluge of data, but second quarter
results continued to have an impact on individual stock movements.
McDonnell Douglas tumbled Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 36 3/4 following second
quarter net income of Dollars 1-a-share against Dollars 2.01 in the same
period of 1991.
Shares in Aetna, one of the largest US composite insurers, tumbled Dollars 1
3/8 to Dollars 43 1/4 in active trading on the back of a loss of 46 cents a
share on continuing operations compared with net income from continued
operations of Dollars 1.13 a share the previous year.
Among other big insurers, Travelers edged Dollars  1/8 lower to Dollars 22
1/2 , Equitable slid Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 9 1/8 and Cigna eased Dollars
1/4 to Dollars 54 3/4 .
Fleet Mortgage, a unit of Fleet Financial, was the most active issue of the
morning. The stock was quoted at Dollars 23 3/8 at the close of trading. An
8.3m initial public offer was made at Dollars 23-a-share.
Other active big board issues included RJR Nabisco Holdings, unchanged at
Dollars 8 3/4 , Bristol-Myers Squibb, steady at Dollars 69 1/2 and Baker
Hughes, off Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 22 3/8 .
Paramount Communications fell Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 45 5/8 . The US
entertainment group said it was expanding into the theme park business
through the acquisition of King's Entertainment in a deal valued at about
Dollars 400m.
In Nasdaq trading, Microsoft fell Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 72 3/4 , Dell
Computer climbed Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 23 and Apple Computer lost Dollars
 1/4 to Dollars 47.
Canada
TORONTO share prices posted a solid gain in moderate trading, bucking the
downward move shown by most world markets.
Based on preliminary data, the composite index was up 17.79 points, or
0.52%, to close at 3,443.42. On the week, the composite index added about 44
points. Winning issues led losers by 324 to 217, volume rose to 25.734m
shares from 24.328m the previous day and trading value was CDollars 329.8m
against CDollars 226.2m.
Eleven of the 14 sub-groups ended higher, with the best gain in financial
services.

purchase

<TEXT>
PARAMOUNT Commun ications, the New York based entertainment and publishing
group, yesterday announced a significant diversification, paying Dollars
400m for a series of regional US theme parks.
The acquisitions of Kings Entertainment Company, owner of three big parks,
and of Kings Island, a theme park near Cincinnati that was owned by American
Financial Corporation, represent the biggest diversification move since
Paramount registered a gain of more than Dollars 1bn in 1989 when it sold
off The Associates, a financial services company.
Mr Martin Davis, Paramount's chairman, has been keen to spend some of the
proceeds of the financial services sale on an entertainment-related venture.
Paramount, which owns Simon and Schuster, the New York publisher, as well as
a major Hollywood studio, thus joins the ranks of the Walt Disney Company
and MCA/Universal. Unlike these two, whose parks are linked to resort
complexes, Paramount's parks draw local and regional customers on day trips.
Kings also has a 20 per cent stake in Canada's Wonderland, based near
Toronto. This park is also managed by Kings.
Combined revenues of the theme parks being acquired are expected to exceed
Dollars 250m this year, according to Paramount. A newly formed subsidiary  -
Paramount Parks  - will manage the parks under the leadership of Mr Nelson
Schwab, who heads the investor group selling Kings Entertainment to
Paramount.

FT  01 AUG 92 / International Company News: Charge for job cuts brings loss
at Aetna
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A SHARPER-than-expected deterioration in property-related investments
contributed to a second-quarter loss of Dollars 20.1m after tax at Aetna
Life &amp; Casualty, one of the largest US composite insurers.
The result compares with a Dollars 159.5m profit in the same period of 1991,
and leaves Aetna with a net profit of Dollars 187.1m for the first six
months of 1992, against Dollars 296.9m in the previous year. Its shares
closed Dollars 1 3/8 lower at Dollars 43 1/4 yesterday.
The loss is struck after a Dollars 145m charge to cover job cuts and
restructuring moves, which Aetna announced last month. The insurer is aiming
to cut staff by 4,800  - about 10 per cent of its workforce. It claims this
should lead to annual after-tax savings of around Dollars 132m by 1994.
Net realised capital losses in the second quarter totalled Dollars 41m,
against a loss of Dollars 12m a year earlier.
However, within this overall figure, additions to reserves for troubled
mortgage loans and property write-downs were Dollars 105m (Dollars 78m),
Partly offsetting this damage were gains of Dollars 76m (Dollars 71m),
largely from sales of bonds and shares.
'We saw more deterioration than we expected in our mortgage loan portfolio
during our normal review process,' admitted Mr Ronald Compton, chairman.
'Most of the deterioration was in the commercial office sector in New
England, California and New York City.
'We adjusted our reserves accordingly and we cannot currently estimate the
full-year impact real estate will have on our earnings.'
The second-quarter figures were also struck after a Dollars 30m charge
related to an Olympia &amp; York financial guarantee  - of which Aetna had also
previously warned.
In terms of operating divisions, the biggest loss (after reorganisation
charges and investment losses) was seen in the commercial property-casualty
business  - a Dollars 37.4m deficit compared with a Dollars 43.1m profit a
year earlier.
The personal property-casualty division turned in Dollars 21.2m deficit
(against a loss of Dollars 2.1m), while financial services made a loss of
Dollars 25.2m (Dollars 35.2m loss).
The life and health business made a profit of Dollars 31m (Dollars 87.5m),
and discontinued operations  - the American Re-Insurance subsidiary which
Aetna is selling to a Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts-backed buyout  - made Dollars
30.9m (Dollars 33.8m).

FT  01 AUG 92 / International Company News: McDonnell Douglas earnings dive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MCDONNELL DOUGLAS, the financially stretched US aerospace group, yesterday
reported a 51 per cent drop in second-quarter earnings, higher-than-expected
costs on an important airliner production programme and a reversal of its
recent success in lowering its debt-to-equity ratio.
The news sent its share price sharply lower and the stock closed at at
Dollars 36 3/4 on the New York Stock Exchange for a loss of Dollars 3 3/8 on
the day.
Mr John McDonnell, the chairman, warned workers that in the coming months
the group would be taking 'further steps to improve our competitiveness'.
The group reported earnings of Dollars 38m, or Dollars 1 a share, compared
with Dollars 77m, or Dollars 2.01 in the same quarter of last year, on
revenues which dipped slightly to Dollars 4.89bn.
All its three manufacturing segments suffered lower earnings, but the
company said the main cause of the drop was higher research and development
spending, principally for its proposed MD-12 jumbo jet.
McDonnell Douglas cannot afford to develop this aircraft alone and has been
seeking foreign financial partners, principally Taiwan Aerospace, but so far
without success.
The company also reported that costs on the MD-11, a wide-bodied aircraft
which it began delivering just under two years ago, had not declined as
rapidly as planned.
The company had therefore raised its cost estimate for the total programme
and reduced the rate at which it was reporting earnings. McDonnell Douglas'
debt-to-equity ratio in its aerospace operations, which the company cut to
.68 at the end of last year, went up to .78 at the end of June, as debt rose
from Dollars 2.39bn to Dollars 2.84bn.
It said this was due primarily to lower bookings for commercial aircraft,
higher funding requirements for the controversial C-17 military transport it
is developing for the Pentagon, and deferred vendor payments.
Its commercial aircraft business had operating earnings of Dollars 20m on
revenues of Dollars 2.15bn, compared with Dollars 53m on revenues of Dollars
1.8bn a year ago. R&amp;D spending rose Dollars 29m.
The MD-11 programme incurred a small operating loss, while McDonnell's other
civil aviation programme, the MD80/90, achieved higher operating earnings
thanks to improved margins. Its military aircraft side earned Dollars 66m,
down from Dollars 106m.
Most of the drop was attributed to a Dollars 34m pre-tax charge for
increased costs and higher reserves on the C-17 programme, which is well
over its fixed price contract level.
Revenues dropped 19 per cent to Dollars 1.74bn, mainly because of completion
of the C-17's development phase.
The group's firm backlog of orders stood at Dollars 26.4bn at the end of
June, down from Dollars 30.4bn at the end of December and Dollars 33.1bn a
year ago.
For the six months it earned Dollars 90m, or Dollars 2.34 a share, down from
Dollars 135m, or Dollars 3.51 a share, on revenues of Dollars 9.04bn, down
from Dollars 9.2bn.

FT  01 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Losses increase to Pounds 125m at Airedale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIREDALE, the private holding company for the Magnet kitchen retailing
business, fell further into the red with pre-tax losses of Pounds 125m for
the year to March 28.
The result, which compared with a loss of Pounds 119m the previous year, was
struck on sales 17 per cent down at Pounds 187m.
Mr Louis Sherwood, chairman, said 'highly-successful' cost-cutting had
helped to cushion operating losses which rose from Pounds 23.5m to Pounds
27m.
Net interest charges were similar at Pounds 94.7m (Pounds 95.3m). Airedale,
which owes about Pounds 664.2m to bankers following the highly-leveraged
management buy-out of Magnet in 1989, earned some Pounds 3.6m on cash
deposits.
Mr Sherwood said there had been little actual interest paid during the year.
Under current financing arrangements, capital and interest payments on the
company's loans are rolled up until the end of December.
'In light of recent discussions with the group's senior lenders,' Mr
Sherwood said, he was ' confident that satisfactory arrangements will be put
in place well before then.
Magnet, Airedale's operating company, remained financially sound with net
assets of Pounds 160m, a healthy cash balance and no debt, Mr Sherwood said.
The subsidiary is shielded from its parent's debts through an arrangement
with bankers. Until Magnet forecasts a positive cash balance of Pounds 30m
for the following six months, it cannot help pay Airedale's debt or
interest.
Mr Sherwood said steps had been taken to stem losses in Airedale's retail
business. The trade division had moved back into profit, although on lower
sales.
The pre-tax figure included a Pounds 3.4m exceptional item arising from the
introduction of new bedroom ranges.
In view of the capital structure of the company, said Mr Sherwood, an
earnings per share figure would have little relevance. There was no
dividend.
Airedale also faces a claim from GE Capital, which is pressing for repayment
of Pounds 70m mezzanine debt.
The loan was part of Pounds 629m provided for the Magnet MBO. Mr Sherwood
said the group would 'defend the actions vigorously'.

</HEADLINE>

   By CATHERINE MILTON and TIM LAWRENCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERTOURS, the London-based travel agency, this year became one of the few
outlets prosecuted successfully under UK consumer protection law, Catherine
Milton writes.
The company, registered with the Association of British Travel Agents, was
fined after several complaints to Westminster City Council that prices
charged were higher than those advertised.
In June, magistrates ordered Mr Christopoulous Panayiotou, director of
Intertours, to pay Pounds 3,000 in compensation and costs for a variety of
offences under consumer protection law.
One trip to Delhi was quoted at Pounds 425, but the client was asked to pay
Pounds 485. At a London magistrates court, Mr Panayiotou pleaded guilty to
all charges.
Mr Chris Rogers, chief trading standards officer at Westminster council,
said: 'This is a typical complaint, and very often we do not get sufficient
evidence to build a case. This is fine from the point of view of criminal
proceedings, but it does not help people who just wanted their money back in
the first place.'
Mr Panayiotou refused to discuss the details of his prosecution, but said:
'We did not intentionally charge anyone more than the advertised price.' He
said the court case arose out of a 'complete misunderstanding' last year.
The prosecution involved 1.3 per cent of his 12,000 customers last year. 'We
have gone through turbulence but Intertours is now a smooth, clean
operation.'
                        *      *      *
HUNDREDS of people were caught out by what appears to be a loophole in UK
regulations when an Icelandic company, Air Tours Rekjavik, ceased trading
and grounded its UK-based subsidiary, Iceland Air Tours (IAT), in June,
Catherine Milton writes.
They booked tickets to Rekjavik believing their money was protected under
the Civil Aviation Authority's Air Travel Organisers Licence (Atol) system,
which guarantees refunds to clients when travel companies fail.
Although IAT did not have a licence, clients believed it had agreed to pay
another company to share its licence. That kind of arrangement is proper and
fairly common.
No such contract had been signed, however.
IAT probably did not need a CAA licence to trade under UK regulations. The
licence is necessary only for companies that sell charter packages
(including accommodation).
Iceland Air, the state airline, put together a rescue package to help those
stranded overseas when the companies collapsed. However, hundreds of people
who had booked holidays for July, August and September were still left out
of pocket.
The CAA said the situation was confused. All IAT personnel have returned to
Rekjavik and the telephone number for Air Tours Rekjavik is no longer in
use.
                        *      *      *
BOOKING a cheap flight on a reputable airline is no guarantee of fair
treatment, as some bucket shop customers have found to their cost, Tim
Lawrence writes.
Ms Sue Freeman, for example, understood the risks involved in booking a
package holiday with a bucket shop. But she did not know that booking a
flight could be equally fraught.
In mid June Ms Freeman, a journalist, booked an American Airlines flight to
Boston on July 30 for Pounds 379 with Lifestyle Travel, a bucket shop in
Tottenham Court Road in central London. She eventually caught the flight,
but only after an ordeal of claims and counterclaims, she says.
Ms Freeman paid for the ticket and was told it would arrive within 10 days.
When no ticket arrived, she embarked on a daily merry-go-round of
increasingly heated telephone calls to Mr Frank Deluca, owner of Lifestyle
Travel.
Three days before the flight she was told that the flight was overbooked. Mr
Deluca blamed an agent acting for American Airlines for overbooking the
flight. Lifestyle Travel offered her a much longer flight to Boston via
Chicago.
The agent claims it sent two reminders to Lifestyle Travel before the
reservation expired on June 26. By the time Lifestyle Travel's cheque
arrived on June 30, the flight was full.
Eventually American Airlines resolved the difficulty by making space for Ms
Freeman on the original Boston flight  - although not in Club Class.

BUYING from an air ticket bucket shop is like trading on the futures market,
according to Mr Chris Rogers, chief trading standards officer at Westminster
City Council. The risk is high, but if you take the necessary precautions
the financial benefit can be great.
There is no need to buy from non-bonded bucket shops, said Ms Kim Winter, a
project officer at the Consumers' Association magazine Holiday Which?.
'There are enough fully bonded specialist . . . operators, such as
Trailfinders and STA Travel, for people not to risk anything outside,' she
said. People dealing with unbonded bucket shops risk losing money or being
stranded if the tour operator, travel agent or airline collapses.
According to Holiday Which?, the best protection is to pay by credit card,
making out the voucher to the airline, not the travel agent. If the flight
or holiday falls through, the Consumer Credit Act makes the credit card and
the travel company jointly liable.
Mr Riaz Dooley, owner of Travel Bazaar, a non-bonded bucket shop in west
London, said most scheduled flights required no insurance. 'The government
of the national airline would be too embarrassed to leave passengers
stranded if something went wrong,' he said.
Package holidays can be fully protected with a travel indemnity insurance
costing between Pounds 5 and Pounds 10, Mr Dooley added. Bucket shops that
advertise at one price and try to sell at another should be avoided.
Clients, he said, should pay no more than a Pounds 50 deposit on flights and
the full fare should be paid in exchange only for the ticket.
Charter flights have to be paid for in advance, said Mr Dooley, and
customers should get a receipt with the Air Travel Organisers Licence
number, which will guarantee a refund if the company fails.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Travellers on a well-trodden road to ruin: In the wake of
yet another tour industry failure, FT reporters investigate pitfalls facing
the holidaymaker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER

<TEXT>
AS police and liquidators sift the records of the Land Travel coach company,
which collapsed last week, one thing is certain: it will happen again. If
not this summer or autumn, then next year or the year after.
As long ago as 1871, the British newspaper, The Graphic, observing the
beginnings of package tourism, prophesied: 'A time will come when vast
numbers of the population will be carried enormous distances for ridiculous
sums.'
Today, the British buy 20m foreign holidays every year, many for sums so
ridiculous that the companies offering them go out of business.
The system that delivers this service is inherently unstable, making
periodic collapse inevitable. The cost of setting up as a tour operator is
low and the temptation to cut prices is ever-present. The effects of war,
epidemics and hurricanes drive some out of business. Fraud and foolishness
account for some others.
Systems could be devised to ensure that travellers and would-be tourists do
not lose their money, as an estimated 50,000 Land Travel customers have
done.
Even under Mr Michael Heseltine, however, the Department of Trade and
Industry is too averse to intervention to license all tour operators and
ensure proper monitoring.
Land Travel was not a member of the Association of British Travel Agents
(Abta) or of any other organisation offering a money-back guarantee.
The government says it intends to require companies like Land Travel to
arrange guarantees for their custo-mers.
Companies taking customers by road and ferry will be able to subscribe to a
reserve fund, along the lines of the existing fund for air passengers.
But belonging to the surface travel reserve fund will not be compulsory.
Companies that remain outside the fund will have their customer guarantees
monitored by trading standards officers rather than experienced travel
organisations.
Those who remain in the travel business fear collapses almost as much as
those who fall victim to them. The business is concerned with management of
two things: cash and confidence. Wreck confidence in the travel business or
in a particular company and the cash will disappear. Customers will no
longer provide it, and previously indulgent hoteliers, airlines and coach
operators will come knocking at the door, demanding payment earlier than
previously envisaged.
A travel company on the point of collapse exhibits characteristics which
many in the business recognised in Land Travel. In its last two months, it
appeared to be taking in customers' payments with the sole objective of
paying off immediate debts.
Mr Noel Josephides, a director of the operator Sunvil Holidays and chairman
of the Association of Independent Tour Operators, says: 'They were selling
for Pounds 59 a tour that was probably costing them twice that. They were
getting cash to pay debts they already owed.'
Land Travel's reputation was not high even before the troubles of recent
months. Coach and Bus Week, a trade publication, began reporting in 1990 on
the company's tendency to pay suppliers late.
Land Travel's brochures were adjudged to contain substantial inaccuracies.
That is not unique to Land Travel. A report in Holiday Which? magazine
earlier this year criticised the brochures of the UK's three biggest travel
companies  - Thomson, Owners Abroad and Airtours. A common deficiency was an
inability to gauge accurately the distance between hotels, beaches and
shops.
Complaints to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) about Land Travel,
however, disclosed an inventiveness remarkable even by the standards of the
holiday industry.
One traveller complained that a tour of central and eastern Europe was to
have included optional excursions to Prague and Krakow, but that those had
not been available. Land Travel, the ASA said, 'stated that the hotel
location had been found to be too far for the excursion to Prague and that
it had not been possible to arrange visas in time to offer the excursion to
Krakow'.
Land Travel did not own any coaches, relying instead on outside contractors.
In spite of the company's reputation for late payment, coach companies
continued to work for it.
Some coach operators who worked for Land Travel are reluctant to admit that
they lost money and asked for their names not to be mentioned.
One who agreed to talk was Mr Keith Davies, a partner in Pat's Coaches of
Wrexham. 'We worked for them for two months,' he said. 'Their reputation
preceded them in the industry. A lot of people didn't trust them. We told
them we wanted cheques up-front, post-dated for 10 days. A lot of others
were working on the basis of 30 days or 45 days. Two of our coaches were out
at the time (of the collapse). Three of their cheques bounced.'
Liquidator Grant Thornton is still not sure what precipitated the final
crisis at Land Travel. What is clear, however, is that, as rumours of
trouble grew, they became, to some extent, self-fulfilling. P&amp;O European
Ferries demanded that Land Travel pay it in advance. When it became clear
that the company did not have the money, P&amp;O refused to take any more
bookings.
The likelihood of further Land Travels has increased rather than decreased
in recent years as a result of changes in booking patterns and traveller
preferences.
One of the attractions of the business has always been the favourable
cashflow. Customers generally pay for their holidays before the operator has
to pay for airline seats and accommodation. Travel has traditionally been a
good field for an under-capitalised entrepreneur.
Mr Peter Rothwell, marketing director of Lunn Poly, the UK's largest chain
of travel agents, points out that all a new tour operator needs is a
computer reservation system and some telephones. If the operator can get a
charter airline or coach company to allocate him some seats and can find the
customers to fill them, he is in business. As long as the customers keep
booking, the business can carry on growing.
The period between customers paying and suppliers demanding payment meant
new companies could earn healthy amounts of interest. Over the past decade,
that opportunity has diminished as customers have begun to book later,
waiting for discounts. Ten years ago, a third of all package holidays for
the following year were already sold by Christmas. The proportion has now
dropped to less than a quarter.
British holidaymakers also show a growing preference for self-catering
accommodation rather than hotels. Tour operators generally pay for hotel
beds only if used. Self-catering accommodation usually has to be paid for
whether used or not.
Mr Rothwell believes that efforts to protect the holidaymaker could, in
fact, make operator failure more likely.
Companies that belong to the reserve fund will know their customers are
fully protected, he says, and that might encourage them to take even bigger
business risks. The new trust fund, he adds, 'could just be a bigger pot for
people to go bust in'.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Doctors faulted over drug allocation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH doctors prescribe fewer, older and cheaper drugs than their
Continental counterparts, but their prescribing practice is not
cost-effective, according to the Association of the British Pharmaceutical
Industry.
'The UK is not using new medicines wisely,' Dr John Griffin, association
director, said. 'British doctors are using old, slightly more dangerous and
certainly less effective products which are more expensive in the long
term.'
In 1990, the UK pharmaceutical market, including over-the-counter
non-prescription drugs, was Ecu 4.74bn (Pounds 3.4bn). That compared with
Ecu 10.1bn in Germany, and Ecu 8.9bn in France.
UK patients received more than 460m prescriptions last year, up 24m on 1990.
They cost the National Health Service Pounds 3.1bn, representing 9.7 per
cent of its total expenditure. Per capita expenditure on prescription drugs
in the UK is nearly half that in France and Italy, Dr Griffin said. UK per
capita expenditure on prescription drugs in 1990 was only Pounds 55. That
compared with Pounds 105 in Italy, Pounds 102 in France, Pounds 95 in
Germany and Pounds 82 in Sweden.
British GPs prescribe fewer drugs than many of their Continental
counterparts. Prescriptions per capita in the UK averaged only 7.6 in 1989
compared with 38 in France, 20 in Italy and 12 in Germany. Danish, Swedish
and Dutch doctors signed fewer prescriptions.
Drugs prescribed by UK doctors also tend to be old, he said. In Italy,
Japan, the US and Canada, more than 20 per cent of drugs prescribed have
been introduced in the past five years. In the UK, the figure is 9.3 per
cent.
Dr Griffin blamed government measures for making doctors more
cost-conscious. He argued that by prescribing less effective drugs, doctors
were raising overall costs because of increased hospital admissions.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Storm over contaminated-land register
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REVISED proposals for a contaminated-land register, issued yesterday, have
provoked strong criticism from both sides of the environmental debate.
Environmental activists accused the government of retreating from its
commitment to identify contaminated land. The property industry said the
changes were cosmetic and would depress land values and increase urban
blight.
Recommendations in a new consultation paper from the Department of the
Environment are less stringent than previous government proposals. The new
proposals would reduce the amount of land placed on a public register to
between 10 per cent and 15 per cent of that included under the former
proposals. Mr David Maclean, minister for the environment and countryside,
said the new regulations placed the emphasis on the most contaminating uses.
The consultation paper proposed a two-tier system to distinguish between
land that has not been investigated or treated from land where the
contamination has been assessed.
Mr Christopher Jonas, president of the Royal Institution of Chartered
Surveyors, said the revised proposals would lead to 'unnecessary blight and
distort the property market'. They would create added uncertainty in the
property industry and deter investors and developers from regenerating inner
cities.
Mr Sean Humber of Friends of the Earth, the environmental lobby group, said
the revised proposals excluded most of an estimated 100,000 contaminated
sites.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Mind over motor in the car bazaar: The hopes and fears
behind today's K-registration plates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS party time last night at the Reg Vardy motor group's flagship Nissan
dealership, which stands almost in the shadow of the Japanese carmaker's
plant near Sunderland.
Mr Neil Dunkley, the dealership's general manager, estimated about half of
the more than 140 customers who ordered new Nissans for August delivery with
the new K plate registration would turn up for the party. At the stroke of
midnight, they would drive home in their new purchases, and Reg Vardy would
celebrate what has been a unexpectedly strong sales period. The group's 21
sales and service outlets pre-sold for August as many new cars as they sold
throughout August last year.
Meanwhile, far to the south, in Fulham, west London, Mr Graham Horder, owner
and managing director of Cheyne BMW, claims to be rubbing his hands in
anticipation of a bonanza of August new car sales. 'Last year we delivered
87 BMWs during August, which was a good result given the circumstances,' he
says. 'This year we have already got August orders for 134 cars, and they
are still coming in each day.'
Both dealers either occupy an apparently recession-proof island in the
moribund UK economy, or August new car sales this year will confound the
anxieties of manufacturers and the big dealers.
The indications are that, when the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders tots up sales figures in early September, August will have provided
little to cheer about. Indeed, suggests Professor Garel Rhys, the SMMT's own
professor of Motor Industry Economics at Cardiff Business School, the
figures may finally demonstrate that it is now time to abandon the annual
new car registration prefix.
August accounts for about 25 per cent of total annual sales. July's market
has been reduced to little over 2 per cent and, as early as late April,
potential buyers are holding back, waiting for the new prefix. As the August
bulge has grown, so it has left fewer sales for the final four months of the
year.
The fear this year is that prolonged recession and July's gloomy statistics
on rising unemployment and collapsing confidence indicate that the August
car sales bulge will not be big enough to take up the stock of cars that
UK-based manufacturers have built.
According to Prof Rhys, there is already an excess stock of 40,000 new cars
scattered around the countryside.
As recently as March, the industry expected sales this year to recover to
1.7m-1.75m units, up from last year's depressed 1.59m. Now, it fears there
will be little or no improvement on last year.
The result is that the recent cut-price bazaar atmosphere in car retailing
may continue through the year to clear unsold stocks.
Some motor trade executives like Mr Reg Heath, chief executive of TKM, which
controls one of the UK's largest retailing networks, believes this bazaar
atmosphere may last well into next year.
Growing urgency to 'move the metal' has prompted some innovative marketing
schemes. They include Ford's 'Options' package, under which a purchaser
finances the net cost of a car's purchase price less its projected
depreciation after two years. At the end of the period, he or she can opt to
hand back the car and start a new agreement, or pay the rest of the purchase
price. Ford, which is struggling to reverse a market share slide from about
30 per cent in the 1980s to the low 20 per cents now, hopes most people will
opt for another new car.
Vauxhall has already hit back with a similar scheme, called 'Choices', with
the added lure of a Pounds 300 bonus for any new Nova, Cavalier, Carlton,
Senator or Calibra registered up to August 31.
In spite of having spent about Pounds 50m promoting and advertising such
schemes in July alone, the industry fears that this August sales will not
exceed last August's 370,000 and will be far short of the record 530,000
achieved of August 1989.
According to Mr Heath of TKM, both the trade and the industry have no option
but to tighten their belts, keep overheads tight and sit it out for a
recovery  - which, he notes in an ironic reference to government forecasts,
'doesn't look like coming now until the fifth quarter of 1992'.
Like Prof Rhys and Mr Neil Marshall, economist at the Retail Motor Industry
Federation, he is stuck for suggestions on how the govern-ment might restore
con-sumer confidence, short of sharp interest rate cuts and sterling's
realignment within ERM.
The infuriating thing, says Mr Marshall, is that 'we know there is plenty of
money about, and that the savings ratio is exceptionally high. What we have
is a psychological problem. It's deeply disturbing for us and, with most
economic indicators pointing in the wrong direction, we simply don't know
when it's going to go away.'
For those with the cash and the courage, however, there is one old motor
trade 'come-on' which has never been more valid: there has never been a
better time to buy a car.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Steeper GDP drop expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORECASTERS have scaled back their expectations of Britain's economic
performance this year and next, according to data released by the Treasury
yesterday.
The Treasury's latest survey of independent forecasts, compiled last month,
showed that on average economists now expect gross domestic product to fall
this year by 0.2 per cent and GDP growth in 1993 to be only 2 per cent. The
June survey of 30 forecasters in the City, economic research institutes and
academia pointed to growth of 0.4 per cent this year and 2.5 per cent next
year.
The increased pessimism has caused the forecasters to revise upwards their
expectations of unemployment and the government's public-sector borrowing
requirement.
The latest consensus is that unemployment, which was 2.72m in June, will
rise to 2.88m in the final quarter of this year and increase to 2.97m by the
end of next year. In June, the forecasters predicted unemployment of 2.85m
at the end of this year and 2.87m in the final quarter of next year.
The survey found that, on average, forecasters now expect the PSBR to total
Pounds 31.7bn in the current financial year and Pounds 36.4bn in 1993-94, up
from June's estimates.
Consensus expectations for inflation have fallen to 3.8 per cent by the end
of this year.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Cadbury is backed by Exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE London Stock Exchange yesterday issued an unqualified endorsement of
recommendations to improve the performance of company boards proposed by the
Cadbury committee on corporate governance.
The Exchange also said it was considering whether one of the committee's
recommendations  - that balance-sheet information be included in interim
financial reports  - be made a condition of listing.
The committee, which considered financial aspects of corporate governance,
issued a report in May calling for companies to comply voluntarily with a
code of best practice for directors.
The committee was formed at the instigation of the Financial Reporting
Council, the accountancy profession and the London Stock Exchange, and
included representatives of industry, shareholders, academia and the Bank of
England.
Among its key recommendations was a Stock Exchange listing requirement under
which companies would be required to disclose the extent to which they
complied with the voluntary code of conduct and where they diverged from it,
explain themselves. While those companies that fail to comply would risk
delisting, it is considered unlikely that the Exchange would do more than
censure such a company for failure to comply.
The listing requirement was the only enforcement mechanism proposed by the
committee and has been criticised by shareholder groups as falling short of
what is needed to improve corporate governance.
Yesterday the Exchange spelt out how it intends the listing requirement to
work. The code of practice itself will not form part of the Exchange's
so-called Yellow Book of rules, only the provision that the extent of
compliance be disclosed. The rule would apply to companies seeking listings
for the first time as well as those already listed.
The listing requirement has also been strongly criticised by the
Confederation of British Industry. Sir Michael Angus, CBI chairman, said the
new listing requirement might lead to additional layers of bureaucracy for
business.
THE Cadbury committee on corporate governance contains 'serious omissions'
on enforcement and internal auditing, the Institute of Internal Auditors
said yesterday.
The institute said effective corporate control could not rely on external
auditors and required professional internal auditors employed by directors
to advise on controls within the company.
Mr Harold Izzard, institute spokesman on corporate governance, said:
'Cadbury is really a top-down review while we approach the comapny from the
bottom up. But non-executive directors are very vulnerable without internal
auditors.'
The submission to the Cadbury committee argues that external auditors are
restricted by the level of their fees, and mainly concentrate on financial
controls.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Court broadens scope to sue press
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN APPEAL Court decision in favour of a former maid at Buckingham Palace
opened the way yesterday for actions against newspapers by people who cannot
afford to sue for libel.
The court gave Miss Linda Joyce, a former Royal maid, the right to sue Today
newspaper for malicious falsehood, rather than libel, over an article that
accused her of stealing intimate letters belonging to the Princess Royal.
The judges said it was 'as plain as a pikestaff' that Miss Joyce had been
libelled, but said she could not afford to sue at her own expense. While
legal aid was not available for defamation cases, it could be obtained for
an action for malicious falsehood.
Mr Mark Stephens, her solicitor, said: 'The court has remedied a great
social injustice. It has finally recognised that poor people should have the
right to clear their names if newspapers recklessly lie about them.'
Miss Joyce of Stonehouse, Gloucestershire, who is now unemployed, had been
told it would cost Pounds 40,000 to commence libel proceedings. Palace maids
earn about Pounds 5,000 a year. The court said it did not expect to see
people who had been defamed 'queueing up to issue writs for malicious
falsehood' in future.
It is more difficult to prove malicious falsehood than libel. Plaintiffs
cannot recover damages for loss of reputation but only for proven financial
loss or the real likelihood of financial loss. They must establish both that
a statement was false and that it was published with malice or with reckless
indifference to its truth or falsity.
The court rejected Today's argument that Miss Joyce's action should be
struck out as an abuse of process. The newspaper argued that allowing her to
proceed by way of malicious falsehood denied it the defences available in
libel actions and the 'absolute right' to have the issue tried by a jury.
Sir Frank Rogers, chairman of the Newspaper Publishers Association,
yesterday said the ruling was 'potentially very dangerous for newspapers'.
Mr David Newell, deputy director of the Newspaper Society, which represents
local and regional newspapers, called for a comprehensive review of media
law.

A HIGH COURT judge yesterday refused to make an immediate order that the
Serious Fraud Office disclose to the liquidators of the collapsed Bank of
Credit and Commerce International documents seized from three former
officers of the bank and a broker through which many of the bank's treasury
transactions took place.
The documents were obtained from the homes of Mr Agha Abedi, BCCI's founder,
and Mr Swaleh Naqvi, former BCCI chief executive, a safe deposit box in the
name of Mr Zafar Iqbal, and Capcom Financial Services.
Sir Donald Nicholls, the vice-chancellor, said none of the four had been
notified of the liquidators' application for production of their documents.
Parties from whom documents had been seized were, in general, entitled to an
opportunity to present objections.
Capcom should be asked its attitude to disclosure, he said. More information
was needed about the circumstances of the three individuals and the
practicability of notifying them before he could decide whether notification
to them should be dispensed with.
The liquidators, partners in Touche Ross, were granted an order for
disclosure by the SFO of other documents obtained under compulsory powers
from Price Waterhouse, former auditors of BCCI, and from Control Securities,
a company formerly controlled by Mr Nazmudin Virani, other companies in the
Control group, and from Mr Virani himself.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A MORTGAGE trap which has saddled many mortgage defaulters with
ever-increasing repayments was blocked by the Court of Appeal yesterday.
Some mortgage companies have seized possession of properties from defaulters
and not sold them in the hope that values will rise. But yesterday three
judges ruled they must not do this if caused the defaulter's debts to
continue rising.
Businessman Mr Anthony Palk and his wife Margaret bought a property in
Heathfield, West Sussex, in 1990 with a Pounds 300,000 advance from Mortgage
Services Funding. Mr Palk's business then failed.
In March last year, when he owed Pounds 358,587 on the mortgage, Mr Palk
negotiated a sale of the property for Pounds 283,000. But Mortgage Services
obtained a court order for possession of the property and successfully
opposed a County Court application by Mrs Palk for permission to sell.
The Appeal Court allowed an appeal against this ruling.

Jack writes.
Mr Claud Gurney, leader of the egm initiative, criticised Lloyd's for not

to about 35,000 Names, the individuals whose assets underwrite the insurance
market.
Last week's meeting discussed four resolutions, including a call for the
governing council to co-operate more with Names. Mr Gurney said he had been
unable to send out the letter because Lloyd's had refused to supply him with
Names' addresses, and had rejected a request even if he paid all costs.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Construction chiefs call for currency realignment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS OF Britain's de-pressed construction industry yesterday made one of
the strongest appeals to the government to change its economic policy and
seek a realignment of currencies within the European exchange rate
mechanism.
The appeal accompanied a forecast that the recession in the industry,
already severe, would be deeper and longer than previously expected.
The National Council of Building Material Producers, representing more than
2,000 companies with a combined annual turnover of Pounds 20bn, said UK
construction output was likely to fall 8 per cent this year and a further
2.5 per cent next year. Last year it fell 8.9 per cent.
Mr Peter Roberts, director responsible for building products at the IMI
metals group and chairman of the council's forecasting panel, said:
'Conditions, particularly in the private housing market, have deteriorated
since the (April general) election.'
More jobs would be lost unless efforts were made to stimulate the economy,
Mr Roberts said. 'Very few recoveries start without government pushing some
button to start it.'
He appealed to the government to use its presidency of the European
Community to make a concerted effort with other EC members to realign
currencies and bring down interest rates over the the next six months.
The Federation of Civil Engineers said Britain should try to agree on
realignment even if agreement could not be reached with Germany.
It said any attempt by the government to control public spending by cutting
capital investment in roads, homes and other infrastructure would be
disastrous for the con-struction industry and the country.
The federation published a separate survey showing that 40 per cent of civil
engineers expect to shed more jobs during the next 12 months.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Poll tax arrears may last to 2000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE IN 12 local authorities expects to be collecting poll tax arrears into
the year 2000, even though the tax will be replaced by the property-based
council tax next April.
Two out of five councils believe that the poll tax backlog will affect
implementation of the council tax either extensively or moderately.
The findings come in a previously unpublished study commissioned by the
government from CSL, the management consultants, and leaked to Mr Jack
Straw, shadow local-government minister.
The Department of the Environment agreed yesterday with Mr Straw's
assessment that more than Pounds 1bn was uncollected from the first two
years of the poll tax.
'The poll tax fiasco lives on and is likely significantly to upset the
implementation of the council tax,' Mr Straw said yesterday.
'The country has already paid too dearly for the mess of the poll tax: it
looks as though the council tax will replace one fiasco with another.'
As councils prepare for introduction of the council tax, some Environment
Department officials believe that the average bill for a household in a band
D home (worth Pounds 68,000-Pounds 88,000 in April this year) might well be
more than Pounds 500.

FT  01 AUG 92 / British Gas defends its record on prices and service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MONOPOLIES and Mergers Commission investigation of the UK gas market
requested yesterday by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary,
will be the most comprehensive review since British Gas was privatised in
1986.
Mr Heseltine made two references to the MMC, one on the gas supply market to
household, commercial and industrial customers, and the other on the
transport and storage business which British Gas has agreed to run as an
arm's-length subsidiary from 1994.
The MMC is charged with establishing 'whether a monopoly situation exists,
and if so, whether it operates against the public interest, or whether
anything done by the monopolist operates against the public interest'.
If the MMC reports to Mr Heseltine that that is the case, he will have the
power to change the terms of the Gas Act under which British Gas was
privatised or to ask Sir James McKinnon, director-general of the regulator
Ofgas, to make changes in the running of the industry.
British Gas said yesterday that it had agreed to all demands made on it to
introduce competition to the gas market, but sometimes conflicting demands
from the the Office of Fair Trading, Ofgas, and the Department of Energy had
made 'medium and long-term planning extremely difficult'.
Mr Cedric Brown, who takes over as British Gas chief executive today, said
the group had embraced competition so that 33 per cent of the firm contract
market was now handled by independent suppliers. The company had reduced
prices by 19 per cent in real terms for domestic customers and 40 per cent
for large industrial users.
It had also improved its standards of service, as demonstrated by recent
surveys which showed high levels of consumer satisfaction.
British Gas was angered by the insistence of Ofgas earlier this year that it
should submit to a strict formula limiting price rises to household
customers to 5 per cent below the rate of inflation. The dispute came soon
after BG had agreed to OFT demands to surrender 50 per cent of its
industrial supply market by 1995, partly by releasing portions of gas it was
already contracted to buy to competitors, and to hive off its transportation
business.
The final straw was Sir James's refusal this week to allow British Gas to
impose prices for using its pipeline business for independent suppliers that
gave it an adequate rate of return on its investment, without a referral to
the MMC. If such a referral was to be made, BG said, it should cover all
aspects of the market.
The inquiry will mean nine months of intense scrutiny of all aspects of the
household supply business of British Gas, although its other businesses, in
exploration and production, and gas supply overseas, will not form part of
the investigation. Moreover, it could delay the development of competition
in the market.
British Gas has pledged to continue its programme of releasing contracting
gas to competitors. But Sir James announced yesterday that in view of the
MMC referral it would be impossible to implement a fair system of prices for
the pipeline business by the original target date of October. He had
reluctantly postponed that for a year.

WASHINGTON and Moscow have invited participants in the Middle East peace
talks to resume bilateral negotiations in the US capital on August 24, the
first meeting since the change of government in Israel last month.
Hopes of a breakthrough in the talks launched last October, have been raised
by the election victory of Mr Yitzhak Rabin, who has promised to accelerate
the process. He has accepted having the next round in Washington, which the
previous government had rejected, and is prepared to make greater
concessions to the Arabs than Mr Yitzhak Shamir, his predecessor.
In a rare interview with an Israeli newspaper published yesterday, Mr Yasser
Arafat, chairman of the Tunis-based Palestine Liberation Organisation,
called on Mr Rabin to drop Israel's refusal to negotiate directly with the
PLO in the talks.
Mr Arafat also reiterated the Palestinian demand to introduce into the
negotiating process the issue of the right of Palestinian refugees to return
to their original homes.

JVC, the Japanese consumer electronics company, is to produce television

project in China, Gordon Cramb writes from Tokyo.
Production will begin in December and is intended to reach an eventual

to assemble knockdown kits for video cassette recorders, camcorders and
karaoke equipment aimed at China.
JVC will have 55 per cent control of the venture. The main local partner is
Shanghai Video and Audio Electronics, which has 29 existing plants making
televisions and video cameras, and 6,000 sales affiliates and service
centres across the country.
The venture, though employing only 70 people in its first year when TV
output is expected to be 48,000 units, gives a boost to Shanghai's Pudong
free trade zone, where it will be located.

NEW job offers in Japan fell sharply in June and consumer prices in Tokyo
were slightly lower last month, reflecting the slowdown in economic activity
that prompted the Bank of Japan to cut official interest rates this week.
The ratio of job offers to applicants fell from 1.14 in May to 1.08, the
lowest in four years, the Labour Ministry said. Most big companies have
announced plans to reduce staff intake this year, and a few smaller ones
have been laying off staff recently.
New job offers in the manufacturing industry fell 23.5 per cent on the same
month last year, with a 60 per cent fall in demand for seasonal and
part-time workers. However, there is still a labour shortage in service
sector businesses and in some factories.
The ratio of job offers peaked at 1.47 in March last year, and has since
fallen consistently, prompting the ministry to start a study into sectors
with a surplus of workers.
Meanwhile, housing starts in June rose a slim 1 per cent on the same month
last year, with a 20 per cent increase in starts for rental houses, but a 41
per cent plunge in starts of houses for sale, the 15th consecutive month of
decline, the Construction Ministry reported.
The Bank of Japan argues that the bottoming-out of the housing market, at
least in the rental area, means an economic recovery is not far away; but
apartment prices are still declining and the share prices of leading
property developers have fallen sharply over the past month.
The central bank was reassured by the 0.4 per cent fall in Tokyo consumer
prices this month, the first decline in five months, as it reinforced the
bank's view that the inflation threat has receded.
Evidence that Japan's slowdown may be intensifying prompted the Daiwa
Institute of Research, linked to Daiwa Bank, to revise downward its growth
estimate from 2.8 per cent to 2.5 per cent for the fiscal year to March.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Inkatha denounces ANC strike

<TEXT>
POLITICAL tensions in South Africa heightened yesterday as the mainly Zulu
Inkatha Freedom party (IFP) strongly attacked the African National Congress
(ANC) 'mass action' campaign, urging supporters to defy the general strike
called for Monday.
In Johannesburg, Mr Humphrey Ndlovu, a senior IFP official, accused the
African National Congress (ANC) of adopting a 'deliberate confrontationist
policy of mass action'.
An anti-strike march by the IFP is due to take place today in Durban, in the
party stronghold of Natal province.
The ruling National party made a last-minute plea to the ANC yesterday to
call off the strike, saying the country might never recover.
The ANC has appealed to strikers and demonstrators to behave peacefully, and
said yesterday that leading companies had agreed not to take disciplinary
action against striking staff.
Between 10 and 12 United Nations observers will be in South Africa to
monitor the two-day strike, due to be followed by three days of
demonstrations, sit-ins and rallies. Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN envoy to South
Africa, said last night that he 'hoped and prayed' that the week of protest
would pass off peacefully.
Mr Vance, speaking shortly before his return to New York last night, will
report back to the UN secretary general, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, early
next week.
He made clear that he expects to return to South Africa as part of a UN
initiative, and is expected to recommend that the world body attach
observers to local institutions, such as the Goldstone commission into
township violence, and the National Peace Accord, a body set up last year to
help curb political killings.
Earlier in the day President FW de Klerk's office said the government and
the ANC would hold a further round of talks in 'the near future'. A
spokesman confirmed reports of Tuesday's meeting, the first official contact
since the ANC suspended negotiations last month, but said no agreement had
been reached over the release of remaining political prisoners  - one of the
ANC's conditions for the resumption of multi-party constitutional
negotiations.
In what it called a 'decisive blow' against witness intimidation, the
government yesterday announced new laws to protect people testifying about
political violence, AP reports from Pretoria.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Hong Kong awards Pounds 600m airport deal: International
consortium wins contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN international consortium of Japanese, US and European companies was
yesterday provisionally awarded a HKDollars 9bn (Pounds 600m) contract to
carry out reclamation and site preparation for Hong Kong's Chek Lap Kok
airport.
The bid by Airport Platform Contractors was the lowest from four
short-listed consortia, and was well below the HKDollars 10bn budgeted for
the work by the Provisional Airport Authority, the government corporation
charged with overseeing and managing the project.
The contract is expected to take about 3 1/2 years to complete. Members of
the consortium include Nishimatsu Construction of Japan, Costain of the UK,
Morrison Knudsen of the US, China Harbour Engineering from China, Ballast
Nedam, a Dutch subsidiary of British Aerospace, and Jan De Nul of Belgium.
Work will involve levelling the 1,248 hectare site on Chek Lap Kok Island
and reclaiming land from the sea. The formal award of the contract requires
China's approval for the financing for the airport, which, allowing for
estimated inflation, is forecast to cost HKDollars 68.5bn.
The Hong Kong legislature then has to approve the arrangements.
Beijing's approval is expected to take some time. The consortium has agreed
to extend the closing date of its offer from mid-October until the end of
November.
Failure to meet this deadline may mean the contract being put out for
re-tendering.
It is the second big contract to be awarded for the airport project, which
includes large-scale road and rail links to the mainland. In May an
Anglo-Japanese consortium which included Costain and Trafalgar House, the UK
construction, property, shipping and hotels group, was awarded a HKDollars
7.14bn contract to build one of the world's largest suspension bridges.
Negotiations between Britain and China about the financing of the whole
airport project broke up on Thursday without agreement. Yesterday Mr Chris
Patten, the colony's governor, said he hoped for rapid progress in
negotiations after August.
China is concerned about the cost of the project, the financial guarantees
made available by the government, and the prospect of heavy debts accruing
to the post-1997 government of the colony.
Britain is seeking China's agreement to the financial package devised for
the Provisional Airport Authority. It is prepared to make concessions on the
financing of the airport railway, the principal source of concern to China.
These worries are unlikely to be allayed, or confirmed, until Mr Patten
makes known his plans on the colony's future political structure in the
autumn.
But the provisional award of the contract has increased the pressure on
Beijing to approve the financing for the airport.

THE US administration is preparing to send 2,400 soldiers to Kuwait in the
coming days, the Pentagon said yesterday, AP reports from Washington.
Soldiers with mechanized and infantry units from Texas and Georgia have been
given orders to prepare for the move, said defence officials. They said the
troops will be flown to Kuwait from Texas and Kentucky in an exercise which
had been planned for later in the year.
'It's a message to Saddam. It's to show the flag,' one official said.
The move follows the US administration's decision ' in light of the tension
with Iraq over United Nations weapons inspections ' to send a battery of
Patriot missiles to Kuwait, and another battery of the anti-missile weaponry
to neighbouring Bahrain.
Yesterday the state department rejected a UN inspector's suggestion that a
confrontation with Baghdad over access to a suspected weapons site was a
misunderstanding and charged that all of Iraq's hidden capabilities had not
been uncovered.
The state department said UN Security Council resolution 687, which sets out
Gulf War ceasefire terms, requires Iraq to give UN inspectors immediate and
unconditional access to any site that they believe may contain information
about Baghdad's weapons of mass destruction.
In addition to sending troops to Kuwait US navy and marines are expected to
participate in a round of naval and amphibious exercises with the Kuwaiti
military, beginning next week.
The decision does not portend military action, according to the Pentagon.
'It's defensive. It's like an exercise,' he said.
'There is nothing going on there now that should raise anyone's level of
concern,' indicating chances are extremely low that the Army troops would
come under fire.
The troops are expected to be dispatched in the coming days but the order
could be reversed should the White House decide it isn't necessary.
The Pentagon stressed that top military officials were treating the move as
'business as usual,' and that no great level of anxiety accompanies the
decision.

FT  01 AUG 92 / EC wants Swedish defence pledge
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN should agree to join in an eventual common European defence as the
price for entering the EC, the European Commission said yesterday.
This was the only seriously contentious issue raised by the Commission in
what Mr Frans Andriessen, the external affairs commissioner, called a
'perfectly positive' opinion on Swedish membership.
A year ago Sweden followed Austria in applying for membership, prompting
similar action from Finland and Switzerland, and possibly from Norway this
autumn. The EC has said it is ready to start formal accession negotiations
with these countries from the European Free Trade Association (Efta), once
future Community financing has been agreed and the Maastricht union treaty
ratified.
The difficulty of ratifying Maastricht, after it was rejected two months ago
by Denmark, still places a certain question mark over admission of new EC
members.
Sweden has convinced the EC that it will accept a common foreign and
security policy. But it still has reservations, the Commission noted, on
Maastricht's provisions on defence. Mr Carl Bildt, the Swedish prime
minister, has repeatedly stressed Sweden's desire to conduct its own
immediate defence itself.
Anxious lest incoming Efta neutrals prevent the Community from developing a
common defence one day, President Jacques Delors persuaded his Commission
colleagues that Sweden should, during its accession negotiations, be made to
give 'specific and binding assurances' that it will accept whatever emerges
from Maastricht in this area. The Commission is likely to recommend the same
in its opinions on Finland and Switzerland later this year.
By contrast, Sweden should find it relative plain sailing to adapt its
relatively successful economy to Community requirements, though the
Commission signalled likely difficulties for Sweden's farmers who will have
to accept lower support prices, and abolition and modification of the
country's alcohol monopoly.
Mr Andriessen suggested that, once accession talks started, the Community
might agree to Sweden's request for formal membership of the European
Monetary System. Last year it linked the krona to the Ecu.

civil lawsuit against accountants Arthur Andersen, accusing the
Chicago-based firm of accounting malpractice, negligence and breach of

The S&amp;L failed in 1989, costing US taxpayers Dollars 900m.
The suit was filed by the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC), the federal

FT  01 AUG 92 / War prompts rampant nationalism in Croatia: The mood in the
former Yugoslav republic on the eve of elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE EVE of presidential and parliamentary elections, thousands of Croats
in Zagreb at a rally for the Croatian Party of Rights raised their hands in
a Sieg Heil salute, and vowed to defend their homeland.
Ultra-nationalism in Croatia, embodied by the Croatian Party of Rights
(HSP), will be on the rise until an agreement is reached to end the war
between the former Yugoslav republic and Serbia.
Mr Milorad Pupovac, a leader of the Serbian Democratic Forum, says: 'Mutual
recognition by the two countries would be an important and necessary step
towards a political solution.'
The need for Croatia to reassert control over its territory has been the
single most important issue of the month-long election campaign. The war,
which began in June last year, gave rise to nationalism and appears to have
eclipsed all other issues.
Elections posters throughout the capital call for a 'free and strong
Croatia'. One of the HSP posters portrays a handsome Croat soldier pointing
a machine gun.
Mr Branko Horvat, a Zagreb economist, says: 'Only when you can walk freely
from one end of the country to the other, can you have democracy.
'If you wish to have a democratic Croatia, then you must stop the war,' says
Mr Horvat, whose Social Democratic Union party stands little chance in
Sunday's poll. While the bloodshed has eased in Croatia, people say the war
will not be over until the Croatian government gains control of the third of
its territory patrolled by UN forces.
Diplomats in Zagreb say progress towards democracy will not begin until the
question of sovereignty is resolved. One said: 'Democracy is simply not the
main issue at this point. People are concerned with territory.'
Mr Horvat says only when the war is over will people address the economic
decline in Croatia. Industrial production is 50 per cent below that of 1989,
he says. Inflation is running at 25 per cent a month. Unemployment is
vaguely estimated at 15-30 per cent, not counting the 700,000 refugees in
Croatia and the UN-controlled zone. Mr Horvat says economic renewal is
contingent on the government giving up control over the economy. He sees
economic reform as a crucial step in achieving real democracy.
While the international community searches for a political solution to the
Yugoslav crisis, many Croats believe the only solution is to intensify
pressure on Serbia. Most are unwilling to make any compromise with Serbia
until Croatia controls its own territory.
Masa Silic, a 22-year-old student, says: 'Until they (the Serb militia) stop
the killing in Bosnia, we need the strongest government to protect Croatia
and help unite the territory again.'

</HEADLINE>

   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday submitted to heavy pressure from
governments and companies outside the Community and postponed decisions on
two controversial state aid cases.
Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner, was forced to withdraw
proposals to make Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish industrial group,
repay illegal state aid of Pta36bn (Pounds 196m) to the Spanish government.
The plan is likely to be resubmitted to the Commission in September,
although it may have to be substantially reworked to attract enough support
from other commissioners, who expressed serious reservations yesterday.
They were said to be worried about pending legal action by the Spanish
authorities, which disputes Brussels' right to open a state aid
investigation.
The Spanish authorities wrote off Pta36bn of debts owed to them by CCC, an
ailing electricals group which ABB bought in June 1990. CCC would have
difficulty repaying the write-off itself.
Separately, the Commission decided to delay imposition of a 10 per cent
customs duty on Chrysler vans imported into the EC from a new Austrian
factory. Brussels alleges that Austria provided excessive subsidies for the
factory, breaking the terms of a trade agreement with the EC.
Community cannot demand repayment of the aid, because Austria is not an EC
member and the European Economic Area is not yet in force.
The commissioners decided on further talks with Austria before they submit
formal proposals for duties to EC member states.
The Commission is to take the Italian government to the European Court for
not implementing two 1989 Commission decisions calling for the refund of
L875.5bn (Pounds 399m) of state aid. The Commission wants the aid  -
L615.1bn from Alfa Romeo and L260.4bn from Lanerossi  - to be repaid to the
Italian state rather than to state-owned holding companies. The Alfa Romeo
decision has already been upheld once by the European Court.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Treasury and Bank step up defence over sterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TREASURY and the Bank of England yesterday stepped up their defence of
the pound's position in the European exchange rate mechanism in the face of
renewed weakness on European currency markets.
Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the Bank's governor, moved swiftly to counter
damage to sterling following Thursday's criticism of its high value in the
ERM from Mr Brian Pearse, Midland Bank's chief executive, and Sir Denys
Henderson, ICI chairman.
The UK monetary authorities were 'absolutely determined not to tolerate
inflation', Mr Leigh-Pemberton said. 'This is why our commitment to the ERM
is so important and unwavering as a means to that end,' he told a business
seminar in London.
Earlier, in an interview with the Daily Express, Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, repeated his opposition to devaluation. It was 'fool's gold', he
said, and would lead to higher, not lower, interest rates.
Dealers said both the Bank of England and the Bank of Portugal intervened in
yesterday's foreign exchange market trading, buying sterling after it fell
below its permitted floor against the Portuguese escudo, which is the
strongest ERM currency.
The chancellor and the Bank governor were supported in their campaign by Sir
Jeremy Morse, chairman of Lloyds Bank.
Sir Jeremy said the pain inflicted by ERM discipline would have to be
endured to reach the goals the government wanted.
'We are suffering the same pain that other countries did years ago,' he
said. He poured cold water on the chances of a realignment of currencies in
the ERM, unlike Mr Pearse and Sir Denys, who urged the government to work
for such a move.
After losing about one pfennig against the D-Mark in early European trading,
the pound recovered to close unchanged in London at DM2.8425. It was at
DM2.8413 in late trading in New York.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Monopoly probe into British Gas: Company adopts high-risk
strategy by seeking inquiry after series of rows with regulator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SIMMERING row between British Gas and the industry regulator Ofgas
erupted into the open yesterday as Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, agreed to a comprehensive review of the UK gas market by the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
The surprise move, requested by British Gas, was triggered by disagreements
between Ofgas and British Gas over rates of return on the privatised
utility's pipeline and storage business. But it is the culmination of
several years of strained relations between British Gas and both Ofgas and
the Office of Fair Trading.
The utility said a series of regulatory changes imposed by the regulators
had 'made medium and long-term planning extremely difficult'. They had also
brought demands from customers and independent suppliers for more
consultation time on the effects of the changes.
Mr Cedric Brown asked Mr Heseltine for the referral yesterday morning - only
hours before he was due to take over as chief executive of British Gas
following the decision by Mr Robert Evans, chairman and chief executive, to
split the two roles.
It is the first time a privatised utility has opted to subject itself to an
MMC investigation.
British Gas is not the only utility to have had a turbulent relationship
with its regulator since the start of the privatisation process in the early
1980s. British Telecom, for example, has been to the brink of an MMC
referral but always drawn back.
For British Gas, it is a high-risk strategy which analysts suggested might
result in the break-up of the company. The government's decision to agree to
British Gas's request to be privatised as a single unit in 1986 is bound to
be questioned.
An MMC inquiry will mean nine months of intense scrutiny of all aspects of
British Gas's UK supply business and a period of prolonged uncertainty for
shareholders.
It was clear from the wording of the announcement that the government may
use the MMC report to change the terms of the Gas Act which privatised
British Gas in 1986. The Department of Trade and Industry said Mr Heseltine
would have powers to make changes 'in relation to conveyance and storage and
more widely'.
British Gas agreed to demands from the Office of Fair Trading earlier this
year to hive off its transportation and storage business into an arms-length
subsidiary by 1994, and to publish new pricing schedules for independent
shippers using British Gas pipelines by this September.
But it has insisted that tariffs should allow the company to earn a fair
rate of return on its pipeline assets  - which it says is 6.7 per cent on
existing assets, and 10.8 per cent on new investment. Otherwise, investment
in the pipeline by British Gas and its competitors could be threatened.
Mr Brown accused Sir James McKinnon, director-general of Ofgas, of 'ducking
the issue' and refusing even to consider raising the rate of return above
the current level of 4.5 per cent  - a move which might mean higher prices
for gas consumers.
'I have held three meetings with Sir James McKinnon during which we did not
even begin talking about the rate of return issue. He suggested this was
something that should be handled by the MMC.'
Mr Brown said that without agreement on the pipeline issue, it was
impossible to implement other agreements reached with the OFT and Ofgas in a
'piecemeal fashion'. He had therefore concluded the MMC should review the
whole gas market.
Mr John Dorken, deputy director-general of Ofgas, last night denied what he
called British Gas's 'misrepresentation'.
'It was quite clear that British Gas's proposals were unacceptable to us.
Our view was that rather than have a long, long debate about this, it was
better to have them debated by the MMC.'
Ofgas itself asked the MMC yesterday to investigate the transportation and
storage business, but its request was overtaken by Mr Heseltine's decision
to widen the inquiry.
British Gas agreed earlier this year to OFT demands to surrender 50 per cent
of its share of the industrial gas market to competitors by 1995, and to
hive off its pipeline business into a separate subsidiary.
It was angered by Ofgas's subsequent insistence that it should submit to a
tough formula limiting price rises for domestic customers to 5 per cent less
than the rate of inflation  - a formula which Sir James enforced in May by
threatening legal action against British Gas if it did not cut its prices.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Bangkok driven potty as traffic jams grow longer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DON'T LEAVE home without one  - a potty, that is  - drivers in Bangkok have
been warned. The Thai government also said they should take emergency
supplies of food and water.
This alarmist advice follows a week in which Thailand's capital, famous for
its traffic jams, excelled itself.
Nightmare snarl-ups paralysed the city for hours, stranded children at
school until after midnight and delayed international flights, prompting the
government to advise drivers to carry rations and chamber pots  - just in
case.
Commuters took up to six hours to drive a few miles; on most routes there is
no alternative to road transport.
At a school in north Bangkok parents started arriving to collect their
children at 11pm on Wednesday  - the last pupil left at 2am. The jams played
havoc with airline schedules because passengers and aircrew were unable to
reach the airport.
The immediate cause of the chaos was the monsoon rain, but the real culprits
are successive Thai governments which have doggedly refused to plan the
capital's growth or build public transport networks.
Wednesday evening's congestion, exacerbated by the flooding of the airport
road and by cars running out of petrol after hours of crawling through the
streets, was possibly the worst in the capital's history.
Bangkokians have developed a peculiar culture to deal with the physical and
mental strains of their predicament. Even people of relatively modest means
employ a driver and use the back seat of the car as a secondary office,
complete with newspapers, a mobile telephone and sometimes a television.
An invitation to lunch is followed by a period of delicate negotiation. Each
party attempts to name a restaurant close to their office, and the loser is
permitted to be late and to boast of the appalling traffic jam which trapped
them.
Traffic lights often add to the misery. Many are operated by hand, and one
set has been known to take 18 minutes to change.
Motorcycle taxi drivers have developed a lucrative trade, weaving in and out
of lines of stationary cars and buses.
But on Wednesday night, some commuters simply stopped at the nearest
restaurant and enjoyed an unscheduled meal while waiting for the roads to
clear.
Bangkok's traffic congestion threatens to choke the country's dynamic
economy. Some expatriates have moved to the more efficient and less polluted
island of Singapore, rather than struggle to reach meetings in Bangkok.
Work on two mass transit projects  - both including elevated railways - is
expected to start shortly, but it will be several years before they relieve
the congestion on the roads. In fact, the construction work will make
matters worse.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Brussels clears Twyford Down M-way scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX and ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE 20-YEAR battle to save Twyford Down in Hampshire ended in failure last
night as the European Commission gave the go-ahead to the government's
controversial scheme to extend the M3 motorway.
Brussels dropped legal actions against the Twyford Down project and four
other UK building projects for alleged breaches of EC environmental rules.
The move should reduce UK accusations that Brussels interferes too much in
environmental policy.
Brussels officials denied the decision marked a climbdown to avoid
embarrassing the UK during its presidency of the EC.
The other four projects are: the Channel Tunnel rail link, including the
King's Cross terminal in London; the M11 link road at Hackney, east London;
an incinerator at South Warwick Hospital; and a soft-drinks plant and
can-making factory at Brackmills, Northampton.
Last October the then-EC environment commissioner Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana
provoked a row between Brussels and London when he said work on the five
projects should be halted because surveys on the environmental impact,
required by a 1985 EC directive, had not been done.
The UK has since convinced the Commission that the environmental impact had
been adequately considered.
Mr David Croker, chairman of the Twyford Down Association, who has
campaigned to preserve the beauty spot, said :'It looks like the end of an
era.'
The European Commission still disagrees with London over the scope of EC
rules and yesterday moved toward bringing legal action against two other
construction projects where it says Britain did not follow proper procedure
 - the East London River Crossing through Oxleas Wood and the extension of a
British Petroleum refinery in the Scottish city of Falkirk.
Brussels will now issue a Reasoned Opinion  - the second of three steps
leading to a court case  - and will give the government two months to argue
that proper procedures were carried out. It could take Britain to the
European Court of Justice if agreement is not reached. Mr Michael Howard,
environment secretary, said: 'We strongly maintain that there has been no
breach of EC law.'

FT  01 AUG 92 / Lean times for a man with a taste for the grand style: The
insouciant Christian Lacroix, one of the last of a dying breed of
couturiers, speaks to Alice Rawsthorn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHRISTIAN Lacroix is clever, courteous, cultivated and charming, but also
one of the last of a dying breed. Lacroix is a fashion designer, not just
any old designer, but a Paris couturier in the grand style with an opulent
hotel particulier on the rue Faubourg Saint Honore where an atelier of
skilled seamstresses pore painstakingly over the designs he unveiled at his
haute couture show last Sunday.
Five years ago when Lacroix set up his couture house, the first to open in
Paris for over a decade, he was hailed as the bright young designer who was
going to breathe new life into high fashion. Today he is still in business
and last Sunday's show was a critical triumph. But it is almost
inconceivable that another new designer would be launched today in the same
grand style as Christian Lacroix.
'Times change,' he says serenely from the leafy garden of his hotel a few
doors away from the Elysee Palace. 'Five years ago we were living in an era
of luxury, Dallas, Dynasty and easy money. Fashion designers were style
dictators telling people what to wear. Today things are different. People
are less materialistic, more introspective. Designers must find a new role.'
Lacroix, 41, fell into fashion by accident. He was born in Arles in southern
France. His father was an engineer from protestant stock in the mountainous
Cevennes region, 'very strict, very sober, very moral', his mother's family
was Provencal, 'warm, exuberant, theatrical'.
He studied art history at university with the vague idea of becoming a
curator in the costume department of a museum. Design did not appeal at the
time. 'This was the early 1970s. My own style was a combination of Katmandu
hippy and Bloomsbury Bohemian. Designers did not seem relevant and I was
never interested in becoming an old-style couturier, a technician like
Balenciaga or Christian Dior.'
But by the mid-1970s a new group of young designers, led by Claude Montana
and Thierry Mugler, was emerging in Paris. A friend took him to see a Mugler
show. 'It was wonderful - like a 1940s movie. Mugler treated his collection
as a form of theatre to express his ideas. I had found what I wanted.'
Like most young designers he started off as a freelance. He had one contract
in Italy to make shoes for high class hookers and another in Japan designing
dresses for the princesses at the Imperial Palace. 'I was a mercenary. I
loved it.'
He made his name in the early 1980s through his funky couture collections
for Jean Patou, one of the more obscure Paris houses. In 1987 he was
introduced to Bernard Arnault, now chairman of LVMH, the global luxury goods
group, then a very ambitious young French businessman.
Arnault saw Lacroix as someone who could attain the same stature as the
great French fashion designers, Christian Dior and Coco Chanel. The
pay-back, or so he calculated, would come from the string of licensed
products, the scents, cosmetics and sunglasses, bearing the Lacroix name and
the cachet of his fashion collections.
At the time it all seemed to make sense. The luxury goods business was
booming. Lacroix looked like a role model for the modern fashion house with
Arnault taking care of the finances. He paid for everything from the
seamstresses' wages to the Garouste and Bonetti bill for the pink and orange
interior of the hotel. All Lacroix had to do was to deliver his collections
 -and lots of glossy photographs of his haut Bohemian lifestyle in the
fashion magazines - so that Arnault could market his elan.
Christian Lacroix kicked off with couture and then launched pret a porter.
He has since opened shops: the next opens on Monday on London's Sloane
Street. He has signed licences for everything from men's ties to women's
tights. Two years ago he, or rather Dior Parfums, another part of the
Arnault empire, launched C'est La Vie], the perfume with which his backer
hoped to recoup his Pounds 18m investment in the couture house.
In retrospect Arnault's timing could scarcely have been worse. Lacroix
staged his first couture collection in Paris to rave reviews in July 1987.
Three months later he took it to New York arriving on the eve of the stock
market collapse. 'We held the show in the Wall Street district. It was
terrible. There had been three suicides already that day. No-one was in the
mood for Parisian frivolity.'
Bernard Arnault has yet to see a single cent back from his investment. The
couture collection is still losing money and pret a porter has been fraught
with production problems. Most worrying of all, C'est La Vie], which has
cost LVMH Pounds 17.5m, is not a success.
'It's the recession,' says Lacroix. 'People talk about our losses, but
Bernard Arnault sees us as an investment, a long term investment. We always
knew we would lose money for the first five years. If it wasn't for the
recession we would be making money next year. Now, who knows?'
Beneath the veneer of insouciance he must be worried that Arnault could
decide to cut his losses and close the house of Lacroix. From time to time
the Paris fashion world ripples with rumours that Arnault is about to do
just that and to dispatch Lacroix to Christian Dior, another of his fashion
houses.
So far the rumours have proved unfounded. Arnault can have few complaints on
the creative front. Lacroix has his critics in the fashion press, but they
are easily outnumbered by his fans led by the redoubtable Suzy Menkes,
fashion editor of the International Herald Tribune, who faithfully flaunts
his gaudy suits from the front row of every show.
Moreover, as Arnault must be well aware, Lacroix is seen as an institution
in France, where fashion designers are feted as national treasures. Any
attempt at closing the house could be catastrophic for Arnault's public
image. He made a rare appearance at last Sunday's couture show as if to
signal his support for his designer. 'So far Bernard Arnault has had the
courage and vision to support us,' says Lacroix. 'Let's hope he continues.'
In the meantime, Lacroix is left to fulfil his side of the bargain, by
concentrating on design. This is a turbulent time for the fashion world. The
1980s was an era when everything, not only the economic environment, but
also the cultural climate of conspicuous consumption, seemed favourable to
fashion designers.
The climate has changed. Conspicuous consumption has faded, as much because
of environmental concerns as recession. The elitism of designer clothes is
as alien to today's 20 year-olds, the 'rave' generation, as it was to their
hippy predecessors, like Lacroix himself, in the early 1970s.
'There has been a return to the values of the early 1970s,' says Lacroix.
'People are no longer interested in clothes as status symbols, to show how
much money they have. Instead they see them as a form of self-expression. As
designers we have to use our instincts to interpret the new mood.'
So far the designers' response seems to have been to panic and to fling
themselves to ever-greater extremes of opulence. Fashion today is polarised
between basics, the functional jeans and T-shirts sold by The Gap, and the
fin de siecle excesses of designers such as Gianni Versace, Karl Lagerfeld
and, some say, Lacroix.
'People say it's immoral to make such expensive clothes at a terrible time
of recession, ecological catastrophes and war in Yugoslavia. But that's not
a valid issue. The reason my clothes cost so much is because they use
beautiful materials, velvets and silks, and are made by hand with great
skill. Those are timeless values, part of the French artisan tradition.'
It is this craftsmanship, he believes, that will enable the designers to
define a new direction. 'This is an era when people are concerned with
internal values and the quality of life. Couture is all about quality. I
would never claim that fashion is a form of art. It isn't. But I do believe
that you can get as much aesthetic pleasure from a beautiful piece of
couture embroidery as a fine painting or a piece of sculpture. Fashion's
role in the 1990s is to explore those rituals.'
He may be right. But even if he is, fashion designers seem destined to play
a more marginal role in the 1990s, than in the 1980s, with less influence
over fashion trends and less appeal to investors.
If Lacroix was starting off today he would find it very difficult to
persuade anyone to set him up in his own house, run in the grand style. For
all his talent, he would be more likely to be struggling as an independent,
or to be designing under someone else's name as he did at Patou.
Christian Lacroix was lucky in meeting the right man, Bernard Arnault, at
the right time, just before the recession. 'I need the grand style. Some
designers can work from tiny rooms running up dresses in cheap fabric and
showing them in disused metro stations. Not me. It's the rituals and the
tradition of a big house that inspires me. And fashion is the only thing I
can do. I don't have the talent for anything else.'

FT  01 AUG 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Off to the circus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TEARS rolled down my face as the Olympic opening ceremony in Barcelona
pulsed towards its climax last Saturday. Of course it was bread and
circuses, an astoundingly expensive show choreographed and paid for by some
of the top brains on Earth - Washington, the CIA, Peking, Kodak, Coca-Cola,
Reebok - so as to keep our minds off the woes that wrack our planet.
But I am a sucker for a circus. 'Look at this, Miss Lee,' I shouted as my
executive assistant entered from the garden where she is supervising the
erection of a small Greek temple. 'The Spaniards have done us proud. This is
mankind at his finest - 21 goosebumps-per-minute in a show costing millions
and beamed out to all of us, billions of us little people, sitting in our
homes. They are worshipping the old gods. We are reverting to our roots. The
planet is going pagan.'
Miss Lee was non-committal, but the energy and oomph of the opening ceremony
were still paramount in my mind on Thursday when I was summoned to Barcelona
by the UK sports minister, who is lurking in a villa high in the hills to
the west of the Olympic city.
I did not catch his name, but I was sure it was the sports minister because
the topic of our meeting was how to handle the Manchester Olympic Games
eight years from now, assuming that Manchester, which is somewhere north of
London, succeeds in its bid to stage them. The minister was wearing a
variety of sports equipment, including streamlined pixie shoes borrowed from
the British cycling squad.
'Hurry up, Julian,' he shouted at his secretary as Julian served mineral
water. Julian is a taekwondo black belt and a member of the Young
Conservatives.
'Right, Michael,' said the sports minister from behind his fencing mask.
'Chop-chop, quickie-lickie. Tell me, in 200 words, how Manchester can trump
Barcelona when Britain stages the millennial Olympics in 2000. Forget the
tedious sport. What about the opening ceremony? John Major is giving me
untold millions to secure the Games for Manchester. He'll want his money's
worth. Do you think this drugs business will foul Britain's chances?'
'Certainly not,' I said. 'Drugs are complicated. Who is to say what's what.
As for Manchester's opening ceremony, you Tories can score a massive PR
coup, for yourselves and for Britain.
'Take sports technology. Britain leads the world. This week's jubilation
over Chris Boardman's superbike was not a flash or fluke. I have been
talking to the manufacturers. Britain is poised for a golden breakthrough in
all Olympic sports. Have you heard about our Stealth javelin? It flies out
of the stadium. Or our breakthrough discus? Our leading-edge archery bow or
our carbopolyphilla-333 arrows? Our 21st century yachting keels? Our
hush-hush rifle with antigrav sights in which Nato is sorely interested? The
new British volleyball? Handball? Tennis ball? Boxing glove? Sabre?
Swimwear? Hockey stick?'
The minister was scribbling furiously; Julian had started to whoop.
'Some of these British inventions are still in pre-production, but others
are set to roll. At the Seoul Olympics four years ago, minister, Britain
finished 12th out of 160 nations on the medal table. But my projections show
that by the time of the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, Britain will be equipped
to win 78 per cent of all available medals. Four years after that: 96 per
cent.
'This technological majesty must star in the Manchester show. And it is not
just sports equipment. There is plenty more to make a fuss about - Britain's
achievements down the ages as well as our current renaissance.
'It was Britain that smashed the atom, invented the egg-timer and the
roulette wheel. Also the double-boiler. We invented almost everything.
Britain leads the space race. We are discovering miracle processes faster
than the Japanese. Our wine makers are peerless, our fashion better than
Paris's, our film industry eclipsing Hollywood. And what about our songs?
'Norman Lamont is right, you know. He gets a bad press because of his
blow-wave. But there are green shoots everywhere. We're not having a
recession, just a bit of a pause.'
The minister was stupefied. He said: 'Can you stay to dinner?'
''Fraid not,' I said. 'Must catch a plane. Governor Clinton needs me.'

FT  01 AUG 92 / Cleaner Thames tempts salmon to return - after 150 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS pleasant, when sauntering across Southwark Bridge to or from that
palace of learning and culture which is the Financial Times' headquarters,
to think that, somewhere in the murky Thames' water swirling beneath one's
feet, the silver Atlantic salmon is running again. The appreciation is
purely mental, unfortunately. You are as likely to see a salmon there as a
mermaid. But not so far upstream, at Molesey, in Surrey, they have been
popping up in the National Rivers Authority fish trap in numbers which
gladden the hearts of those who have worked long and hard to bring the
salmon back.
The whole thing is a minor modern miracle in view of the fact that London's
filth had blocked the salmon's way for almost 150 years. Early in Victorian
times, the river was no more than an open sewer until an event known as the
Great Stink inspired a revolution. A huge raft of suspended faeces came to
rest beneath the windows of parliament.
The upshot was the construction of the capital's first sewerage scheme,
designed by Sir Joseph Bazalgette. But it was not until after the Second
World War that the marvellous transformation of the Thames began  - one
which should compel admiration throughout continental Europe, where, by and
large, the degradation of the great rivers has continued unabated.
Having made the river clean enough for salmon, the old Thames Water
Authority decided that salmon there should be. It wanted - understandably,
if vaingloriously - to show off what it had done.
The task was immense. To establish a self-sustaining run of salmon, much
more than clean water is needed. In particular, the fish has to be able to
make its way up-river to spawn at the time of year when it feels the need.
Having got there, it must be able to find suitable spawning grounds.
Standing in its way, however, were more than 40 weirs. It was essential to
build fish passes - but these cost anything up to Pounds 60,000 each and the
scientists reckoned that - at the very least - they would have to be
installed in the 22 weirs up to Reading, west of London, for the project to
have any chance of success. So, five years ago a charity, Thames Salmon
Trust, was set up to raise the money.
Enlightened souls such as Sir James Goldsmith and companies like Shell and
Siebe, have put their hands in their pockets. So far, a dozen passes are in
place, and others are on the way. At the same time, the NRA has continued
its work in enhancing the gravel beds suitable for spawning, and introducing
juvenile stock.
How admirable and plausible it all sounds. But grave doubts linger. The
target of the Thames project is to achieve a run of 1,000 fish a year. When
you consider that on a river like the Moy, in the west of Ireland, something
like 10,000 salmon are caught each year on rod and line, it can be seen how
modest the ambition was.
Yet, in 20 years it has come nowhere near to being realised. In the best
year, 1988, the run approached 500. Last year, the confirmed total was 59.
This is no fault of the scientists, who have done their utmost; nor of the
Thames Salmon Trust. The causes have been the general fall in the numbers of
Atlantic salmon and the successive years of drought. This summer's healthier
flows have encouraged a distinct improvement in the migration.
It is, however, worth asking what the benefits would be if a run of 1,000
fish a year was established. In sporting terms it would be almost nil, since
the fish would still be too scarce to repay serious angling. Any value would
be principally symbolic. It would tell people that something has been done.
At what cost, though?
The fish passes up to Reading will have cost around Pounds 1m when
completed. The NRA's continuing budget adds up to another Pounds 1m over 10
years. And all this to nurture and cosset a fish which even those who live
by the river are most unlikely ever to see. It is impossible not to
speculate on what could be done with such resources to save whole rivers
from extinction.
And yet and yet. Having raised the objections, I confess that I am still
undecided. Reason suggests that the whole idea was a pipe dream and should
have remained such. But having come so far, and having expended such effort,
it would seem a terrible shame not to go on, even if circumstances do
eventually conspire to sabotage the project. And, yes, it is cheering, even
inspiring, to think of this marvellous creature fighting its way against the
odds and the current through the heart of London, as it did two centuries
ago.
The Thames Salmon Trust is anxious to attract individual and corporate
sponsors for the fish pass programme. Inquiries to Major John Hyslop, Kings
Meadow House, Kings Meadow Road, Reading, Berkshire (tel: 0734-535-544).

FT  01 AUG 92 / The case for lateral thinking: Richard Tomkins pulls the
drawstrings on the public purse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS

<TEXT>
THE 1980s epic Raise The Titanic cost Dollars 36m to make, but it was not a
successful film. In fact, it turned into one of the biggest box office
turkeys of all time. Afterwards Lord Grade, the showbiz magnate who made it,
famously observed that it would have been cheaper to lower the Atlantic.
A decade later, as the British economy flounders, we need more of Lord
Grade's lateral thinking if growing public spending is to be brought under
control.
The trouble is, most people in Britain are useless at lateral thinking. To
take an obvious example, everyone knows it is cheaper to put a sailing boat
on a low-loader lorry and park it in a central London car park than to berth
it in a Solent marina. But drive into the underground car park behind John
Lewis in Oxford Street any day of the week, and what do you find it full of?
Cars.
In one sense, civil servants are an exception to this rule: they are highly
imaginative when it comes to spending more money. When asked to save it,
however, they tend to revert to type. Thus it is incumbent on the rest of us
to help the chancellor find the spending cuts he needs.
A good starting place might be the defence ministry. To cancel Britain's
one-third share in the Pounds 20bn European Fighter Aircraft project would
jeopardise 40,000 jobs, it is said. But if employment is the best reason for
going ahead with the project, you do not need Lord Grade to tell you that it
would make more sense to give the 40,000 workers Pounds 100,000 each to
start up their own businesses, and keep the Pounds 2.7bn change.
And what of that Pounds 10bn folly, the Trident submarine? Investing sums as
vast as this in countering the submarines of the former Soviet bloc is
surely insanity when, for a fraction of the cost, you could buy the former
Soviet fleet and scrap it.
Next might come the Department of Social Security. Some Pounds 26bn a year
is spent on old-age pensions. Clearly this is an area where the search for
economies needs to be balanced with compassion: subsidising the provision of
hazardous sports for the elderly, for example, might be regarded as
distasteful. On a more populist note, however, the welfare budget could be
slashed by offering 'new age' travellers and drop-outs Pounds 1,000 each and
a ticket to the foreign destination of their choice provided they promised
never to come back.
After that, the criminal justice system. Whoever came up with the idea of
criminalising crime committed a catastrophic blunder: far from restricting
its spread, all it has succeeded in doing is driving it underground. It is
time to recognise this mistake and legalise crime. If the Pounds 8bn a year
saved by the abolition of the criminal justice system were to be
redistributed among potential wrong-doers, they would be so busy spending
the money that they would lack both the time and inclination to offend.
In fact, there is barely an area of government policy where you cannot find
scope for whopping savings. Take transport: some branch lines are so heavily
subsidised that it would be cheaper to close them and put chauffeur-driven
limousines at the disposal of their passengers. Education? It surely makes
sense to match the number of university places with the demand for graduates
instead of stuffing people's heads with useless knowledge. The arts? Cut the
colossal subsidies to opera by offering everyone turning up at Covent Garden
Pounds 50 to go away and have a nice meal instead. Economic forecasting?
Save money and improve accuracy by sacking the Treasury economists and
replacing them with someone flipping a coin. (At least he would get it half
right).
Maybe these suggestions sound barmy. But back in the 1980s, people used to
say that the coal and steel industries consumed such huge subsidies that it
would be cheaper to pay their employees to stay at home. So what happened?
We did. And what merriment there was when someone suggested it might be
cheaper to pay farmers to stop growing things than to go on subsidising the
production of food that could not be sold. No one is laughing now.
If Britain's economy is to be put back on an even keel, therefore, the
imagination must be given its head. And to those who criticise lateral
thinking as bogus, I say only this: if that kind of blinkered, small-minded
attitude had prevailed at the beginning of the century, the Titanic might
never have been built.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Arts: Five go to the Olympics - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By B A YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RADIO 5 has the answer to those of us who have been wondering what exactly
it was for: Five at the Olympics, every day of the week from 6.30 am to 10
pm, not only covers the Barcelona activities, it helps keep them off the
other networks.
The five are Danny Baker, Ross King, Caron Keating, Terry Wogan and John
Inverdale, each, no doubt, with athletic inside knowledge; but I shall
follow the great displays by the professional amateurs and amateur
professionals only through the news bulletins.
The Message and the Media is a promising four-part series that began on
Radio 4 on Wednesday, presented by Sheena McDonald. The first programme,
Received Wisdom, dealt with the basic problem: whether the news provided by
the media was the news wanted by readers and viewers. Sir David English of
the Daily Mail allowed frankly that his choice of news depended on the
extent it might influence sales. Max Hastings, editor of the Telegraph, is
for stories to interest readers content with the world as it is. Simon
Jenkins, retiring editor of The Times, is for the provocation of discussion.
The electronic media take a more universal attitude. The BBC's Kate Adie
wants every viewer to have the best chance of appreciating her reports; Nick
Pollard of News at Ten presents one view to all groups from ABs to
hypothetical EFs, which is much the same. John Birt, the BBC's Crown Prince,
reckons that in a half-hour bulletin you do your best, and rely on
supporting programmes for those who need more.
The previous evening, Radio 4 gave us Inside Kosovo. Kosovo is an Albanian
enclave in Serbia, and Melanie Friend's report from Pristina, the capital,
was full of familiar reports - professors sacked at the university, doctors
at the hospitals, young men recruited for the Serbian army, 60 days'
detention for hearing Albanian music on tapes. A refugee in London
complained that she lived worse here than in Kosovo, for all her money went
to family in Albania. At which target is this kind of news directed?
Radio 4 believes as strongly as Radio 1 in the magic of familiar voices.
Over the last three weeks, Stephen Pile Investigates has queried the social
value of sermons, the chance of predicting the future, the life of
journalists, though Pile himself is not a padre, a prophet or a reporter,
just a voice. What he investigates is how much other people know, and this
week he asked about learning foreign languages. This is specially
interesting, for nowadays foreign diplomats, politicians, casuals in crowds,
often speak English on television that is fluent, even idiomatic. Do our own
representatives do as well on the foreign screens?
Stephen Pile is no help to monoglots. After some small talk, he was
introduced to the Vector method, involving inter-active laser-vision, and
made a deliberate ass of himself. No problem, anyway; Sir Alfred Sherman
told him that since English was virtually universal, we had no need to learn
anything else. The very ambitious might try Japanese or Arabic for
commercial purposes. The BBC used to give language lessons. With respect to
Sir Alfred, I wish it still did. Languages are used for other things beside
commerce.
I warned that Radio 3 would offer another 'Unmade Movie', and we got A Night
at the Wasteland, by David Stafford. It told of TS Eliot's script for the
Marx Brothers, and if I tell you that Chico addressed Eliot as Mr Elephant
you may assess the standard of fun. The director was Jeremy Howe, in charge
of Radio 3 drama.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Arts: Sculpture of the 'savages' - Susan Moore admires a
Parisian celebration of Black African art
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE 19th century, the Nazarenes in Germany and the Pre-Raphaelites and
their precursors in England looked to the art of the so-called Primitives as
a means of regenerating the art - and society - of the present. In panels
and frescoes painted before the invention of complex illusionistic devices
of lighting and perspective, they found a sincerity and vigour deemed
lacking in contemporary art. The group of 'Primitifs' in JL David's studio
in Paris had similarly rejected the polished classicism of their day and
advocated a return to a simpler form of art.
A century later, comparable reaction to the facile virtuosity of Salon
painting and the over-attenuated decadence of Art Nouveau prompted the Paris
avant-garde to appropriate African sculpture. Its formal language and
expressive power provided a way out of the perceived impasse of Western
realism.
To ethnologists such as the late William Fagg, it was a 'rude
misappropriation'. The Modernists had never been interested in learning from
the tribal art that was gradually filling up the new ethnographical museums
of Europe. They had simply seized on one of the most conservative and
traditional of arts to serve their anarchic and iconoclastic ends.
Certainly the Fauves, Cubists and members of Der Blaue Reiter seemed to care
little about the function or significance of African sculpture, or to
distinguish between works of art and something knocked out for the tourist
trade. It is, however, primarily thanks to these artists that objects which
were initially viewed as curiosities or artefacts made their way out of the
ethnographical museum and into the art gallery. In 1920, the critic Roger
Fry, reviewing an exhibition of Negro art in London, probably spoke for an
entire shocked and bedazzled generation when he felt forced to admit that
so-called savages had produced sculpture that was greater than anything
produced here, even during the Middle Ages.
It is purely on aesthetic grounds that we are invited to admire the 65
choice pieces of Black African sculpture selected by Ezio Bassani currently
on loan to the Musee Dapper in Paris. This exhibition, a version of that
shown at the Forte Belvedere in Florence in 1989, is not meant to be
comprehensive or didactic. It is a celebration of masterpieces.
To that end, considerable care has been taken to show each piece to its best
advantage, in both this beautifully, if somewhat theatrically lit exhibition
and in its lavish catalogue. (Le Grand Heritage: Sculptures de L'Africa
Noire, Fondation Dapper, FFr263).
This delectable visual feast opens with a small section of ancient or early
sculptures, from Akan terracotta heads and Benin bronzes to the extravagant
Afro-Portuguese ivory salts made by the Sapi peoples in Sierra Leone
1490-1530. Disappointingly, there is not one of the great Ife heads that
rank among the finest sculptures ever made. The first of many compensations
is the imposing and imaginatively stylised Nok terracotta head from
500BC-AD200 Nigeria, glinting with the specks of mica ingeniously fired in
its clay. Its technical sophistication seems even more wondrous when one
realises that this head was probably once part of a life-size figure.
Such is the innate vitality of these and many of the more recent figures and
masks that they seem to be imbued with a life of their own. It makes no
difference whether the sculpture is naturalistic and particularly expressive
of personality, or simplified and abstracted to the austere geometries of
Mbole and Ngbaka wooden masks and to the Mahongwe and Kota bronze reliquary
figures from Gabon. No wonder the Modernists looked on covetously.
The representation of the human figure is the predominant theme of African
sculpture. We find ancestor figures created to make contact with the world
of the dead and to affirm the right to land or power, and images of spirits
or divinities which are characterised by their frontality, a rigorous
symmetry and, not infrequently, a considerable serenity and dignity. It is
in the ritual masks, however, that the sculptors seem to be allowed their
greatest freedom of expression.
Bassani has purposely restricted his selection in order to demonstrate the
richly varied modes of expression adopted by individual ethnic groups. The
show is, more generally, glorious witness to the African sculptors' formal
inventiveness and to his instinctive ability to conceive form in three
dimensions, emphasising or diminishing volume at whim to create the desired
rhythm and effect.
A piece such as the remarkable Bangwa seated figure from Cameroon, like all
the best sculptures, is interesting from almost every angle and compels us
around it. The sculptor showed no qualms about massively elongating the
heavily bangled left arm that supports the head: he wanted his figure to
remain appropriately erect.
Perhaps even more extraordinary to our Modernist-trained eyes is the economy
of the top of a headpiece used by members of the Ogbom secret society, where
the figure's torso and flanking arms are reduced to three parallel arcs of
wood of equal width. There is comparably sophisticated use of 'negative'
space in a Kwele mask framed by band of light and air, and in the Mbole
figures from Zaire.
The latter were hung up on walls as a warning to young initiates of what
would befall them if they betrayed the secrets of their 'Lilwa' society.
Torso, arms and legs have been pared down to the narrowest of rough, tubular
forms. The verticality of these male figures, and the sharp angles of neck,
shoulder, arm and knee joints convincingly evoke the posture of hanged men.
Le Grand Heritage continues at the Musee Dapper, 50 avenue Victor Hugo,
75116 Paris, until September 15. Tel: (1) 45 00 01 50.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Arts: Fast forward to the end of the world - Video
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DARK thought occurred to me at the Irn-Bru Pop Video Exhibition, which has
just opened at London's Museum of the Moving Image. Is the world seeing its
whole cultural history flash before it, processed into these bite-size
hallucinations, much as a drowning person is treated to a short, dramatic
'pop video' of his past life?
Many of us today are worried by the fact that the planet Earth is about to
open its mouth to its doctor and say '1999,' possibly followed by 'Aaargh.'
Pre-millennial tension is a natural human condition. The rise of the pop
video is part of it: symbolic of a shortening of the spiritual breath before
the numbers change to 2000.
The MOMI exhibition will show you what I mean. A dozen screens glower in
darkened corners, issuing crazed staccato images of life and death, sex and
smoke, Madonna and Michael Jackon. Nor is this walpurgisnacht screen culture
confined to the pop video. The month's new feature film releases on video
show that we have entered an age not so much of the short attention span as
of the hunger for audio-visual tyranny.
Batman (Warners) is now available to pushbutton viewers, timed to coincide
with Batman Returns at the cinemas. Both are drowning-person movies par
excellence. Never mind leisurely exposition or patient filling-in of
character: the screen explodes with cackling guest stars, runaway production
design and multi-megaton special effects.
The video version of Batman is on widescreen format - hurrah] - which at
least makes the strident virtuosity more bearable. Your eyes can roam a
little around the mayhem. For another facet of the pre-millennial moving
image is that we are mostly told what to see, perhaps on the principle that
drowning people have no say in what flashes before them.
This tendency is evident in films as diverse as this month's My Girl
(Columbia), The Butcher's Wife (CIC) and Dead Again (CIC). Made for the
large screen, they play as if made for the small. We are hustled through the
plots with heads held still while the cast stand at stage-front enacting
their one-dimensional dramas of sentimental growing pain (My Girl),
clairvoyant whimsy (The Butcher's Wife) or amnesiac murder mystery (Dead
Again).
In former movie eras, before films had to anticipate a second life on
television, the screen image could be a fresco. The eye could wander around
a John Ford landscape or an Orson Welles cityscape, foraging for details.
Today, the threat of emptying cinemas and homes equipped with fast-forward
buttons puts pressure on film-makers to hold the viewer's attention at all
costs, if necessary in a vice.
Let me illustrate the negative effect of this by citing one positive moment
in The Butcher's Wife. The scene caused incredulous joy at the press show I
attended. While psychiatrist Jeff Daniels and another character discuss an
important plot point in a foreground doorway, Daniels's unoccupied patient
in the background performs some quiet, inventively eccentric funny business
with a mask. The shock of being allowed to take in two zones of action at
once in a modern Hollywood movie made everyone in the audience guffaw with
nervous delight.
But drowning persons are allowed few such moments of questing contemplation.
For these you must turn from modern Hollywood to the art film sector of the
video market, now growing fast enough to offer a serious home-viewing
alternative. August's treats include Robert Bresson's L'Argent (Artificial
Eye), a majestically gnomic murder tale from the director of Pickpocket, the
Tavianis' harshly powerful Padre Padrone (Artificial Eye) and from Australia
Jane Campion's Sweetie (Electric).
This last is a tale of family and personal breakdown couched at times in the
language of non-sequiturs and surrealism we associate with pop videos. But
there is a human story, and there are slower passages between the scherzos
in which we can think about that story. That is the difference - a rapidly
disappearing one in our countdown culture - between viewing images and
drowning in them.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Arts: A ragbag of riches for the Beaubourg's birthday -
Alice Rawsthorn tackles an ambitious, multi-layered exhibition to celebrate
15 years of the Pompidou Centre in Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'HEY, it's Zoo TV,' said the teenage tourist on spotting the arch of video
screens piled on top of each other at the entrance to the top floor of the
Manifeste exhibition at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris.
He was both right and wrong. Wrong, because the video arch is not a relic
from this summer's Zoo TV rock tour by U2, the Irish rock band, but a video
installation made in 1985 by Nam June Paik, the South Korean artist. But he
was right in that Paik was undoubtedly an important influence over the video
artists working on the U2 tour, and Manifeste is all about tracing links
between different strands in modern art. If Nam June Paik's ideas began in
an art gallery and ended up on a rock stage - so be it.
Manifeste commemorates the 15th birthday of Beaubourg, as the Pompidou
centre is usually called. It is intended to be both a retrospective of the
art collected by the centre since its opening and a statement of intent for
the future from Dominique Bozo, who became Beaubourg's president last
autumn.
The show's logistics are exhausting. Manifeste, which runs throughout the
summer, acts out Beaubourg's dual roles as France's national museum of
modern art and its centre of industrial creation. The exhibition encompasses
architecture, design, video and photography, painting and sculpture, in a
show stretching over 7,000 square metres on six floors.
One of Manifeste's main aims is to introduce Beaubourg's new architecture
collection. The curators have sensibly steered clear of trying to present a
thorough overview of contemporary architecture and have instead concentrated
on specific subjects, such as the sculptural work of Frank Gehry and Aldo
Rossi, and the new emphasis on modern materials pursued by the younger
architects, Rem Koolhaus and Jean Nouvel.
The results are erratic. The intricate models for Toyo Ito's Tower of Winds
at Yokohama and his Silver Hut in Tokyo are stunning. The presentation of
Jean Nouvel's new tower at the La Defense business district to the west of
Paris really succeeds in conveying a sense of what the tower, which will be
the tallest in the world, with an opaque black base and transparent top,
will look like when it is built. Other exhibits, particularly the tatty
cardboard mock-up of Frank Gehry's American cultural centre in Paris, are
too slight to say anything significant about the architects, or their work.
The curators have made an honourable attempt to explain why particular
architects, or buildings, were selected. Sir Norman Foster's Hong Kong &amp;
Shanghai Bank headquarters is singled out for the complexity of its
construction and Ito's municipal museum at Yatsushiro for what it says about
his ideas on museology.
But the exhibition fails to address the central issue of how to show
buildings in a museum context. It adopts the conventional approach of
displaying buildings in model form, sometimes backed up by sketches. The
limitations of architectural models are all too apparent, notably in the
model of Richard Rogers and Renzo Piano's design for Beaubourg itself, which
makes the Pompidou centre look like a serene study in white plastic, not the
bright, bustling building housing the show.
The same criticism can be levelled against the design section. Design, like
architecture, is notoriously difficult to exhibit. Manifeste rounds up the
usual suspects for a whistlestop tour of modern product design, running from
Joe Columbo and his fellow futurists in the 1960s, to the post-modernist
puns of Philippe Starck in the 1980s. Their work is displayed on pristine
white plinths, along the lines pioneered by the Museum of Modern Art's
design department in New York and since faithfully imitated by most other
design exhibitions.
The problem with this approach is that it gives little or no idea of the
context in which the design was developed, or of how it was used. In a
crowded show like Manifeste, where there is only enough space for a limited
selection of each designers' output, it leaves no room to consider how a
particular piece relates to the rest of the designers' work, or its
influence on other designers.
Manifeste is most successful with design when it abandons the conventions
and adopts a more playful approach. The design section is spread across two
floors. Some exhibits on the lower floor are encased by walls and are only
visible through overhead shafts on the upper floor and slim vertical slits
running down the walls below.
From the top the exhibits look bewilderingly abstract. A polyurethane
library by Gaetano Pesce, the experimental Italian designer, resembles a
volcanic overspill; a red plastic table designed by Annie Tribel for a Paris
cafe looks like a minimalist sculpture. Then there is a delicious sense of
the illicit when you see them at a normal angle through the slits.
Design and architecture apart, Manifeste is chiefly concerned with painting,
sculpture, video art and installations. Beaubourg's permanent collection of
modern art until 1960 has been kept intact on the fourth floor, the core of
the show is its selection of work from the last three decades.
Dominique Bozo is adamant that Manifeste is not an attempt to present
Beaubourg's definitive statement on art since 1960, but an idiosyncratic
selection from its collection. The problem with this is that it makes it
difficult for the show to seem like anything other than a motley assortment
of important, and not so important, work from the 1960s to the present day.
Manifeste works best when bodies of work are gathered together in logical
groupings within which the work of one artist relates to that of the rest.
The most successful section is that devoted to the Arte povera and Antiform
movements on the mezzanine floor.
The juxtaposition of naturalistic pieces, Richard Long's Cornish slate stone
circle and Jannis Kounellis' raw wool on wooden poles, with Mario Merz's
neon-encrusted 'igloo' of earth-filled sacks works wonderfully under the
ducts and piping that criss-cross the industrial interior of the Pompidou
centre.
Similarly, the Fluxus is successful because the main installations - Plight,
a series of rooms swathed in thick rolls of felt by Joseph Beuys, and Moon
is the Oldest TV, another video sculpture by Nam June Paik - are so strong
that they grab the visitors' attention.
The rest of the show is so vast and so varied that it is difficult to do
anything other than focus on the few really stunning pieces - a beautiful
Baselitz oil on the top floor, a nearby wall sculpture of metal boxes by
Christian Boltanksi, Marcel Broodthaers' room installation or the space
allocated to the German painters, Sigmar Polke and Gerhard Richter - while
zapping past the others.
Manifeste is too crowded and confusing to achieve Dominique Bozo's aim of
being a testimony to Beaubourg's past and a pointer to its future. It is
really a ragbag of art - some good, some bad, much of it indifferent. But
there are enough good pieces to make it worth while taking a deep breath and
scouring the six floors of Centre Georges Pompidou to stride past the dross
and seek out the very best of the Beaubourg collection.
Manifeste is showing at the Centre Georges Pompidou, rue Rambuteau, 75003
Paris, until the autumn. Open weekdays 12pm to 10pm and weekends 10am to
10pm. Closed Tuesdays.

HAUNTS OF THE BLACK MASSEUR by Charles Sprawson Jonathan Cape Pounds 15.99,
307 pages
SEVEN-TENTHS by James Hamilton-Paterson Hutchinson Pounds 16.99, 269 pages
HERE ARE two books for the beach, celebrating as they do - in different ways
 -swimming and the sea. Charles Sprawson's Haunts of the Black Masseur is,
despite its opaque and inappropriate title (teasingly half-explained on page
255), straightforwardly a history and celebration of mankind's pleasure in
the water.
It apparently began life as an article and turning it into a book has left
stretch-marks: some repetition and too many long outlines of the plots of
novels that deal with swimming. Clearly, Sprawson has read virtually
everything on the subject, which makes it shameful that there is neither
index nor bibliography.
That said, there is much to learn and enjoy - and some splendid photographs.
As with so many human activities, the Classical period (especially Rome with
its 800 public baths) represents a high point. Then came the Dark Ages,
lasting in this case right up to the Romantics, during which most people
regarded swimming as very eccentric.
But with Goethe, Byron, Shelley, et al, it took off again and has never
looked back. For the Romantics and their followers, swimming and the sea
symbolised many things: heroic challenge, taken up by Byron in the
Hellespont; liberation from the pressures of bourgeois life (until well on
in the 19th century everyone swam naked); return to nature and the womb (in
spite of Shelley's obsession with bathing and sailing, he never learned to
swim, courting death through leaky boats and wild seamanship until he found
it).
In the 19th century, the English dominated swimming, using the
breast-stroke, which had been universal since the dog-paddle disappeared in
Elizabethan times. (It was common to learn to swim in the study, watching a
frog in a bowl). Then came the crawl, and with it the 20th century has
belonged to the other Anglo-Saxon nations and the Japanese. This century has
also produced the diver and magnificent feats of daring and beauty, linking
aquatics to art and show-business. Finally, Sprawson nicely chronicles for
us the explosion of the private pool, both grand and domestic, and a return
to the ubiquitous sybaritism of the Romans.
James Hamilton-Paterson ranges more widely in Seven-Tenths (another opaque
title, whose explanation is that seven-tenths of both the human body and the
surface of the globe is water). There is swimming in this book too - through
it runs a haunting autobiographical motif of a swimmer in mid-ocean who has
drifted out of sight of his boat. But there is much else.
A confessed non-scientist, Hamilton-Paterson is engagingly fascinated by the
history of scientists' attempts to understand the sea and its creatures. He
enjoys and is enjoyable on the subject of persistent misconceptions.
For decades after everyone concerned should have known better, the view
persisted that water became so dense at deeper levels that sinking ships and
human bodies would remain suspended some way above the bottom. For a long
time, it was theoretically shown (completely wrongly) that no life was
possible in deep layers of the ocean. The author gives an exciting account
of the heroic descents by William Beebe and others in small contraptions
they built themselves and of the wonderful things they saw. There is a
scientific detective story about coral reefs and how they were formed. As so
often, it turns out that Darwin got it more or less right.
Hamilton-Paterson is good on wrecks; the fascination they exert and the
obsessive nature of the searches for them. After Robert Ballard finally
succeeded in his quest for the Titanic he said: 'In a way, I am sad we found
her'.
What gives the book its special quality is the author's elegiac tone, his
continuous musing on the emotional, ethical and psychological aspects of the
subjects he discusses. There is a moving account of the USS Arizona, a
warship sunk at Pearl Harbour which has not been raised but left as a
uniquely dignified war memorial ('the only example of a monument which is
viewed from above'). We are treated to a persuasive theory that the famous
Caribbean pirates were homosexuals to a man. Then the discussion slides to
modern pirates in the Philippines and the symbiotic relationship they have
with the nomadic sea-people on whom they prey. And then to the nature of
nomads and the loss to the human spirit which will be sustained when such
people finally disappear from the world.
The book indeed is primarily about loss. There are some passionate and
well-documented attacks on the current spoliation of the ocean (the chapter
on trawler-fishing in the North Sea is particularly horrifying). But the
general tone is more subtle. It is well encapsulated by the only incident
quoted in both books under revaew As early as 1907 Edmund Gosse lamented
that no one would ever again see the wonderful world of the seaside
rock-pools which his famous naturalist father had described so beautifully
and reverently 50 years before, but which had then been destroyed by the
invasion of amateur collectors stimulated by that very account.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Arts: Celebrating Shelley - the times and the places
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ENGLAND'S response to the bi-centenary of the birth of one of its greatest
poets has been various and disparate - so unlike the official brouhaha that
surrounded last year's Rimbaud centenary in France. There have been many
lectures and readings up and down the country, some accompanied by music.
Oxford's Bodleian Library has been hosting a Shelley bi-centenary
exhibition, which runs until August 8. West Sussex County Council declared
May 20 a Shelley Vegetarian School Meals Day in commemoration of the poet's
vegetarianism. The Council has also published a Shelley Trail Guide,
'pinpointing places of interest in Sussex linked with Shelley and his
family.' In April a permanent Shelley Room was opened at Horsham Museum. At
Eton, Shelley's old school, speeches were delivered in his honour on April
23.
The occasion that Shelley's shade is likely to have enjoyed the most was the
Byron Society's dinner in his honour in the House of Lords on March 20,
addressed by the Tory Peer Lord Blake; a more kindred spirit can scarcely be
imagined. And on the day of the bicentenary itself, August 4, the National
Portrait Gallery in London will host a tribute to the poet.
Overseas, in April an exhibition of Shelley manuscripts opened at the New
York Public Library under the title Shelley: Poet and Legislator, and that
continues into September. In May a three-day international conference of
Shelley scholars examined the poet's legacy at New York's City University
Graduate Center.
Celebrations in Rome (where the poet's ashes are buried), many organised by
the Keats-Shelley Memorial Association with support from the British Council
and Penguin Italia, have included a series of readings, lectures and films,
and these will continue throughout the year. In Lerici, the May Poetry
festival offered an evening boat trip in his memory - without, on this
occasion, significant loss of life.
All details of this year's Shelley celebrations world-wide can be obtained
(send an SAE) from the Keats-Shelley Memorial Association, Flat 1, 33
Aberdeen Road, London N5 2UG.
Publishers have also pulled out a few stops. The Hardy scholar Desmond
Hawkins published a biographical account of Shelley's First Love (Margaret
Harriet Grove) in May (Kyle Cathie, Pounds 14.99). Those fond of the
fictionalised saga might wish to dip into Wild Spirit - the Story of Percy
Bysshe Shelley (Hodder, Pounds 15.99); Robert Gittings and Jo Manton have
re-assessed the importance of Mary Shelley's step-sister, Claire Clairmont,
in Claire Clairmont and the Shelleys (Oxford, Pounds 20), and Judith
Chernaik's Mab's Daughters, a fictional re-creation of the diaries of the
women in the Shelley circle, is available in paperback (Pan Books, Pounds
5.99).

FT  01 AUG 92 / Arts: An updated Rake that progresses nowhere - Festival
d'Aix-en-Provence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONJUNCTION of a new Rake's Progress, brought to the stage of the
Theatre de l'Archeveche by Alfredo Arias, with the revival from last year of
Robert Carsen's hit production of A Midsummer Night's Dream gave the Aix
Festival the opportunity for its very own study in Anglo-Saxon manners. It
was not a survey of eccentricity that many English would recognise now, but
clearly it touched chords and confirmed prejudices with a good portion of
the French audience. There, though, any parallels between the two stagings
begin and end, for where Carsen's production seems to me a milestone in the
stage history of Britten's opera, Arias' half-baked realisation deserves to
be quickly forgotten.
There might well be an updating of The Rake that would give good mileage -
with Tom Rakewell as 1980s yuppy perhaps, given his year of dissolute high
living courtesy of all the Nick Shadows of high Thatcherism, and with any
number of possible candidates for the roles of Mother Goose and Baba the
Turk. Arias settled for something much woolier and less specific. While the
costumes placed it somewhere in the first half of this century, his idee
fixe was to double the three protagonists with dancers, who embroidered each
set piece with their own parallel plot, carefully choreographed by Andy
Degroat. It was never illuminating, only distracting.
Even before the opera began the inmates of the Bedlam asylum were swarming
over the stage; that they were all female, and found themselves in some
pretty lurid postures raised suspicions from the start. Meanwhile a
television set was offering edited highlights from Hogarth's engravings and
soon showed itself to be another idee, dispensing a succession of Highly
Meaningful Images - a pair of doves billing and cooing at one point (for Tom
and Anne of course), a mouse trapped in a wheel, even, heaven help us, the
Household Cavalry on parade. Not so long ago the recruitment of circus
midgets used to be a reliable indicator of a desperate directorial
imagination; now televisions showing irrelevant video clips have been added
to the opera's director's more dubious baggage.
It was all a great pity. For though the cast's American accents emphasised
the out-of-kilter 'Englishness' of the proceedings, and often drew attention
to the unruly prosody of Auden and Kallman's text, the three central roles
were as strongly presented as could be imagined in international opera
today. Samuel Ramey has been the definitive Nick Shadow for the best part of
a decade and here combined a wonderfully economical stage presence and
oleaginous style with singing of understated menace and impeccable clarity.
Dawn Upshaw's Anne was utterly straightforward, prim, sweet and all the more
moving in the second half of the opera for her very restraint. She
particularly made the presence of a balletic double seem utterly
superfluous.
Jerry Hadley was Tom; when one overcame the culture shock of hearing the
lines sung with such forthright vigour and almost a Broadway style of
phrasing, his performance became a compelling demonstration of vocal
prowess. The Mr Truelove of John Macurdy inevitably seemed less assertive,
but together with Joan Khara's ample Mother Goose and Victoria Vergara's
Baba the Turk (a replacement for the ailing Tatiana Troyanos) ensured a cast
with no weak points. Kent Nagano conducted, with the kind of elegance and
concern for texture and phrasing that are characteristic of his Stravinsky.
Had the dramatic context only offered more, this would have been a Rake's
Progress of exemplary distinction.
                        *       *       *
The theatrical discipline and visual flair of the Dream only underlined the
shortcomings of the Stravinsky. The awards and praise showered on the
production last year seem entirely deserved, for it offers a vision of
Britten's opera that is both breathtakingly seductive and thoroughly
perceptive. Carsen's concept, using a colour scheme of bright green and deep
blue (designs by Michael Levine) is carried through without ever faltering;
it hardly matters that not all the ideas are freshly minted. Its parade of
true English eccentrics - Puck as dirty-raincoated flasher, Lysander regency
fop, Demetrius City gent, the fairies a regiment of frockcoated public
schoolboys - is never overplayed, and crucially never suffocates the
individual performances of a fine cast.
There is no space to catalogue the contribution of every singer, but James
Bowman's Oberon is now more sensitive of phrasing and colour than ever, and
Lilian Watson's Titania, was comprehensively seductive in voice and
demeanour. Juliet Booth's painfully frumpy Helena, John Graham-Hall's
impossibly gangling Lysander, and Peter Rose's irrepressible Bottom must be
mentioned, together with Emil Wolk's virtuoso, menacing Puck. Steuart
Bedford's conducting (of the English Chamber Orchestra) unfolded the score
with exemplary care.
Even those who regard A Midsummer Night's Dream as one of Britten's most
problematic operas would have laid their misgivings aside and been held
spellbound by this exceptional version, for which a revival is promised in
Paris, Lyon and Montpellier in two years' time.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Arts: Old Masters lead the way to normality - A year in
which tradition - and sanity - returned to the auction houses / Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOST expensive work of art sold at auction in London, in the UK, indeed
in the world, in the saleroom season now ending was an Old Master painting.
Canaletto's broad sweep of the Horseguards in St James's Park in 1749, which
Christie's sold for the Harris family, who had owned it for more than two
centuries, went to composer Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber for Pounds 10.13m.
The second most expensive work disposed of in the UK, also at Christie's,
was another Old Master, Titian's 'Venus and Adonis', which the experts
decided was mainly in the hand of the Master rather than his studio. It
went, via Christie's and the Earls of Normanton, to the Getty Museum for
Pounds 7.4m. And the third most costly work? Well, yet another Old Master,
Rembrandt's portrait of Johannes Uyttenbogaert, which Sotheby's sold, for
Lord Rosebery, to an American collector for Pounds 4.18m.
What could more vividly sum up the transformation in the art market than the
fact that three Old Master paintings, all from English aristocratic
collections, made the top prices in the auction room in 1991-92?
The rout, at least temporarily, of the Impressionists, and of 20th century
art, of classic cars and of the abstract expressionist artists of the 1950s,
is complete. The auction world has returned to its traditional ways, where
connoisseurs rule and established works of art hold pride of place.
Christie's reports that Old Master sales rose 23 per cent this season and
furniture by 18 per cent. For Sotheby's, jewels were the biggest market -
followed by Old Masters.
But this return to accepted standards is not totally good news for the
salerooms. In the heady days of the late 1980s and early 1990 the
speculative bubble in the Impressionists, headed by Japanese buying, pushed
art prices (and saleroom profits) to unprecedented heights - Dollars 82.5m
(Pounds 43.1m) was paid for a Van Gogh; Dollars 78.1m for a Renoir. With the
disappearance of such prices for post-1870 art the annual sales of Sotheby's
and Christie's have slumped and they have to work hard to make a profit.
This week they announced their results for the 1991-92 season. Sotheby's
registered a worldwide decline in sales during the year of 15 per cent in
dollar terms to Dollars 1.14bn (Pounds 640m), while Christie's was 8 per
cent lower at Pounds 609m (Dollars 1.082bn). The falls at least showed a
levelling off on a year ago when both salerooms announced a reduction in
turnover during the 1990-91 season of approaching 60 per cent.
The art market has now accepted that it is in for a long, hard haul out of
recession. Christopher Davidge, managing director of Christie's, admits that
he anticipates two seasons of modest growth. But there are clear signs that
the worst is over. Both Sotheby's and Christie's report that sales in the
first six months of this year show a 6 per cent improvement over 1991. This
is the kind of growth that the auction houses anticipate in the immediate
future.
In a business where confidence is vitally important, the two auction houses
are skilled at finding patches of blue sky. For a start, sellers have
finally accepted that the market is in the doldrums and that, to dispose of
their works of art, they must lower price expectations and reserves. As a
result the number of lots left unsold globally this season has remained the
same, at around 23 per cent at Sotheby's and 25 per cent at Christie's
(although Christie's in London has done much better, reducing its unsold
lots by 5 per cent during the season to 17.5 per cent).
The basic problem for the salerooms remains the reluctance of owners to risk
disposing of important masterpieces at auction during a flat market - unless
the demands of Lloyd's of London, or business failures, command otherwise.
What Sotheby's and Christie's need is a succession of substantial deceased
estates, consisting of works of art of undoubted brilliance, and heirs
desperate to raise some money. Sotheby's has actually just secured one. The
death of the Prince of Thurn und Taxis in Bavaria has forced his widow to
cash in some of the family's amazing art collection to meet death duties.
The first, of three, auctions - consisting of jewels, silver and works of
art - will be held at Geneva in November. Sotheby's is tempting buyers with
very conservative estimates, and at least Pounds 8m should be raised.
Michael Ainslie, chief executive of Sotheby's, hopes that this auction,
which seems certain of success, will be the trigger to restore much-needed
confidence to the art market.
Sotheby's needs a lift. It has found conditions marginally harder in the
past season than Christie's, which got its cost reductions in first with a
wave of redundancies in December 1990 and is currently trading at a small
profit. Sotheby's has had its triumphs - the collection of Jaime
Ortiz-Patino raised Dollars 29.4m; a Faberge Egg sold for Dollars 3.2m;
there was a record for a carpet when a Louis XVI Savonnerie made Dollars
1.2m; and the Dollars 2.8m paid for a painting by Diego Rivera was the
second highest price for a Latin American painting.
But Christie's, thanks mainly to its century-old links with the owners of
Old Masters paintings and its success with English furniture (especially the
Messer collection, which brought in Pounds 7.7m), marginally increased its
market share. It claims 49 per cent, a 1 per cent gain on the season and its
highest share against Sotheby's since the mid 1950s. It has inflated its
figures by including private treaty sales, in particular the Pounds 10m it
secured by selling Holbein's 'Lady with a squirrel' to the National Gallery.
Even so it probably made a minor inroad and certainly heads Sotheby's in the
UK and Europe.
But market share is less important than market size. While the recession
extends its grip on the world there will be no substantial improvement in
the fortunes of the salerooms. Speculative buying has disappeared, and
antique dealers faced with unsold stock are, in markets such as 20th century
art and furniture, taking a back seat to private buyers.
Both Sotheby's and Christie's have reduced their payrolls this year, frozen
salaries, and had a blitz on printing and office costs. Christie's senior
directors are still enduring a 20 per cent cut in their salaries, but at
least the company seems safe from takeover bids. Sotheby's has attracted
more speculation since its owner, Alf Taubman, decided to sell 8m shares
this summer.
Phillips, third in size among the British auction houses, did well by
achieving sales of Pounds 85.3m and registering a fall of only 3 per cent.
It was helped by the emergence of private buyers who out-bid the moribund
trade. Bonhams, fourth in size, did even better, managing growth of 2.3 per
cent to Pounds 22.12m. and actually recording a gain of 14 per cent in the
first six months of 1992, thanks mainly to private buying.
Indeed, all the auction houses are looking towards the collector to provide
the limited growth they anticipate in the new season, which gets under way
seriously in October. It will be a hard grind but, with the worst probably
behind them, the auction houses can try and forget the wonder years between
1987 and 1990 and return to the slow but steady expansion, linked to the
world economy, which characterised the trade in the past.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Arts: In praise of a beautiful angel - Shelley's
bi-centenary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL GLOVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEXT WEEK marks the bi-centenary of the birth of Percy Bysshe Shelley, one
of England's greatest Romantic poets, a figure reviled in his lifetime for
his scandalous life and unfashionable opinions, and quickly apotheosised
after his death at the tender age of 29 as the very type of the Poet -
Matthew Arnold once described him as a 'beautiful and ineffectual angel,
beating in the void his luminous wings in vain.'
Although one of his grandfathers was born in Newark, New Jersey, Shelley
himself came from West Sussex, but there was no love lost between him and
his forebears, whom he once described as 'a parcel of cold selfish and
calculating animals who seem to have no other aim or business on Earth but
to eat drink and sleep.' Fortunately, he spent little time there.
He was beaten and bullied at Eton, where fellow pupils denounced him as 'mad
Shelley', and later expelled from University College, Oxford, for failing to
answer questions in front of a public tribunal (consisting of heads of
college, professors and a quorum of bishops) about a pamphlet that he had
written and circulated, entitled 'The Necessity of Atheism.' And in 1816 he
was banished from the family estate for eloping to Edinburgh with the
16-year-old Harriet Westbrook - the first of many flights from authority.
Much of his later life was spent in Italy - Lucca, where he translated
Plato's Symposium, Venice, Naples, Pisa and, ultimately, Lerici, where he
lived in a lonely beach house on the bay with the rest of his household,
which by this time consisted of Mary, their son Percy Florence, and Claire
Clairmont, Mary's young step-sister. It was here that his last major poem
was written, 'The Triumph of Life', which was left unfinished at the time of
his death. The last, sad act in the drama has been well documented: Shelley,
a non-swimmer, drowned in August 1822 after an unexpected squall hit the
schooner Ariel during a return trip from a visit to Byron at Livorno. The
god was dead.
The myths surrounding the person and the poetry of Shelley were freely
circulating within a quarter of a century of his death. Why was Shelley so
ripe for myth-making? Five reasons, principally: he had been astonishingly
prolific at a very young age; he had died at sea, a kind of death that had
already been immortalised by Milton in 'Lycidas'; he had a lived a life of
public scandal and concern, thanks to his extreme political views and his
atheistical tendencies; his personal life had been repeatedly tainted by
charges of immorality. And, equally scandalously, he had been friends with
Lord Byron and other dangerous aristocratic reprobates, thus heaping scandal
upon infamy in the mind of a public as thirsty for the stuff then as now.
But, above all things else, he had been cut off in his prime - old age had
not had the opportunity to wither or mature him.
And then, in the 20th century, Shelley the Skylark's reputation nose-dived,
thanks to a great deal of scatter-spray loosed off from that rusting
blunderbuss, FR Leavis, and his beaters. Leavis mocked and reviled Shelley
for his linguistic vagaries and ridiculous rhetorical flights of fancy.
Unfortunately, and as was so often the case with Leavis, the quotations that
were deployed to set Shelley spinning down from the upper air were highly
selective - and his life and other achievements as thinker, letter-writer
and savage polemicist were ignored.
It is these aspects of his multifarious talent that other, later critics
have hailed as remarkable - his passionate indictment of the failures of
technology; his defence of vegetarianism; and the political radicalism that
made him the toast of a thousand radical and chartist groups in the middle
of the 19th century while the defenders of his poetry, makers of that very
myth-machine, were soaring high in the clouds with his juvenilia.
How do we explain such a multi-faceted genius as Shelley's? He seemed to
contain within himself the extreme passion and the extreme idealism of a
young man who had not lived long enough to be browbeaten into the
conformities of middle age - wedded, of course, to a brilliant intellect
that genuinely believed in the power of the hammer-blows of reason to beat
down the walls of Tyranny. The date of the bi-centenary is August 4.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Cookery: A fine kettle of turbot - A dinner party treat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON JULY 14 the Earl of Bradford announced plans to storm the culinary
bastions of Paris: in October ten master chefs of Great Britain will descend
on the George V hotel to cook for French food writers, chefs and gourmets.
The idea is to show the French that there is more to British foods than
smoked salmon, oysters, roast beef and steamed treacle pudding.
The menu they have chosen comprises clear oxtail soup with parsley
dumplings; a platter of fish including potted crab, soused mackerel, jellied
eel and marinated haddock; pot roast partridge with caraway flavoured
cabbage; blackberry and apple crumble with mead ice-cream; and British
farmhouse cheeses. May a good time be had by all.
Meanwhile, as October is a long way off, I have had fun working out a summer
menu of good British foods that eschew the stereotype choices of asparagus,
salmon, lamb and strawberries.
This meal might begin with a selection of cold cured meats, Welsh salt duck,
Macon (mutton ham), Lincolnshire chine and York or Bradenham ham, among
them.
For the main course there would be turbot, arguably Britain's finest fish
and an old fashioned favourite but all too rarely served these days. The
fish would be cooked whole and served in the time-honoured British way, not
with a butter-rich sauce, but with one that is delicately creamy, lightly
thickened with flour and laced with shrimps. Braised cucumber and garden
peas would make choice accompaniments.
Finally, for pudding, I suggest a puff pastry gooseberry pie, the fruit
sweetened with splash of elderflower syrup, served with crinkle-skinned
clotted cream.
TURBOT WITH SHRIMP SAUCE serves 6
Whole turbot, which can weigh 20 lb or more and was once the great dish of
grand dinners, is not something you will find on many fishmongers' slabs
these days. Yet a small turbot, or chicken turbot as it is charmingly
called, remains a fine choice for a special occasion and is well worth
ordering for a small dinner party.
The traditional way to cook turbot is to poach it in a diamond shaped
kettle. More junk shops than kitchen shops stock turbot kettles now but they
can still be picked up cheaply at country house sales: useful for cooking
hams as well as fish.
In the absence of a suitable kettle, bake turbot, wrapping it in buttered
foil with sea salt, pepper, bay leaves and slices of lemon. Lay the baggy
parcel on a large baking tray and cook for about 45 minutes at 350'F-375'F
(180'C-190'C) gas mark 4-5.
1 chicken turbot weighing 3 1/2 -4 lb; 1-2 pt milk; 2 bay leaves; 2 lemons;
a bunch of parsley. For the sauce:  1/2 lb cooked prawns in the shell; 4 oz
potted shrimps;  1/2 oz each butter and flour;  1/2 - 3/4 pt creamy milk;
1/4 pt cream; 1 slice of onion, 1 bay leaf and half a dozen lightly bruised
black peppercorns tied in a piece of buttermuslin.
Make the sauce first as it can be prepared ahead and reheated in a
double-boiler when needed. Shell the prawns, reserving the flesh to garnish
the turbot. Put the shells into a saucepan with the buttermuslin bag of
flavourings and  1/2 pt milk. Bring to simmering point, cover and cook over
the lowest possible heat for 10 minutes.
Remove the buttermuslin bag and whizz the remaining contents of the pan in a
food processor for 10 seconds only. Strain the pink shellfish-flavoured
liquid through a fine sieve, pressing to extract every flavoursome drop.
Measure and top up with extra milk to bring the level back to half a pint or
just over.
Make a roux with the butter and flour (using the spiced butter that seals
the potted shrimps, if liked) and cook for a couple of minutes. Blend in the
milk away from the heat, then let the sauce simmer very gently for 5 minutes
or so stirring occasionally.
Season to taste with salt, pepper, maybe a little lemon juice, and thin with
the cream. Stir in the potted shrimps and heat through gently.
Make an incision down the length of the turbot's backbone on the dark
skinned side to prevent curling during cooking. Lay the fish in the kettle,
dark side down. Add slices of lemon, a couple of bay leaves, a few
peppercorns and a mixture of milk and water to cover. Bring to a bare simmer
and cook very gently indeed for 12-15 minutes or so until the flesh is no
longer transparent and comes clean from the bone.
Drain the fish well, saving the milky liquor for soups. Lay it on a handsome
dish, garnish with the peeled prawns, little bouquets of parsley and wedges
of lemon. Hand round the sauce separately.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Wine: Double act that buyers cannot afford to miss / A look
at the real wine bargains that are available this summer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREAT VINTAGES can be assessed only with the benefit of some sort of
historical perspective. But since so many of the best wines have
traditionally been available only in infancy, clever wine buyers have had to
take a foreshortened view of potential greatness.
We should all be gazing in wonder at the magnificence of Europe's 1989 and
1990 vintages and working out just how many cases of this surely
unrepeatable double-act we can afford. And to think how good we thought 1988
was before they came along . . .
This is particularly true for the great sweet whites - of Bordeaux, Alsace,
the Loire and Germany, and indeed of Germany's exciting drier wines too.
The exceptional ripeness of 1989 and 1990 gave them unparalleled exuberance,
particularly from the stars of the Rheinpfalz such as Lingenfelder and
Muller-Catoir whose wines are marvels of heady concentration whether they be
dry (Trocken) medium dry (Halbtrocken) or unreined; both producers' wines
are sold by Oddbins whose greatest bargain has been Muller-Catoir's 1990
(and last) vintage of Muller-Thurgau (Pounds 4.99) which makes one revise
all previous assumptions about this workaday grape variety. But even the
wines at the very top of Muller-Catoir's glorious range, which should
continue to develop well into the next century, cost less than Pounds 10.
Which is more than can be said for the equally successful famous French reds
of 1989 and 1990, the smartest burgundies and (less rare) classed-growth
bordeaux. There are bargains in other regions however, and these vintages
were just as successful in the Loire, the Rhone and the Midi. So difficult
is it to go wrong with 1990 made in and around Hermitage that even
Sainsbury's lowly Crozes-Hermitage (Pounds 3.99) from the area's
co-operative is rich, plump and deserves to be decanted off its low-rent
label.
In the Loire, these two great vintages arrived just as a decent proportion
of producers had got to grips with making serious sweet whites without
recourse to overdoses of sugar and sulphur, and had mastered the vigour of
their vines to coax maximum ripeness from their reds.
We can, therefore, choose not only from some Vouvrays which can truly be
called fabulous - for Huet, try Bibendum of London NW1 and The Wine Society
of Stevenage, Herts - but also from reds with more lush fruit than I have
ever tasted from the Loire.
Britain's greatest range of Loire wines of all hues is on the list of the
restaurant RSJ and its wholesale wine company around the corner, an enclave
of Loiremania in London SE1 (071-633-0489) - but you do have to buy by the
dozen.
Charruau's stunning Saumur-Champigny, Les Folies 1989 is Pounds 82 a case
and it is a miracle that the French allowed even a bottle of this wine for
today, tomorrow and the next century, to escape across the Channel. The
assumption that fine wine has to be bought in infancy is being called into
question however by some of the bargains being offered around the trade at
the moment.
One of the more talked-about has fetched up on Oddbins' shelves, resulting
in such delicious vintage ports as Dow 1985, selling there for Pounds 11.49
a bottle. This is rather less than it would have cost by the dozen in 1987
and less than half the notional market price - although quite what
constitutes the port market at the moment is anyone's guess.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Food: Morocco bound to have the freshest fish
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT USED TO be said that you should never order fish in a restaurant on
Mondays because it would not be fresh. This is not quite the case now. New
markets - early each Monday at Brixham, Devon, and Newlyn, Cornwall, for
example - and improved refrigeration techniques, particularly vacuum
packing, have helped to preserve the quality of Saturday's catch. But
traditional fishing ports have been reluctant to change their routines and,
like most people, fishermen prefer weekends at home.
Suddenly, however, top-quality fresh fish is arriving in London in time for
delivery on Monday mornings from an unexpected source: Morocco. Because they
are Moslems, fishermen there rest on Friday - their holy day - and go out at
weekends. And they have plenty of sea to work in: Morocco has 400 kilometres
of Mediterranean coast and, more significantly, 2,600 kilometres facing the
less-polluted Atlantic.
Traditionally, Moroccans have used simple 20 ft rowing boats to fish for
anchovies and sardines, but both are being exhausted. So the fishermen have
moved up market to John Dory, red mullet, red bream of sufficiently high
quality to be eaten raw in London's Japanese sashimi bars, spotted bass,
large weever with their poisonous spines, and rascasse (scorpion fish), the
fish for bouillabaisse.
What guarantees quality is the fact that, although they are landed at ports
modernised by the Moroccan government, the technology for catching these
fish has not improved. Because there has been very little investment in the
boats, most of the fish are caught by line rather than trawled;
consequently, they are not damaged in the nets. And because the boats are so
small, they work by day in the rich inshore fishing grounds and land their
catch the same night. This ensures that fish do not spend two or three days
losing freshness in a ship's hold.
The best fishing ports are along the Atlantic coast: El Jadida, Safi,
Essaouira, Agadir and Tan-Tan. Catches are delivered immediately to
Casablanca, where the fish trade has been controlled for centuries by
several family firms. The fish is then packed under ice in polystyrene boxes
to be flown abroad.
Moroccan fish can now be found on many of the most fashionable dining tables
in London including Le Gavroche, Tante Claire, Clarke's, Kensington Place,
The Ivy and Le Caprice. The importer, Cutty Catering, of London SE15, is
confident that Morocco will become an important supplier because the absence
of a large fish market means prices do not fluctuate as much as they do in
Europe.
At the same time, cheaper air freight is making other unheralded sources
more accessible. Iceland, once regarded merely as a supplier of cod for fish
and chip shops, could soon be supplying large quantities of top-quality
monkfish, halibut and haddock. The same goes for its smaller neighbour, the
Faroe Islands. Both have the benefit of deep, cold and relatively unpolluted
waters.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is the Californian Tree Poppy, a semi-shrubby perennial with stiff,
5ft-6ft stems, some of which might survive the winter, but others are likely
to be killed to ground level except in mild places. Stems and leaves are
grey-green; the sweetly scented flowers, which are large and poppy-like, are
pure white with a big central boss of golden stamens. This is a very
beautiful plant, which thrives in warm, sunny places and fertile, porous
soils. It is difficult to transplant and should be obtained in pots, from
which it can be planted out without root disturbance.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Gardening: Such good English gardens in exile - Robin Lane
Fox welcomes a new book which may prevent homesickness on the family holiday
abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MARIGOLDS are glowing in Italy; fibrous-rooted begonias are dotted like
cats' eyes round France; Love lies bleeding on a thousand roundabouts within
sight of the Mediterranean.
Faced with all this foreign bedding, English gardeners on family holidays
are preparing for a fortnight of exile. If they knew where to go, would it
be better? Are there places abroad with the style which echoes their high
ideals for the garden at home?
Most of these echoes have been left by fellow English gardeners, busy
abroad. The hunt for them is very much easier this year because of a notable
new book by Charles Quest Ritson called The English Garden Abroad, published
at Pounds 20 by Viking.
From La Mortola to the Cooks of Portugal, its old photographs are
well-chosen; the new colour ones are fun; the text surveys English gardens
in Europe from Portugal to the French Riviera, from Malaga to eastern
Sicily.
Everyone will find an unfamiliar villa and little-known facts and
practitioners of English gardening abroad: there was much more going on in
the earlier part of this century than the famous lavishness of Miss Willmott
in France or the amazing vulgarity of Cannes.
Many books on this topic are either picture-boilers or the work of garden
historians who have never been near a plant or would not know the English
difference between middle and upper class.
Charles Quest Ritson is something else. He has a profound knowledge of
roses; his training extends from history to tax law and life with a
plantswoman whose nursery stocks Prunus bessii and who describes Oxford
University as second-rate.
His book reads like a tightly-written brief, packed with his own research, a
good line in passing comment and a sharp eye for expatriates' particular
obstacles: soil, sun, and their heirs. He gives an excellent bibliography,
which asks to be followed down rare avenues which he recommends.
I have been relishing it at breakfast, a chapter at a time, and the view
from my window of rain, long grass and English greenery has seemed
wonderfully at odds with the dreams which he conjures up.
Often, a dream is all that is left. This book is best at the specific, the
family detail, the problems of water, or the botanical specimens to be found
in great gardens of the past.
It reminds us of great enterprises which cost fortunes and have now
disappeared. At times, it is not entirely explicit about the level of
gardening which remains.
Its unwary readers might visit Ravello on the coast of Italy, expecting to
find a living tradition of plantsmanship and maintained elegance. It is
worth visiting the Scottish-based garden of the Villa Rufolo and the nearby
Villa Cimbrone, home of the Yorkshire expatriate, Lord Grimthorpe, whose
home society knew him as the Big Bad Wolf.
The siting of these two gardens is still spectacular, on the edge of a steep
cliff, but their planting is pretty awful and their upkeep is not
distinguished.
Further north, in the great garden made by the Hanburys at La Mortola, the
story is even worse. As Quest Ritson comments more gently, its heir, the
University of Genoa, has continued to make an frightful hash of its legacy,
in spite of the attempts of English experts who have been consulted.
France has a fabulous pair to our own Hidcote, the second home of Lawrence
Johnston at La Serre de La Madonne. Very few gardeners have been allowed to
visit its remains, but the reports are of a ruined framework, sad witness to
a dream of the past.
Quest Ritson well remarks that Italians know how to restore a ruin: they
also understand concepts like ecology or botanical environment. They do not
have a clue about artistic gardens of flowers which can evolve in a duet
with committed gardeners.
Not everything is lost and decaying. Quest Ritson has a sharp eye for
neglected areas of genius, still alive and well. He appreciates the Botanic
Garden in Palermo; he pays particular homage to Sir Peter Smithers and his
remarkable garden at Vico Morcote, which includes almost every known
magnolia.
The two Wakefields, father and son, earn a large bouquet at Clos de
Peyronnet; mention is made of Russell Page, the professional English
designer abroad; the great garden at Ninfa and the Howards make a proper
climax to the text; on Madeira, there are fond words for the Blandys and on
Sicily for the Whitakers, active families whose gardens were built on
fortunes from Madeira and Marsala wine, respectively.
Sometimes, the air is so rarefied that I feel myself in a minority: 'Many
have travelled to the Villa Taranto in June in the hope of seeing the rare
Emmenopterys henryi flowering as nowhere else in Europe.' Perhaps we should
join the crowds.
My own guess is that the 21st century will see a great scattering of good
gardens, newly made by young English owners who have opted for life in
Europe and managed to cope with the absence of the best weed-killers in the
smaller market towns.
They will have made their fortune in the stock market boom of 1994-96: more
women than ever before will be cashing in their chips and setting out with
personal fortunes to lose their golden handcuffs in gardens of flowers which
will make Monet look old-hat.
They will revel in Quest Ritson's book and many of its bons mots. The French
have always been puzzled that well-off English owners should want to work in
person and let the garden make them dirty.
At the great garden of La Mortola, Lady Forbes once wrote of her three
golden rules: 'Never plant singly; do not mix families of plants, which, by
the laws of nature, could never have grown together; study your
colour-schemes.'
In practice, as Quest Ritson aptly observes, she usually broke her own
rules. Expatriates, he reminds us, tend 'to present as problems what in
practice they see as opportunities.'
From this familiar mentality, yet more good English gardens in exile are
still to be born.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Bretton Woods remembered - by its last remaining star
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EDDIE Bernstein is squinting at the numbers on his desk-top calculator.
'Thirteen point six per cent,' he calls out. 'That's what the Russians were
offered at Bretton Woods. The British got 14.8 per cent of the votes in the
IMF and the Americans 31.4 per cent.'
Sliding the old book back on the shelf and settling back into his chair at
Washington's Brookings Institution, the 87-year-old Bernstein reflects on
the combined less-than-five per cent share of the votes the 15 former Soviet
republics accepted in April on becoming full members of the International
Monetary Fund. 'Don't forget, Britain and France under the ninth quota
review will each have only five per cent of the shares. So I'd say Russia -
given its small share of trade and absence of reserves - has received very
generous treatment.'
A pause. 'They've gotten just about as much as we offered them at Bretton
Woods.'
It has been 48 years since the monetary conference at the mountain resort in
northern New Hampshire, and Bernstein is the last of those taking part to
remain alive and working. The wartime conference, attended by 44 nations,
established the IMF and World Bank. The UK Treasury's John Maynard Keynes
and US Treasury's Harry Dexter White were the visionaries behind the fund
and the bank. But Bernstein - assistant to White and secretary of the US
delegation - played a pivotal role. With rare immodesty, he observes: 'I,
not Keynes, was the star at Bretton Woods.'
White and Bernstein were the chief American contacts with Keynes in the
difficult 1943 and 1944 bilateral negotiations that culminated in Bretton
Woods. But White - alienated from his colleagues and often ill-tempered -
was no match for the worldly, erudite Englishman. In the US delegation at
Bretton Woods, it was understood that only Bernstein could hold his own
against Keynes. Grudgingly, Keynes called Bernstein the hero of Bretton
Woods, 'The person who made everything clear.' Keynes diary from a year
earlier was less generous, though. There, the New Yorker - who insisted that
key elements of Keynes' draft be modified - was a 'ghetto rat.' But
Bernstein calls Keynes the greatest intellect of the 20th century after
Einstein.
Bernstein - who took a PhD at Harvard, wrote a highly-regarded text on money
and worked as a university professor before going to the Treasury in 1940 -
went on to be the first research director at the IMF, a post he held until
1958. After that, he set up his own consulting firm and made a lot of money.
Finally, in semi-retirement, he went to Brookings where, as a research
fellow, he continues to issue papers on such matters as US interest rates,
the dollar, the Japanese surplus, and the budgetary impact of German
unification.
Bernstein believes the IMF has never lived up to the lofty ambitions of
Keynes and White. 'It suffers,' he says, 'from having never been able to
discipline its principal member, the United States.' Even now, Washington
retains veto power with 19 per cent of the votes.
Bernstein feels the IMF was handicapped at the start because it was
overshadowed by the Marshall Plan, and that it lost influence steadily after
exchange rates began to float in 1970. Until the collapse of communismm, he
notes, the fund had been relegated to dealing mostly with developing
countries instead of the big players in the global economy. Now, with Russia
finally a member, perhaps that will change. 'This is a very big thing for
the fund. They have been given a very big responsibility in guiding Russia
into the world economy.'
What about transforming post-communist states into market-based economies,
prescriptions for which are being handed out by the fund and such academics
as Harvard's Jeffrey Sachs? Bernstein is in general accord with the new
orthodoxy but has serious doubts about convertibility. 'Don't forget that,
after the war, the west Europeans waited 10 years to make their currencies
convertible.' He believes premature convertibility is, almost certainly, a
mistake. 'The first priority has to be creating a capitalist economy at
home, industry by industry. Prices have to be based on costs and brought to
world levels. The exchange rate should be set low enough to promote exports,
but not too low.'
In retrospect, he argues, the Russians could have avoided hyper-inflation by
isolating the huge rouble balances the population built up involuntarily
during 70 years of communist austerity. The suppressed consumer demand
represented by those savings should have been absorbed by allowing citizens
to buy their apartments and farms from the state. But that is all past
tense. The task now, he stresses, is stopping inflation, stabilising the
economy, reviving - and then boosting - exports.
There is a lot of the professor left in Eddie Bernstein. He says he would
give Sachs an 'F' for his assertion in a Brookings lecture that high US
interest rates explain the dollar's relentless rise between 1980-85. Rather,
says Bernstein, speculation drove the dollar higher; and while high interest
rates might have initiated its rise, it was the enormous demand for US
assets, and the expectation of further dollar advances, that fuelled the
currency's upward move.
Reflecting on how the world has changed in 50 years, Bernstein says it is
ironic that so many of the pre-war economic ambitions of Germany's Adolf
Hitler and Japan's Hideki Tojo have been realised. 'They've accomplished
their goals economically and, in some cases, surpassed them.' Viewing
Tokyo's huge payments' surplus, he notes that surplus countries call the
shots eventually, just as the US did through the 1950s, '60s and '70s.
Bernstein is, however, no apostle of American decline. Dashing to a stack of
reports, he retrieves statistics showing that US labour productivity exceeds
that of Germany and that US manufacturing competitiveness has improved
vastly since the mid-'80s. Referring to GDP figures, he points out that the
growth in the US economy in the 1980s was, by itself, a number bigger than
the entire West German economy.
Have events in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union put an end to
Marxism? 'Yes, without doubt,' says Bernstein. 'But Marx's labour theory of
value was always nonsense. Interestingly, Marx was a great believer in gold,
just as Keynes loathed it. And, by the way, Keynes' thinking at Bretton
Woods was shaped by the belief that a depression would inevitably result
from the end of hostilities in the Second World War.'
What are the lessons of the transformation process, now 2 1/2 years old in
eastern Europe? 'The recent back-tracking of Poland proves that, in a
democratic system, you have to back off when the social costs become too
great,' Bernstein says. 'What you've got in all these countries - including
the former Soviet Union - is huge repressed demand that requires prices
being brought into line with costs.
'Wages have to be related to productivity and exchange rates must be set low
enough to promote exports while surging imports must not be permitted to
destroy domestic industries. And there has to be rapid privatisation.'

FT  01 AUG 92 / As They Say in Europe: French replay a war crime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
READING newspapers on holiday is the kind of activity for which there used
not to be a word. Today, we have re-invented 'disjunctive.' At least, I
think that is the word because it implies a lack of coherence between what
one is doing and the circumstances in which it is being done.
For the past two years, many have been alarmed on exotic beaches by reports
of distant crises, first in Kuwait then in Moscow. This time, we hoped to
avoid these guns of August by going to the Dordogne in July. But instead of
the echoes of present crises, the papers were full of the tragedy of half a
century before.
Most years at this time, there is mention of events in July 1942 when the
French police rounded up thousands of naturalised French Jews and their
children and sent them to the death camps. Generically, the episode is known
as the Vel' d'Hiv', this being the abbreviation of the Paris winter cycling
stadium where the victims were held before transportation.
The 50th anniversary occasioned more heart-searching than ever. On July 16,
Liberation headlined its front page: 'France faces up to its crimes.'
Figaro, meanwhile, interviewed the nazi-Hunter, Serge Klarsfeld, who said
France could not be blamed. More Jews had survived there than in other
occupied countries.
The debate dominated even the provincial press: Sud-Ouest ran related
stories for several days, headlining the 'lively polemic' the anniversary
had generated, along with President Mitterand's presence at a commemorative
ceremony in Paris.
One question at issue was the nature of the Vichy government, the
collaborationist regime that was presented by Marshal Petain as the true
successor of the 'Vraie France.' Vichy also was implicated in the atrocities
of the Vel' d'Hiv'. But were they the result of defeat and 'the criminal
madness of the occupying power,' as the mayor of Paris, Jacques Chirac, put
it? Or was it all, in a sense, a French responsibility?
This debate impinged on our holiday in a graphic manner. We were staying a
mile north of the River Dronne; the nearest town was Riberac, on the
southern bank. The Dronne was the frontier between occupied and Vichy
France, and the old Gestapo headquarters is one of the last buidings before
crossing into Riberac. A little to the West is the glade containing the
graves of the resistants shot by the Nazis.
What the newspapers were agonising over was whether that was a national
frontier - whether France existed south of the Dronne. It was this debate
that was more intense than on the other anniversaries of the events of 1942.
This is partly because one or two of the most notable figures involved are
still at large, having sometimes been protected by the Roman Catholic Church
 -as the Church's own astounded report showed earlier this year.
Opinion in France has, if anything, hardened against the perpetrators in the
face of judicial complacency: almost three-quarters of the people want them
punished. The other quarter, one assumes, are don't-knows or supporters of
Jean-Marie Le Pen and the National Front.
The strength of the Front today has itself contributed to the debate over
the French past. The party stands for that constant strand in French
politics which, to say the least, is ambiguous about the Revolution.
It flaunts its sentimental religiosity, built around the cult of Joan of
Arc, and is a successor to the xenophobia of 'Action francaise' and the
racism of the 19th century. Its ambiguous relationship with Vichy and
Marshal Petain is, therefore, a living embodiment of the debate.
A little over a year ago, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung ran a cartoon
showing history drawing a line under a page marked 'Post-war period.' That
optimistic assessment has turned out to be inaccurate.
The post-war period was frozen out by the Cold War and - as events all over
Europe now show - has, in fact, only just begun.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Property: Retirement village on the Algarve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AUDREY POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE much of the property offered in leisure resorts on sunny coasts is
said to be suitable for holiday homes or the retired, usually there is
little designed for all-year use by older people. Apartments will have
minimal heating for winter months, the floors are likely to be chilly tiles,
and facilities in many developments will close down out of season.
Portugal's Algarve once attracted a large number of older Britons. There are
few retirement developments there now. But Mary Cornelius-Reid and her
husband have acquired a 22-acre site a few miles from the market town of
Loule and are building a village of 30 retirement properties.
These will be a cross between cottages and apartments, built in short rows
around a square and echoing the local cottage style. Although the site looks
out over miles of open countryside, it is only a short drive to the beaches
or Faro airport.
Work is to start soon on the cottages, which will have one and two bedrooms
with a kitchen and dining area, living room with terrace and barbecue, and
an internal patio and courtyard. There are gardens and a swimming pool.
The cottages are in the grounds of a nursing home, which has been converted
from a farmhouse and guest house. But they are not intended for people in
need of medical treatment; the planners simply felt that some of the nursing
home's amenities - such as the shop, hairdressing salon and restaurant -
would be useful to cottage residents as well. In addition, some might be
happier knowing the home's back-up services were there if needed.
The cottages will be available on an interest-free loan system. A payment of
between Pounds 85,000-Pounds 125,000 is made, returnable after the property
is vacated. There is a charge of Pounds 140 a week for a single person and
Pounds 170 for a couple. This covers cleaning, laundry, air-conditioning or
central heating, domestic help, external maintenance, a 24-hour call
facility and lunch in the restaurant. For further information, telephone
0980-622-957 (UK).

FT  01 AUG 92 / Property: Fifth Avenue from the waist up - A 1920s building
with the latest technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AUDREY POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORTY-five apartments in a 1920s building with late-20th century technology
are now coming on to the market at 1049 Fifth Avenue, in New York's
Manhattan. The Pounds 42m venture involves international investment bank
Investcorp, which has a base in London, and New York entrepreneur Jack
Keller.
The 23-storey building originally was a hotel. Most of the interior has been
ripped out and re-designed to make apartments with three and four bedrooms.
This fills a gap in the market for larger properties, says Investcorp's John
Thompson in London.
Unusually for the area, where most of the the apartments are co-operatives
governed by management committees with rights to approve or veto buyers, the
new development will be sold as condominiums. Prices of the units - each of
which will have 12 telephone lines - range from Pounds 750,000 to Pounds 3m.
While Fifth Avenue is one of New York's most sought-after locations,
potential buyers should know that No. 1049 is not actually in Fifth Avenue
at all. It is about 50 feet along East 86th Street, which runs off the
avenue at right angles.
No. 1049 is separated from Fifth Avenue by the Yivo Institute, a low corner
building. Keller tried to buy this to combine it with his re-development
next door but nothing came of his approach.
The institute's address was 1047/1049 Fifth Avenue, so an arrangement was
made - sanctioned by the local authority - for the new building to take over
part of that address. Thus, the former 86th Street hotel is now 1049 Fifth
Avenue.
After all, say the vendors, all its floors above the seventh look over the
institute building on to Central Park - just like real Fifth Avenue
buildings. The irony of the manoeuvre is that the institute building is now
for sale.
A London estate agency is to be appointed to handle marketing of the
apartments. Meanwhile, information can be gained from Investcorp in London
(071-629-6600) or New York (212-650-0066).

FT  01 AUG 92 / Property: House with vintage memories - Some country
properties that have evocative motoring associations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HANSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS weekend, the Vintage Sports Car Club is holding its annual meeting at
Prescott, the hill-climb course near Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. The event
attracts about 10,000 spectators and the fanatical owners of some of the
world's most evocative motoring hardware.
The Prescott course has belonged to the Bugatti Owners' Club for 55 years,
having been saved from housing development by two brothers, Godfrey and Eric
Giles, who bought the 65-acre Prescott estate in 1937 and leased the hill to
the club at a peppercorn. The first meeting was held on May 15 1938.
The kilometre of winding track that echoes to the roar of engines at full
throttle and the smell of high-octane fuel also is the private drive to the
18th-century Prescott House, which is for sale at Pounds 650,000 through the
Cheltenham office of Humberts (0242-513-439).
Prescott House was the first clubhouse of the Bugatti Owners' Club. It was
rented for many years to the BBC's motoring correspondent, BH Hartley, until
the club sold it in 1957 to Colonel Ian Cator.
After his death, his son sold it in 1985 to Ronnie Bock, a specialist
restorer of T'ang dynasty objects using unusual dentistry techniques.
'I love old cars but I am certainly not a Bugatti owner. I have never liked
them,' says Bock, firmly. 'I have just sold a TR3A at an enormous loss but I
have acquired a 1923 Star, which I shall use for everyday motoring.'
He has restored and modernised Prescott House to make it a very comfortable
eight-bedroom residence with garaging for four cars and more than four acres
of gardens and grounds. 'It must be one of the only houses in England to be
approached along a private race track,' he says.
Another is next door: the converted stables occupied by David Sewell,
curator of the Bugatti Trust Museum, who must hope Prescott House is bought
by one of the BOC's 1,600 members.
Nestling in a valley in Gloucestershire is another house with motoring
associations. Atcombe Court at South Woodchester, near Stroud, is owned by
Victor Gauntlett, former chairman and part-owner of Aston Martin Lagonda.
Offers of Pounds 750,000 are being sought by the Tetbury office of Humberts
(0666-502-284).
This beautiful Grade II-listed Georgian building stands in more than 12
acres of gardens and grounds - including paddocks, woods and lakes - and is
surrounded by farmland. Its impressive outbuildings are in immaculate
condition.
The main house has seven bedrooms but there is a staff or guest wing with
another three bedrooms. The former coach house and stable block have been
converted into garages for at least six cars - mainly workhorses like Range
Rovers and Land Rovers, his more valuable motors being kept in high-security
garages elsewhere.
Gauntlett bought a stake in Aston Martin Lagonda in May 1980 and became
chairman the following year, a post he occupied until he left last September
(although he and Peter Livanos had sold the company to Ford in 1987).
Having founded Pace Petroleum in 1972, which he built up to 500 filling
stations by the time he sold out to the Kuwaitis in 1983, he and Livanos now
are developing a new company, Proteus Petroleum, which already has 140
sites.
Although he owns some very collectable Aston Martins (including the
limited-edition Vantage), Gauntlett's favourite car is a 1929 two-seater,
boat-tailed, 4.5-litre 'Blower' Bentley which still can do 120 mph.
'I'm really a Bentley man, first and foremost,' he admits. 'After all, WO
Bentley designed the Lagonda engine that powered Aston Martins in the 1950s.
I have been quite mad about Bentleys over the years. The three-litres are
lovely to look at, but I'm a heavy metal man.'
So, too, is Keith Schellenberg, who owns a mouth-watering collection of
Bentleys. Since 1974, he has lived on the Hebridean island of Eigg, which
covers 7,400 acres, but a messy divorce led to a judge ordering the island
to be sold.
Knight Frank &amp; Rutley has just announced that Eigg has been bought for
around Pounds 1m - by Keith Schellenberg.

Pounds 9.99, 228 pages
MATING by Norman Rush Jonathan Cape Pounds 15.99, 477 pages
THOMAS Keneally is known best for his 1982 novel Schindler's Ark, which won
the Booker Prize that year and sold more copies than any other Booker winner
before or since. It was a heady mix of fact and fiction - so much fact that
some people claimed it was not a novel at all - based more or less directly
on a real story from Hitler's war. For his latest work, Woman of the Inner
Sea, Keneally is trying the same thing again, albeit in a vastly different
setting.
Names, dates and venues have been changed but the author says the story is
essentially true, told to him a dozen years ago and filed for future
reference. It tells of Kate, a prosperous Irish-Australian whose marriage to
an immigrant construction boss turns sour at the same time as something
terrible (it would be unfair to say what) happens to their two children.
Unable to cope, Kate abandons her husband and sets off for the Australian
bush. She works as a barmaid in the middle of nowhere and takes up with
several different men, one of whom keeps an emu and a kangaroo (Australia's
national symbols) as pets. But her husband hires a private investigator to
track her down and serve her with divorce papers. The investigator is a
thoroughly unpleasant character who punches the kangaroo so hard on the nose
that its hind feet rear up and shatter his pelvis. And that is only for
starters.
Throw in floods, dynamite, attempted murder, an Oscar-winning film director
and a defrocked priest serving five years for illicit gambling and you have
the makings of a very whimsical tale indeed. In fact, parts of it would
appear to belong in a different book, or even several different books.
Yet, if the story never quite coalesces as a whole, the main character is
done beautifully and the plot unfolds with real skill. The problem, perhaps,
is that the author has set out to tell a partially true story and truth, in
the end, often turns out stranger than fiction.
Amin Maalouf's Samarkand is based on a true story as well, the writing of
the Rubaiyaat of Omar Khayyam in 11th century Persia, now Iran. It begins
with Omar's arrival in Samarkand as a little-known poet and ends 900 years
later with the loss of the original Rubaiyaat MS in the Titanic disaster.
The first half of the book is taken up with the writing of the poems, the
second with a 19th century American scholar's hunt for the manuscript,
missing for 600 years.
It is an intriguing story presented deftly by Maalouf, although the English
translation by Russell Harris is a little stiff. You might feel that 11th
century Persia is not your cup of tea. But think again because, in Maalouf's
hands, it is a brightly-lit world of sieges, sackings, voluptuous court
poetesses and homicidal assassins (in the original sense of the word). The
narrative rambles in places and the author does not always make the best use
of a dramatic situation but he has a splendid tale to tell - one which
already has won a prize in France and deserves to succeed in the UK as well.
It is a good week for fiction based on fact. Brian O'Doherty is a doctor of
medicine and, for his first novel, has recreated a famous medical history
from 18th century Vienna. The Strange Case of Mademoiselle P. tells the
story, in several different voices, of Marie-Therese von Paradies, the
pianist for whom both Mozart and Salieri wrote concertos.
Blind from the age of three, Marie-Therese had given up hope of seeing again
until her father took her to the pioneer of psychosomatic medicine, Franz
Mesmer. Thus 'mesmerised,' she regained her sight gradually only to see her
playing suffer as a consequence. This endangered her livelihood, prompting
her father to look askance at Mesmer's cure. What happens thereafter will be
for readers to find out: suffice to say that it is a most interesting story,
reconstructed ably by O'Doherty.
Norman Rush has been a published short story writer for more than 20 years,
but Mating is his first attempt at anything longer. It is set in Botswana in
the 1980s, where the author worked for a while, and follows the career of an
American woman writing a thesis on nutritional anthropology while looking
for the perfect man to sleep with.
The book is billed as a comedy of manners, and the tone is certainly jokey
enough. But the author's use of English is clumsy, to say the least, and his
command of dialogue almost non-existent. Some writers are long-distance
performers and some are not; one suspects that Rush's natural length is the
short story, rather than almost 500 pages of often tortuous prose.

CHINA: A NEW HISTORY by John King Fairbank Harvard Pounds 22.25, 510 pages
IN WHAT was possibly the most dramatic episode in the life of a gentleman
scholar, John King Fairbank, doyen of American China-experts, delivered the
manuscript of this history to his Harvard publishers on a September morning
last year, and that afternoon died of a heart attack. The only unfinished
section of the text was, uncharacteristically, the acknowledgements.
The book is a suitable swan song, probably the best and certainly the most
magisterial survey of China's history. It spans the Chinese saga from
200,000 years ago when Peking Man, the hunter/fisher/gatherer and probable
cannibal, flourished in caverns a few miles southwest of a contemporary
mausoleum housing the mummified remains of Mao Zedong, a much more deadly
predator.
Fairbank's book comfortably deals with the huge distances of time and space,
knitting the development of Chinese society (or rather of Chinese culture)
together with the repetitive patterns picked out with great intelligence and
urbanity.
However, this is a work for the general reader and, as such, is largely a
summary of Fairbank's life work and a survey of the current state of
establishment Chinese scholarship in general. It adds little, apart from the
intelligent commentary and perspective he provides, to what those already
interested will know.
Fairbank rehearses the social and cultural explanations of what makes up the
special 'different' characteristics of the Chinese people. The transplanting
of rice 'certainly the greatest expenditure of muscular energy in the world'
in a country where land is economically more valuable than labour sets up a
'vicious interdependence' which creates hostility to machines and
labour-saving invention, as well as inspiring filial respect in sons
awaiting their inheritance.
He contrasts the 'culturalism' of the Chinese - a nationalism born of a
unified identity defined by the surrounding hordes of Inner Asian
'barbarians' - with European nationalism born of contact with other nation
states. The Confucian and neo-Confucian hierarchical social structures are
likewise seen as admirable, indeed enviable, reflections of history and an
innate culture.
All such 'approaches to understanding China's history' are within the great
tradition of western Sinology, where the academic who understands and
empathises with Chinese civilisation feels himself duty-bound to communicate
his special expertise and adjure the ignorant to make due allowances in
dealing with and judging China; this process tends to be a one-way flow.
Such attitudes have shaped generations of Orientalists who have reached high
positions within the US State Department. Even President George Bush's short
posting to Peking was sufficient to persuade him that he has special
insights, leading to his insistence that the Tienanmen massacre and
subsequent violations of human rights should not deny China most-favoured
nation status in trade.
The same attitudes are rife among the Orientalist mandarins of Britain's
Foreign Office (Sir Percy Cradock, for example, who persuaded John Major not
to annoy Peking by receiving the Dalai Lama). Hong Kong's retiring governor,
Lord Wilson, left the colony angrily denying that his qualifications had
predisposed him to 'kow tow' ('dreadful word]') to the Dragon Throne.
The Fairbank school helped inspire an academic backlash of revisionists
unwilling to swallow the China apologists' arguments. These were frequently
exploited by the leaders of such authoritarian states as China itself,
Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan, as a rationale for dictatorship and human
rights violations ('You do not understand; we Chinese have no democratic
traditions'). Much the same has been happening in the field of Japanology,
in which modern scholars are increasingly unwilling to explain away
single-minded protectionism and market domination in terms of a cultural
tendency to seek consensus. But the names of such brilliant 'revisionists'
as Simon Leys are not to be found among Fairbank's acknowledgements or
suggested reading.
In spite of Fairbank's urbane mastery of the subject, his book betrays a
nervous defensiveness. 'US citizens who feel inclined to bash China's
dictatorship,' he writes gratuitously, 'may usefully recall their nation's
difficulties in the exercise of freedom and power.' Even more gratuitously,
he goes on to recall the Kennedy assassination, Nixon's dishonesty and a
recent Hollywood product who 'lived a fantasy life, lying to himself and the
public to make us feel good', which presumably helps to put into perspective
Mao's killing of 'millions and millions of Chinese' and Deng Xiaoping's
dispatch of the tanks into Tiananmen. Anyway, US shortcomings, in Fairbank's
view, explain the reluctance of the old men in Peking to have China flooded
with pop culture and invalidates 'the appropriateness of the American model
for China's modern transformation.' So it does, but two wrongs hardly make a
right.
Only at one point does Fairbank admit misjudgment, which occured a
forgivable number of years ago. He ascribes the lack of any serious
discussion of the practice of foot-binding by the social historians of China
to an 'occupational quirk of sinologists, a secondary patriotism or
sinophilia that may lead otherwise hard-headed scholars to want to say no
evil of the object of their researches.' This breath-taking admission is
footnoted with a confession which is even more damaging in its implications:
'For an outstanding example of sentimental sinophilia see my statement in
Foreign Affairs, October 1972, that to a certain extent the Maoist
revolution was the best thing that had happened to the Chinese people in
many centuries.'
So much for the balanced search for objective truth which academics would
have us believe inspires their researches. At least when journalists get
things wrong no one accords them the infallibility with which Fairbank was
credited by so many of his students.

THE LETTERS OF PIER PAOLO PASOLINI: VOLUME I 1940-1954 edited by Nico
Naldini, translated by Stuart Hood Quartet Books Pounds 25, 526 pages
OUTSIDE Italy, Pasolini is known chiefly, if not exclusively, as a
film-maker, and beyond any question the dozen or so films he made bear the
unmistakable imprint of his vital, iconoclastic, tormented mind. But for
Italians - and, I think, for Pasolini himself - his writing, his poems,
novels and essays, represented the truer, more complete expression of that
mind, that exceptional personality.
His letters, too, are self-revelatory, and the collection painstakingly
assembled and cogently introduced by his cousin, Nico Naldini, forms a
fascinating document, not only about Pasolini but also about the Italy of
his time (he was born in 1922 and died, murdered, in 1974). Son of an army
officer and a school-teacher, he spent his early youth in various northern
Italian cities, then remained for most of the war in his mother's native
area, Friuli, whose dialect became one of the first serious vehicles of his
poetry. His younger brother was killed in the Resistance. Shortly after the
war's end, accused of corrupting the young, Pasolini was driven to leave
Friuli for Rome.
He arrived there in the early 1950s, broke, virtually unknown, branded. But
he soon had a circle of admiring, helpful friends, including older and
influential poets such as Attilio Bertolucci and Giorgio Caproni, and
several perceptive critics. It was then that, through Caproni, I met him,
and like the others I was immediately impressed. From the first moment,
something about him - the intensity of those bright eyes in that hewn,
almost hard face, the quiet assurance of his soft voice with its (to me
exotic) northern accent - told you there was a special quality about this
shy young man in the ill-fitting suit and the frayed shirt.
A book of his poems (he says in one of these letters that he considered it
his 'first book') in Friulan dialect had just appeared; I read it, not
without a linguistic struggle, and the first impression was confirmed. I
also read a haunting poem in Italian, 'The Appenine', and turned it into
English: it was his first translation into any language. By then we had
become friends: a curious friendship in which his total seriousness always
made me feel frivolous, and his steel determination to be a writer (and, it
was clear, a famous writer) contrasted with my own aimless uncertainty about
a future direction.
Rome in the 1950s seemed a city of aspiring writers, assailing the bulwarks
of the establishment: the state radio, the respected magazines, the
flourishing cinema. Through his friendships (and, of course, his talent),
Pasolini was soon on the inside track. He began winning prizes, contributing
to reviews like Paragone, directed by the awesome Roberto Longhi and his
formidable wife Anna Banti, frequenting the parties of another crucial
couple, Alberto Moravia (who was to be his lifelong friend) and Elsa
Morante. But then, at a certain hour of the evening, he would slip away to
his other life, a hidden Rome, where he found not only sexual satisfaction
but also literary inspiration.
In the capital's literary salons, he sometimes seemed the ambassador from
another, very foreign world. If he made powerful friends, he also made
powerful enemies, and with both he could be excoriatingly sincere. Some -
too few - of the 425 letters in this first volume have an aggressive
frankness that must have taken the recipients aback (the correspondence with
the rather stuffy senior critic Enrico Falqui has lost none of its
sharpness). There are very few 'confessional' letters, but those to his
perceptive friend and confidante Silvana Mauri portray a vulnerable,
self-critical youth in pain: these are the letters of a real writer.
Other letters - many other letters - introduce us to the less admirable
aspects of Italian literary life, the canvasing for prize-jury votes, the
requests for recommendations and introductions, the reciprocal reviewing
and, on occasion, the flattery. Pasolini himself regretted the necessity of
these manoeuvres, and - it must be said to his great credit - he wrote as
many or more letters on behalf of others as in his own interest. Still,
these time-consuming machinations make slightly unpleasant reading today;
and, ironically, a great number of such letters survive while, one suspects,
many others, perhaps more personal and more engaging, have been lost or
destroyed or not made available to the editor.
Letters, usually written only for one reader, are hell to translate; in
facing this immense volume Stuart Hood has worked with insight and
sensitivity and, as a whole, his achievement is considerable. Some problems
are insoluble, such as salutations and closings: 'Carissimo' can indeed be
very affectionate, but not always, and similarly 'un abraccio', while it
does indeed mean 'a hug', somehow sounds more physical in English.
In a few moments perhaps of weariness, Hood succumbs to the lure of faux
amis (governante is not 'governess', inchiesta is not 'inquest', attuale is
not 'actual,' and an accelerato, God knows, is not a fast train). But the
feel of the letters is there, and the figure of Pasolini emerges.
Not wholly, of course. To understand him fully, the reader must turn to the
poetry, the prose, the cinema. This book - and the companion volume we can
presumably expect - will be invaluable supplements to the real work. For, as
he knew from the beginning, Pasolini was, before anything else, an artist.

<TEXT>
THE CATHOLIC FAMILIES by Mark Bence-Jones Constable Pounds 19.95, 341 pages
LIKE Arlott on cricket or Elizabeth David on cooking, Mark Bence-Jones'
books about the British aristocracy are well-known for mixing anecdote and
magisterial knowledge into a marvellously engaging read. Today, figures such
as the Duke of Norfolk and the Marquis of Bute belong so recognisably to the
Great and the Good that it is startling to recall for how long Catholics
were shut off from the political and official life of the nation.
The first of the series of Test Acts in 1672 debarred Catholics from holding
office or sitting in parliament. By 1778, though, the date at which
Bence-Jones begins his history, the advantages of not squandering their
fortunes in electioneering had left a surprisingly large number of landed
Catholic families still prosperous despite a century of recusancy fines,
defections to Anglicanism and forfeitures for treason, real or alleged.
Full Catholic emancipation came in 1829, although the first Relief Act of
1778 had made exercising the functions of a Catholic priest or running a
Catholic school no longer an offence punishable with life imprisonment.
The next boost to the Catholic cause came with the Oxford Movement in the
mid-19th century when a rash of defections from Anglican high society had
the aristocratic classes gossiping frantically about who was rumoured to be
wavering and who was next to fall. Curiously, only Disraeli, among the
novelists of the day, seems to have captured the mood of a nation so ill at
ease with itself religiously.
Bence-Jones evokes brilliantly the dawn abductions and last-minute
conversions which featured in this twilight battle for hearts and souls, so
similar in atmosphere (as Graham Greene realised) to the morally ambiguous
world of the modern spy thriller.
Like the true story-teller, Bence-Jones knows when to purple his prose. His
popes have a habit of saying things like 'Sta tranquilla, figlia mia'; his
Catholic youths tend to be slim and elegant, with large and melancholy eyes.
His women seem to fall into three categories: 'pretty and lively', 'ugly but
cheerful' or 'selfish and mean.'
If the elegant youths do not develop into devilishly handsome men (Teddy
Howard, for example, a cardinal and cousin of the Duke of Norfolk, was 'the
best-looking ecclesiastic in Rome'), they become eccentrics like 'Silly
Willy' (William, 10th Lord Clifford of Chudleigh), 'Dirty Bertie' (Cuthbert
Riddell of Swinburne), or Charles Waterton who, despite such habits as
scratching the back of his head with the big toe of his right foot and
pretending to be a dog under the hall table, was furious at being referred
to in the Ornithological Dictionary as 'the eccentric Waterton.'
Combining old-fashioned genealogical history with a marvellous eye for
detail, Bence-Jones covers scandals and trials, from Mrs Fitzherbert's
dangerous liaison with the Prince of Wales to the dowager Lady Tichborne's
search for her elder son, Roger, whom she was determined to believe had not
been lost at sea off the coast of Australia and would one day return.
In response to her advertisements in the Australian press, she received a
letter from a butcher in Wagga Wagga claiming to be Sir Roger Tichborne, her
long-lost son; he had, he said, survived shipwreck and had lived under an
assumed name ever since.
Like the hero of Depardieu's film, The Return of Martin Guerre, the
Claimant, as he was known henceforth, managed to fool most of the people
almost all the time despite inaccuracies such as his education at
'Winchester College, Yorkshire' (to which the dowager replied: 'I think my
poor dear Roger confuses everything in his head').
The Claimant's family knowledge and resemblance probably owed more to his
being a distant illegitimate relation. Despite a wave of public sympathy
surrounding his trial in 1873, he was sentenced to 14 years' imprisonment.
Turning to this century, with the book's examples of selfless public and,
notably, military service, the surface picture is of the Catholic families
increasingly merging with the British establishment. The perspective,
however, is always double: between London and Rome, dominions temporal and
spiritual.
All in all, it is a fascinating history and one which today's whiggishly
agnostic historians have neglected too readily.

THE FATAL LOVER: MATA HARI AND THE MYTH OF WOMEN IN ESPIONAGE by Julia
Wheelwright Collins &amp; Brown Pounds 16.99, 186 pages
IN THE spring of 1917 war-weariness was provoking mutinies among French
troops and strikes among Parisian workers. Official propaganda blamed the
crisis of morale on subversion by enemy agents. At that moment Mata Hari,
the celebrated dancer-courtesan, returned to Paris from Madrid. She was
arrested and charged with espionage. On the morning of October 15 1917 she
was taken from the condemned cell in the Chateau Vincennes; in the courtyard
she requested that her eyes be left unblindfolded and her hands untied. As
the 12 soldiers of the Zouave Regiment raised their rifles, she blew them a
kiss.
In that instant a legend was born. Mata Hari became the archetype of the
seductress-spy whose erotic treachery can betray whole nations. Her memory
was execrated, and she herself feared; rumour whispered that she had escaped
the firing-squad and was still at work. Years later sightings of her were
reported, on trains or abroad.
Was Mata Hari spy or victim? In this absorbing book Julie Wheelwright
proposes an answer. In one sense her conclusion is predictable: Mata Hari
was a victim, and moreover a victim of predictable kinds of male fears and
attitudes. When women are either Madonnas or whores - when they are either
symbols of patriotism, like Edith Cavell, or seductive betrayers - there is
little mercy for any who break the conventions, as Mata Hari did, and use
their sexuality to gain independence.
Mata Hari - Eye of the Dawn in Javanese - made her name as an erotic dancer.
In her most celebrated act she was a Javanese maid who, whipped by priests
for disobedience, escapes from an Indian temple and throws herself naked
before a Hindu idol. In the early years of the century such headiness was
much in vogue. It was the age of the Salome craze, Oriental mysteries, the
Grecian frieze style of movement, nudity and sex tricked out as art. In an
age still avowing although not practising the proprieties, such stuff was
dynamite.
It was after a failed marriage to a Dutch officer called Rudolph Macleod
that Amsterdam-born Margarethe Zelle went to Paris and became Mata Hari.
Macleod had taken her to the East Indies, and one of their two children died
there. The marriage lasted nine years, during which Margarethe suffered at
the hands of her much older husband. Later she claimed that he had been
violent, even to the extent of biting off both her nipples.
Her career was not smooth. In spite of a succession of lovers and occasional
triumphs on stage she was often in need of money. By 1914 her career both as
dancer and courtesan was approaching its natural term, and debts were
mounting. Perhaps this explains much about the events which followed.
In Wheelwright's view, Mata Hari did not spy for Germany. She came under
suspicion because had a predilection for older, influential men, especially
Army officers. Before the war she had an affair with a German officer, and
in the summer of 1914 she did so again while living in Berlin, hoping for
work there. She also had affairs with senior French officers, and a Russian
one. Accordingly, Georges Ladoux, the French intelligence chief, suspected
her of spying, and resolved to make her a double-agent. Between them they
concocted a bizarre scheme to seduce the Kaiser's son.
Perhaps the French authorities really believed Mata Hari was a German spy.
Or perhaps they knew she was merely a fantasist and self-publicist, but
elected to use her as a public sacrifice to the hysteria gripping
war-ravaged France. She was the perfect target: independent, sexual,
threatening, easily characterised as a whore despite her artistic
pretensions - a woman both accusable and disposable.
Such is Wheelwright's view, and she makes a good case. But it remains
possible that Mata Hari's story is more complicated. The evidence in
Wheelwright's book fascinatingly prompts as many questions as it answers.
For in its pages we also meet, by chance, Marthe Richard, another Ladoux
recruit and exponent of 'erotic espionage'. In comparing her own fate with
Mata Hari's, Richard said, 'I got the Legion of Honour and (she) got the
firing squad'. Could this be another case of war's ironic fortunes?

FT  01 AUG 92 / Motoring: A Rover coupe with few rivals
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE majored on luxury, the other on high technology. Both were new arrivals
in niche markets catering for affluent seekers after sportiness and
individuality.
The Rover 800 Coupe is an elegant two-door development of the 800 saloon
that has become Britain's best-selling executive car.
Large two-door saloons - for this, in spite of the coupe tag, is what it is
 -have never been very popular in the UK. In the main, the British like
their big cars to be four door saloons or estates.
So, at Pounds 30,700 including absolutely everything - from automatic
transmission and leather seats to air-conditioning and a radio/tape/six-disc
CD autochanger - the 800 Coupe has few obvious rivals. The only extra listed
is a driver's crash-protection airbag (Pounds 750).
The showroom price of a comparable Mercedes-Benz 300CE equipped to the same
level would be about Pounds 5,000 higher although a three-litre Honda Legend
coupe, with similar goodies to the Rover's but not at all traditionally
British inside, is Pounds 28,995.
The Rover's pale hide, hand-stitched and dark-piped, and plentiful burr
walnut would make a Jaguar (perhaps even a Bentley) driver feel at home.
An 800 Coupe might even be seen as a replacement for a Jaguar four-litre
XJ-S coupe (Pounds 33,442 list with automatic transmission).
This veteran two-door cannot, however, seat four people, not can its boot
swallow two sets of golf clubs in their trolleys.
The Rover Coupe's does, with plenty of space to spare for weekend bags. And
four full-sized people have lounging room in front or back seats.
Mechanically, the 800 Coupe is no different from a Rover Sterling. The
Honda-supplied 2.7-litre, 24-valve, V6 engine puts out a smooth 169
horsepower and is well matched to the four-speed automatic. The suspension
is quite soft and the power-assisted steering very light indeed.
Cruising on the motorway, the 800 Coupe is almost free of wind, tyre or
mechanical noise. Even an open sunroof (does an air-conditioned car need
one?) creates little disturbance in the car.
Like big Rovers of old, it is a typical senior partner's car, unlikely to be
chosen by the press-on-at-all-costs kind of driver. Which makes Rover's
choice of decidedly low-profile, 55 series tyres on 16-inch wheels
surprising and, I suspect, mainly cosmetic.
They give sharp steering response and masses of cornering grip. But a
less-squat tyre would not thump so disturbingly on rough minor roads.

THAT over-used term 'hi-tech' really does apply to the Mitsubishi 3000 GT.
How else can you describe a twin-turbocharged, V6-engined super-car with
four-wheel drive, four-wheel steering, electronically-controlled suspension
and aerodynamic aids that pop up and down according to your speed?
Mitsubishi Motors says its integrated systems (the four-wheel drive and
steering, ABS brakes, electronic regulated suspension and so on) make
driving easier and less stressful. I will second that.
No car with a 155 mph (250 kmh) potential and 0-62 mpg (0-100 kmh)
acceleration time of 5.9 seconds could be more user-friendly.
On busy roads in Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire, it ambled along at 35 mph
(56 kph) in fifth waiting for a moment to overtake.
Slipped into third and right foot down, it leapt forward like a jet fighter.
Used responsibly, nothing could be safer.
At 140 mph (225 kmh), still in Bedfordshire but on the Millbrook proving
ground's two-mile bowl, it felt as relaxed as it had at half that speed on a
dual carriageway.
Pushed hard on a winding, hilly, handling circuit, the 3000 GT's traction,
braking capacity, cornering grip and sheer good manners made it flatteringly
easy to drive.
The V6 that pulls uncomplainingly at little more than 1,000 rpm at 30 mph
(48kmh) in top yowls eagerly and tunefully up to 6,000 rpm and more in the
gears.
For a car on 17-inch wheels and ultra-squat tyres - specially-developed
Dunlop SP Sport 8060s - the 3000 GT rides with surprising shock-absorbency.
It comes with air-conditioning - essential equipment in this kind of car -
and a driver's seat with inflatable bolsters that fit round one's form like
a surgical corset. The rear seats are notional rather than practical but the
tailgate lifts to reveal a fair amount of luggage space.
At Pounds 35,500, a Mitsubishi 3000 GT 2+2 is Pounds 20,000 cheaper than a
mid-engined, strictly two-seat Honda NS-X and around Pounds 4,000 less than
a Porsche 968. But it is dearer than a Nissan 300 ZX (Pounds 32,775) and the
just-announced Subaru SVX (Pounds 27,996).
One hundred 3000 GTs will come to Britain this year and deposits have been
taken already on more than half of them.
The UK market for high-performance sports cars and coupes is not what it
was. From 11,110 in 1990, it fell to 7,481 last year. Only 2,965 were sold
in the first six months of 1992.
Recession, soaring insurance premiums and an increasingly tough response by
police and courts to serious speeding are to blame.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Travel: To swim in the Dead Sea, first store your Sten gun -
Christian Tyler is intrigued and exasperated by Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
DINING on St Peter fish on the promenade at Tiberias, with a bottle of Golan
white at my elbow, the waters of the Sea of Galilee at my feet and a sky of
black velvet overhead, I was ready to sink into a Biblical reverie.
Then the disco cruiseboat, fairy-lit from stem to stern, came throbbing
through the waves. A minute later, two flights of Cobra helicopter gunships,
lights extinguished, clattered across the firmament on their way home from a
retaliatory raid against the PLO in southern Lebanon.
Was this the 'Galilee Experience' promised by the neon sign on the town's
main street?
In the ruins of Caesarea, Herod the Great's Roman city on the Mediterranean
coast, a party of sixth-formers sat on the broken steps of the amphitheatre
to listen to their teacher read from the guidebook. Two of the giggling
girls carried automatic weapons and a curly-haired youth waved a
sub-machinegun.
Down on the Dead Sea shore a soldier in outsize battledress wandered into
the men's changing room of the spa hotel holding his ticket in one hand and
dragging a Sten gun with the other. We helped him cram the oily monster into
a tin locker so that he could undress for his swim.
At the foot of the tel at Megiddo, a mound of earth 25 layers deep in
history, a middle-aged couple from the Ukraine played 18th-century violin
duos. These genteel buskers in the ruins of Armageddon, scraping a living
within earshot of King Solomon's stables, were unemployable Zionist refugees
in the modern state of Israel.
In spite of its profound Biblical associations - ones which still infect the
extremes of national politics - Israel is not a country in which nostalgia
can be indulged for long without the intrusion of the present.
The five-star sites of Christian pilgrimage, such as Nazareth, Bethlehem or
Gethsemane, have been smothered by naive, overblown modern architecture.
Even the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in the Arab quarter of old Jerusalem
is magnificently vulgar.
But the new can never quite subdue the old. Parts of the Galilee lakeshore
remain untouched: you can wander down the grassy Mount of Beatitudes, swim
in the cold water and sit watching the ancient fishing vessels with only
lizards and rock rabbits for company.
Israel is a poor, progressive and neurotic country where past and present
are more entwined than in any other place I can think of. Nothing is more
ancient than the stony hills of Judaea and Samaria in the West Bank and
nothing more modern than the regimental lines of low-rent villas that are
being spread across them by the expansionist Israeli occupiers.
From the inside, Tel Aviv appears a raucous, modern European city. From the
outside it is a sprawling, polluted shambles. In the old city of Jerusalem
you can walk, in three paces, from the scruffy Arab souk to the triumphantly
restored Jewish quarter with its spanking new piazzas and condominiums.
Israelis have treated their past well: their museums must rank with the best
in the West. But it is the present that preoccupies them. My guide, a
paratrooper when on reserve duty ('elite corps,' he said, proudly patting a
middle-aged spread) and veteran of the 1981 invasion of Lebanon, was
irritatingly and charmingly typical. Like many younger Israelis, he is
agnostic, lives in Tel Aviv with a smart lawyer wife and would never dream
of moving to the holy city so long as the ultra-Orthodox have such influence
there. He laughed as he pointed out a kibbutz where pigs are raised, and I
am sure was not above eating the occasional 'white steak' himself.
He stood respectfully to one side as a party of nuns took turns to kiss the
stone at the spot where Christ's crucifix is supposed to have stood and was
assiduous in his pursuit of other Christian shrines. But it was in the
border areas - by the fence at Metulla where soldiers slept in the sun after
night patrol in Lebanon, or driving past the minefields and deserted
barracks of the Golan Heights - that he really came alive.
We scrambled over a bunker, now a tourist showpiece, from where the Syrians
used to lob mortar shells into the kibbutz below. Why, I asked him, were
women and children allowed to live within range of the Syrian artillery, or
of the Katyusha rockets from Lebanon, or of the PLO guerrillas who crept
through the perimeter fence at night to cut their throats?
'This is our land,' he replied. 'Should we not be allowed to live on it?'
He exhibited a characteristic Israeli chauvinism, not necessarily or
primarily anti-Arab, in which everything built or planted since 1948 was due
to 'us.' 'Here you see an Arab village,' he would say, 'but up here we are
building a Jewish village. One day it will be a big town.' Or: 'Here we have
planted eucalyptus trees; there we are growing new kinds of tropical fruit.'
Even the migrant storks that flocked over the fields became 'our storks.'
Israelis are still reluctant to visit Arab east Jerusalem after dark or to
shop in the Old City, even though the Arab uprising in the occupied
territories, the intifada, has subsided and the peace talks have been
revived by Labour's win against the hardliners of the Likud party in the
recent general election.
Provided they are reasonably careful, however, tourists need not feel too
inhibited. Israelis will discourage them from venturing into the Arab towns
of the West Bank (where the reality of the occupation is on show), but most
difficulties can be overcome by simply hiring a Palestinian taxi with West
Bank licence plates.
There, on the Jericho road or along the Jordan valley, tourists will find
enough to satisfy the hungriest appetite for Biblical tableaux: flocks of
sheep and goats driven by children, peasant farmers in their smallholdings,
wayside encampments of bedouin.
But even more compelling for me is the evidence of the present: the remains
of Israel's bloody birth, the aggressive, intense yet self-critical
behaviour of its people, the continuing conflict between ancient claims and
modern democratic sensibilities. It is that which makes Israel so intriguing
and exasperating.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Travel: A dark and mysterious Irish ritual
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS DUSK falls at this time of year, a group of men dressed in camouflaged
jackets and hats regularly gathers on Inchy Bridge, a peaceful spot on the
Argideen river about 20 miles south-west of Cork in southern Ireland.
There is an almost clandestine ritual about these meetings. Names like
Connemara Black, Bloody Butcher, Silver Teal, Keyhole, Strawberry Ivy and
Big Flat crop up like codewords in the conversation.
Then, as it gets dark, heads are counted. There is discussion as to whether
lots should be drawn. Most of the dozen that have gathered are locals, but
one is a Welshman who has arrived with his teenage son. 'Ye look as though
you've done this bifore,' says a voice in a West Cork brogue. The Welshman
nods agreement. There are grunts of approval. A few sidelong glances are
cast at my denim jeans and shiny, new Wellington boots.
'Yer man here is new. It's his forst time. Maybe he should go down by the
Metal,' says another. They decide to draw lots. There is a distant rumble of
thunder. Below the bridge, above the steady gurgle of the river, a splash is
preceded by the silver flash of a fish as it leaps from the water.
These people are fly-fishermen. From now until October, the sea trout which
is their prize return from their winter ocean habitats to spawn in the
upstream pools where they themselves began life just a year or two before.
The sea trout is renowned as one of the shiest fish to take a bait, and then
usually only at night.
Connemara Black, Silver Teal and Bloody Butcher are the artificial flies
that are painstakingly assembled by the enthusiast to resemble the real
flies the discerning trout will, on occasion, rise to. I was there, an
impressive two hours' instruction in the art of fly casting behind me, to
try my luck with the veterans.
The Argideen river is now one of the best sea trout rivers in Ireland,
especially since the collapse of sea-trout angling on west coast rivers,
which has been blamed on sea-lice infestations spreading from salmon farms.
In May a fishing lodge opened for business on the river, the first and only
one of its kind, as permits are jealously controlled by the local anglers'
association.
It is owned and run by Tim Severin, the travel writer, explorer and author,
who has lived in the area for 20 years. The lodge consists of four cottages
built from the converted granary of an old mill. They offer self-catering
accommodation for up to six people in each, though only one rod permit is
available per lodge. The lodges are fully-equipped and tastefully decorated
with a view to attracting not just fly fishermen but their families as well.
Nearby attractions include horse riding, hill walking and boating.
For the anglers, though, the Inchy Bridge ritual is the focus and start of
each night's sport. It is at Inchy Bridge that the fishing spots along the
two-and-a-half mile fishery are assigned for the night. Big Flat, Keyhole
and Metal are the names given to various deep pools which the sea-trout
frequent on their journey upstream. Then, armed with a whippy piece of
carbon-fibre, 20 yards of thick, rubbery line at the end of which is tied
the fly, and a map for newcomers, the anglers step gingerly along the river
bank.
The sea-trout taunt the fishermen. Swirls and splashes in the water confirm
their presence. Flies are cast and drawn back across the pools and current
and then patiently recast time and again.
A few yards down the river bank there is a murmur of excitement. 'Have you
caught one?' whispers an excited voice. 'To be sure I have. It's 25 ft long
and full o' leaves,' came the reply from an angler grappling with a tree
behind him in the darkness.
As the night wears on, the leaps of the trout disappear as they tire of the
game. Only the swish of the rods can be heard. As night stretches into the
early hours, only the optimists remain by the riverbank and even they head
for their beds a few hours before dawn. As I grope for the path back to the
lodge, there is a swirl of water behind and a loud splash. Then another. I
seriously start to believe that sea-trout have a sense of humour.
Not all of them have the last laugh, though. An average of 400 per year have
been caught in the Argideen over the past 10 years. In 1933, one man fishing
at Inchy Bridge caught 53 sea-trout weighing 135 lbs, says a leaflet of the
Argideen Anglers Association. A donkey and cart was used to carry them away.
Such stories undoubtedly help to enrich a sport that is arcane to most but
an obsession to a few. Yet there is an infectious and intriguing appeal
about attempting to lure one of these cunning creatures onto the hook, even
if you return it to the water again.
Prices range from IPounds 145 per week per lodge at either end of the
May-October season to IPounds 310 per week in July and August, and are
remarkably good value.

FT  01 AUG 92 / How To Spend It: Rituals of a truly British summer - The
latest ideas for the great outdoors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
IN THE days when these things were taken seriously gentlemen were out of
town in the summer, or so the 19th century Gentleman's Handbook of Etiquette
informs me: '. . . or if he cannot afford to do so, he merely closes his
window-shutters, and appears to be gone.'
Nowadays, such are the benefits of democratic capitalism, it is not only
gentlemen who go out of town in the summer.
Whether it is Cowes or the Open, Goodwood or the Cumbrian Hills, Henley or
the Scottish moors, the big outdoor events of summer attract everyone from
the hoi polloi to tycoons and aristos.
August usually signals the start of the biggest exodus - what with Cowes,
the highlight of the year for the navy blazer set, running from the 1st to
the 8th and the 12th marking the start of the bird-slaughtering season. It
is also the month when Scotland is often at its glorious best.
Those who are regular habitues at any or all of these events will need
little advice or help for me. For almost all these tribal gatherings the
rituals are long-established, the nuances of dress and behaviour long honed
by convention and practice.
However, every now and again something new enters the field and even the
most traditional and well-established of companies has to take fresh stock
of its ranges. Here are just a few of some of the best and newest ideas
around . . .

THOSE who are heading north of the border might like to know that Hunters of
Brora has used three of its sturdy 22 oz Carrol tweeds to make four
splendidly rugged looking bags.
Colours are the soft hues of the Scottish highlands - gentle greens, browns,
mustards and heather - and the lining is of an olive green canvas. The
trimmings are leather. The Weekend Bag, photographed here, is 25 in long by
13 ins wide by 12 in deep - small enough to slip under the seat on the
flight to Edinburgh or Inverness, yet large enough for most weekend needs.
With an outside pocket and a clip-on shoulder strap it is Pounds 175.
The Cartridge Bag can be used as a country handbag. Made from one of three
Carrol tweeds, it is 12 in wide by 10 in deep and sells for Pounds 69.50.
The Country Bag, with two outside pockets, is big enough to carry books or
maps, fishing reels and fly boxes (Pounds 89.50). The Rambler Bag, a bit
larger than its country cousin, is large enough to take a packed lunch,
binoculars, cameras and maps and costs Pounds 149.50. Visitors to Brora in
Inverness can buy them personally from the shop or tel: 0408-621366.

WHEN IT comes to guns the trade is hoping for boom times. The established
leaders in the field, James Purdey and Holland &amp; Holland seem to have a head
start over their rivals.
Customers from Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong and the US, are happy to join an
18-month waiting list for a pair of hand-built guns and pay Pounds 50,500
plus VAT simply to own guns by the hallowed names.
Nevertheless, Asprey, the jewellers, in spite of the most unpropitious
economic climate,has opened a gun room and now has its own craftsmen
building sidelocks to the finest specification.
As Edward Asprey, director in charge of the project, puts it: 'With other
top London gun-makers around there was no point in us making guns unless we
could match them for quality. I believe we have.
'London guns are still sought-after the world-over and with so many of the
old names now gone we feel quite sure there is room for us in the market,
too.
Edward Asprey is a keen shot. He started with an airgun and graduated to
shooting tin plates thrown by his father with a No. 2 saloon gun. There
seems almost nothing he does not know about the sport.
'We have gone to immense trouble to make sure we give value for money. A
pair of guns will cost Pounds 61,000 (inc VAT) but they will be deep-scroll
engraved, will be self-opening, hand-built and will be presented in their
own double leather case.'
With such a new operation (the gun room only opened last November) you might
think you could buy a gun in a hurry - alas no, the waiting list at Asprey
is already up to 14 months.
Those who are not in need of guns, but are seeking some of the appurtenances
the sport requires, might like to know that there are very posh cartridges
(from 12 bore to .410 calibre) with Asprey written all over them, as well as
immensely chic leather cartridge bags and belts.
Needless to say, like any proper gun-maker, the gun-room will repair and
overhaul, doing anything from restocking to rebarrelling.
For clothing, Asprey turned to Gieves &amp; Hawkes, feeling that the expertise
of a professional tailor was required. So, there is now an exclusive range
of shooting suits which can be bought off-the-peg or made-to-measure.
The gun room at Asprey has its own entrance at 23 Albemarle Street, London
W1X.

BANKS MAY fold, pension funds disappear, company profits tumble but, judging
by the activity among purveyors of traditional country clothing and
accessories, taking pot shots at birds, stalking deer and casting for salmon
goes on for ever.
Even now the keen shot is oiling his gun, bringing his plus-fours out of the
wardrobe and packing his bags, ready to head for hill and heather.
When it comes to clothing most aficionados know that the old names are the
safest. They may safely put themselves and their needs in their hands,
confident that in their clothing and accessories they will breach no rules,
offend no etiquette.
At Holland &amp; Holland, 31 Bruton Street, London W1, there has been a great
deal of new activity since it was taken over by Chanel last year.
It has always had a good collection of traditional country wear but, this
season it has its first own-label collection, all British-made, on sale.
As women shots are increasingly being allowed to do more on the moor than
just see to the lunch, proper shooting clothing for women is a necessity
and, in September (sadly not in time for the glorious 12th) Holland &amp;
Holland will have tweed jackets which can be teamed with tweed breeches,
skirts or trousers in two or three colours.
Chaps, though, can get themselves splendidly kitted out - the shooting suit
pictured (above left) comes in two different tweeds. Its particular
claim-to-fame is that it has a phitwell, or cross-gartering elastic, across
the shoulder blades, making it splendidly easy to raise the arm to take aim.
They can be bought off-the-peg or made-to-measure, from Pounds 1,350.
There is also a splendid collection of unisex weatherwear which is designed
to cope with the kind of foul weather that seems to go hand in hand with
shooting, deer-stalking and fishing.
Made from 100 per cent waterproof traditional mackintosh fabric, it is lined
in old-fashioned Austrian Loden - not as breathable as Goretex, but warmer
and, of course, completely waterproof.
It comes in all sorts of shapes and lengths, from full-length raincoats, to
three-quarter length coats and jackets.
Some have quilted linings with detachable hoods, others have special pockets
for carrying dog leads, for wet gloves and no doubt even for stuffing away
the odd bird. Prices start at Pounds 325.
Footwear is important. Before the war, it seems, gentlemen wore leather
boots or puttees; today a gentleman might look at Holland &amp; Holland's
Churchill shoes, photographed above left.
Water-resistant, with very strong grip soles, they are Pounds 295.
Photographed beside them is a selection of shooting stockings, Pounds 55 a
pair. If it is really likely to be damp and cold leather-lined wellington
boots are the real chill-beaters.
Gieves &amp; Hawkes pukka shooting gear has been developed exclusively for
Asprey (as I report elsewhere on the page) but, being long-established
gentlemen's tailors, there has always been a good selection of traditional
country wear.
For this winter Gieves &amp; Hawkes has brought out a collection of country
clothing that can be happily and fashionably worn both on and off the grouse
moor.
Photographed top right are some selections from the collection. A waxed
cotton sleeves gilet jacket (Pounds 225) is worn over a pure wool crew neck
sweater (Pounds 125). The shirt is pure cotton (Pounds 49), the tie, pure
silk (Pounds 45) while the brown check plus-twos (less conspicuously full
than plus-fours) are in pure wool and cost Pounds 150.
Hands and feet get very cold on those damp moors so the soft leather
shooting gloves with silk linings sound worth the Pounds 65 outlay. The
leather-lined Wellington boots are Pounds 180. Shooting stockings (never,
call them socks) come in various colours and patterns and cost Pounds 59 a
time while the essential garters are Pounds 7.50. Gieves &amp; Hawkes are at No.

<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COWES WEEK this year will be much enlivened by the presence of the fleet of
ten identical 67-ft yachts which will race against each other in the British
Steel Challenge Yacht Race around the world starting on September 26.
The race is the brainchild of Chay Blyth who did a bit of lateral thinking
on yacht racing.
Whereas most races are determined by a combination of hi-tech nautical
engineering and the crew's skill, with very often the competitor with the
most money to throw at the problem coming in first, this race, for the first
time, pits ten identical yachts (with hulls made from British Steel and
designed by David Thomas) against each other.
In other words, for the first time, the skill, drive and determination of
the crew should determine the winners.
What further makes the whole enterprise so interesting is that although each
yacht is skippered by a properly-trained yachtsman the rest of the crew on
each boat are all amateur volunteers They are from every walk of life -
dentists, doctors, carpenters, policemen, solicitors, secretaries, vets,
crane-drivers, funeral directors, and chefs - each with his or her own
reason for wanting to spend the next eight months in some of the most
uncomfortable conditions known to man.
All this should give the social set something a little different to think
about as they make their merry way from boat to shore, dexterously changing
from seafaring togs to black-tie and back again.
As anybody who has ever been to Cowes knows, the matter of dress is of
crucial importance. Real sailing gear should, above all, look properly
broken in - nothing too bright or too new should ever hit the deck. And when
it comes to colour there is really no choice - the colours of the Senior
Service have always been navy-blue and white and they are hard to beat.
Sensibly, when it came to designing a range of functional, tough sailing
gear suitable for every nautical mood from bone-aching arctic winds to
scalding tropics, Uffindell &amp; West stuck to these tried and tested colours.
Made by Kent &amp; Curwen, the sportswear specialists, the range offers
something for anybody who likes messing around in boats as well as for those
who just like to dress down at home.
Reasonably priced, at Pounds 35 for a sweatshirt, Pounds 26 for a piquet
polo shirt, Pounds 28 for Bermuda shorts, Pounds 39 for jogger pants, it is
all good sturdy stuff.
As you can see from the photograph here, the range is for men and women,
much of it, like the T-shirts and polo shirts are unisex, but all of it
designed not for show but for comfort and practicality.
It can be bought by mail by telephoning 0793-706888 or by writing to
Uffindell &amp; West, PO Box 200, SN2 5BD.

FT  01 AUG 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Take me out to the ball game - Peter
Berlin attends a Cuba-America baseball clash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN

<TEXT>
THE Barcelona Games are far too friendly. There are no boycotts and no
political protests. Sport's Cold War is over. Instead, the competition is
full of plucky, freshly independent little republics. Barcelona is crawling
with friendly fans from around the globe. Everyone is cheering, no one is
booing.
This niceness is growing wearying. So, this week, I went to the baseball, to
see the US take on Cuba.
Baseball is America's national game, but at the Olympics the US team of
college boys is David against the Goliath of Cuba's amateur world champions.
What I found was a very drab baseball game.
Hospitallet is a glum municipality whose share of the Olympic pork barrel is
a lovely little ball park plonked in a field a mile south of the town's
glummest fringe. There, fans do the Mexican wave even though the stands only
border half the field.
The public address system plays raucous Cajun and country and western music
between innings. And a full house sat unti 1am noisily enjoying a slowly and
badly played game draw to a predictable close long after the last busses and
trains had stopped running.
The college boys started well. They took a 5-0 lead in the first inning
thanks to a home run by Michael Tucker and two fielding errors. Antonio
Pacheco hit a bases loaded home run in the third inning: 5-4.
Suddenly the Americans began to play like the college kids they are rather
than the major league millionaires they will be. They committed one basic
fielding error after another. The score only stayed close because the Cubans
matched them almost error for error.
After Pacheco's home run, I headed for the stands where I was way-layed by
Angelo, Ilyana and Francisco, three Cubans who live in Barcelona. As Cuba
scored twice in the fourth inning to take the lead, their fans danced in the
aisles, shouting, singing and waving flags.
'Everyone here is for Cuba,' said Ilyana. 'The Spaniards are for Cuba. The
children are for Cuba. Even the Americans are for Cuba.'
Well, not quite everyone. Two rows away sat a group from Palm Beach,
Florida, some of them slowly drinking beer. Very occasionally one would aim
a cheerful taunt at the Cuban fans.
They were used to Cubans, said one of the Floridians. 'We've got them coming
in all the time, floating in on boats, guys who couldn't make this baseball
team.'
I sat in an empty seat, notebook in hand. Directly behind me was the biggest
and noisiest American. His first yell almost took my head off. His name was
Scott Benedict.
Benedict had cast a knowledgeable eye over the Cubans. He had timed them
running the previous day and had been impressed by their speed. He also
approved of their approach. 'I like the Cubans. They know how to play the
game.'
The game ended at 1am, 9-6 to Cuba. Fans from around the world, who had come
together to share four hours of tedium, applauded, then went their separate
ways.

YESTERDAY I went for a stroll through the Olympic Village. It is jammed with
human beings from five continents and 172 countries. As the number of
Olympic events and participating nations grows, so does the variety of human
shapes, sizes, colours and physical abilities. The 11,000 athletes gathered
here probably form the largest and most differentiated collection of genetic
types assembled in any one place in human history.
I ambled past beefy Samoans, mustachioed Turks, lithe Indonesians, wild
Mongolians, coal-black Sudanese and cool blond Finns. There was even a
Liverpudlian or two. If my powers of identification seem miraculous, the
explanation is easy: all athletes in the Village wear plastic identity cards
around their necks.
What the cards do not indicate, though, is the sport each athlete practises.
I began to play my own Olympic game, guessing from body type the sport that
each passer-by played.
Some were easy. Sky-scraping black Americans such as David Robinson can only
be basketball players. The Australian swimmer I saw could be identified by
her broad shoulders, good tan and hair turned a greeny-blond by chlorinated
pools.
Marathon runners like Rosa Mota seem to have a thin, haggard look even
before they run. High jumpers are the general shape of string beans.
Weightlifters such as Turkey's Naim Suleymanoglu have thighs like hams.
Other guesses were more difficult. Really practised sports-spotters, I am
told, can even pick out archers. Britain's Steve Hallard, for example, has
slightly lop-sided shoulders, thickened fingers and a calloused chin from a
lifetime of hefting bows and drawing bowstrings.
Although the Russians once spent much time and effort with a
scientifically-designed computer programme to discover the 'ideal' athletic
type - and came up with 6ft, 14 1/2 -stone Olympic sprinter Valeri Borzov -
there is not an individual in the world with a morphology that answers
perfectly to the countless different physical demands of all sports.
None the less, in a world filled with unending human variation there are
individuals whose exceptional body make-up allows them to excel as sportsmen
and women in one field or another.
What makes a top class athlete? The first answer must be genetics. We are
either born with superlative athletic ability or we are not. We can improve
our bodies to some extent, but not beyond their genetic limitations.
Most of us could train until we dropped and still follow only very distantly
in the footsteps of British sprinter Linford Christie, who has hopes of a
medal.
But simple muscle power is not enough. We all have 'slow-twitch' and
'fast-twitch' muscles, in about equal proportions. High-performance athletes
are different. Sprinters have a very high proportion of fast-twitch muscle
for explosive bursts of energy. Marathoners, on the other hand, are all slow
twitch for endurance. Christie could never be a good marathon runner, nor
could Kenya's hope for marathon gold, Ibrahim Hussein, be a sprinter.
Nor does Christie necessarily have the oxygen uptake capacity that all
endurance athletes require. Genetics determine our blood's ability to absorb
oxygen and carry it to the muscles. Sprinters or weightlifters do not need
high aerobic capacity - they work with oxygen already in their systems - but
distance runners, rowers, cross-country skiers and cyclists do.
Physical flexibility is another critical variable. So is hand-eye
co-ordination. If there are individuals whose specific physical make-up
allows them to excel in certain sports, are there groups of people sharing
common genetic characteristics that similarly excel? More precisely, are
there certain races that have natural sporting advantages?
In a perfect, just and racially unbiased world, the question would be
logical and innocent enough. In the world as it actually exists, it is a
question fraught with 1,000 hazards.
Walking around the Olympic Village, one cannot but be struck by the physical
appearance of black athletes. To the eye they are bigger, stronger and more
muscled than most other athletes.
In certain sporting events they dominate. In the 100 metres final at the
1991 Tokyo world championships, six men clocked under 10 seconds. All eight
runners in the final were black. East Africans today are leaders in distance
running. Blacks are conspicuously absent, on the other hand, in some sports
 -a black American has yet to win an international swimming event, for
example.
I have talked to sports physiologists (they prefer not to be named) who
assure me that blacks - African Americans, Afro-Caribbeans and Africans -
are indeed better physically endowed than other races.
Many things about them, they say, are different: their bone structure, their
body-limb ratios, the length and mass of their musculation, their body fat
content, their bio-chemistry.
The fact is, however, that no research on sports performance by racial
category has been conducted since Hitler's attempts to prove Aryan racial
superiority. Other considerations aside, such studies are politically
unacceptable; no research body in the world would receive funding for such
studies.
On the other hand, there is much evidence to suggest that superlative sports
performance by blacks is sociologically determined. Kenyan distance runners
may excel because they spent childhoods running to school at high altitudes.
For many US and British blacks, sport has been a ticket out of the ghetto. A
winner is accepted into society whatever his colour.
There is also a bandwagon effect in sport. If an American black won a gold
medal for swimming, every black kid on the block in Harlem would start
looking at swimming pools in a different way, if he had access to one.
But certain sports bring more money and prestige than others. American male
volleyball and swimming teams at the Olympics are white-dominated. If they
produced as much financial reward and respect among the black American
community as basketball, the US volleyball and swimming teams might have as
many black stars as US basketball's Dream Team.
Above and beyond sociology, there are two considerations that make a
nonsense of racial superiority in sport. The first is that athletes of any
colour are not representative of broad racial characteristics. They are
1-in-1m genetic exceptions whose make-up bears no relation to any means or
averages. They stand outside racial considerations.
The second is not physiological, but mental. In high-level competition there
is little difference between the muscle power, oxygen up-take or
co-ordination of individuals. At this standard of competition, what very
often makes the difference between a winner and a loser is mental attitude:
a ferocious will to win and the ability to perform under pressure.
This, and not an athlete's origins, is what makes Olympic competition the
exciting spectacle and massive gamble that it is.

FT  01 AUG 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Spanish organisation delivering the
Games goods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPANISH yachting has become a metaphor for the nation's Olympic pride.
Halfway into the Games, events are going as well as any Spaniard dare hope,
with a clutch of gold medal chances at sea and barely a stumble elsewhere.
Organisation, backed by investment, is delivering the Olympic goods.
In men's 470 dinghies, helmsman Jordi Calafat and his crew Francisco Sanchez
have posted an extraordinary record in the first four races of this most
competitive class. Any 'Anglo' given to comments about the erratic
brilliance of the Hispanic nations has to argue with Calafat's record of
three firsts and a tenth. At the fourth-race stage they were 21.4 points
clear as overall leaders, with Britons Paul Brotherton and Andy Hemmings in
second place.
'We are going to keep taking risks in order to win, but we have to be calm -
tranquil enough not to make mistakes,' said Calafat ashore after another
victory.
In women's 470 dinghies, Theresa Zabell, a resident of Barcelona though born
in Ipswich, has posted a record nearly as impressive as Calafat's. A first,
second and third have put her in second place overall. Were it not for a
premature start in her first race this supremely aggressive 27-year-old
computer programmer, currently world champion in 470's, would undoubtedly be
lying first.
King Juan Carlos's passion for sailing has been passed on to his children
(the Infanta Christina crewed the women's 470 in Seoul) and, apparently, the
Spanish people. Yesterday he was at sea with his eldest daughter Elena and
the King of Greece watching the Soling race. But more important than a royal
lead has probably been the sponsorship of the national sailing squad by
Fortuna cigarettes.
This division of the giant state-owned Tabacalera tobacco company has
provided the yachting squad with around Pounds 6m over four years. 'Sailors
have had a salary, the best boats and equipment, plus two years of sailing
out of the Olympic harbour in Barcelona,' said an executive.
The local Olympic organising committee itself is also benefitting from the
undoubted success of the Games to date. A week ago Barcelonans were still
grumbling about the income tax increases that start on Monday to help pay
for the Olympic festival. However, seven days of praise from ordinary
visitors, the media and even the august International Olympic Committee
(IOC) has persuaded many citizens to walk tall and not count the cost of the
party for a month or two.
'The IOC are hot, tired - and loving it. They think the Barcelona Games are
splendid,' said one official who has been holed up with the elite in the
closely-guarded Princess Sophia hotel. However, travel to distant sites has
been onerous in the heatwave, and the transport provided has tended to be
the only weakish link in the Olympic chain.
For once the sailors have not been the distant poor relations of the Games.
That lot has fallen to the rowers in the lakeside town of Banyoles, 155km
north-east of Barcelona.
Some of them are unlikey to care. So far it has been a somewhat more
successful week for Britain's rowers than the experts had been predicting.
Of course, Steven Redgrave and his latest partner Mathew Pinsent can be
depended upon like a Swiss watch. In their coxless pairs semi-final they
beat main rivals Germany by over two seconds and Redgrave declared himself
delighted to have achieved such pyschological superiority ahead of today's
final.
'We were thrilled to see that the three medallists from the world
championships were drawn in our race as it gave us a very good feel for how
the final will go,' said Redgrave.
In tomorrow's men's eights final, an inexperienced British team has done a
remarkable job to be ranked third.
Many rowers from countries not in the medal hunt will be at least as
interested in the plans Denis Oswald, president of FISA, the sport's
governing body, unveils later today. Olympic president Juan Antonio
Samaranch has been warning rowing for some time that it has too many
classes, too many different types of boat and costs too much to fit
comfortably into an Olympic movement committed to slimming itself. Oswald
may announce a savage voluntary diet.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A relative of mine has a coin which she acquired many years ago and has now
been valued at in excess of Pounds 10,000. If she sold the coin, could she
be liable for capital gains tax? I understand that sterling is non-taxable
normally, but does this apply if the coin is no longer legal tender? She
acquired the coin in pre-decimalisation days.
Yes, demonetised coins are within the scope of CGT. Your relative will find
general guidance in the free pamphlet CGT14 (Capital gains tax: an
introduction) which is obtainable from tax inspectors' offices. The free
pamphlet CGT16 (Indexation allowance: disposals after 5 April 1988) will
also be helpful.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
My student son, having completed his BA, now intends attending another
university for one year for his MA. If he lets his house on a short-hold
tenancy, what does he need to do to protect his position?
What tax relief can he claim (he now qualifies for the Pounds 30,000 - the
mortgage is Pounds 31,000)? What would be the tax position on any profile?
The solicitor who draws up the tenancy agreement will be able to guide your
son through the pitfalls, and on matters such as obtaining the mortgagees'
consent and notifying the insurers. The solicitor will also guide him on the
tax aspects of the letting.
If the house is let furnished, an arbitrary wear and tear allowance of 10
per cent of the rent will be given - as explained briefly in the free
pamphlet IR87(1991), which should still be obtainable from local tax
offices. Your son could also ask for pamphlet CGT14 (entitled Owner-occupied
houses) from which you will see that the letting may not result in any
prospective CGT liability on the eventual sale of the house. This again, is
something which the solicitor will be able to explain in detail.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As a non-resident of UK domicile, I am aware of the desirability of changing
income sources before my return to the UK. What is the position concerning
those gilt edged stocks which are tax free to non-residents and on the
national savings register (interest paid gross)?
The basic reason for disposing of income-sources (and other chargeable
assets, such as non-sterling bank balances) before the tax year in which one
will become resident in the UK - again or for the first time, is to avoid
any prospective Capital Gains Tax charge on gains which have accrued while
one was non-resident. There is therefore no need to dispose of gilts,
because they are exempt from CGT (under section 115(1)(a) of the Taxation of
Chargeable Gains Act 1992). For gilts on the national savings register,
which are tax free to non residents, the preceding-year basis (under section
64 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, in conjunction with section
47 of that Act) means that there will be no tax liability on the holdings
for the first year of ordinary residence in the UK.

Preserving wealth. Large sums of money need effective management to provide
income and capital growth. You might feel that your surviving spouse or
children could be tempted to spend too much too quickly and not know how to
manage money, nor know who to appoint to manage it for them.
Controlling wealth - say, providing for a dependant during his or her life
while also preserving the capital for others. For example, a trust can
provide for a wife for life and, thereafter, for the children.
Providing pensions for retired employees and their dependants.
Facilitating investment through unit
trusts. Trustees can buy holdings in several companies and invite the public
to buy 'units' or shares in the trust fund.
Making provision for causes or non-human objects.
Making a secret provision, such as for an out-of-wedlock child or lover.
Enabling land to be held for people who cannot own it personally.
Reducing tax in the UK and
abroad.
Protecting assets from creditors (but only if the trust was set up without
this in mind.)
Avoiding the fixed succession rules of other countries.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: So you want to set up a trust . . . -
Caroline Garnham explains how they work and their varied uses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE GARNHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR MANY, a trust is an alien concept shrouded in legal mumbo-jumbo. But a
trust can be used effectively to overcome many complex practical problems to
avoid tax legitimately, in Britain and elsewhere and preserve and protect
wealth.
The box shows the many and varied uses of trusts. Although their purposes
may differ widely, the basic principles and rules governing them are more or
less the same.
There are three parties to a trust: the settlor, the trustees, and the
beneficiaries.
The settlor
The role of the settlor, whether a munificent grandfather or a reluctant
employer, is to provide the funds and dictate his or her wishes via the
trust deed.
Before setting up a trust, you must know why you want to do so; who should
benefit, even in unusual circumstances such as family members dying out of
chronological order; the work, obligations and functions of the trustees;
the scope of the trustees' investment powers (even if not immediately
exercisable); and the scope of their liability.
Certainly, you should never sign a trust deed for which you have not given
instructions or do not understand the contents. It is also not advisable to
allow your trustee to draw up a trust deed for you unless you are advised
separately. Trustees are concerned to limit their liability, whereas your
concern is to keep the trustees on their toes. There is, therefore, a
conflict of interest.
As a settlor, you should also be clear in your mind before starting about
the consequences of setting up a trust. The settlor and tax
The two taxes of which you should be most wary are capital gains (CGT) and
inheritance tax (IHT). CGT is chargeable on a gift, regardless of how little
or how much money changes hands. The gain is calculated according to the
market value of the funds being transferred. But there are exceptions and
deferrals depending on:
1. Your status as the settlor. If you are not resident in the UK, you will
not have to pay CGT. If you are resident but not domiciled, tax is not
payable if the assets transferred are physically outside the UK at the time
they are transferred into the trust.
2. What property is being transferred. There are exemptions for heritage or
business property, and for a main residence.
IHT is not usually payable on lifetime gifts unless you die within seven
years. There is, however, one important exception. IHT is payable if
property is put into a discretionary trust, other than an accumulation and
maintenance trust, even if the trust is offshore.
A discretionary trust is one where the trustees are allowed to pay the
income to one or more people and/or when the trustees can accumulate the
income. An accumulation and maintenance trust is a form of discretionary
trust but it is different for IHT purposes so long as certain conditions are
met. One is that all the beneficiaries must be under 25.
The 1992 Finance Act introduced two important exemptions to IHT for business
property and agricultural property, which now attract 100 per cent relief.
Finding a trustee
As a settlor, you choose the trustees. A good trustee is usually someone who
is not only skilled at managing the trust assets but would take a keen
interest in the well-being of the beneficiaries. So, it is advisable for
trustees to have regular meetings to discuss the needs of the beneficiaries
and the state of the investments.
Virtually anyone can be a trustee, including the settlor and their spouse.
In some cases, it will be necessary to appoint a professional trustee. You
should ask them not only what their professional qualifications are for
managing the trust fund but how they would keep in touch with the needs and
circumstances of the beneficiaries.
The duties of trustees are determined by law and the trust deed. But,
briefly, they have a duty to manage the trust with as much care as an
ordinary prudent man of business would use in the management of his own
affairs. They also have a duty to pay the right sum to the right
beneficiaries. If they mismanage the funds and make a loss, or pay the wrong
amount to the wrong person, they could be forced to make up any shortfall
from their own pockets.
Unless there is a provision within the trust deed, they cannot expect to be
paid for their services.
The trustees are also liable for the tax on the trust fund. The amount
depends on several factors including what type of trust it is; whether the
settlor is also a beneficiary; whether the trust can be revoked; whether the
children of the settlor can benefit, and what ages they are; where the trust
is resident, etc.
The tax system in the UK is well defined and clear, albeit somewhat
unexpected on occasions. For example, if you set up a trust offshore and
remain non-UK domiciled, the trust will be free of CGT and IHT provided the
fund is kept outside the UK.
The situation becomes more confused when trusts are used by people in
countries which do not understand the concept of a trust. More and more
people are trying to take advantage of this confusion in their home country;
as a result, trusts are now being set up by residents of European countries
and elsewhere as part of local tax-planning schemes.
Beneficiaries
If you are a beneficiary, you have probably the least active and most
rewarding role in the trust. Apart from a right to call for information
about its administration, and to sue the trustees for breach of trust, you
need do little except wait until the money comes in. Invariably, tax is not
payable, unless you also are the settlor, until the money is received.
If there is some flexibility in the trust, it might be possible to defer
receipt of your share until you are non-UK resident so that tax can be
avoided. But before embarking on any such scheme, you should first check to
see whether, by saving British tax, you do not fall foul of another
country's tax regime as a result. Legal status of trusts
A trust is very different from any other legal concept. It is not a separate
legal entity, like a company or a Lichtenstein foundation; nor is it based
on the law of contract. In countries which do not understand the legal
concept of a trust, like Switzerland, the rights of a beneficiary can be
difficult to enforce unless the trust is expressed to be governed by a law
which recognises trusts, such as UK law.
The trust is also a different legal concept from that of agency. If I give
you my property to sell as my agent, I can at any time cancel this
arrangement and demand my property back. The same is not true of a trust.
The main difference between a trust and an agency is that the trustee owns
the property legally, even though he does not own it for himself. It is
important, therefore, that where a trust is used to avoid tax, the settlor
is not seen to create an agency by controlling the trustees.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Boats for all seasons - Nick
Garnett meets an old-fashioned craftsman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK GARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PETER Freebody's cavernous and dusty shed on the Thames at Hurley, with its
cobwebbed corners and persistent creepers poking through the wooden planking
from the mass of undergrowth outside, is hardly a microcosm of anything. But
in this tiny, old-fashioned corner of British industry, where Freebody makes
and restores fine, hand-crafted wooden boats, the distinct whiff of
Britain's recession mingles with that of the varnish his workmen use on the
rich mahogany and teak decking.
The hull of a 50 ft steam launch owned by businessman Peter de Savary lies
forlorn in the shed, all restoration stopped by one of the most prominent
but now hard-pressed entrepreneurs of the Thatcher years. The new
superstructure of another launch, built in 1912 and now being re-timbered,
rests in another corner; the owner, a Midlands businessman, is short of the
cash to complete it. What remains of a pre-First World War racing motor-boat
waits for its purchaser, an engineering company director in Wiltshire, to
start producing the money for rebuilding.
When well-heeled individuals feel the recessionary pinch, expensive toys
usually are the first things to get the elbow. 'It's a wonder we have
managed to keep our team together,' says Freebody, 57. 'Last year was very
tough.' So tough that the company lost Pounds 80,000 on a yearly turnover
that normally reaches about Pounds 650,000. The manual labour force has
shrunk from 28 to 18.
He reckons the worst is over, though, partly because he is hoping for new
boat orders from at least three US businessmen. The company's habits also
are changing for the better. Freebody, who clings to a rather romantic view
of business life, says he appreciates the need for improved practices. 'For
one thing, I have realised that our accountant has really been just an
auditor. I accept that all kinds of things have to be done more
professionally here in the way we cost and charge for work.'
The family has built boats on the river for more than 200 years and Freebody
bought the present company - near the rowing town of Henley, Berkshire -
from his grandfather in 1962. But purpose-built it isn't. 'One shed, a US
lend-lease one, was given to me and the other shed was bought for Pounds
500,' he says. Part of the yard's office is a former boat house and some of
the roof came from an old jam factory. He will repair a leaking propellor
shaft for under Pounds 100 and makes punts for just over Pounds 8,000. But
he also produces marvellous Edwardian-style electric launches for perhaps
Pounds 150,000, and steam launches for up to Pounds 300,000.
When the Andrews yard in nearby Bourne End, which was a style leader for
classic sloping-back Thames slipper stern launches, collapsed a decade ago,
Freebody stepped into the breach. 'I realised there was still a market for
boats like that.' A 30 ft electric-powered slipper stern that simply oozes
class will cost Pounds 38,000 (excluding VAT), and a 25 ft version Pounds
27,000.
The company uses Burmese teak, African and Brazilian mahogany, English oak
and British Columbian pine for its vessels and builds everything from the
keel up, including old-fashioned spoked steering wheels. About the only
thing it does not do is the sign-writing.
The yard has the kind of ambiance which, while looking efficient, entrances
many a customer. It is the type of place where varnish is held in tin cans
with the 'plum tomatoes' labels still attached.
Last year, Freebody made a punt for Mrs Tiny Rowland, wife of Lonrho's
owner, one for Virgin group tycoon Richard Branson, and two very small ones
for an ornamental lake at the home of former Beatle George Harrison.
Overall, though, 'it was a barren year for new boat orders.' So, much
against the advice of his bank, NatWest, he kept the yard's work force busy
building for stock.
'As it turned out, that has helped us keep afloat. I've sold in the last
month Pounds 108,000 of vessels built for stock, though a lot of that was
probably close to cost,' says Freebody. This included an eight-seater
electric 'canoe' and a 30 ft launch. Last year, 60 per cent of the company's
turnover came from repair work, compared with 40 per cent in normal years.
Hiring out mooring space and making rope lanyards for aircraft brings in a
steady Pounds 60,000 a year.
Reducing the work force has eased Freebody's Pounds 250,000 wage bill. A new
accountant, Aruna Boyland, says she is putting in systems to cost jobs
properly, as well as setting up a proper system of billing. 'In the past,'
Freebody says, 'I have asked customers how they want to pay. Perhaps I'd
bill them every Pounds 4,000 or maybe every Pounds 10,000 and we'd stop work
for periods if they wanted a breather.' Boyland says craftsmen there work as
if it was a paid holiday rather than a proper job.
The company was upset a few weeks ago when - without warning, according to
Freebody - NatWest told it to start slicing its Pounds 130,000 overdraft by
Pounds 1,000 a week. But Freebody has potential orders for Pounds 800,000 of
new boats including those three from the US, one of them a large,
Edwardian-style launch for a senior manager in Cincinnati Milacron, a
machine tool company.
He points out, too, that wooden launches are good value. 'They are often
half the cost of a similar-sized glass fibre boat. They hold their value,'
he explains. They do need revarnishing, every year, though - which costs
about Pounds 1,500.
What about turning to glass fibre? 'I've absolutely no need to. People are
going to go back to electric, steam, and wood.'

FT  01 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Income rescue delay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EFFORTS to compensate investors who lost money on home income plans have hit
a second, potentially embarrassing, delay with a conflict between insurance
companies and the insurance ombudsman.
Delay is especially significant, because most investors were already over
pension age when they bought the plans, which used a remortgage to buy an
investment bond, with the aim of earning a sizeable income. Many unwittingly
reached the brink of losing their homes when house prices fell crashed,
interest rates rose rocketed and the investment bonds failed to perform as
expected.
Some insurance companies tried to head off complaints by approaching all
plan-holders with offers of compensation, but tended to make up only the
loss on the investment bond, and not the loss on mortgage payments or money
withdrawn for capital spending.
The insurance ombudsman's view is that these payments were often too low.
His own and Lautro's guidelines say that investors should be put back where
they were financially before buying the plan and that payments to cover
distress and the cost of legal advice would be considered.
An investor's acceptance of money 'in full and final settlement' would not
preclude examination, since investors might have accepted an offer through
desperation and might not have been told they could go to the ombudsman.
The insurance companies are unhappy about this. One refused point blank when
the ombudsman asked - as a matter of form - for permission to review a case
where compensation had been paid, according to Peter Tyldesley of the
ombudsman's bureau. However, Tyldesley said this would not stop Dr Julian
Farrand, the ombudsman, dealing with the case. Insurance companies must
comply with his decisions and pay awards worth up to Pounds 100,000 unless
they leave the voluntary scheme, after giving six months' notice.
One of the companies most heavily involved in home income plans was Guardian
Royal Exchange, where marketing manager Ken Franklin said the company was
concerned at being asked to overturn something already agreed.
GRE paid sums of between Pounds 2,000 and Pounds 3,000 to each of 490
investors who bought home income plans from Intercity, a GRE-appointed
representative. GRE offered the money, making up losses on investment bonds
only, after cancelling Intercity's agency on discovering some 'probably
perfectly innocent' irregularities with holding of clients' money, said
Franklin. The insurance ombudsman is currently reviewing 12 of these cases.
'They were not told about the ombudsman because they were not complaining,'
said Franklin, 'We were writing to those customers out of the blue saying we
have looked at these schemes and we are going to make an offer to you.'
'We were one of the first companies to actually get off our butts and do
something,' said Franklin, 'We are not happy to have it looked at again.' He
said GRE was hopeful its discussions with the ombudsman would reach an
amicable solution.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Keen to study the student market / A
look at the carrots banks will offer to win the business of school leavers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW academic year approaches and the banks are homing in on students.
Bank customers are deeply reluctant to move their accounts, so signing up a
student can be the key, for the bank, to a long-standing lucrative
relationship.
However, banks are now much more sophisticated in the way they target
students and school leavers. Students themselves are more conservative and
sensible in their approach to finance than they were ten years ago.
According to research conducted by Barclays and the National Union of
Students, they are acutely conscious of debt, dislike it, and are not as
confident as they used to be of a high starting salary when they graduate,
to pay off the overdraft.
Barclays' research paints a picture of a 'carefree fresher' spending money
happily at first. The 'end of the honeymoon' sets in when they first have to
borrow, which usually happens in the first year. This deteriorates into
'final year blues', possibly even followed by a disillusioned graduation.
The research suggests that a third of students are in debt at any one time,
while Barclays according to students, graduate owing on average Pounds
1,100. Only 25 per cent of student debt by value is with banks. The most, 31
per cent, is with the government's Student Loan Company and 21 per cent
comes from parents. Credit cards take up 6.5 per cent.
These figures show why banks have decided to withdraw some of the 'freebies'
with which they entice students. Free overdraft facilities have now been put
to the fore.
Students can now expect an interest-free overdraft of Pounds 400, for the
full term of their study. Last year some banks, including Barclays, only
offered free overdrafts for the first year, but it is now usually extended.
Students can also expect charge-free banking and some degree of interest,
while in credit, and at least one plastic card. Policies over issuing credit
cards still vary, as the chances of serious bad debts in this area are
obviously considerable.
However, students off on a rail trip around Europe during the vacation can
expect preferential rates on foreign exchange.
School leavers who go straight into work tend to take an even more
conservative approach, and are deeply averse to borrowing. Consequently they
can expect more in the way of 'goodies', but much less in the way of cheap
borrowing facilities. School leavers will ideally be going into full-time
employment, so cheap credit should be less important to them. Also, banks
are reluctant to encourage borrowing in such young consumers.
The main offers are as follows:
Abbey National aims at youngsters in general and makes no special offers for
students, beyond a preferential rate of interest on overdrafts - the APR is
14.5 per cent for students, compared with normal rates of 24.4 per cent for
authorised overdrafts and 34.4 per cent for unauthorised.
Its package for youngsters in general is more competitive. Abbey offers Visa
Delta debit cards, and access to Link machines, along with Saturday opening
in 95 per cent of branches (useful for 16-year-olds in their first job). The
goodies are a free driving lesson and 25 per cent off the next five lessons,
for those who do not already have a driving licence, and Pounds 15 in BP
petrol vouchers for those who do.
Barclays has an interest-free overdraft of Pounds 300, less than the other
clearers, which will be available throughout the course of study. It also
offers free banking, and the opportunity to apply for a free Barclays
Connect debit card, and a free Student Barclaycard. Successful applicants
for the latter receive a Pounds 250 credit limit with eight weeks'
interest-free credit, and a choice of the following goodies: a clock radio,
a travel bag, or a Pounds 5 Our Price voucher. Barclays' chief 'treat', for
all students opening an account, is a Pounds 10 voucher for Our Price
records. The bank has also set up a system of student business officers, and
a free interview for financial planning advice during the first year is part
of the package.
Lloyds is offering a Pounds 400 agreed overdraft for the full term of study,
with a reduced interest rate (15.3 per cent APR) on larger advances. Banking
is free whether in credit or overdrawn. Gross interest of 5 per cent monthly
is payable on credit balances.
Goodies include a free Young Persons Railcard, commission-free currency and
travellers' cheques, and a free Eurocheque card. There is no cash gift.
Midland is offering an interest-free overdraft of Pounds 400 for the full
period of study, along with a Pounds 50 cheque guarantee card, which also
works for cash machines and as a debit card. Banking is free while in credit
and free 'financial counselling' is also available.
Goodies include Pounds 15 in cash, commission-free Thomas Cook travellers'
cheques and currency transactions, and eligibility for charge-free Access
and Visa cards up to a maximum credit limit of Pounds 250.
National Westminster announces its package next week. It is likely to match
the standard Pounds 400 interest-free overdraft for the full term of study.
Last year's cash gift was Pounds 30 and it is unlikely to be increased.
Royal Bank of Scotland offers a Pounds 400 interest-free overdraft for only
the first year of study, and a 'Highline' card which works as a cheque
guarantee and cash-point card. Tiered interest is payable on accounts while
they are in credit. Goodies include a Pounds 20 cash gift, a free Eurocheque
card and commission-free travellers' cheques and foreign currency.
TSB maintains more of a 'goodies' policy than its rivals, and is also keen
to stress the 7.5 per cent gross savings rate it offers on current accounts,
which it claims is currently the market leader. Students get their Pounds
400 interest-free overdraft facility, which is available until the September
of their final year of study. They also get a Speedbank multi-function card.
The goodies include a Pounds 15 voucher and six 10 per cent discount
vouchers for Olympus Sport, plus a free driving lesson when booked as part
of a course of ten with a participating member of the Motors Schools
Association.
All of these, apart from the overdraft, apply to school leavers aged between
16 and 20. Eleven to 15-year-olds receive the TSB FirstSave account (current
interest 7.25 per cent), along with six 10 per cent discount vouchers for
Olympus Sport and six 10 per cent discount vouchers for the Fosters clothes
store. Similar pass-book based accounts are available for under-10s.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Think cheap when you choose a company
car
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INLAND Revenue had some dispiriting news for Britain's executives this
week. From now on, it seems, the rule of thumb when choosing a company car
will be - go for the cheapest.
Many drivers could gain if proposals to reform income tax treatment for
company cars - contained in a new consultative paper - are enacted. Tax
bills could be cut by as much as 30 per cent, although some may go up by
more than 40 per cent.
The reforms will not operate until the beginning of the 1994-95 tax year at
the earliest, and the Revenue could yet make changes. But if you are
choosing a company car in the next few months, it would be foolish not to
bear these plans in mind.
The present system lumps cars into broad bands according to their engine
size if their price is below Pounds 19,250. The new rules would tax cars
entirely on their price, and would have far more bands.
There are, however, several ways in which price could be assessed. At
present, the Revenue favours the manufacturer's retail list price, but other
possibilities include the cost to the employer and the original market
value.
Some accountants, including Martin Myerscough of Arthur Andersen, also are
worried that the new administrative burdens on companies, and the costly
consequences of making mistakes, will discourage some from offering company
cars altogether - heaping further gloom onto Britain's executives.
Precise gains and losses cannot be determined until the new rules are more
definite. But those affected worst are likely to be drivers of cars with
engines just below two litres and which fall just within the Pounds 19,455
limit. Tax bills for them could increase by up to 40 per cent, but they have
been benefiting from the present system.
Shed a tear, also, for executives with cars costing between Pounds 50,000
and Pounds 60,000. Their tax could increase by around 35 per cent.
If your company has bought you a cheap but powerful car, such as a Vauxhall
Astra or Ford Fiesta, expect to benefit by anything up to 25 per cent. All
the precise details will be announced in the Budget next March.
Several experts are hoping for changes, as well as extra detail, by then but
Clive Tulloch, tax partner with accountant Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said the
Revenue had missed several opportunities to remove anomalies in the system.
He pointed out that the proportion of the scale charge on a car which
individuals must pay will still be based on their business mileage. This is
bad news for those with very high annual distances covered who need their
cars most.
According to Tulloch, those with annual business mileages of somewhere
between 12,000 and 15,000 miles at the bottom, and 17,999 at the top, would
be better off taking additional cash from their employer and buying their
own car.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Abbey National profits fear - The Week
ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE two largest UK banks, Barclays and National Westminster, announce their
half year results this week, together with Abbey National and Standard
Chartered.
Abbey National's profits on Monday may well disappoint the market, at least
by comparison with the sparkling performances it has given in previous
years. High bad debts will probably push last year's Pounds 308m pre-tax
profits down to around Pounds 270m.
National Westminster on Tuesday is likely to report profits not far from
last year's poor performance of Pounds 101m.
Standard Chartered turned in Pounds 83m at the interim stage a year ago.
Forecasts for its latest result on Wednesday range from around Pounds 60m to
slightly above last year's figure.
Barclay's results on Thursday will attract the most attention. Heavy
provisions are likely to drive its half year figures well below its Pounds
378m pre-tax profit at the half-way stage last year. SG Warburg forecast
profits of only Pounds 120m - a very disappointing figure for the UK's
largest bank.
A dividend cut of up to 50 per cent is widely expected when British
Petroleum reports second quarter figures on Thursday. The June firing of
Robert Horton, chairman and arch-defender of an unchanged dividend, cleared
the way for a more realistic payout. Income on an historic cost basis is
likely to have slumped to about Pounds 100m from Pounds 243m.
Royal Dutch Shell has fared much better and will turn in net income of about
Pounds 520m against Pounds 532m on the same day.
Unilever will report on Friday second quarter pre-tax profits of about
Pounds 490m (Pounds 448m). It will have benfitted from a cut of about Pounds
20m in interest costs thanks to debt reduction and from a pick up from the
tough year-earlier quarter. Sales of some products such as perfumes were
depressed then by lower tourism in the wake of the Gulf War.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Pick-a-mix for Pep investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS holding investment or unit trust Personal Equity Plans can now mix
non-qualifying with qualifying trusts after a rethink of the rules.
Non-qualifying trusts are those that do not commit themselves to holding at
least 50 per cent of their investments in European Community equities.
The Inland Revenue this week clarified the rules governing non-qualifying
trusts. Before the Budget, Pep investors were allowed to put Pounds 1,500 in
a non-qualifying trust or Pounds 3,000 in a qualifying trust. Those who
wanted to invest the full annual Pep limit of Pounds 6,000 had to make up
the balance in individual equities.
Chancellor Norman Lamont raised the limits on investment in both unit and
investment trusts from a maximum of Pounds 3,000 to the Pounds 6,000 limit
for equities in the Budget.
However, the rules did not seem to allow Pep holders to mix qualifying with
non-qualifying trusts in one Pep. To do this, the Pep holder would have to
go through a laborious and costly process of first subscribing to a
non-qualifying trust up to Pounds 1,500 and placing the remaining Pounds
4,500 in equities - then selling the equities and replacing them with
qualifying trusts.
Pep holders who invest up to Pounds 1500 in a non-qualifying trust can now
can now make up the Pounds 4,500 balance with a qualifying trust, equities,
or a mixture of both.
'Investors who want a broader spread can now mix and match non-qualifying
trusts with qualifying, without the complications of first investing in
other equities and then switching,' said Fiona Monro of the Association of
Investment Trust Companies.
Julian Shersby of the Unit Trust Association also welcomed the news: 'It
widens the choice for investors. Very few of our members were promoting
their non-UK/Europe unit trusts but I would expect them to start doing so
now.'
Investment trust companies are continuing to lobby for all investment trusts
to qualify for the full Pounds 6,000 a year. The large international general
trusts are one of the most stable and diversified sectors in the investment
trust industry.
Jeremy Tigue of Foreign &amp; Colonial, the UK's largest investment trust, with
six of its eight investment trusts classified as non-qualifying, called the
simplification of the Pep rules this week 'half a loaf'. 'It is still very
frustrating to have the Pounds 1,500 limit.'

FT  01 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Equity risks put damper on prospects -
Philip Coggan surveys investment potential in world stock markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOW SAFE is it for private investors to risk their money in the world's
stock markets? There was some cheer this week when the FT-SE 100 rose nearly
50 points on Wednesday. But the UK market has fallen substantially over the
summer, the Japanese market has been in retreat and the US market, although
strong, is trading on valuations that would deter many British private
investors.
Some think that the world economy is facing one of its deep periodical
crises. Economist Andrew Tylecote spells out the arguments in another
article on this page.
The bears claim the excesses of the 1980s are having their repercussions
now. Companies and consumers are struggling to pay off debt; as a result,
economic growth is sluggish. The problems are widespread.
Japan: The Tokyo market is now 60 per cent below its peak at the end of
1989. Each time foreign investors have proclaimed that the bottom has been
reached, the market has proved them wrong. Successive interest rate cuts,
including one this week, have failed to produce a revival.
Late in the 1980s, many Japanese stocks commanded stratospheric
price-earnings ratios with the market p/e reaching 62 at the end of 1989,
according to Datastream. Even after the recent collapse, the ratio is still
over 30, well above the level prevailing in the UK.
There have been repeated worries that the fall in share prices would cause
problems for Japanese banks, which have large equity holdings. Given the
role that Japanese investors play in the international financial markets, a
banking collapse in Japan could have major repercussions on the world
economy. 'You would have to observe that the risk of a major financial
dislocation rooted in Tokyo is higher today than ever before,' says Nick
Train of GT Management.
Even the Japanese economic miracle is looking tarnished, with only 2 per
cent GDP growth expected for the year - low by historical standards.
Britain: Despite this week's mini-rally, the post-election euphoria has
definitely worn off. Traders assumed that the return of John Major to
Downing Street would restore consumer confidence and spark recovery.
Instead, the chances are that 1992 will see a further decline in GDP.
Meanwhile, the government's options are limited severely. Chancellor Norman
Lamont has stated again and again his commitment to membership of the
Exchange Rate Mechanism and the present central rate of DM2.95/Pounds . With
the Bundesbank determined to eliminate the inflationary effects of German
reunification, that gives him no scope to cut British interest rates.
The other classic mechanism for reviving an economy, fiscal policy, is
constrained by a budget deficit already close to Pounds 30bn for the present
year.
United States: Although Wall Street has flirted repeatedly with its all-time
high, the economy has struggled to live up to the stock market's optimism.
Successive reductions in interest rates have produced only weak economic
growth, as shown by the 1.4 per cent second-quarter rise in GDP. But with
short-term interest rates not much over 3 per cent, equities still look
attractive vis-a-vis cash. 'US stock prices reflect the most favourable
monetary conditions that have existed for 30 years,' says Bill Smith, equity
strategist at BZW.
With the p/e ratio above 20, some feel that the US market is vulnerable to
bad news, such as a defeat for George Bush in November's election. In view
of all these risks, many cautious investors may feel safer sticking with the
generous real returns available from the building society, gilts or national
savings.
Hardened contrarians may feel that, with all this gloomy news around, this
must be a good time to buy shares. Certainly, the FT All-Share is yielding
more than 5 per cent at the moment, a traditional sign of value in the
equity market. BZW's Smith is looking for lower interest rates and earnings
growth in the UK over the next year. But with the risks so high, only brave
investors would plunge into the equity market. Cautious contrarians might
try the safety-first method of investing via a monthly savings scheme.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The downswings that should worry us
all
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TYLECOTE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the phrases spoken most often during the recession is 'What goes down
must come up.' But how far down, and how soon up?
The optimistic assumption is that we are in a short cycle recession of 10 or
11 years, so that we are repeating the recession of the early 1980s and will
have another mid-to-late decade boom before long. Unfortunately, there is
good reason to think that there are also two longer cycles at work.
The first, the downswings of which are nasty enough on their own, is the
Kuznets or long swing, some 18-19 years in length. The long swing is notable
for movements in land prices and in building and credit. The upswing
encourages land speculation, driving up asset prices and producing a bubble
of over-expanded borrowing. When the bubble bursts, there is a very sharp
contraction of credit.
Growth can resume only after a painful sequence: a long fall in land and
asset prices; the return to health of corporate and personal balance sheets;
and, finally, the return of confidence.
The last Kuznets downswing began with the crash of 1973-74, and the early
1990s certainly resemble the mid-1970s in the land and financial markets -
with one important difference. Then, inflation brought borrowers' real debts
down quickly and land prices back up, so the upswing could resume. There is
no reason to expect such a foreshortening of the downswing this time. But
this downswing, like the last, will take place within the same downswing of
the Long Wave.
The Long Wave, or Kondratiev cycle, is a matter of more debate. Many
economic historians deny its existence altogether. But there is an ominous
resemblance between the slowdown in world growth since 1974 and that of the
inter-war period.
Both long-wave downswings began with an international crisis (1914 and 1973)
which dealt the first blow. Meanwhile, a technological revolution was
nearing completion which, for a time, enabled one leading nation - the US
then, Japan now - to drive forward while others were faltering.
The early diffusion of the new 'technological style' helped to stimulate
growth during a Kuznets upswing (mid-to-late 1920s, mid-to-late 1980s) but
it exacerbated a dangerous trend to inequality.
This was manifest internationally. The technological leader became creditor
to the world, and the poorer countries got mired in a debt crisis. It was
also developing domestically, with the rich getting richer and the poor
poorer.
'When the rich get too rich, and the poor too poor, something happens,' as
the Chinese proverb says. Demand becomes insufficient, for the rich do not
spend as much of their income as the poor. Even the rich suffer from the
poor's inability to buy what they sell.
Second, the suffering of the poor affects the supply side. Poor countries
cannot afford to keep up their previous rate of investment, nor can poor
people invest in education, training, and even physical and mental health.
Growth slows, unemployment increases, and the inequalities grow worse.
The effects of these increased inequalities were delayed internationally by
the recycling of oil revenues after 1974, and domestically in Europe and the
UK by the deregulation of credit in the 1980s. In both cases, it was a
bargain of Faust: when it was time to pay, the devil charged double.
The third world and eastern Europe have been in stagnation and crisis since
the early 1980s; now is the turn of the weaker northern countries. Here,
internal debts and external deficits intersect. Governments which want to
reflate their economies can scarcely do so because of the effects on budget
and trade deficits.
The Kuznets swing is most violent in countries where financial institutions
are regulated least tightly. In Japan, frenzied speculation drove land and
stock prices to extraordinary heights. In 1990-91, the bubble burst with a
vengeance.
The parallels between the Japanese slide and the US slump after 1929 are
alarmingly close: a financial implosion is taking place in the world's
greatest creditor. At least governments and central bankers understand
better what to do the second time around. This factor may, however, be
cancelled out by another. After 1929, the US was one of the worst sufferers
from its crash, and so had a strong interest in action. This will not be
true in Japan for some time.
The implosion will not cause mass Japanese unemployment, nor does it pose an
immediate threat to the major industrial companies. Within Japan, it is
almost being welcomed as a overdue purgative.
It is the effect outside Japan which is terrifying: Japanese trade
surpluses, previously recycled by private capital outflows, will soon be
huge and the outflows much diminished. Japan's trading partners will see
their deficits rise further and their activity levels fall. If the implosion
causes a massive withdrawal of Japanese funds, their financial systems will
be gravely weakened.
It is only the reaction of trading partners which will inflict real pain on
Japan's main decision-makers and drive them to fundamental restructuring.
Meanwhile, the agony of the double downswing will be compounded. The Kuznets
downswing eventually will work itself out naturally; but to end the Long
Wave downswing will require fundamental reforms. What they should be is
another story.
Andrew Tylecote is a senior lecturer in the department of economics,
Sheffield University management school and author of The Long Wave in the
World Economy (Routledge, 1992, Pounds 40).

<TEXT>
AT LAST, directors are showing their true form. With the market seemingly in
inexorable retreat, a surge of buying by directors was long overdue. In the
week of July 20-24, it duly arrived - in emphatic fashion.
Sir Anthony Bamford, of the privately owned JCB Group, has long been a fan
of Tarmac. As a non-executive director, he has been buying shares since last
October when he paid 160p. His latest purchase, at just 70p, comes after a
period of considerable uncertainty for the building materials' sector.
John Haggas, the textile group, appears to have emerged from recession
rather earlier than most manufacturing companies. In July 1991, finance
director Martin Scriven and Steven Barker bought shares at 58p. The same two
have been buying again, this time paying between 104-106p.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Markets: BT ebullient after disappointing results - The
Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR A company which reported its first quarter-on-quarter decline in sales
since 1984, coupled with a 27.8 per cent decline in pre-tax profits, BT was
in a surprisingly ebullient mood this week.
It was as if the telecommunications company was relieved to report a fall in
profits and sales after running into so much criticism in the past for its
unseemly profit increases.
However, it was not the avoidance of political criticism that relieved BT.
It was the fact that the results could be used as further proof, that the
present regulatory regime is tough enough.
Oftel has told BT to cut the price of a basket of its basic services each
year by inflation minus 7.5 percentage points, compared with 6.25 points at
present.
The company has also been told to ensure small retail customers share in the
price cuts.
BT's believes its first quarter results, which saw pre-tax profits fall from
Pounds 825m to Pounds 596m on sales of Pounds 3.27bn, down from Pounds
3.34bn, shows that the company is having a hard enough time under the
existing price regime.
BT's shareholders no doubt see the point. A comparison of its shares with
those of Cable &amp; Wireless, the international telecommunications group,
relative to the FT-Allshare over the last eight years, shows BT's shares
underperforming those of its rival.
Mr Iain Vallance, chairman, said the proposed price regime was 'extremely
tough by any standard', and many of the detailed provisions would add to the
proposals' negative impact on BT.
If BT fails to agree with Oftel, the only course available to the company is
to allow the matter to be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Both BT and Oftel have recently talked privately about doing so. The MMC has
the power to impose a solution.
However, given that as BT and Oftel have threatened to go to the MMC several
times in the past, the present dispute seems to point to the two sides'
tough negotiating stances rather than a total breakdown of talks.
What is clear is that Oftel, in spite of BT's disappointing result, will not
negotiate over its price regime. It points out that it is not due to come
into effect until August next year and then it would remain unchanged for
four years.
Furthermore, while BT's results showed the effects of the recession,
particularly on inland call volumes which fell by three per cent over the
past three months, the profits were affected by non-recessionary factors.
There was the exceptional charge of Pounds 135m mainly relating to the loss
on its divestment of its interests in Mitel Corporation, the troubled
Canadian telephone equipment maker. Then there was Pounds 56m of redundancy
costs relating to the voluntary retirement of 29,000 people.
BT has decided to cuts its workforce down to a size comparable with its
competitors in the US. At beginning of the financial year the workforce was
210,500. By 1996 the figure could be reduced to 120,000.
It was no surprise to many telecommunication analysts that BT decided to
speed up that process in the run-up to the new regulatory price regime.
It did not go unnoticed at Oftel that BT's cost cutting exercise, which
affected this quarter's results, will increase the company's profitability
in the future. As far as Oftel is concerned BT's results showed a very
healthy and robust telecommunications company performing well in a
recession.
Instead of asking how BT would fare under a tougher regulatory regime its
poses a different question.
'Just think how BT would fare if there was no recession?' By next August
1993, when the proposed regulatory price regime is due to come into effect,
the worse of the recession may be over.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Markets: Eager buyers ignore vote of no-confidence - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHO WOULD have thought it? Just as Wall Street was settling down for its
annual summer slumber, and the red braces brigade were dreamily
contemplating a month of quiet weekdays and long lazy weekends in the
Hamptons, share prices took off this week in a frenzied orgy of buying not
seen since the first days of the year.
In just two days, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped almost 100 points
while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index, the broadest measure of the market's
performance, rocketed to an all-time high. And, after more than a week of
light trading turnover - when it seemed many institutional investors had all
but closed their books for the summer holidays - volume roared to extremely
high levels as investors rushed into the market in the hope of catching the
rapidly rising tide of prices.
Oddly enough, the spark that lit the fire under stocks was a report of a
sharp drop in consumer confidence. On Tuesday morning, the Conference Board
announced that its index of consumer confidence plunged 11.6 points in July
to 61.0, a decline that stunned analysts who had been expecting little
change.
The stock market did not respond directly to the confidence numbers but,
rather, to the reaction the figures triggered in the bond market. After
months of refusing to push long-term bond yields lower because of fears
about the outlook for inflation and concern about the size of the budget
deficit, Treasury investors reacted to the consumer confidence report as if
they had been struck by a mini-earthquake.
Amid heavy buying of longer-dated government securities, the yield on the
benchmark 30-year bond finally dropped below 7.5 per cent after six months
of hovering between 7.75 and 8. By yesterday, the 30-year was yielding just
over 7.4 and still heading south.
In a moment, the bond market's inflation and deficit worries seemed to have
disappeared.
It might seem premature to pass such a judgment after only a two-day rally,
but Treasury market analysts claim that after the dreadful June employment
report, a series of weak economic indicators out last month, and now the
plunge in consumer confidence, investors suddenly have realised that
inflation may not pose a threat to the value of their fixed-income assets
for at least another year.
Equity investors were delighted at this sudden turnaround in Treasury market
sentiment. For most of this year, the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, the
White House, Wall Street economists, and almost anybody else with an
opinion, have been complaining that stubbornly high long-term interest rates
were one of the main reasons why the economic recovery was so sluggish.
The reasoning among those who were rushing into stocks this week was that if
long rates are now finally coming down (and, more importantly, staying
down), there is a compelling new reason to buy equities.
This assumes, of course, that substantially cheaper long-term credit will
prove to be the effective economic stimulant the Fed and the White House
have said, all along, it would. Lower long rates should stimulate all
interest rate-sensitive investment, further ease the burden on corporations
and consumers for their debt repayments, and bring down mortgage rates.
The economy is certainly in need of fresh life, judging by the latest gross
domestic product figures released this week which put second-quarter GDP
growth at 1.4 per cent, half the pace of the first three months and well
below the growth rate seen traditionally after a recession.
While the economy stuttered in the second quarter, some of the country's
biggest corporations fared better. The giant car manufacturers began
releasing their latest results this week, and the news was good.
Chrysler kicked off on Tuesday with net earnings for the April-to-June
period of Dollars 178m - not much of a return on sales and revenues of
Dollars 9.3bn but a big improvement on the Dollars 212m loss incurred at the
same stage last year. Ford followed the next day with a similar rebound,
reporting net earnings of Dollars 502m compared to a year-ago loss of
Dollars 324m.
The market greeted both sets of figures warmly, pushing Chrysler's stock
Dollars 2 1/4 higher to Dollars 21 1/2 and Ford Dollars 1 5/8 higher to
Dollars 45 5/8 over the week. General Motors' stock also rose in sympathy,
and the final of the big three should be releasing its second-quarter
earnings within the next week or so.
Monday     3282.20 -  3.51
Tuesday    3334.07 + 51.87
Wednesday  3379.19 + 45.12
Thursday   3391.78 + 12.70

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish Amicable has launched an ambitious range of critical illness and
income replacement policies. This is an unusual step from a mutual Scottish
office best known for its investment products, and suggests that competition
in the area could broaden further.
The critical illness policy will pay out for heart attacks, strokes, cancer,
paralysis, coronary artery disease requiring surgery, blindness, major organ
transplants, kidney failure, multiple sclerosis, and total permanent
disability to engage in any remunerative employment.
The income protection plan has special benefits for relapses, and
proportionate benefits for rehabilitiation periods.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Markets: At a Glance - Underlying problems worsen in the
housing market
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The underlying problems of the housing market are getting steadily worse and
mortgage repossessions are set to run at alarming levels for the next few
years. That was the bleak message from the Council of Mortgage Lenders this
week. Although the number of homes repossessed in the first half of this
year was slightly down, the figures for people with serious mortgage arrears
are rising sharply.
The number of people with mortgage arrears of more than 12 months has
tripled since the end of 1990 and now stands at 113,860. A further 191,280
borrowers are more than six months behind with their mortgage payments. Even
if half are saved, as the CML hopefully predicts, it now seems certain that
repossessions could continue to run at around last year's level of 75,540 or
more for the next two or three years.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Markets: Why it pays to cut back a mortgage - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AVERAGE Briton is saving, not spending, and reducing his debts,
according to the statistics. This shows a lot of sense. With interest rates
at 10 per cent and inflation under 4 per cent, real returns are over 6 per
cent, very high by historical standards. Unemployment is rising and people
are afraid of losing their jobs; all this makes it a good time to save and a
bad time to borrow.
Many people, of course, are struggling to meet their present interest
payments. But those fortunate enough to have savings should, apart from
paying off such obviously high-cost debts as credit cards and overdrafts,
not neglect mortgage repayment as a way to improve their finances.
There is generally little point, tax distortions apart, from having
borrowings and savings simultaneously. Obviously, you should have some
'rainy day' savings to meet unforeseen bills and spending on holidays or a
new car. But it is highly unlikely you ever will get as much interest on
your savings as you will pay out on your borrowings. This is especially true
now as building societies seek to widen the margins between savers and
borrowers.
What is more, the income from your savings normally will be taxable whereas
the interest payments on your loan (except the first Pounds 30,000 of a
mortgage) will not be tax-deductible. The result is a hefty net loss to you.
Take someone with a Pounds 35,000 mortgage who is paying a rate of 11 per
cent. He is a top-rate taxpayer who also has Pounds 10,000 in the building
society earning 10 per cent gross - a net rate of 6 per cent. If he took
Pounds 5,000 out of the building society to pay down the mortgage, the
resulting loss of interest income would be Pounds 300 a year. But the
mortgage interest saving would be Pounds 550 a year, a net annual gain of
Pounds 250. For a basic-rate taxpayer, the annual gain, on the same
assumptions, would be Pounds 175.
Now, some might claim they can do better with their savings than simply
leaving them in the building society. But they would have to achieve a gross
return of 14.67 per cent (if a basic-rate taxpayer) or 18.33 per cent (if
top-rate) to make it cost-effective not to repay their mortgages at 11 per
cent. How many investors can be confident of doing so well?
Besides which, the beauty of paying down your mortgage is that it can be a
virtuous circle. The monthly reduction in the interest bill gives the
investor greater scope for saving - which can lead to further mortgage
repayments.
There is one important caveat. The lender might impose penalties or waiting
periods on partial redemptions - and will almost certainly do so if you have
a fixed-rate mortgage. The penalties might outweigh the benefits of
repayment, so check with your lender and do your sums before you send off
the cheque.
The calculations become more difficult once you deal with repayments of
mortgages under Pounds 30,000. In the past, it has often been stated
blithely that such a loan is cheap borrowing and represents a 'good thing'
for everyone. But the abolition of higher-rate tax relief has weakened this
argument.
The effective cost of an 11 per cent mortgage to a taxpayer is 8.25 per
cent. You certainly should be able to beat that return in a Tessa (although
your investment will be limited to Pounds 3,000 a person in the first year
and Pounds 1,800 thereafter). The zero preference shares of investment
trusts also should offer a better return (although it will all come in the
form of capital gain). An equity investor might hope to beat an after-tax
return of 8.25 per cent a year although he could not be certain. But it is
hard to think of an investment that will bring an immediate benefit
equivalent to an 8.25 per cent tax-free monthly income, which is the effect
of paying down the mortgage.
Nor is the money used to repay a mortgage lost for ever. The investor can
always 'gear up again' by increasing his mortgage loan next time he moves
house, or even by re-mortgaging. Repayment also increases your equity in
your home - and, thus, your security - in the event of further falls in
house prices.
Mortgage repayment also could bring extra savings flexibility. If a borrower
has used an endowment policy or some other savings vehicle, as security for
the loan, it is now free to perform some other task such as school fee
funding or retirement planning. Alternatively, the policies can simply be
left as potential security for the home-owner's next move up the housing
ladder. You certainly should not abandon an endowment policy in mid-term -
that would be a surefire way of losing money.
The days when it was smart to take out as big a mortgage as possible, and
wait for inflation to erode the cost, are over - at least until the next
housing boom in the 21st century. Indeed, it could be very difficult to 'get
rich quick' over the next few years, whatever your chosen method of
investment. Paying off part of your mortgage will not make you rich, but it
could prove to be astute money management - and a simple way to improve your
standard of living.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Markets: And now for yet another sterling effort - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To Mr Roger Gibbs, chairman of Wellcome Trust:
Dear Mr Gibbs,
I hear you are looking for someone to manage the Pounds 2bn-plus cash you
raised this week when you sold 270m of your Wellcome shares. I would like to
apply for the job. Perhaps I should tell you the way I am thinking about the
stock market just now, and give you some idea of how I would invest your
money.
I know you want to increase the yield you get on your investments so that
you can spend more on medical research. I understand you are planning to put
Pounds 500m or so into an indexed fund to start off with, and hope to get
about 40 per cent of the cash into equities over the next nine months. You
will be putting the rest into fixed-interest stocks. Then, I hear, you are
looking to have about 80 per cent in shares two years from now.
Well, I have to say I cannot see out two years at the moment. My horizons
have got rather shorter of late. In fact, I am not sure I can see anything
beyond the next few months.
It strikes me that the recession is turning even nastier. Look at the man in
the street. House repossessions are still bad and mortgage arrears are
rising, so where does that put the consumer-led recovery? The CBI survey
this week showed that companies are not cheerful, either.
Everyone thought that company chairmen would be making more optimistic
noises over the next few weeks as they announced their interim results. But,
already, we have had some gloomy remarks.
Take ICI. Sir Denys Henderson is a clever chap. He managed to get his own
share price up by saying he was thinking about demerging the business. At
the same time, though, he hit the market with news that profits were down
and would have been much worse but for the redundancies his company has
made. Trading is still weak, he says, and he cannot predict the end of the
recession.
And listen to what the banks are saying. Midland and Lloyds both reported
figures this week. Although bad debts are down a bit, activity is at a low
level. New loans are not being made at anything like the rate which would
suggest that companies are beginning to expand again.
Now look at the equity market. It has been falling pretty well non-stop
since post-election euphoria ran out in May. True, it did bounce for a
couple of days this week and reached 2,423.2 on Wednesday. But, by last
night's close, the Footsie was back under 2400 at 2399.6, up only 22.4 on
the week.
The rally on Tuesday and Wednesday was down partly to you putting some of
that cash into the market. Wall Street was going up, too, which always
helps. And, on Wednesday, BAT Industries announced a big rise in earnings. I
would not read too much into BAT's profit increase, though; much of it was
just recovery from the dreadful losses it had made on its mortgage indemnity
insurance.
So, I reckon that rally was just a brief respite in the downward trend. I
have to admit here that I got that idea from Nick Knight, the Nomura
strategy guru. He was right to be bearish when most of the other
stockbrokers were trying to get people to buy shares after the election. Now
that the others have reduced their forecasts for the market, he has cut his
again.
He has worked out that, in each of the past three election years, the market
has fallen quite sharply from a post-election high. The average fall is 21
per cent. And, so far, the Footsie has fallen only 12 per cent from the high
in May. So, he says, it would have to go down to about 2,150 just to fall by
the average. What would drive the market down that far, you ask? Well, Nick
thinks the UK is heading for a sterling crisis (you remember them, we used
to have them regularly before the pound went into the European exchange rate
mechanism).
Sir Denys of ICI and Brian Pearse at Midland Bank both put in their oar on
Thursday, saying we should devalue sterling in the ERM and then interest
rates could come down. Sir Kit McMahon was saying much the same thing in the
Financial Times 10 days ago and he used to be number two at the Bank of
England, so he ought to know. It gets rather hard for the government to
maintain any credibility for its stance on the exchange rate when top people
are saying that sort of thing. And Norman Lamont does not seem to be doing a
great job as chancellor of the exchequer in calming fears. Indeed, some say
he is so relaxed he is horizontal.
The foreigners who buy and sell sterling may well think the time is right to
get out. In the end, that could mean higher UK interest rates, not lower,
and then the recession will turn into a slump.
If the government is forced into abandoning its zero inflation target - and
the sooner the better, I say - then your long-term plan to be in equities
looks a good one. But I am a bit worried about your keenness to buy
gilt-edged stock at the moment, though.
I realise I am on tricky ground here, as you know all about gilts from your
time running that discount house Gerrard &amp; National. But the government is
going to have to issue an awful lot of gilts this year; and if sterling came
under pressure and interest rates had to rise, I do not think that gilts
would do terribly well. Anyway, you can get pretty much the same rate of
interest by putting the cash on deposit, or by buying gilts issued by other
governments. I hear the French ones are quite attractive.
I expect you would like to know what my track record is as an investor. I
have to confess my investment in residential property is not doing too well.
On the other hand, the cash I have in the building society is as safe as the
houses it is lent on.
I look forward to hearing from you.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Return of the whale killers: Bronwen Maddox visits Norway's
remote Lofoten Islands to meet the men eager for the hunt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX and KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DR TORE HAUG'S voice crackles over the radio link from Spitzbergen, half-way
between Norway and the North Pole: 'Our boats have caught 59 whales so far,
but we are behind schedule because of the terrible weather and fog.'
Haug is the 40-year-old scientist in charge of the six Norwegian whaleboats
now at the centre of a fierce international dispute.
His 12-man team on board the Asbjorn Selsbarne (Child of the Seal) has
killed 14 minke whales in the past three weeks, hunting around the clock
under the midnight sun. The whaleboats are now heading back to Norway - and
back into the dispute.
At the annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission in June,
Norway announced that it would resume commercial whaling next spring after a
break of five years.
Norway's move threatens to undermine the fragile moratorium which most IWC
members have observed since 1985 and Japan is expected to follow. Less than
48 hours after its announcement, Norway dispatched Haug's team to catch 110
minke whales for 'scientific research'. This is permitted under IWC rules,
but considered by some to be a mere pretext for starting whaling
immediately.
The resumption brought international condemnation particularly as Mrs Gro
Harlem Brundtland, Norway's prime minister, has received dozens of
environmental awards, earning her the tag of 'the Green Queen'. It might
prove an obstacle to entry into the EC, the European parliament has said.
Is the Norwegian stance foolish and obstinate? Are campaigns to 'save the
whale' trying to protect the species or to protect every single whale - and
are they more than a lobby of sentimental animal lovers?
In the tiny whaling villages of the Lofoten archipelago, 150 miles inside
the Arctic Circle and four hours from the mainland, the answer is emphatic.
'We have to earn our living from the sea - we don't like being called
barbarians', says Arne Lauritz Bendiksen who has hunted whales for 39 of his
54 years, first with his father and then with his three sons.
He lives in Reine, the village at the south of the islands which could claim
to be Norway's whaling capital, with six of the country's 55 registered
whaleboats.
It is beautiful and harsh: 150 wooden houses strung along a crescent of flat
land between jagged black mountains, pervaded by the smell of fish and
sewerage. The road peters out after a few kilometres at the village of Aa.
Hugging the shore is the Maelstrom, the ferocious tidal current which
horrified Jules Vernes in Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea.
Until 1987 almost a third of the men from Reine's 30 families were whalers.
That year the Norwegian government bowed to international pressure to halt
commercial whaling - two years later than most countries - until research
could determine their numbers.
Roald Olsen, out in his 65-foot boat, the Malnesfjord, is searching for the
minke which he hopes to kill next season. 'Keep looking for the curve of his
back in the water', he says from the bridge. The tripod on the bow is empty
now, but by spring it will be fitted with four-feet-long metal shafts, with
orange grenades screwed to the tip.
The grey-and-white minke whales are hard to spot: only 20 feet long, they
rarely spout and their tiny dorsal fin hardly cuts the water.
Suddenly a shout from the crow's nest: a young whale has been tempted close
to shore by the low tide. The boat lurches round in pursuit, but the whale,
100 yards away, dives. 'Sometimes he is cleverer than me,' says Olsen
ruefully. 'I am just waiting for next spring.'
The 1987 ban hit the community hard. 'It was a great loss in my life' says
Bendiksen. 'We used to call it whale sickness - the fever that would grip
all the men here in April before the season started.'
'But the worse damage was to my wallet,' he says, grimacing. 'The permits
were like money in the bank.'
Before the 1987 ban, the whalers sold the slabs of bright red meat to
traders on nearby Skrova island for Norwegian and Japanese supermarkets. 'It
is like the best beef you ever had,' say the occupants of the Gammelbua,
Reine's main bar. On Skrova an average minke would fetch around 30,000
kroner (Pounds 2,700); although that price seems sacrilege to many whale
lovers, it was bounty to the Reine fishermen.
In 1987 Bendiksen says he made around 200,000 kroner. Whaling contributed 60
per cent; catching haddock, cod and caplin in the 24-hour darkness of the
winter, less than half. Fishing all year round has proved a poor substitute
for whaling, he says, although the government has paid half the cost of new
cod nets to help compensate.
But however much the end of the ban is appreciated by the Lofoten whalers,
they number only a few hundred. The Norwegian government is the first to say
that the motive behind its decision was not money.
Whaling is not actually economically important to us,' says Helga Hernes of
the Foreign Affairs Ministry. In 1987, the last year of Norwegian commercial
whaling, its catch of 387 whales made the country only 13m kroner, around
Pounds 1.2m, mainly from selling whale meat to Japan. Instead, it is a
question of the right to preserve a cultural heritage, the ministry says,
arguing that 'Norway has always made its living from marine resources.'
Norway's resumption of whaling pre-empted a judgment by the IWC of whether
the minke whale had recovered enough from intensive hunting in the 1950s and
1960s to be caught without endangering its numbers. Norway claims that its
action is environmentally sound as there are now enough minke whales off its
coasts to 'harvest' in line with the Rio environmental summit's principle of
the 'sustainable use of the environment'.
Its scientific arguments that the minke is not endangered are good ones  -
although less complete than it claims - but it has undermined its case by
impatient and insensitive diplomacy. This summer the IWC scientific
committee formally accepted an estimate, based on Norwegian data, that there
are some 86,700 minke whales in the northeast Atlantic. That is a 'best
guess': the model gives a 95 per cent chance that the total lies between
61,000 and 120,000.
Acceptance of that figure marks a triumph for the Norwegian delegation to
the IWC. It had argued steadily that research in 1987 which suggested that
only 20,000 whales were left was wildly inaccurate.
The debate has raged because it is difficult and expensive to work out how
many whales there are. For two years Norway sent out boats from its marine
institutes to count whales systematically, crossing and recrossing the sea
in a grid, at a cost of 30m kroner. They spotted several thousand whales;
the institutes had to conduct more studies on how long whales stay
underwater and other crucial assumptions in order to project the total
population from that small sample.
The IWC's acceptance of the data put some weight behind Norway's case that
regular 'harvesting' would not jeopardise the northeast Atlantic minke
whale. But Norway promptly weakened its case by refusing to wait for the IWC
to agree a quota or inspection procedures.
Norway says it will itself run the IWC model of how fast minke whales breed
and set itself a safe catch limit.
The 'finger in the wind' guess from one IWC executive is that the eventual
figure is likely to be between 600 and 1500 next spring, which tallies with
the Lofoten fishermen's expectations.
So far the Norwegian government has refused to comment, thus preventing any
serious scientific discussion of whether its chosen 'harvest' will be safe
for the whales. It seems premature for it to claim 'we have science on our
side'.
Norway explains its impatience by saying that the IWC has been hijacked from
its task of setting safe quotas by countries which are opposed to any whale
killing at all. It has some cause for frustration, given the members' past
difficulty in reaching agreement. Indeed, the two arguments have often
become entangled. But it has done itself no favours in the way it dismisses
its opponents views as 'sentimental and emotional arguments based on animal
rights', in the words of the foreign ministry.
The proprietor of the Gammelbua bar demands 'what about Spanish
bullfighting? And what about your Prince Philip and his fox-hunting? Why
pick on whales - they are not special,' he says.
'Our problem is that in the past two decades the whale has become an urban
totem,' says Georg Blichfeldt, secretary of the High North Alliance, a
pro-whaling lobby based in Reine. 'It is cultural imperialism to impose
these foreign values on us.'
Those arguments have a long pedigree and a catholic set of advocates. The
Marquis de Sade, one of the most succinct, declared 'morals are geography
misapplied'. It is fashionable, widely marketed under the label of cultural
relativism, to argue that one culture's standards are not preferable to
another's. But it is hard for the Norwegian government to claim the moral
high ground. It may complain of other countries' totems but it has itself
made a totem out of its whaling traditions, now practised by a tiny fraction
of its people.
Its abrupt rejection of its opponents arguments also does not do justice to
the strength of feeling that whales arouse around the world. Hundreds of
thousands of pounds are regularly spent rescuing beached whales, and in the
past week a British diver has pledged to raise Pounds 250,000 to release a
Beluga whale, nicknamed Brightness, into the Black Sea. Both Jonah and Moby
Dick, neither urban nor contemporary, point to the history behind that
fascination.
Politics is more likely than moral pressure to bring a resolution to the
battle. International sympathy for whales may mean little to Lofoten
islanders, but it cannot be ignored by the Norwegian government,
particularly if it intends to apply to join the EC.
So far the Norwegian stand has been expressed in terms of high principle.
But it would be disingenuous for the government to argue that survival of
the fishing communities is its only motive; the survival of Mrs Brundtland's
precarious minority-government Labour Party, is also at stake. Her party has
seen its support collapse in the coastal towns partly because of its plan to
take Norway into the EC, which coastal towns see as a threat to their cod
quotas. In 1972 a national referendum extracted a vehement Nei to EC entry -
particularly from the north - and no government has tried since.
Oslo ministers are adamant that the whaling decision is not a bribe to
persuade the north to back a new referendum, but one local mayor, Mr
Sigbjoern Eriksen of Nordland, welcomes it for the help it will give the
fishing communities.
'Whaling will be one of several matters for negotiation if we decide to
apply to the EC in November' the foreign ministry says smoothly, but the row
is unlikely to have dissolved by then. The government has earned itself a
difficult autumn, spoiling a promising though incomplete scientific case
with inept diplomacy and isolationist rhetoric.
Meanwhile, the Lofoten whalers look anxiously on. Greenpeace, the lobby
group which has made its name by harassing whaleboats, last week tracked
down one of Haug's research boats and has since deterred it from killing
more whales. Leif Bendiksen, the 84-year old head of the clan, says 'We're
all uncertain. It's not sure this will go through. We're just a small
nation.'
From the porthole of the Malnesfjord Roald Olsen looks out at the sea. 'I
feel bitter, after hunting for so many years. To be up by Spitzbergen, in
your own boat, there is nothing like it. It is my greatest desire to hunt
for whales again.'

FT  01 AUG 92 / The Long View: Secrets of the drug culture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMID another wave of Olympic drug-taking scandals there are fears that the
problem is spreading to the financial markets. Various novel substances are
being tried out, and scientists are racing to develop new detection methods
. . .
Lamontose
A derivative of the drug Majorin, this controversial hallucinogen has
pain-killing qualities that enable those taking it to carry on
marathon-style beyond the normal limits of endurance. In fact it is almost
impossible to persuade them to stop, whatever damage they are doing to
themselves or others. Common side-effects include green streaks in the
vision which can progress to cause almost complete blindness. Ultimately the
drug can lead to permanent deep depression.
Thatcheronol
Has recently appeared at secret acid house parties as an antidote to
Lamontose. Produces dramatic clarity in the vision, and those swallowing
this concoction achieve a feeling of great certainty and self-confidence. It
may one day be legitimised in the UK, but the chances of Thatcheronol ('Blue
Hearts') ever being approved in Continental Europe are regarded as
non-existent, because of total incompability with German cold water
treatment.
Devalium
Often taken as part of a potent cocktail with Thatcheronol, or its close
cousin Tebbitin, Devalium is a version of an old stimulant banned some years
ago in most of Western Europe (though still popular in the US and parts of
Scandinavia). It is sometimes prescribed as a last-resort method of getting
people out of bed and back to work; best avoided, but occasionally resorted
to as a result of a wild weekend.
Natsaverine
Normally a legitimate and harmless enough financial sedative taken in small
quantities by mostly old people, this has proved to have unsuspected
qualities when increased in dosage and taken in conjunction with Cheltenum
G, another tranquiliser with which it tends to react quite violently. In
fact the government has panicked over this development, and the product has
been withdrawn by the manufacturer and replaced by a weaker version,
Natsaverine 2, reckoned to be inoffensive.
Maastrichterone
Appeared on the Dutch narcotics scene with much publicity at the end of last
year. After injection with this powerful artificial hormone even ageing
politicians and European Community officials have acquired aggressive,
masculine characteristics and have gained added weight and power. However,
newer and even more powerful drugs such as Danabol-N and the still untested
Francenon (due on the market in September) may render Maastrichterone
obsolete.
Danabol-N
This powerful derivative of referendenol, a traditional Swiss remedy for
weakness and indecisiveness last made widely available in the UK by Harold
Wilson's second government, appeared unexpectedly in Denmark in June and is
believed to have taken European financial markets by storm. Can permit swift
muscle-building by small peoples. The Brussels regulators appear to have
been taken by surprise but may not be able to rule Danabol-N illegal.
Frankfurtone
Slap-on anti-inflammatory remedy widely used in conjunction with German
ice-cold water and mud-bath therapy. It is considered excessively powerful
by many other Europeans as in some circumstances it can lead to loss of
circulation and even partial paralysis. It comes in two isomers, and
L-Frankfurtone (currently recommended for application as a 9 1/2 per cent
solution) is regarded as more significant than the D-form (8 3/4 per cent).
A disadvantage is that it may take a long time to work, but the Germans are
unconcerned about the damaging side-effects. Banned in the US and Japan.
Beta-statistiform
Anti-depressant formula which has a following among certain government
ministers and top civil servants. It can, for instance, make unpalatable
numbers appear attractive. Often prescribed for economy, and prices can be
made to appear low though they can vary according to interest levels. This
treatment came under suspicion when it was applied to large numbers of
unemployed people and many mysteriously disappeared, but nothing was proved.
Imrolin
Mind-bending drug from Maxwell Laboratories rumoured to be taken by
financial regulators to relieve the tedium of their job. Tell-tale signs
include a tendency for the eyes to glaze over and the head to nod
uncontrollably up and down. Highly addictive, although abusers may
eventually be switched over to the less damaging Sibrulin (large doses are
now considered necessary under a new regime). If the Imrolin addict does not
respond quickly, early retirement may be the only practical answer.
Programmerol
An alternative pick-me-up treatment enjoying something of a vogue amongst
computer software engineers, the joke being that they need it to help them
cure computer viruses. The most significant effect is a tendency towards
optimism which causes addicts to build strong recoveries into economic
models and this may explain some of the recent errors by City forecasters.
But now most are said to be back on nothing more mind-bending than aspirin.
Electorin
Detection-beating treatment designed to cleanse the system of controversial
elements. If this works the drug user can then expect four or five years in
which he can go back to his bad old ways before being tested again. For
instance, John Major appears to have survived tests for Lamontose and,
rumours have it, Maastrichterone (though some believe he opted out of this
particular treatment) but in the US George Bush may not find it so easy. He
is reckoned to be something of a devalium junkie.
Divimor
Pleasure-enhancing extract which has been very popular amongst unit trust
companies and pension fund managers. But manufacturers are being forced to
cut output because of a shortage of ingredients. Addicts could face some
rather nasty withdrawal symptoms.

FT  01 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Lex Service
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Interim figures from Lex Service should dispel some of the more wildly
pessimistic stories about the UK car market. The company's forecast of
August car sales slightly higher than last year suggests a national total
for the month in the region of 380,000, in line with yesterday's estimate
from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.
However, it remains unclear what impact the August rush will have on
aggregate second-half margins. Overproduction in anticipation of a more
solid recovery in consumer spending could still lead to an overhang of
inventory on the forecourts come the autumn, which would only be cleared by
discounting. Although the industry claims to be more rational than in the
1980s, such lingering doubts may explain the recent lacklustre performance
of Lex's shares. Having outperformed the market by 21 per cent between
January and May, they have since lost almost all of this advantage.
Even assuming a good August, Lex is unlikely to repeat the first-half
pre-tax figure of Pounds 16m, especially given the loss of the Volvo
concession. There must be some doubt about its ability to continue
equity-accounting the contribution from Arrow Electronics which was Pounds
4.6m in the first half. Against this, a more realistic view of residual
values allowed the group to make a respectable return on leasing and the
integration of Swan National appears to be proceeding smoothly. Assuming the
final dividend is held, a prospective yield of 6.3 per cent looks
undemanding.

FT  01 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Lloyds Bank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyds Bank must have been disappointed to see its shares fall more than 5
per cent yesterday after it raised its interim dividend by nearly 10 per
cent. After all, its net return on equity is a highly respectable 16 per
cent, the all-important tier 1 capital ratio is pushing 7 per cent and bad
debt provisions against large corporate loans are at their lowest level for
more than two years. The trouble is that these factors have for some time
allowed the shares to trade at a premium of 100 per cent and more to net
assets. What the market was not prepared for was the 6 per cent fall in
operating income.
Coming a day after a similar disappointment from Midland, Lloyds' interim
results add to the impression that a dearth of income is becoming a problem
for the British banking industry which no amount of cost-cutting can
disguise. True, Barclays and National Westminster are not expected to show
the same shrinkage in their loan books next week, but Lloyds is the bank to
which investors look for strategic vision. It may be right that lower
interest rates reduce the amount it can earn on its interest-free capital
and that some low-yield business is not worth keeping anyway. Beyond that,
however, the answers are hardly original: keep trimming expenses and hope
that loan demand will revive.
It is thus easy to see why Lloyds was so interested in acquiring Midland.
The merger would have given it both extra income and new costs to cut.
Unfortunately, there are no obvious alternative candidates. But investors
are not without some consolation. For the time being the bank has plenty of
resources - including Pounds 930m in surplus provisions for developing
country debt - with which to finance further increases in its dividend.

FT  01 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Sterling
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Perhaps Mr Brian Pearse of Midland Bank and Sir Denys Henderson of ICI would
be better advised to keep their mouths shut about the exchange rate. Their
complaints this week about the economic cost of maintaining sterling's level
within the ERM elicited no sympathy from the Treasury. But they have
contributed to a growing malaise in the currency markets. If that continues,
the government may find itself under pressure to raise interest rates, which
can scarcely be what the two men intended.
Part of the trouble is that the exchange market has begun to doubt the
government's resolve following the speed with which it moved to ensure that
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester withdrew its recent mortgage rate rise. That makes
the market more inclined to push sterling down towards its absolute D-mark
floor of 2.778. To be sure, there are still more than 6 pfennigs to go. But
sterling already needed official support against the Portuguese escudo
yesterday.
Sharply higher Italian interest rates have made it expensive to sell the
lira short. That is conspicuously not the case with sterling. Nor does
uncertainty over September's French referendum on the Maastricht treaty
help. When ERM stability was accepted by the market, currencies at the
bottom of the system could only move up. That no longer applies when the
system itself is in doubt.

FT  01 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Gas turns up the heat
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Gas's decision to submit itself to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission is of central importance for the UK's privatised utilities as a
class. British Gas may be in some ways a special case. It is the only
utility to have suffered a breakdown of relations with its regulator. But
that makes it the ideal test case on how far and how frequently a regulator
can change the rules. It is also the purest monopoly of the lot: the others
either suffer competition at the consumer level, like BT, or are broken into
regional monopolies like water and electricity. But that makes Gas the ideal
subject for establishing the central question of what kind of rate of return
a monopoly should enjoy.
For the other utilities - BT especially - the effect is that of a free ride
at Gas's expense. Going to the MMC is a fairly desperate expedient, given
the risk of an adverse ruling and the burden on senior management time. It
is not clear whether Gas did so because of stubborn resistance to change, or
in the realisation that the regulatory impasse was making change impossible.
Either way, it could ultimately benefit from the experience, not least in
being obliged or allowed to slash costs in the BT manner.
Investors must now resign themselves to a becalmed share price until the
spring. But an MMC reference was mostly in the price already. There is
always the chance that the findings will change Gas still further from the
animal described in the original prospectus. But for investors, as for the
management, there is value in knowing where they stand.

FT  01 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets: Unexpected loss knocks Allianz off its
pedestal - Disillusion with the insurer and high interest rates have
depressed German equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS week has proved to be a baptism of fire for Mr Henning Schulte-Noelle,
chief executive of Allianz, the Munich-based insurance company which is one
of Europe's most powerful financial institutions. In recent days the company
has had some rare trouble with its share price, which in turn has dragged
down the German stock market.
On Tuesday, Mr Schulte-Noelle held his first press conference since he took
over from Mr Wolfgang Schieren last autumn. What he had to communicate was
not welcomed by the stock market.
Shareholders were presented with a larger-than-expected underwriting loss in
1991 - the first-ever loss on Allianz's mainstream insurance business. The
loss amounted to DM1.78bn (Dollars 1.2bn), down from a profit of DM182m in
the previous year, reflecting difficult conditions in eastern Germany and in
North America.
That day, Allianz's shares dropped by 3 per cent. But the company's problems
 -and those of the market - did not end there. Following an analysts'
meeting on Wednesday, which prompted a hefty downgrading from DB Research,
the research arm of the Deutsche Bank, the shares dropped by another 4 per
cent on Thursday, and carried on sinking yesterday.
Allianz shares ended the week at DM1,835, a 9 per cent fall since Monday.
The DAX index closed at 1,615.42, little changed from last Friday but down
7.2 per cent since the Bundesbank raised its discount rate from 8.0 to 8.75
per cent on July 16.
Analysts say that Allianz's blue-chip image and its status as a proxy for
the market because of its shareholdings in other companies have both been
been tarnished.
Furthermore, investors who previously had been apprehensive about the merits
of the strategy pursued by the outgoing Mr Schieren, are now totally
disillusioned. His aim had been to reduce Allianz's dependence on the
profitable domestic market by investing overseas. Equally controversial was
the decision to buy Deutsche Versicherungs, the former east German state
insurance monopoly which is unlikely to be profitable before 1995-96.
He spent vigorously - some DM10bn during the 1980s - but these investments,
it appears, on the basis of Tuesday's figures, have lowered the quality of
the company's earnings.
The shares were dealt a further blow by a sell note from DB Research. DB
analyst Mr Michael Drepper believes that Allianz has grossly overstated its
reported Earnings Per Share (EPS) for last year.  He says that the 1991
figure should more properly have been DM26, less than two-thirds of the
DM40.85 reported on Tuesday. He has also cut his forecast for this year's
EPS from DM 45.50 to DM28 and for 1993 from DM54 to DM44.
His recommendation is based on the way Allianz has accounted for DM576m of
losses incurred by Deutsche Versicherungs. In calculating its EPS, it
treated the losses as an 'extraordinary' item which is taken 'below the
line' and therefore has no impact on earnings. DB Research argues that as
the losses were normal trading losses, they should have been taken above the
line, thus significantly reducing earnings.
Such an unequivocal 'sell' recommendation is unusual in the consensual world
of German finance. Conspiracy theorists see it as evidence of a
deterioration in relations between Deutsche Bank and Allianz, the two most
powerful institutions in the German financial services sector, and, through
their extensive industrial holdings, in corporate Germany as well.
The conspiracy theorists may well be wrong. What is clearer is that DB's
sell note shows the increasing influence of Anglo Saxon-style equity
analysis in the German stock market. Deutsche Bank has recently reorganised
its research activities in an effort to boost its credibility as a provider
of independent advice to institutional investors.
Equally Anglo-Saxon was Allianz's response to the sell note: it released a
statement to the press defending its position and Mr Diethart Breipohl, the
finance director, held an impromptu press conference.
This sort of reaction to share price developments may be familiar in the UK
or the US, but it is still uncommon in Germany.
Not surprisingly, the Allianz affair eclipsed the other corporate news of
the week. Commerzbank, the first of the big three banks to report its
figures, reported a 14.7 per cent increase in half-year profits; and BMW,
the luxury car maker, announced a 10.5 per cent increase in net profits in
the first six months, in spite of poor conditions in world car markets.
In both cases, the figures were impressive, but not enough to lift the gloom
which has settled on the German equity market since the interest rate rise.
Only the bravest investor would argue that today's prices offer a buying
opportunity. A technical rebound may be possible in the short term but it
seems unlikely that there will be a robust recovery in share prices until
the Bundesbank relaxes its monetary policy. At present, the consensus is
that the central bank will not cut rates until the first quarter of 1993 at
the earliest, and may even have to raise the internationally-sensitive
Lombard rate before then.

FT  01 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Fears about Deutsche's results
depress Frankfurt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES ended lower in uncertain trading, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT came under renewed pressure from Allianz and Deutsche Bank.
Forecasts that the latter's half-year results, due on Tuesday, may prove
disappointing saw its shares fall DM11.50 or 1.8 per cent to DM637. Some
analysts said that there were rumours that total operating profit would show
a 5 per cent decline compared with the same period in 1991, instead of
estimates of a rise of between 5 and 7 per cent. At midsession the FAZ was
down 6.12 at 636.90, slightly lower on the week while the DAX shed 8.57 to
1,615.42, but rose 0.3 per cent over the week. Turnover fell to DM4.6bn from
DM5.1bn.
BMW, up DM10 at DM553, was lifted by Thursday's pleasing results while other
car makers fell :Volkswagen off DM3 at DM356.50, Daimler down DM4.50 at
DM685 and Porsche DM12 lower at DM515.
News that the Swiss retailer Metro was to take a majority stake in Asko saw
the latter's shares fall as low as DM762 before recovering to close up DM2
at DM792. Some analysts welcomed the deal, since it would enable Asko to
consolidate its position in the retail sector.
PARIS was unsettled by weakness in the bond market and worries that the
French will vote against the Maastricht Treaty in the September referendum.
The CAC-40 index fell 27.90 to 1,754.67, but was still up 1.2 per cent on
the week thanks to an earlier but short-lived bear market rally. Volume was
a modest FFr1.9bn and was mainly generated by arbitrage activity.
Euro Disney continued its fall, losing FFr3 to FFr85 while BSN lost another
FFr15 to FFr1,000. The stock has lost 4.1 per cent since last Friday when
the food company said it planned to restrict voting rights.
MILAN rose as dealers squared their positions ahead of the weekend and the
start of August, when many companies close down for the summer holidays. The
Comit index rose 4.0 to 401.72, but was 1.1 per cent lower on the week, in
turnover estimated at slightly above Thursday's L80bn.
The market was pulled higher at the start by the insurance sector, with
Generali adding L345 to L26,345 and jumped to L27,850 after hours. Fondiaria
rose L560 to L23,810 and Ras added L340 to L13,850.
The market's rebound caused some 10 shares to be suspended temporarily for
excessive gains, including the steel group Falk and the energy group Edison.
AMSTERDAM saw selling in Philips after the consumer electronics group's
announcement on Thursday that it was delaying the introduction of a new
compact cassette product. Its shares shed 50 cents to Fl 24 while Polygram
slipped 70 cents to Fl 47.80. The CBS Tendency index closed down 0.8 at
116.2 but rose 0.8 per cent on the week.
Royal Dutch was lifted late in the session on good half year results from
its Shell Oil division in the US. Its shares advanced Fl 2.30 to Fl 147.20.
Fokker, rebuked by the stock market authorities for the way it kept its
minority shareholders appraised of its takeover talks with Dasa of Germany,
was 20 cents weaker at Fl 25.80.
ZURICH weakened in late trading. The SMI index fell 8 to 1,798.1, but put on
2.4 per cent on the week. Union Bank bearers lost SFr5 to SFr701 and Swiss
Bank bearers dropped SFr11 to SFr247 after announcing on Thursday a 7.7 per
cent fall in half year operating profit. Nestle bearers lost SFr70 to
SFr9,370.
BRUSSELS was lifted by gains in Solvay and Petrofina. The Bel-20 index
gained 4.08 to 1,145.26, adding 0.4 per cent on the week, in low turnover of
BFr645m. Solvay was actively traded after Thursday's positive half-year
results, advancing BFr200 to BFr12,475. Petrofina firmed BFr100 to
BFr11,025.
VIENNA eased in line with other markets. The ATX index lost 9.54 to 782.62,
but was up 1.4 per cent on the week.
Steyr Daimler Puch fell another Sch8 to Sch140 while Austrian Airlines
recovered Sch5 to Sch1,575 after falling Thursday on news that it may have
to cut its 1992 dividend.
STOCKHOLM rose on foreign interest in Astra. The Affarsvarlden index gained
2.70 to 861.70, up 3.2 per cent on the week. Astra's B shares advanced SKr3
to SKr539.

FT  01 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Corporate tax breaks
lift Nikkei
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
REPORTS of the government's additional economic stimulus package, which
includes planned tax breaks for corporate capital investment, lifted share
prices but activity remained subdued ahead of the weekend, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index gained 354.68 to 15,910.28, for a rise of 2.7 per cent
on the week. The index fell to the day's low of 15,469.09 in the morning
session on small-lot profit-taking, but later surged on index-linked buying
by investment trusts, hitting the day's high of 15,967.18 in the afternoon.
Volume, however, fell to 200m shares from 223m. Gainers led losers by 805 to
181, with 114 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first
section stocks rose 25.77 to 1,219.25 and in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
fell 2.34 to 968.93.
Traders said the bulk of activity consisted of short-covering, and little
new demand was seen. Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities said: 'Sentiment
seems to have improved as the government has started to announce concrete
measures to counter the weak economy and stock market.' He added that
investors were waiting to take profits at higher levels.
Reports that central bankers in the US, Japan, and Europe were in close
discussions over problem loans at commercial banks, encouraged market
participants.
Banks and property-related issues, which rose on Thursday on the
government's plans to support land prices by purchasing real estate for
public works projects, advanced sharply.
Industrial Bank of Japan gained Y70 to Y1,780 and Sumitomo Bank gained Y60
to Y1,430. Mitsui Fudosan, the leading realtor, added Y69 to Y839, and
Mitsubishi Estate Y45 to Y810.
Speculative theme stocks strengthened on short-term trading, with Meiji Milk
Products gaining Y15 to Y875 and Okamoto Industries Y30 to Y1,060.
Foreign investors were seen bargain-hunting in electrical blue chips.
Hitachi advanced Y7 to Y723 and Fujitsu gained Y20 to Y587. However, Toshiba
fell Y7 to Y614 and NEC lost Y2 to Y760 on continuing concerns over
earnings.
In Osaka, the OSE average gained 388.23 to 17,750.75 in volume of 12.9m
shares.
Roundup
A FIRMER Wall Street and Tokyo helped most markets in the Pacific Basin to
rise.
HONG KONG was stronger on selective bargain-hunting. The Hang Seng index
rose 51.30 to 5,881.13, a 1.9 per cent rise on the week, in turnover of
HKDollars 2.15bn.
HSBC Holdings was the most active stock, gaining HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars
54, while Hang Seng Bank improved 50 cents to HKDollars 53.50, and Cheung
Kong was up 30 cents at HKDollars 24.50.
SEOUL's composite index rose 0.72 to 509.95 but was 2.3 per cent down on the
week. Gainers exceeded losers by 327 to 309, with 191 unchanged.
TAIWAN ended higher on buying of shares in the food, plastics and textile
sectors. The weighted index gained 78.99 to 4,108.52, up 2.1 per cent on the
week, in turnover of TDollars 29bn.
MANILA was slightly stronger. The composite index advanced 3.78 to 1,499.50,
a 2.5 per cent increase on the week, as combined turnover improved to 329.3m
pesos from 226.9m pesos.
KUALA LUMPUR rose on bargain-hunting with the composite index closing 2.97
higher at 601.53 for a 1.3 per cent gain on the week. Gainers led losers by
156 to 72 in volume of 72.3m shares.
AUSTRALIA weakened with the All Ordinaries index ending down 3.2 at 1,617.7,
but up 0.5 per cent on the week.
BANGKOK rose on hopes of good second quarter results. The SET index gained
4.76 to 744.42, up slightly on the week. BOMBAY's BSE index gained 28.23 to
2,727.06.

FT  01 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Lloyds weak on interim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN MILLHAM, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOLLOWING the interim trading report, Lloyds Bank slipped 23 to 401p.
Operating profits for the half year fell to Pounds 697m from Pounds 729m and
chief executive Mr Brian Pitman said trading conditions are likely to remain
tough, with little economic recovery in sight. He added that 'with
continuing high real interest rates and slack loan demand we shall continue
our efforts to to enhance customer service, reduce costs and improve the
quality of our loan portfolio.' Turnover was at least double the usual daily
level at 5.8m shares.
Provision for bad and doubtful debts, excluding problem countries, declined
to Pounds 401m from Pounds 429m in the first half of last year, while an
improvement in the outlook for problem country debt meant there was a net
release of these provisions of Pounds 72m.
The bank's first half profits rose by Pounds 38m, or 11 per cent, to Pounds
369m, but retail banking profit in the UK was only Pounds 11m against Pounds
56m. Operating expenses were lower, due largely to a reduction in the number
of employees, but positive factors were offset by a fall in net interest
income.
Trafalgar upset
Worries that Trafalgar House may be in danger of breaching some of its
banking covenants persisted in the market yesterday undermining the shares
in heavy turnover of 5m.
Trafalgar's interests in shipping, property, hotels, engineering and
construction have borne the brunt of the recession and anxiety about the
group's debt position have emerged before. The company yesterday took the
unusual step of issuing a statement saying it saw 'no reason' for the share
price fall.
Mr Zafar Khan at Strauss Turnbull said: 'We have been concerned about the
company's short-term liquidity, but have been assured by the company that it
has no onerous covenants and that it has Pounds 700m of unutilised committed
banking faciltiies.'
Trafalgar shares, which stood at 160p at the beginning of May, yesterday
tumbled back to 45p before recovering to 51p, a net fall of 3 on the day.
Press reports that a recent warehouse fire may have pollution repercussions
for Allied Colloids sent the shares down 8 to 166p. Sentiment was not
improved as Hoare Govett reiterated its sell stance on the stock.
The resignation of a director at Laporte sent the shares into hasty retreat
before a late rally. They closed at 521p after touching 505p, a net 10 off.
Following ICI's demerger plans, Fisons continued to attract interest on
speculation that it could be in line for a takeover by one of the new ICI
segments. Fisons shares rose 5 to 178p. After Thursday's huge jump, ICI
retreated 8 to 1163p.
Property group MEPC jumped 10 to 236p in turnover of 6.9m - its highest
volume for nearly three years - as some in the market felt that the
downgrades and negative sentiment in the sector had been overdone.
Hotel group Forte was the best performer in the leisure sector as talk that
new non-exceutive directors might be appointed soon and that they would
bring substantial weight to a board long-criticised by analysts for lacking
fresh blood. There were also suggestions that Forte had been legitimately
buying its own stock over the last couple of days, although Forte was later
said to have denied this. The shares jumped 7 to 157p in brisk turnover of
4.6m.
Forte was also reported gleeful that its Gardner Merchant subsidiary had won
a substantial contract from its arch rival Compass Group. Shares in the
latter slipped 2 to 409p. However, Ms Sarah Clements at Paribas, moving to a
strong buy stance, said that Compass was a good defensive stock and that the
shares had an upside potential of 530p in the short-term.
A proposed management reorganisation at TI Group was well received and the
shares put on 4 to 308p. Conglomerate Harrison and Crossfield was subject to
adverse comment and a bout of profit-taking following results on Thursday.
The shares slid 7 to 127p.
News of improved holiday bookings lifted sentiment in photograph processing
group London International, with both Hoare Govett and Lehman Brothers
positive. The shares jumped 16 to 186p.
A series of reviews of the media sector by UK brokerage houses inspired
activity in several of the leading names. Reuters, the global business
communications network, extended its recovery from the fall of around 13 per
cent since the interim trading statement, gaining 24 to 1042p. Investment
optimism was encouraged by yesterday's announcement that two of Chicago's
largest futures contracts will be listed for trading on Reuters' Globex
system from this weekend.
Reuters shares have been obvious beneficiaries of this week's recovery on
Wall Street but London buyers were in evidence yesterday following a
recommendation from Hoare Govett which described the stock as 'undervalued'.
But publishing stocks continued to suffer from their association with the
fall in advertising revenues. Reed International, with 40 per cent of
revenue taken in the form of advertising, lost 10 to 483p, although it was
identified by SG Warburg Securities as 'poised for early recovery and
equally resilient if it arrives at glacial speed.'
Unilever was unchanged at 942p despite hopes of higher interim profits on
August 7. Analysts are looking for a rise to Pounds 862-Pounds 882m from
Pounds 840m previously. Hot European weather in May and early June is
expected to have boosted ice cream sales, in which Unilever is the leading
producer.
Shares in jewellery chain Ratners were unchanged at 9p after the company
said it plans to poublish its delayed accounts 'as soon as practicable.'
Accounts for the year-end to February 1 were due to be issued by August 1,
but has notified the Stock Exchange of the delay. The group said it is at an
advanced stage in finalising negotiations with its lenders to continue
existing facilities.
British Gas lost 6 1/2 at 240p, ahead of an announcement by Ofgas, the
industry watchdog, that it will make a monopoly reference on the gas
transportation industry. BP slipped 2 to 212p on rumours of a broker
downgrading, but Shell improved 5 to 471p as its US arm turned last year's
second quarter loss of Dollars 68m into a profit of Dollars 183m.
Troubled exploration group Lasmo gained a penny to 132p, but County NatWest
said the company is not yet out of the woods, despite this week's news of a
maintained interim dividend. Profits will remain under pressure, while there
are two more year of rising debt and gearing, according to County.
Banks had a generally weaker tone, in sympathy with Lloyds. Barclays fell 5
to 314p and National Westminster gave up 8 at 317p, but HSBC gained 3 1/2 to
339p in positive reaction to this week's interim figures from its Midland
Bank subsidiary.
There was little relief for holiday park operator Euro Disney, amid gloom
over poor attendance figures and losses. The shares rounded off a bad week
in the market shedding a further 33 to 875p.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the markets): Strike
nerves push platinum higher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NERVOUSNESS ahead of next week's national strike in South Africa pushed
platinum prices up sharply at the end of the week. South Africa accounts for
about two thirds of the total platinum supplies.
An earlier downtrend had been encouraged by Tuesday's announcement that a
pay settlement had been reached between management and unions at Impala
Platinum, South Africa's second biggest producer. But that slide was
reversed on Thursday, when the price rose Dollars 3.75 to Dollars 376.25 a
troy ounce, and yesterday a further Dollars 9 was added, taking the price to
Dollars 385.25 at the afternoon fix, up Dollars 4.90 on the week.
The two-day South African strike that is scheduled to begin on Monday had
already been discounted at the price ruling before the rise of the last two
days, but the market nevertheless became increasingly edgy as it drew
nearer. 'Nobody wanted to go into the weekend short. . . and the early
buying caused a panicky scramble to get covered,' one dealer explained
yesterday. He said there was concern that situation in South Africa might
get out of control once the strike was under way.
The gold price moved up with platinum yesterday, rising Dollars 1.35 to
Dollars 357.95 an ounce, up 50 cents on the week.
At the London Metal Exchange nickel prices came under increasing pressure as
stocks in exchange warehouses surged by 6,924 tonnes to an all-time high of
34,560 tonnes. That compared with 11,922 tonnes at the start of the year and
6,420 tonnes 12 months ago and beat the previous record of 32,664 tonnes set
in March 1984. A decisive breach of support at around Dollars 7,500 a tonne
for three months metal prompted further selling yesterday and by the close
the price was Dollars 7,417.50 a tonne, down Dollars 75 on the day and
Dollars 205 on the week.
The uptrend in LME lead stocks also continued this week, the total rising
another 1,600 tonnes to 148,800 tonnes. But that bearish factor was easily
outweighed by Thursday's news that workers had gone on strike at Doe Run's
Herculaneum smelter in the US, which has an annual capacity of 225,000 short
tons (2,000 lb). The cash price rose immediately by Pounds 17 to Pounds
353.50 a tonne, but was trimmed yesterday to Pounds 349.25, up Pounds 7.25
on the week, as the company said the smelter might restart on Monday, run by
salaried staff.
The announcement of a modest fall in LME aluminium stocks helped prices to
steady a little yesterday following a run of chart-inspired losses earlier
in the week. The cash price closed at Dollars 1,316.50 a tonne, up Dollars 6
on the day but Dollars 21 down on the week.
Some traders said that the flood of Russian aluminium that had driven the
exchange stockpile to unprecedented levels over the past 18 months had
slowed to a trickle as production difficulties got the better of the
country's hard-pressed producers. Shortages of cash, alumina (aluminium
oxide) and spare parts, combined with transport difficulties suggested that
Russian claims that exports were being maintained at 75 per cent of last
year's level (estimated at 1m tonnes) would not stand close examination,
they said.
Despite concern about Polish copper workers' plans to intensify their strike
action against the KGHM combine copper prices declined for most of the week.
A fall in LME stocks aided a Pounds 6.50 rally yesterday, however, and the
cash price closed at Pounds 1,315.50 a tonne, Pounds 25 down on the week.
When three months delivery tin breached the Dollars 7,000-a-tonne level on
Monday traders suggested that with chart patterns looking bearish a further
slide was on the cards. And they were not disappointed. Despite recovering
Dollars 20 yesterday the price ended the week Dollars 207.50 down on balance
at Dollars 6,835 a tonne.
The coffee market got little inspiration from talks going on in London this
week on a new price-stabilising international coffee agreement and the
September futures price ended Dollars 8 down on balance at Dollars 745 a
tonne.
'If you look at what has happened over the past week, then we haven't
achieved much. The prevailing feeling is one of frustration,' producer
spokesman Mr Valdemar Carneiro Leao of Brazil told the Reuter news agency
yesterday. The producers' disappointment stems from what they regard as the
inflexibility of certain consumers on the issue of controls. In particular
they are concerned that leading consumers such as the US are prepared to
accept coffee without proper documentation. Producers feel consumers should
be more committed to controlling imports at their end.

FT  01 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS a listless trading session in the derivatives markets yesterday, with
traders taking their cue from the foreign exchange sector rather than from
any links with underlying equity prices.
The September contract on the FT-SE Index struggled to hold on to its
opening level of around 2,419 and, after briefly touching 2,425, went into a
slow retreat. Local traders were largely out of the market and the Footsie
futures contract moved on sentiment. The dip in sterling, although recovered
before the close, heightened tensions over the outlook for interest rates in
the wake of comments this week from the president of the Bundesbank.
September closed at 2,414, 11 points down on the previous session and at a
4-point premium to its estimated fair value of 12. After the official close,
the September contract came in for support, however, and later quotations of
around 2,420 raised hopes for a firmer opening on Monday.
In traded options, where total volume increased from 20,783 to 23,143, the
FT-SE option saw 8,689 deals against just under 6,000 on Thursday. BAe
topped the actives list.

FT  01 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE 2,400 mark abandoned again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NERVOUSNESS in the sterling foreign exchange markets, which also inspired
falls in UK government bonds, took the heart out of UK equities yesterday.
The FT-SE Index finally lost a struggle to regain the 2,400 mark which had
been abandoned early in the session.
The focus on sterling's performance came in the wake of calls for a
realignment of the European exchange rate mechanism from the boardrooms of
Midland Bank and ICI. City analysts continued to take a cautious view of
this week's improvement in equities which appeared to be a technical bounce
in an oversold equity market rather than a definitive turn for the better.
A stock market looking desperately to the corporate sector for evidence of
economic improvement reacted negatively to the half-time trading report from
Lloyds Bank. Shares in Lloyds Bank, which have been seen as one of the most
attractive in the sector, fell sharply on the disclosure that the core UK
retail banking side continues to suffer.
After edging briefly higher, the market dipped sharply as sterling weakened
against the D-Mark. At the day's low point, the Footsie touched 2,396.8 and
although an attempt was made to rally, helped by the pound, this soon
fizzled out as Wall Street made a dull start to the new trading session.
The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,399.6 for a net loss of 12 points
on the session. This week, the opening leg of the two week equity trading
account, has seen the London stock market recover by 22.4 points on the
Footsie scale, or just under 1 per cent.
UK equities have been helped this week by improvement in both Tokyo and New
York. On the domestic front, however, economic views have remained gloomy.
Mr Nicholas Knight of Nomura Research Institute, rejecting market hints that
he had shifted his stance, yesterday reiterated his year-end target of
Footsie 2,500, with Footsie 2,300 the target for 'becoming more interested
again' in the short term. He expects the current equity rally to implode.
The strategy team at Strauss Turnbull believes that the market will be doing
well to stay above Footsie 2,400. However, SG Warburg Securities comments
that the reported demise of the equity market appears to be somewhat
exaggerated and that, for those taking a view beyond the next quarter or so,
'equities are looking outstandingly cheap.'
Retail business in equities has shown welcome signs of recovery from
depressed levels. However, investment uncertainty has been reflected in
turnover volatility.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Increasing gloom over sterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING lost around one pfennig in early European trading against the
D-Mark yesterday as the markets became increasingly gloomy about the
prospects for the UK economy, writes James Blitz.
Several dealers said that the market had been badly affected by comments
from several leading British businessmen, including the chief executive of
Midland Bank and the Chairman of ICI, that a realignment of the Exchange
Rate Mechanism (ERM) was needed if the government was to take control of the
economy.
Yesterday, Mr Robin Leigh Pemberton, the Bank of England Governor, tried to
counter these comments, saying that the UK authorities were fully committed
to membership of the ERM. But the darkening economic climate in Britain
makes many dealers wonder whether realignment or devaluation are in
prospect. The July survey of independent forecasters issued yesterday added
to the gloom, predicting that the UK economy will contract by 0.2 per cent
in 1992, compared to the treasury forecast of 1.0 per cent growth.
Under these conflicting pressures, sterling fell back to a low of DM2.8353
in the early afternoon, but soon recovered to close unchanged on the day at
DM2.8425. A particularly worrying aspect of its performance was its slide in
the EMS grid. Dealers said that both the Bank of Portugal and the Bank of
England were forced to intervene in the market, buying the pound, after
sterling fell below its permitted floor against the strongest currency, the
Portuguese escudo.
That divergence does not worry dealers excessively, as trading in the escudo
is only a small part of the foreign exchange market. But dealers tend to be
particularly bearish towards currencies at the bottom of the grid.
Yesterday, the gap between sterling and the second weakest currency, the
Italian lira, widened to 2.75 percentage points.
The dollar again moved in narrow ranges against the D-Mark in European
trading. Strong US factory orders for June, which rose by 2.3 per cent on
the previous month, and an up-beat Chicago Purchasing Management survey for
July, triggered an advance of nearly a pfennig up to DM1.4831. But in late
American trade, the dollar subsided in a wave of profit-taking, falling back
to a low of DM1.4727.
The dollar will continue to be trapped in narrow ranges next week. Dealers
believe that central banks will intervene if the currency falls towards
DM1.45, while US indicators are not strong enough for dealers to feel
bullish. However, the US currency could rally if July's non-farm payroll
data, due out on Friday, rises. The market expects an increase in jobs by
100,000 on the previous month.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Money Markets: Futures still bearish
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING futures again performed very bearishly yesterday as the market
continued to assume that a cut in UK base rates was a distant prospect.
The September short sterling contract closed at 89.63, its lowest finish
since base rates were cut to 10 per cent three months ago. After opening at
89.64, it had bottomed out earlier in the day at 89.60. The December
contract was also badly hit by the bearish mood, closing at 89.74, ten basis
points down from its previous close.
The closing price for the December contract assumes that 3-month money at
the year's end will still be at 10 1/4 per cent. The impression that there
will be no cut in the all-important German Lombard rate this year was
clearly given by Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank President on
Thursday. Sterling's poor performance yesterday did not help matters: the
currency slid one pfennig in early trading to a low of DM2.8353.
Rates in the sterling cash market were firmer, although this was again put
down to the month's end, when commercial banks and discount houses need to
keep a minimum amount of paper assets on their books to comply with Bank of
England requirements. Dealers also felt that they must keep bills in reserve
for next week: there is speculation that the Bank will hold another gilts
auction, creating big shortages in the discount market.
As a result, bills were only gradually offered to the Bank, on a day when a
shortage of Pounds 1.25bn was forecast in the morning. One week money was
dearer by  1/4 per cent on the offered side, closing at 10 1/4 per cent. One
month money was  1/16 per cent higher at 10 1/4 per cent offered, while
3-month money closed unchanged at 10 3/8 per cent offered.
The Bank operated at the established rates of 9 7/8 per cent for Bands 1 and
2, and 9 15/16 per cent for the repurchase agreement (repo).
In the morning, the Bank purchased Pounds 200m in the repo, revising the
forecast to Pounds 1.3bn. The Bank then bought Pounds 6m in Band 1 treasury
bills, Pounds 10m in Band 1 bank bills, and Pounds 34m in the repo. In the
afternoon, the Bank revised the shortage up to Pounds 1.4bn, bought Pounds
615m in the repo, Pounds 5m in Band 1 treasury bills, Pounds 158m in Band 1
bank bills, Pounds 102m in Band 2 bank bills and Pounds 350m in the repo.
Late assistance was Pounds 405m.

<TEXT>
DU PONT, the leading US chemicals group that is embarked upon a series of
restructuring projects, yesterday unveiled plans to reorganise its
electronics division.
Effective from today, Du Pont will transfer its polyester and high
performance films businesses from the electronics division to the Du Pont
imaging systems and medical products organisation.
The films business has annual revenues of about Dollars 550m, which means Du
Pont's electronics division - which last year had about Dollars 1.8bn of
revenues - will be left with less than Dollars 1.3bn of annual turnover.
About 100 voluntary redundancies will be sought as a result of the move; the
electronics division at present employs about 8,000.
Mr Edgar Woolard, the Du Pont chairman, said that on November 1 management
responsibility for the remaining electronic businesses will be transferred
from the US to Japan.
Mr Chad Holliday, president of Du Pont's Asia Pacific operations, will take
over with responsibility for the printed circuit materials, microcircuit
materials and semiconductor materials businesses in addition to his present
activities.
Du Pont will, meanwhile, proceed with the planned divestiture of the
electronics division's connectors business, which is expected to take place
by the year-end.
The connectors business, which employs about 3,000, has annual revenues of
about Dollars 450m, meaning that the electronics division Mr Holliday will
take over will have total sales of about Dollars 800m.
Mr Woolard said the electronics plan was aimed at strengthening the group's
position as a materials supplier to the worldwide electronics industry.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ELKEM, the Norwegian light metals producer, and Broken Hill Proprietary,
Australia's biggest stock-listed company, have signed a preliminary
agreement aimed at reducing their exposure to cyclical market fluctuations
and stabilising earnings of their manganese businesses.
The deal will give Elkem long-term access to manganese ore at prices below
current market rates while securing BHP's customer base for long-term
supplies of the raw material.
Elkem is one of the world's leading manganese alloy producers and BHP one of
the world's leading suppliers of manganese ore.
The agreement, subject to government approval, calls for Elkem to acquire a
49 per cent stake in a newly established subsidiary of BHP's unit, GEMCO, a
manganese ore supplier.
In return, BHP will take a 49 per cent stake in two of Elkem's domestic
manganese alloy plants.
The transactions will be completed without financial compensation. , Elkem
said. It added a final agreement should be signed in the autumn. The deal
also calls for GEMCO to supply manganese ore to Elkem's two domestic
manganese alloy plants, and a plant in the US.
GEMCO owns and operates a manganese ore mine in Groote Eylandt, Australia.
Mr Bjoern Segrov, an Elkem executive, said that last year the company
purchased an estimated 500,000 tonnes of manganese ore. He added that
although the deal with BHP will meet the bulk of Elkem's manganese ore
demand, the company will still need to buy ore from South Africa.
The final agreement will form an alliance in the manganese market which few
can match in quality, size and competitive power, Elkem maintained.
In the long-term, it will offer the potential for greater earnings for the
two companies.
Since 1986, manganese ore prices have tripled to more than Dollars 175 a
tonne. Elkem's manganese alloy operations last year saw a turnover of
NKr2.1bn (Dollars 360m), of which NKr1.1bn was achieved by its two domestic
plants.

CREDIT SUISSE, Switzerland's third-largest bank, is in talks to buy
Gewerbebank Baden, the leading bank in the Baden region with assets of
SFr1.66bn (Dollars 1.21bn) at the end of June.
The talks are with BBC Brown Boveri, the Swiss partner in the ABB Asea Brown
Boveri engineering group, which holds a 38 per cent voting stake in the
bank. Winterthur Insurance, which holds 13 per cent of the votes, is also
co-operating.
Mr Leo Menz, senior vice-president, finance, of BBC, said the shares would
be sold at slightly above market prices, and that minority shareholders
would be offered identical terms in a public offer.
Gewerbebank Baden's bearer shares last traded at SFr760 earlier this week
and its registered shares at SFr255, valuing the bank at SFr123.8m.
The sale is part of BBC's policy to sell off participations in businesses
other than ABB. Following the sale of the bank, ABB would account for 99 per
cent of BBC's interests.

THE PAKISTANI government's privatisation effort has suffered a setback, with

Brokers believe no more than 20 per cent of the 52m shares, offered at
Rs40.15 (Dollars 1.62) each, have been subscribed for.
Brokers had expected the price to rise to Rs60, but on Thursday it closed at
Rs42.
Muslim Commercial Bank, the underwriter, has, however, not announced the
level of subscriptions.
'The government would need to carefully re-evaluate their plans in the light
of SNGPL's experience,' said one leading broker.

provision for bad debts

<TEXT>
WESTPAC Banking Corporation, the Australian bank, made a cautious prediction
for the next 18 months in a prospectus issued yesterday for its ADollars
1.2bn (USDollars 890m) fund-raising operation.
It predicted it would make specific provisions for doubtful debts of less
than ADollars 300m for the six months to September.
The bank shook investors in May with provisions of ADollars 2.65bn for the
March half, mainly reflecting plummeting real estate values, causing a loss
of ADollars 1.67bn. The share issue, announced at the time, is needed to
maintain capital adequacy ratios above central bank requirements.
Westpac, which is raising the money through a three-for-10 issue of shares
at ADollars 3 each, warned that Australia's severe economic recession would
continue to affect financial results.
Mr Frank Conroy, Westpac managing director, said yesterday the main task now
was to pursue an asset disposal programme. He indicated that around ADollars
500m worth of mainly property assets had been sold since March 31.
He added that he believed the bank had made adequate provisions, especially
compared with its peers, but economic uncertainties precluded any specific
profit forecasts.
The prospectus contained a report from KPMG Peat Marwick, as independent
consulting accountants, broadly confirmed the bank's balance sheet
valuations and forecasts. But the accountants made clear they had not
conducted an audit of Westpac, but rather examined previously audited
information. The prospectus confirmed Westpac expects to pay a 12 cents
final dividend.

THE BATTLE among bidders for the Daily News appears set to enter its final
phase, as the newspaper yesterday won a 10-day extension of the deadline by
which it must file a reorganisation plan to the New York bankruptcy court.
The extension came with news that a new group - Silver Screen Management -
is joining forces with the newspaper's management and unions to launch a
stand-alone bid.
Silver Screen, led by Mr Roland Betts and Mr Tom Bernstein, former
entertainment lawyers, is said to be willing to put up about Dollars 25m.
Both Mr Conrad Black, the Canadian publisher who owns the Daily Telegraph in
the UK, and Mr Mortimer Zuckerman, the publisher who owns US News and World
Report, are, however, continuing to negotiate with the paper's unions and
creditors. It is believed that one of these bidders is more likely to end up
owning the New York tabloid.
It is also thought likely that the latest 10-day extension will be renewed
again. But advisers say the identity of the leading contender should become
clear within the next 10 days.

<TEXT>
SCHNEIDER, the French industrial group, yesterday secured shareholder
approval for its proposed takeover of Merlin-Gerin, the electrical equipment
manufacturer, and warned it might seek permission for a capital increase.
Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, chairman, repeated his earlier warning that
Schneider's 1992 profits would be at the lower end of expectations.
Originally Schneider had been expected to make FFr400m (Dollars 78.4m) to
FFr650m. The final outcome would be closer to FFr400m mainly because of
steep losses at Spie-Batignolles, its construction offshoot.
The initial profits warning in June triggered an inquiry by the French stock
market authorities into Schneider share dealings.
Mr Pineau-Valencienne
yesterday said Spie's losses, originally expected to be around FFr150m for
1992, could be up to FFr200m. He also anticipated a loss from Square D, the
US building business, despite an increase in operating margins.
Mr Pineau-Valencienne said Schneider might ask shareholders to authorise a
capital increase but it was 'not absolutely indispensable'. Schneider's net
debt rose sharply after the Dollars 2.23bn acquisition of Square D last year
and is now estimated at around FFr18.7bn.

FT  01 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Lloyds Bank 11% higher at Pounds 369m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYDS BANK, the smallest of the Big Four UK clearers by asset size,
yesterday reported an 11 per cent rise in its pre-tax profits during the
first half of the year.
However, the improvement chiefly reflected lower provisions against bad
debts and the release of Pounds 72m of provisions of problem country debt.
Pre-tax profits for the half year to June 30 were Pounds 369m, up from
Pounds 331m a year ago. The total bad debt charge was Pounds 329m, down from
Pounds 425m. Total assets were down from Pounds 54.17bn a year ago to Pounds
50.39bn.
Sir Jeremy Morse, Lloyds' chairman, said that though there had been tight
control of costs, the trading side had not been good because of the
continuing recession in the UK economy.
Lloyds Abbey Life was the group's most profitable business, contributing
Pounds 142m (Pounds 150m) pre-tax, followed by its problem country debt
operation which made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 95m (Pounds 14m) including
release of the Pounds 72m provision.
Corporate banking contributed Pounds 60m, up from Pounds 18m a year ago,
with provisions down from Pounds 82m to Pounds 41m. The provisions were the
lowest figure for the past five half years.
UK retail banking, usually regarded as the activity in which Lloyds
outshines its competitors, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 11m, down from
Pounds 56m a year ago, after bad debt provisions of Pounds 266m, mostly
against losses on loans to small and medium sized businesses. Personal
customer business is said to be improving.
Private banking made profits of Pounds 38m, up from Pounds 35m, and profits
from international banking rose from Pounds 26m a year ago to Pounds 37m.
Lloyds Merchant Bank slipped into a loss of Pounds 14m, down from a Pounds
3m profit last time after provisions of Pounds 18m against investments by
Lloyds Development Capital. However, investment managing and stockbroking
are said to be doing well.
Net interest income declined from Pounds 1.2bn to Pounds 1.07bn. Other
operating income was slightly up at Pounds 815m (Pounds 806m), including
Pounds 166m (Pounds 160m) in UK current account fees and Pounds 254m (Pounds
224m) in other UK fees and commissions. Credit card income was flat at
Pounds 36m (Pounds 35m).
Lloyds' unsuccessful bid for Midland Bank cost Pounds 4m.
The group's net interest margin narrowed to 4.4 per cent from 4.49 per cent.
In the UK the net interest margin was 5 per cent, down from 5.33 per cent.
Group operating costs were slightly down at Pounds 1.18bn (Pounds 1.28bn),
producing an improvement in the cost:income ratio which fell to 63 per cent
from 63.7 per cent a year ago.
The total number of employees working for the group fell from 71,521 a year
ago to 65,458 at the end of June.
Lloyds' capital ratios are stronger than they were a year ago with its risk
asset ratio at 10.2 per cent, up from 9.2 per cent and the tier 1 capital at
6.7 per cent. Its loan book in the UK has fallen to Pounds 30.96bn from
Pounds 33.5bn a year ago.
Earnings per share were 16.4p, up from 14.7p, and the interim dividend is
being increased to 5.9p (5.4p).
In the market, Lloyds' shares fell sharply, closing 23p down at 401p.

FT  01 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Unit in profit despite engineering loss
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Unit Group, the USM-quoted maker of timber pallets and precision engineering
components, announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 138,971 for the year to
March 31 compared with losses of Pounds 236,649 previously.
However, although the pallet division achieved profits of Pounds 474,610
pre-tax, engineering activities incurred losses of Pounds 335,639 and that
division has been closed. Mr John Adams, the chairman, said the
diversification into engineering at the end of the eighties had 'proved to
be a costly failure'.
Paramount was sold to its management in January 1992 and Green Pennant was
closed in June 1992.
Mr Adams said all costs of withdrawing from engineering had been taken as an
extraordinary Pounds 1.55m charge and there would be no costs in the current
year. However, as those costs were greater than anticipated there is again
no dividend.
Turnover fell to Pounds 21.2m (Pounds 28.6m) with pallets contributing
Pounds 20.4m. Earnings per share emerged at 0.8p (2.9p losses).

FT  01 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Abbey Panels Pounds 1m in the red
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LOSSES at Abbey Panels Investments, an engineer to the motor, aerospace and
defence industries, widened from Pounds 110,000 to Pounds 1.18m pre-tax for
the half year ended March 31.
Sales tumbled from Pounds 10.38m to Pounds 5.51m and losses per share worked
through at 49.8p (13.2p).
The directors pointed to their last statement, which indicated that the
downward trend in the company's trading results would continue.
They said: 'This has certainly been the case. The results speak for
themselves. The recessionary effect of work cut-back and slashed margins
have had a devastating effect.'
They added that the introduction of a new product line had added to the
problem.
Meanwhile, they would 'continue watching all outgoings and costs' and act to
minimise them where necessary. They did not see any signs of improvement,
'certainly during the rest of 1992.'
Pre-tax losses for the 1990-91 year amounted to Pounds 234,000.

THE HOSTILE all-share bid by Kalon, the Yorkshire-based paint maker, for
Manders (Holdings), the paints, inks and property group, is not to be

This means that day 39 of the progress of the Pounds 89m 8-for-3 bid falls

Trilion, the USM-quoted television production company, reported pre-tax
losses almost doubled at Pounds 1.48m in the six months to March 31,
compared with Pounds 788,000.
The company blamed the tough market faced by its facilities at the Trocadero

Turnover declined to Pounds 7.17m (Pounds 8.15m). Interest costs rose from
Pounds 55,000 to Pounds 314,000. Losses per share rose from 1.3p to 2.5p.

<TEXT>
RATNERS GROUP, the troubled jewellery chain, has delayed publication of its
annual report and accounts for the year to February 2 while it concludes
refinancing talks with its bankers.
The outcome of the talks does not appear to be in doubt, since Ratners
yesterday said it would pay its convertible bondholders the Pounds 58m they
are owed on October 30.
The group said it was at an advanced stage in finalising negotiations with
its lenders to continue their existing facilities and that it expected those
negotiations to be concluded shortly.
The accounts would be published as soon as practic-able.
Ratners has already said it plans to make extraordinary provisions of nearly
Pounds 100m in these results to cover rationalisation.
The shares, which have collapsed from a peak last year of 189p, yesterday
closed unchanged at 9p.

FT  01 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Barker buy-outs defended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECEIVERS to Charles Barker, the world's oldest public relations firm,
yesterday defended criticism from creditors at the speed at which two
management buy-outs were announced, only hours after the collapse on
Thursday of Corporate Communications, Charles Barker's parent company.
Mr Ian Bond, a partner with the accountancy firm Cork Gully, which was
appointed as receiver, said yesterday that great speed was essential in the
sale of a 'people business' to ensure that clients and employees did not
quit.
Charles Barker said that the board of Corporate Communications passed a
resolution on Thursday July 23 to call in the receivers, when it became
apparent that the group was about to breach its banking covenants.
The two buy-outs - to be named Georgeson International, the financial and
investor relations side, and Charles Barker, the corporate, marketing and
public affairs operation - took place on the same day that the group passed
into the hands of receivers with debts of Pounds 10m.
The receivership happened just one day before many creditors were due to be
paid. Month-end invoices from Newspaper advertising departments were due to
be sent out yesterday. The Financial Times is likely to lose at least Pounds
250,000; The Daily Telegraph is believed to be a creditor to the tune of
about Pounds 70,000.
Two of Charles Barker's larger clients - Eurotunnel and IBM - said yesterday
that, as yet, they planned to continue using its services.
Corporate Communications' problems followed an acquisition and expansion
spree since 1989, the year it was formed.
In April 1989 it paid Dollars 13m for Georgeson, a New York-based investor
relations firm, a deal widely reckoned to have been sensible. In October
1989 it bought Charles Barker for Pounds 9m, which a former director of
Corporate Communications yesterday suggested was some Pounds 2.5m more than
its then market value. In the last two years Corporate Communications has
spent an estimated Pounds 13m on internal reorganisations, premises and new
technology.

MR JOHN BAKER chief executive of National Power earned Pounds 383,000 in the
year to March, 1992, more than double his remuneration of Pounds 147,000 in
the previous financial year, writes Peggy Hollinger.
This was revealed in the company's latest annual accounts published
yesterday, which also show that the company shed some 3,092 jobs last year
leaving the total at 11,421. A further 2,400 job losses are planned.
National Power said it intended to withdraw from industry-wide negotiating
committees by the end of 1992, and would make its own arrangement for
negotiating with unions.
Mr Baker's basic salary, which has been increased twice since the spring of
1991, came to Pounds 246,000 for the year to March 31.

FT  01 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Dollars 913m agreed bidfor Templeton,
Galbraith
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TEMPLETON, Galbraith Hansberger, the London-listed and Bahamas-based
international fund management company, is being acquired by Franklin
Resources Incorporated, the California-based fund manager in an agreed deal
valued at Dollars 913m (Pounds 478m).
Franklin specialises in fixed-income retail products and the merger will
form the largest independent fund management company in the US.
The merger is widely viewed as a bellwether for the mutual fund industry
which is facing increasing competition in a mature market. Selling expenses
are rising and industry analysts are taking the view that further
consolidation within the industry is likely.
'Fund managers will need to have more money under management in order to
cover costs,' said Mr Patrick Donlea, partner at Cazenove which acted as
adviser on the transaction.
The deal is expected to give Templeton access to greater distribution
networks in the US, said Mr Martin Flanagan, a director of TGH. Templeton
recently announced changes to its pricing structure, lowering front-end fees
on its mutual funds because they were substantially above the industry
average and were costing the company sales.
The terms call for Sir John Templeton, the 79-year old founding member of
the company, his son Mr John Templeton and partner Mr John Galbraith to
receive Dollars 5.69 per share. The three own about 70 per cent of the
company.
Sir John has said he would like gradually to reduce his involvement in the
company's affairs and will change his role in the new structure to that of
consultant.
Public shareholders will receive Dollars 6 a share. Because of the deal, no
dividends will be paid in respect of the six month period ended June 30
1992.
If Templeton loses more than 20 per cent of its funds under management
before the deal can be approved by shareholders then the price per share
will fall. If more than 40 per cent of funds under management are withdrawn,
both Templeton and Franklin have the right to terminate the agreement.
Franklin said its intention was to keep the management structure and
investment style of Templeton intact - a key factor in retaining Templeton's
client base. To this end, it plans to offer employment contracts, which
include bonuses, to certain employees, including four of the directors. Two
of the four are Mr Thomas Hansberger and Mr J Mark Mobius, investment
manager of the highly successful emerging markets fund. If the directors
stay a further two years after the merger, they will receive another Dollars
32m in bonuses.

FT  01 AUG 92 / UK Company News: O'Reilly takes 1.3% stake in Mirror Gp
Newspapers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TONY O'REILLY, former Ireland rugby international and the head of Heinz
the US food group has given the most tangible evidence so far of an interest
in Mirror Group Newspapers.
Since the re-listing of MGN shares earlier this month Independent Newspapers
in Dublin, the newspaper group, of which Mr O'Reilly is chairman, has bought
a little more than 5m shares or 1.3 per cent.
The shares were probably bought at an average price of about 60p following
the opening of the re-listed shares at 50p. The MGN shares have climbed
gradually since and closed yesterday at 71p, an increase of 2p on the day.
MGN management found out about Mr O'Reilly's modest stake building by
submitting 212 disclosure forms to find out who was buying the shares.
The Independent Newspapers stake was the only one to be revealed that
suggested that potential purchasers of the popular newspaper group might be
buying. The rest of the activity in the shares came from stockbrokers and
involved relatively small stakes.
Mr O'Reilly has made no secret of his interest in MGN which includes the
Daily and Sunday Mirror, The People and the Scottish Daily Record and Sunday
Mail.
A 1.3 per cent stake is however little more than symbolic.
More than 54 per cent of the company in under the effective control of
Arthur Andersen, the administrators to the private Maxwell interests.
All the signs are that the administrators intend to hold on to the stake
until the share price returns much closer to the flotation price of 125p.

FT  01 AUG 92 / UK Company News: OMI incurs Pounds 2.7m loss and shares fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES of OMI International fell 5p to 12p yesterday after the design,
instrumentation, and electro-optics group announced heavy losses and the
sale of businesses.
OMI, formerly called Optical and Medical International, made pre-tax losses
of Pounds 2.68m in the year to March 31, compared with profits of Pounds
2.45m last time. Turnover was Pounds 51.21m (Pounds 53.48m).
The group has agreed to sell its aerospace and general design businesses and
the staff placement agency business, OTS Services, to Hebron &amp; Medlock
(Holdings), a private company. The deal will bring OMI a net Pounds 2m in
cash, but the group made an extraordinary provision of Pounds 12.82m,
principally to cover the disposals. Also included in the extraordinary
provision were the costs of closing parts of Peters &amp; Zabranbsky, a German
subsidiary.
Mr Gil Williams, chairman and chief executive, said this exit from the
depressed aerospace and general design businesses was part of the group's
strategy of focusing on specialised products and added-value services - such
as industrial logistics, diagnostics and optronics.
Losses per share of 6.4p compared with a profit of 3.4p last time. At the
year-end, OMI had net cash of Pounds 478,000, which will be boosted by the
proceeds of the disposals. In view of the strength of the balance sheet, the
board recommended a final dividend of 1p, giving a total for the year of
1.75p (5.21p).

FT  01 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Associates boost for Lex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP increase in the share of profits from associates and a Pounds 6.6m
fall in interest payable to Pounds 3.6m helped Lex Service, the motor group,
lift pre-tax profits from Pounds 4.2m to Pounds 16m in the six months to
June 28.
The half-year was one of change for the group. In March, Lex lost the UK
import concession for Volvo cars, an important source of its profits for
years.
Volvo assumed direct control and paid Lex Pounds 73.5m compensation which
constituted the bulk of Lex's Pounds 79.6m extraordinary gains in the latest
res-ults.
The money accrued, along with the profits on the sale of Lex Electronics
Europe, enabled Lex to reduce its borrowings from Pounds 57m to Pounds 19m;
to increase shareholders' funds to Pounds 244.6m (Pounds 203.8m); to buy in
May Swan National Motor Group, then a wholly owned subsidiary of the TSB
banking group, in a deal worth about Pounds 45m; and at the period-end to
exercise its option to buy for about Pounds 5.7m the remaining 50 per cent
it did not already own of Seltra, the Paris-based truck contract hire
company.
The share of profits from associates at Pounds 10.8m (Pounds 900,000)
outstripped Lex's own operating profits at Pounds 8.8m (Pounds 13.5m). The
company said that this would change once the period of transition was past.
Arrow Electronics of the US, to which Lex sold its North American
electronics components businesses for 6.9m shares, or 34 per cent of its
equity, in September 1991, contributed Pounds 4.6m to Lex's associates'
total. Lex was selling its stake 'in a controlled way'. It has already made
Pounds 1.5m, taken as an extraordinary profit. The proceeds of the Arrow
disposal, the company said, would be reinvested in Lex's core distribution
and leasing sides.
Some Pounds 4.7m of the associates' contribution came from the car and truck
leasing companies, jointly owned with Lombard North Central, with cars
chipping in profits of Pounds 3m (losses Pounds 900,000).
Turnover from continuing businesses rose Pounds 3m to Pounds 324m giving
trading profits of Pounds 6m (Pounds 5.5m). Trading profits from
discontinued activities were Pounds 7m (Pounds 13m).
The company said that 'there were the weakest signs of recovery' in the new
car market. Thanks to the one month of sales from Swan National, Lex lifted
its market share, selling 14,000 cars. Operating profits in Lex Retail were
Pounds 5.5m, 'slightly higher than' last time.
Earnings grew to 10.5p (1.5p) per share and the interim dividend is held at
4p.

FT  01 AUG 92 / The Italian connection: A business and political scandal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As he faces his second weekend in Milan's decrepit San Vittore jail, Mr
Salvatore Ligresti, the 60-year-old Sicilian-born property magnate who is
one of the richest men in Italy, may reflect ruefully on his path to the
top.
Mr Ligresti is the most prominent figure to have been arrested in the
growing political scandal in northern Italy, which has so far caught over 70
party functionaries, businessmen and bureaucrats in its net. With
magistrates planning to work through the August holidays, many Milanese
believe the investigation could yet reach the highest levels of the
country's business and political elite.
During his rise, Mr Ligresti has become a central cog in the network of
corporate and business alliances which link many of the country's most
prestigious companies. But having been charged with involvement in
corruption and having admitted paying bribes of more than L1bn (Pounds
460,000) to win contracts for Milan's new metro line his lawyers are now
trying to secure his release pending trial.
The arrest of a businessman who counts among his friends Mr Enrico Cuccia,
the veteran honorary chairman of Mediobanca, the Milanese merchant bank, and
Mr Bettino Craxi, the Socialist party leader, has sent shock waves through
Italian business circles. No other entrepreneur so successfully spans the
worlds of politics, business and the bourse. And few have had a bigger
visual impact on Milan than Mr Ligresti. His Premafin holding company has
built a string of almost-identical glass-clad office towers.
Premafin, 76 per cent owned by Mr Ligresti, controls four quoted companies
in insurance, construction, toll motorways and porcelain and sanitary ware.
The most important is SAI, one of Italy's biggest insurers with annual
premiums of more than L2,300bn. The company has enabled Mr Ligresti to break
out of his role as a property baron and become a linchpin of Italian
finance. SAI's investments in blue chip companies such as Cofide, Pirelli
and Italmobiliare, the holding companies for the De Benedetti, Pirelli and
Pesenti families, gave him the key to the 'salotto buono', the good drawing
room, of Italy's industrial aristocracy. In most cases, those shareholdings
provided a seat on the board.
SAI is also the best-known of Mr Ligresti's operations abroad and has built
links with European insurance groups and institutional investors.
Friends' Provident of the UK now owns 4.3 per cent of Premafin and almost 2
per cent of SAI, while Groupe des Assurances Nationales of France has 10 per
cent of SAI.
SAI's real gem is its 2 per cent stake in Mediobanca which is at the centre
of a complex network of cross-shareholdings between many of Italy's
best-known private-sector companies.
The relationship between Mr Ligresti and Mr Cuccia, a fellow Sicilian, goes
back at least to the mid-1980s when Mr Ligresti used his good offices with
Mr Craxi, then prime minister, to smooth Mr Cuccia's plans for the
part-privatisation of Mediobanca.
Since Mediobanca managed the flotation of Premafin in 1989, the links
between Mr Ligresti and Mr Cuccia have tightened.
One of the most striking examples of their co-operation came with the
revelation that Mr Ligresti had bought 5 per cent of Continental, the German
tyres group which Pirelli, advised by Mediobanca, tried unsuccessfully to
acquire in a protracted bid battle last year.
Such high-level patronage has earned Mr Ligresti both envy and enemies. The
son of a shopkeeper from a village near Catania, his virtually
rags-to-riches story triggers gossip from the snobbish Milanese.
Mr Ligresti first crossed swords with the city's magistrates in a scandal
over land sales to the council in the mid-1980s. The affair prompted the
resignation as mayor of Mr Carlo Tognoli, one of the most prominent
politicians now under investigation as part of the umbrella Milan
investigations into fraud and corruption. Subsequent arrests involved
allegations of planning violations at new office developments. In each case,
Mr Ligresti was acquitted.
Mr Ligresti's latest problems are likely to prove more serious than those in
the past because the scope of the current investigations is much wider and
the position of the main political parties is weaker.
Shares in all Mr Ligresti's companies have plunged since his arrest, though
some parts of the group were already facing difficulties. SAI, for instance,
has been exposed to underwriting losses while earnings at Grassetto,
Premafin's construction subsidiary, have also fallen because of recession
and tougher competition abroad. The scandal has aggravated the business
outlook by putting a brake on new public-sector contracts. Orders could fall
further given the prospect of severe public spending cuts as part of the
government's plans to reduce the budget deficit.
Even property development has been suffering. Real estate prices in Milan
have fallen sharply since the late-1980s. Office rentals have also slipped.
Many of Mr Ligresti's developments are vulnerable as they are in outlying
areas, often poorly served by public transport.
No one is suggesting that Mr Ligresti's empire is about to topple. He may
bounce back. But bankers believe it will take time and even Mr Cuccia's
patronage may not be enough to stop some of Mr Ligresti's boardroom buddies
distancing themselves from their Sicilian colleague, no matter how great his
financial muscle.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DENIS E FILER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The enthusiasm of business and industry for closer links with education
(Management, July 29), is fully endorsed by The Engineering Council which is
mobilising a nation-wide army of engineers and technicians to work with
secondary schools through the Neighbourhood Engineers initiative.
Under this scheme more than 1,600 engineers are currently working with
teachers, pupils and parents to deliver the curriculum in more than 6,000
schools.
Also, girls are encouraged to consider a career in a technological field
through visits to schools by specially equipped buses and trailers,
sponsored by industry, through our WISE (Women Into Science and Engineering)
campaign.
Since the launch in 1984 of this campaign by the council and the Equal
Opportunities Commission, the number of women studying engineering in higher
education has increased from 7 per cent to more than 15 per cent.
Only through closer links with schools, and helping with the curriculum, can
industry hope effectively to influence education of its significance to
wealth creation and to the economic success of the nation.

   From Mr JOHN R WILTSHIRE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Samuel Brittan's article, 'Recession, but not all gloom and gloom'
(July 30), reached a new low in insensitivity and complacency.
As far as I can see there is no mention in the article of the unemployed and
who is to say the numbers of unemployed will not exceed 3.25m next year?
Mr Brittan seems oblivious to the families in the south-east who are being
booted out of their homes through no fault of their own but due to the
government's slave-like adherence to the ERM strait-jacket of which Mr
Brittan is one of the most vociferous advocates.
Clearly he has no idea how ordinary people are feeling in the depths of this
unpleasant recession.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Crime doesn't pay: Security problems are exacting an
ever-increasing toll on the retail industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The staff at the Marks and Spencer store in St Albans grew suspicious when
the pram lingered for an unduly long time behind a pillar - out of sight of
the closed-circuit televisions.
A store detective was despatched to investigate and watched as a couple
systematically picked clothes off the racks and fed them through the false
floor of the pram into a large cardboard box beneath. The police were
called. The couple were arrested.
Almost Pounds 1,500 of goods was found in the pram while a further Pounds
2,000 of clothes had been carefully stashed on racks in the couple's van
outside. The police also discovered a long list of clothes in the van with
their precise product codes and price points written beside them. Each item
had been ticked off as it was stolen.
Mr Marc O'Connor, store manager, says four people were involved in this
particular ring, which had raided many stores over several months. They went
around public houses in a particular area, asking drinkers what goods they
would like and then simply went out and stole them. 'They were an organised
team who were clearly stealing to order,' he says.
This example of organised theft typifies the growing and costly threat posed
by crime to UK retailers. Yesterday's firebomb attacks in Milton Keynes
reveal one horrifying dimension of the problem. Eight fire bombs were
planted in the town's shopping centre, and while only two went off  - in
Habitat and BhS - the attack caused considerable disruption. Violence is the
most graphic aspect of the crisis facing retailers. But shoplifting,
internal fraud, ram-raiding, extortion, kidnapping and wage heists are also
preoccupying them more than ever before.
The Home Office estimates that about Pounds 2bn a year is lost through shop
theft alone - a figure considered very low by many retailers. But to put
even that figure into context, it is about the same as the annual turnover
of the W H Smith group, which has 1,100 stores.
Until recently, retailers were reluctant to discuss crime, fearing that to
talk openly about it was somehow an admission of failure to resolve the
difficulty. Others believed that publicity of individual cases would fuel
copy-cat attacks. But the scale of the problem is now so great that the
retail trade associations are increasingly speaking out and pressing the
government for solutions.
Individual industry leaders are also adding to the pressure. Last month, for
example, Sir Richard Greenbury, chairman of Marks and Spencer, told
shareholders that the company had increased its security budget from Pounds
15m to Pounds 21m in the past year. He went on to criticise the lenient
sentencing policy of many courts.
'There is not a day that goes by when we have a store that is closed by a
bomb threat or a week that goes by without violence in our stores. We have
had armed hold-ups at the back of our stores. We have had staff held up with
12-bore shotguns,' he said.
Last year, M and S recorded a 23 per cent increase in violent 'incidents'
over 1990. The company arrested 15,000 shoplifters - almost 50 for every day
its stores opened.
Mr Derek Hayes, the divisional director responsible for M and S's store
operations, estimates the company's annual loss from theft at Pounds 30m,
under 1 per cent of turnover. That figure is lower than for many other
retailers, which budget for losses of between 1 per cent and 5 per cent.
Electrical goods retailers have arguably suffered the most from crime over
the past few years as a result of ram-raiding - where cars are driven at
high speed through the windows or doors of stores and occupants make off
with looted goods.
Mr Stanley Kalms, Dixons' chairman, says: 'Ram-raiding has become part of
the local criminal culture. A rite of passage. 'Have you done the Currys or
the Dixons this week?' they ask.'
One of Dixons' stores in Birkenhead, on Mersyside, has been the subject of
14 criminal attacks over the past year. And although a host of defensive
devices - such as metal shutters, bollards and car traps - has largely
negated the threat of ram-raiding, alternative methods of forcing entry are
now being employed.
Security guards, closed-circuit televisions, bullet-proof glass and panic
buttons for shop assistants have become part of the fixtures and fittings of
a modern retail outlet. Increasingly, high-tech solutions are being sought.
Dixons, for example, has spent millions of pounds installing a security
system which links 500 of its trading sites into one cental monitoring room
based in a secret location in Hertfordshire. From this one room, security
guards are able to monitor its sites by way of video cameras.
The police argue that counter-measures to combat crime are more likely to
deflect rather than deter crime: such measures are more likely to lead to
attacks on less well-protected stores or to an escalation of violence.
Mr Tony Whitmarsh, chairman of the British Retail Consortium security
committee, fears that tackling crime in one sector of the high street will
only push it into another. He believes that the big companies which can
afford to install counter-measures 'will drive the problem down to the
smaller retailers, which are less well equipped financially to deal with the
problem. At the end of the day that is going to lead to less consumer choice
for high-quality high-price goods,' he says.
But one solution the retail trade agrees upon is that sentencing of
offenders should be more rigorous and consistent. There is nothing more
frustrating, they say, than to apprehend offenders only to see them released
the next day with a caution.
The British Retail Consortium, the industry's trade association, is
attempting to stimulate a debate about how best to deal with criminals. It
favours more aggressive prosecutions, some means of obtaining restitution
from offenders and rehabilitation courses (which have been successfully
tested in the US). It is holding a conference in October to discuss the
issue of retail crime with representatives from the Home Office, the Crown
Prosecution Service and police forces.
The problem for retailers is that they have to deter criminals while not
alienating honest customers. It is difficult to design stores that are
attractive and also secure. There can be few actions more guaranteed to
ensure that customers do not return than to arrest them falsely or subject
them to heavy-handed security treatment.
There is also a danger that retailers could misinterpret some shoppers'
eccentricities. One director of a chemist's chain, who fancied himself as a
detective, shamefacedly recalls how he once spent hours following a
shifty-looking youth around a store. Just as he was about to challenge him,
the shopper plucked up courage, approached a sales counter and whispered: 'A
packet of condoms, please.'

<TEXT>
Sir, David Neckar (Letters, July 30) makes half a point when he asserts that
American asbestosis and environmental pollution claims are eating away at
the foundations of the Lloyd's market. But to withdraw from America is to
stick one's head in the sand.
There is nothing peculiar to America (nor, for that matter, Lloyd's) about
these claims. It is merely that they hit America earlier than they do here
because the legislation was brought in earlier in America.
Worldwide, the environmental movement is riding a high tide of public
opinion. It is not responsible to anything other than its own agenda. It
pays no attention to the costs of its own campaigns. One of these may be a
viable insurance industry.
It is about time people woke up to the fact that environmentalism is not a
free lunch.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Letter: Retrograde step for credit card holders to divulge
PIN to confirm their identity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Messrs WILLIAM S. HARBISON and MARK LOMAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, We have some major concerns about some of the points made in David
Barchard's article 'Beating the cardsharps' (Credit and charge cards survey,
July 15).
The Home Office proposal to place photographs on credit cards may help to
reduce the impact of opportunist thefts. However, a card can have the
correct photograph but a forged magnetic stripe. A cashier, put at ease by
the correct photograph and signature, would be less likely to notice the
forgery than at present. The use of photographs could encourage an increase
in the number of certain well-documented frauds.
Of much greater concern is the statement that UK banks are considering the
use of personal identification numbers (PINs) at the point of sale as a way
to make card transactions more secure.
Banks have always stressed the importance to the card-holder of keeping the
PIN secret and not divulging it to anyone. They have taken the approach that
if a valid transaction is made using a card and the correct PIN then only
the card-holder could have both of these and must therefore have been
involved with the transaction.
We are aware of well-documented instances of card fraud where this has not
been the case. From research undertaken at the computer laboratory in
Cambridge we know of a number of serious frauds perpetrated using
traditional magnetic-stripe based cards.
By far the most potentially damaging to the image of the whole system, and
to the trust that card users place in it and the financial institutions
running it, are those that occur using knowledge of the PIN.
We know of documented frauds perpetrated using counterfeit cards and genuine
PINs gathered from simple visual observation of their entry. The easy
availability of equipment that can be used to create seemingly authentic
magnetic-stripes is evident from the many advertisements in your special
section.
To insist on the use of the card-holder's PIN at the point of sale (the
stated option preferred by the industry to combat card fraud) will
inevitably make it much easier for the criminally minded to obtain PINs  -
by simple observation at any checkout; and therefore seeming to give a
considerable boost to just such criminal activities the measure is intended
to combat.
We are also aware of a number of other mechanisms that are used to part the
unwary from their PINs - including the use of counterfeit point-of-sale
(POS) equipment to gather both PINs and account details.
We strongly believe that to encourage card-holders to divulge their PINs in
even more public places and on even more occasions than before, is a
retrograde step in the efforts to combat card fraud and to protect the many
millions of card-holders.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Letter: Devaluation is no answer, and 'siren voices' must be
resisted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MATTHEW BRODRICK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Those calling for a sterling devaluation, in the hope of allowing
domestic interest rates to fall, are surely overlooking the consequences for
the UK's balance of payments, and the short- and long-term effects on
British exporters.
In the short term, a sterling devaluation will have the effect of reducing
export earnings - foreign demand for British goods will not suddenly jump
overnight because those goods are perceived to be cheaper.
In the longer term, such is the British propensity to import, any recovery
will lead to the inevitable increase in demand for foreign goods, but at a
higher price relative to the size of any devaluation. These domestic
inflationary pressures will have to be offset, most probably through the use
of higher interest rates. Additionally, export earnings will only recover
should expenditure switching be possible, and foreign purchasers can find
British goods which are suitable substitutes for foreign ones.
The UK economy would therefore have gone full circle, firstly depressing the
export earnings of industry, and secondly by offsetting inflationary
pressures from imported price rises through the use of higher interest
rates. For this, British industry would not thank the present government if
it ceded to the 'siren voices'.

first hop merchant to win the Queen's Award for Exports. We had succeeded in
selling English hops to a number of foreign countries which have continued
to import them ever since - irrespective of currency parities.
Mind you, we did it through sheer hard work, and we didn't pay ourselves

FT  01 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Each-way bets in the markets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AUGUST SEEMS to have started a day or two early this year. It is
traditionally the prime month for market theories and rumours, as traders
try to drum up a little business in a sleepy season. This year there is
enough alarmism before the month has even started to energise three normal
summers.
Presidents Bush and Mitterrand, it is said, may resign rather than face
their electors. The EMS, according to the polls, could be threatened when
French voters are asked to endorse the Maastricht Treaty. And Mr John Major
is seen by some as under such pressure from economic disappointment that his
own immovable policy may crumble.
This is more than idle talk: prices have responded. Equity markets, despite
a technical bounce from their July slide, are discounting a no-change
recession; but bond markets, which had previously benefited from the
sluggish outlook, have now fallen back to discount possible policy
upheavals. Add in continued talk about a possible Japanese market melt-down,
despite a belated relaxation of monetary policy, and no further explanation
is needed for market nervousness.
Political strain
The political strain reflects a feeling that governments in all the
countries affected are virtually powerless in face of their problems; and
such a widespread malaise must be based on more than coincidence. There are
three problems of the 1990s which go a good way to account for the syndrome.
One is transitory; two are not.
The first is the oldest: the bursting of a financial bubble. These collapses
have punctuated financial history for centuries; they look like the end of
the world for a time, but they never are. Stock market investors in Tokyo,
house-buyers in London and banks in New England must all doubt that it will
ever be a glad, confident morning again; but after a time assets will look
under-valued, lenders will believe that they have put the bad news behind
them, and convalescence will begin. The economy tends to need nursing
through this period of nervous prostration. Unfortunately, most of the
countries which have suffered have governments which believe that any
interference with market forces makes matters worse. While time is the only
long-term cure, a tonic, as the Australian recovery suggests, might cut the
time required.
Monetary policy can still be deployed, of course, by even the most ardently
market-based regime; but this has been encountering a second problem. In an
increasingly integrated world capital market, monetary initiatives seem to
have their most powerful effects outside the countries which make them.
Germany mounts a squeeze against inflation; but before it has much effect,
growth collapses in the rest of the EC. The Fed cuts interest rates to a
29-year low; Mexico booms, while the US remains stuck in a recovery 'which
does not look that different from what we now call recession', in the words
that Sir Peter Walters of the Midland Bank used to describe British
prospects. XH
Intractable problems
These problems appear at times so intractable that the whole project of
international integration looks like a mistake. Hence, for example, the
hints in this country, from the new director general of the CBI and the
chairman of ICI, to take the two most prestigious examples, suggest
realignment, or even a return to independent floating, as preferable. Hence,
too, the Bundesbank's evident distaste for having to include Italy's
problems on its agenda, and the trouble President Bush has met in getting
his North American Free Trade Area ratified. We can only hope that by 1993
we will have governments strong and inventive enough to resist
disintegration.
Assuming that we can get through the next few months without a big accident,
one problem will remain: the populations of all the advanced countries are
ageing, especially in Japan and continental Europe, and their demands will
impose a budgetary headache. Japan has planned for this for decades. It
intends to live on foreign investment earnings. Britain, which has about the
smallest long-term problem, has taken the biggest steps to reduce dependence
on state funds, and to impose tight management on demand for those funds.
British problems still look bad enough to keep long-term real interest rates
quite high, even if German and French problems were not driving them higher.
Investors must strive to stay rational in face of these forbidding
uncertainties. Reason says, for example, that house prices will not fall
forever, though debt and repossession will overhang the worst affected areas
for some time yet; and that interest rates, now that inflation has stopped
in the US and Japan and is slowing sharply in Britain and Germany, are
likelier to fall than to rise again. It is not rational to hope that the
bull market will soon come roaring back again; but the worst of the
correction in London and Tokyo (though perhaps not in Wall Street) may now
be over. And remember that this is August, when there are 10 rumours for
every real crisis.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Man In The News: Ultimate apparatchik - Erich Honecker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE COLITT and QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Erich Honecker raised a feeble clenched-fist salute as he left the
Chilean embassy in Moscow this week, he showed the same sort of tottering
truculence with which his own regime in East Germany had collapsed two years
ago.
Yet even in the moment of his humiliation, the man who ruled the German
Democratic Republic for more than 18 years seems incapable of arousing
strong emotions among his people.
'So Erich's back?' came the typical response from a Leipzig worker. 'So
what? I don't need Honecker. I simply need a job again.'
Mr Honecker was not just the leader of the country and its dogmatic
Communist party, he was the very embodiment of the state: grey and grim,
unimaginative and fundamentally indecisive. He was the ultimate apparatchik,
who failed to turn his country into anything better than a pale, if more
efficient, imitation of its Soviet master.
There is no burning desire for revenge on the streets of Berlin as the once
almighty party secretary returns, but rather an exhausted bitterness at the
unholy mess he left behind.
There is a very angry and articulate minority of people who suffered deeply
from his regime - thousands who lost family members shot dead at the Berlin
Wall or the inner-German border (for which he is now being charged with
manslaughter), or years of their lives in political detention and powerless
dissidence. Most, however, would be happy to see him humiliated, without
massive retribution. A not inconsiderable minority who served in the party
and the rest of the state apparatus feel bitter and bewildered that it is
happening at all.
If he is found guilty, and no doubt weeks of embarrassing and complex legal
argument will come before that, the irony is that he would suffer far more
severely under his own East German law than under that of the West: 10
years' sentence for manslaughter, instead of five if the western rule is
followed.
Mr Honecker's rule was certainly harsh, and he was quite prepared to go
along with his colleagues in issuing a shoot-to-kill instruction to border
guards trying to catch would-be refugees to the west. At the same time he
was always ready to bend his own rules in exchange for profitable deals with
Bonn: accepting a DM1bn loan, for example, in exchange for removing
thousands of automatic shrapnel weapons mounted along the border.
Doggedness, and a slavish adherence to the party line from Moscow, made him
a perfect satrap for a Soviet-controlled state. He began life as a poor
miner's son from Neunkirchen in the Saarland, and never allowed his
audiences to forget it. Whenever he was shown round the standard shoddy East
German apartment, he would compare it favourably with Saarland living
conditions in the 1920s.
As a staunch Communist party member in the 1930s, he went to help build the
Soviet steel town of Magnetogorsk, in the Urals. When questioned about the
food shortages there, he said they 'made no impression' on him: when he was
a boy in the Saarland, the shops were full, but he had no money.
He returned to join the Communist underground in Nazi Germany, was
transferred to Berlin, and there was arrested and sentenced to 10 years'
imprisonment for 'preparing high treason'. He was held for 18 months in the
very Moabit prison where he is currently in detention.
After the war, he rapidly proved himself a staunch loyalist to Mr Walter
Ulbricht, the first East German Communist leader, first by setting up his
Communist youth organisation, and then, as the politburo member responsible
for the military and state security, by building the Berlin Wall.
He also met his second wife, Margot, in the youth movement, where she was a
pure version of the East German pin-up girl - always smiling at the
forefront of the international solidarity photographs.
Even though the early Honecker years after he succeeded Ulbricht in 1971
were probably East Germany's most prosperous, the population never really
forgave him for the Wall. They also never accepted his wife. She was known
as 'the witch', and generally regarded as the steel in the soul of the grey
party bureaucrat she married. 'There are probably more people who would like
to see her behind bars than him,' according to one observer. The fact that
she has now fled to Chile, leaving her husband alone to face the German
courts, simply confirms her reputation.
As for Mr Honecker's trial, it is likely to prove embarrassing for all
concerned, which is why the German government has always seemed half-hearted
about wanting him back. It will be hard to make the manslaughter charges
stick, at least under the East German law of the time, for Mr Honecker
undoubtedly had huge powers of administrative fiat. He is also charged with
abuse of trust, in relation to some DM15m in missing East German Treasury
funds. But his real corruption was abuse of power.
The political embarrassment for Bonn is that everyone will be forcibly
reminded how Mr Honecker was once quite blatantly courted by the politicians
of the west.
His state visit to Bonn in 1987, to be entertained with full honours by
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, was seen as a triumph for his twin-track policy: to
deprive his own people of all contact with the west, while courting the West
German political and financial elite. Politicians of all persuasions,
including Chancellor Helmut Schmidt of the Social Democrats, and Mr
Franz-Josef Strauss, the arch-conservative Bavarian leader, flocked to see
him in Berlin.
Quite cynically, he earned billions of deutschmarks each year from western
payments for services to isolated Berlin, the release of prisoners to the
west, and for reuniting families. Ironically the latest revelations suggest
that his own more dogmatic colleagues, like Mr Erich Mielke, the now former
minister of state security, tried to get rid of him in the 1980s for
excessive fraternising with the capitalist west.
All of that is likely to come out in court, to nobody's credit at all.
Perhaps that will be the revenge of the grey man.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Power to the parents / A look at the battle between central
and local government over Britain's schools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS and ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle for Britain's schools is about to begin. This week's education
white paper marks the end of the phoney war between the government and local
authorities. It signals the beginning of an all-out struggle for the hearts
and minds of parents, who alone will decide whether their school should
desert its local education authority and apply for grant-maintained status.
Although schools in England and Wales have now had three years in which to
opt out, only a tiny number have done so - 278, or 1.1 per cent of the
25,000 schools in England and Wales. They are almost exclusively
concentrated in the home counties, among grammar schools or high-achieving
comprehensives. This is ironic, given that a principal objective of the
policy was to free schools from town hall bureaucrats in left-wing councils.
It is Tory Kent that heads the list, followed by Essex, Lincolnshire,
Norfolk and Surrey. Liverpool and Lambeth, the ogres of Tory mythology, have
a grand total of one grant-maintained school each. In the whole of Wales
there are three grant-maintained schools.
Why opt out? Mr John Patten's white paper makes autonomy the key argument.
'Autonomy is at the heart of the grant-maintained school idea', with
governors of 'self-governing schools' enjoying a 'real sense of ownership'.
Grant-maintained schools get their budgets direct from Whitehall: how they
spend them is their decision. Governors of GM schools can also apply to
change the character of their schools, in defiance of the wishes of their
local authority.
Local authorities and opponents of opting-out say the autonomy is a sham.
Budget totals are fixed by Whitehall, and the new funding council to be
established under the white paper will, they say, interfere just as much as
local education authorities when it comes to matching supply and demand. As
to the issue of selection, all schools are obliged to follow the detailed
national curriculum, and for all the white paper's talk of 'specialisation',
ministers are evidently unenthusiastic about a wholesale return to the
11-plus exam.
Parents trying to make sense of the emotive arguments on both sides should
pay particular attention to the funding implications for their school. At
present, grant-maintained schools receive a grant equal to their previous
local education authority (LEA) funding. They also receive a share of the
LEA's central education budget, calculated at 15 per cent of the school's
budget. This formula has, for the most part, enhanced the budgets of
grant-maintained secondary schools at the expense of schools remaining with
the local authority. Capital budgets for grant-maintained schools are fixed
directly by Whitehall - and in practice they appear to be getting far more
than their 'fair' share of such grants.
All that will change from the 1994-95 financial year, by when the new
funding council should be up and running. The government has to finalise the
details, but the white paper envisages grant-maintained schools being funded
thereafter by a formula related to the sum the government estimates the
local authority in each area should be spending on its schools - the
so-called 'standard spending assessment'.
So, if your local authority is spending above its spending assessment on
schools, you might be better off opting out; if it spends below, you could
do best staying with the local authority. That fact alone is likely to
encourage councils to spend up to or above their spending assessment on
education, even if it means cutting other services in the process - as it
probably will, since their overall spending is currently capped by the
government. Since the government will nonetheless be keen to keep the
opt-out momentum going, it may have to find some extra compensation.
One prominent LEA whose spending may rise to keep in the game is Birmingham.
Indeed, when Mr Patten introduced the white paper this week he singled out
the city for particular attack, accusing it of being 'one of the worst
education authorities in the country' and 'kidnapping' Pounds 55m from its
education budget to spend in other sectors. What is the current position,
and how is the city reacting to the grant-maintained challenge?
The ornate, panelled chief education officer's office in Birmingham would,
as Mr David Hammond, its occupant, admits, prove incongruously grand for the
role of local education authorities envisaged in the white paper. But only
three of the city's 420 schools are as yet grant-maintained, and the city
council is confident it will remain a significant player.
Birmingham's moderate Labour leaders angrily reject Mr Patten's 'kidnapping'
allegation. There is no doubt that the city's education budget is currently
Pounds 55m below the government's standard spending assessment. This has
been the case for several years, with the gap between the assessment and the
council's education budget once as high as Pounds 64m.
Birmingham's leaders deny, however, that city is a low spender on education.
They say that unlike most local authorities, many of their educational
activities - further education, training services and libraries - are not
run or financed by the education department, so comparisons between the
education budget and the standard spending assessment convey a false
impression. They claim that on total spending per pupil, Birmingham is ahead
of the average for metropolitan authorities - Pounds 390 a year compared
with Pounds 368.
Sir Richard Knowles, the council leader, says the city is this year adding
an extra 111 teachers and assistants to its payroll, and that pupils'
performance 'bears favourable comparison' with other city authorities - the
proportion gaining five or more GCSE passes at grades A-C increased from 18
to 24 per cent between 1988 and 1991.
The argument between Mr Patten and Birmingham is, however, more than a
discussion about definitions of local government expenditure. Mr Hammond is
'sure it was no coincidence that on the day of launching the white paper Mr
Patten should have chosen to attack Birmingham on the standard spending
assessment'.
Members of Birmingham's opposition Conservative group have made similar
points in the council chamber and - particularly since the poor physical
condition of school buildings has been a big feature in several opt-out
campaigns in the city - the prospect of extra funds for repairs could prove
a powerful argument for the pro-GM lobby.
Birmingham city council resolutely opposes grant-maintained status. Against
the three schools which have so far gone, attempts by parents at two other
secondary schools to leave the LEA have just been defeated in ballots. Some
of the city's famous King Edward's grammar schools are expected to go
grant-maintained before long.
The city council is actively campaigning to keep its schools, aiming to
convince parents, says Sir Richard, of the 'benefits for their schools and
the communities they serve of staying in the local education authority
family'. Curriculum support, the music service, home tuition for children
with long-term illness problems, replacements for staff on sick-leave and
the council's environmental studies centres are all presented as advantages.
Some of the non-educational benefits are summed-up in a letter from one of
the city's head teachers contained in recent education committee minutes. It
thanks the council's engineers, insurance assessors and other specialists
for their assistance after a fire at the school. 'We all appreciate the help
and support we are receiving,' it concludes. 'So much for opting out.'
The council has taken a carefully undogmatic tone in its approaches to
parents, stressing that with the policy of local management, under which
LEAs are obliged to hand most of their budgets direct to schools, head
teachers 'can and do have the best of both worlds' - delegated powers over
finance and staffing while staying in the family.
Even if progress towards grant-maintained status remains slow in Birmingham,
however, council officials expect that the government's proposed central
funding agency will gain a foothold in the city's educational affairs within
two years. This happens within an LEA's area when at least 10 per cent of an
authority's pupils are in grant-maintained schools - a much easier threshold
to reach than 10 per cent of the schools.
Mr Hammond sees 'some sound proposals' in the white paper, for example its
approach to the provision of education for children with special needs.
'However, it condemns us to another five years or more of chaos during which
there could be three education authorities in the city - the council, the
funding agency and education associations put in to take over the management
of particular schools.' (Education associations are the task forces which Mr
Patten proposes to send into schools declared to be 'at risk' by the schools
inspectorate).
Mr Hammond regrets the extent to which the white paper seeks to rule out a
direct role for local authorities over much of the future education agenda,
at a moment when 'other government departments are developing new ways of
working with local authorities on policies like City Challenge and care in
the community'.
One of his deepest concerns is for the future of specialist services, some
of which do not fall neatly into conventional budgets.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, last month launched her Health of
the Nation strategy, which seeks to reduce teenage pregnancies, smoking,
drinking and drug abuse among the young. Birmingham has an 18-strong health
education unit in its education service which has won praise from the
government and and Midlands health authorities.
'The unit is doing some of the best schools health education work in the
country. Do we believe that, in a completely fragmented system of
grant-maintained schools, that work will continue in the same way? Do we
really believe it?'
Parents may, of course, find themselves in an invidious position: keen to
maintain city-wide bodies like the unit, but not in a position to influence
the decision more than marginally one way or another by the decision they
take over their particular school.
Almost the only thing they can influence is the revenue of their school for
the immediate few years ahead. The main impact even of that decision will be
felt by the succeeding generation of children. Though, of course, by then
the system may have changed again.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONG planning battle over a Pounds 3bn scheme to redevelop land beside
London's King's Cross Station has moved a step nearer resolution after a
decision by planning officials to give conditional approval.
Next Thursday, Camden Council is expected to confirm the decision taken by
its planning committee three days ago. Mr Phil Turner, joint deputy leader
of the council, said the move was 'good for Camden and the people of this
borough because it is a further step along the road to bringing this huge
area into use'.
The London Regeneration Consortium, which has been pursuing planning consent
for four years, welcomed the decision. Mr Gordon Graham, a consultant to the
consortium, said: 'We do not see any reason why in another six months or so
we will not get an outline planning consent.'
The consortium comprises Rosehaugh and Stanhope, two developers that have
been badly affected by the property recession, and NFC, the freight company.
To win approval, the developers have been required to reduce the proposed
office space in the scheme by 615,000 sq ft to 5.25m sq ft.
Development will not be possible until London office rents recover
significantly. Mr Graham said he did not expect the scheme to start before
1995-96.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Study of 'M25 effect'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ROAD EXPERTS working for the Transport Department are to investigate the
claim that building new roads creates traffic growth that would not
otherwise take place: the so-called M25 effect.
The idea gained credence when traffic growth on the M25 London orbital
motorway, completed six years ago, far exceeded forecast levels.
Opponents of the roadbuilding programme say the history of the M25 is
evidence that government forecasts of road traffic growth are a
self-fulfilling prophecy because the Transport Department uses them to
justify building new roads.
The investigation is being carried out by the Standing Advisory Committee on
Trunk Road Assessment (Sactra), an independent advisory committee. The
department said yesterday the committee would study drivers' responses to
road construction or improvement schemes.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TEXACO, the multinational petrochemicals company, has offered to buy a
village after complaints from local residents about the drawbacks of living
next to a refinery.
The proposal, which may cost the company up to Pounds 2.5m to find new
homes, has delighted the 100 residents of Rhoscrowther, Dyfed, which lies
close to the company's refinery near Pembroke Dock.
A campaign was launched by the villagers against Texaco six months ago after
a small explosion led to fears that the village could be destroyed if there
was a catastrophe.
In spite of a report from the Health and Safety Executive that there was no
long-term danger, the villagers continued to press for a move.
Texaco said yesterday that as part of a 'good neighbour' policy it was
offering to buy all the homes in Rhoscrowther and to pay all moving and
legal expenses.

THE MAIN shopping centre at Milton Keynes was reopened in stages yesterday
after more than 100 police and bomb disposal officers had worked through the
night to deal with firebombs, John Thornhill writes.
Two of the bombs exploded in Habitat and BHS, causing only localised damage.
Five others were defused and one was let off under controlled conditions.
The police condemned the attack as 'horrific and callous' and called in the
anti-terrorist branch. No one has yet claimed responsibility.
There have been similar incidents in recent months at shopping centres in
Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, and Brent Cross, north London.
The IRA admitted responsibility for the attacks at the Gateshead MetroCentre
in May and Brent Cross last December, saying that it wanted to increase the
'economic cost of disruption'.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIVERSITIES MUST charge companies, government departments and charities the
full costs of the research they sponsor, the government's Advisory Council
on Science and Technology said in a report yesterday.
Acost also called on the government to increase funding for academic science
at more than the rate of inflation, but said universities should be more
selective in the range of research they carry out.
Sir Robin Nicholson, Acost chairman, said: 'The failure of universities to
identify and recover the full costs of research sponsored by external
agencies has added to the financial pressures.'
Acost recommends the government not only to increase the research councils'
budget but also to give universities additional funds to underpin the
infrastructure for research. Institutions 'should ensure that the additional
funds are used to improve the support given to existing staff and
facilities, rather than to employ more researchers, and are allocated on the
basis of the quality of the research undertaken'.
The research pressure group Save British Science welcomed the Acost
recommendations for full cost recovery and more government funding. It
rejected the call for greater selectivity, which it called 'a recipe for
withdrawal from more areas of science, which risks slowing rather than
simulating contacts with industry'.
The Office of Science and Technology said it would reply to the Acost report
in due course. 'Meanwhile the government recognises the importance of full
cost recovery.'

FT  01 AUG 92 / Councils expect poll tax arrears to last until 2000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE IN 12 local authorities expects to be collecting poll tax arrears into
the year 2000, even though the tax will be replaced by the property-based
council tax next April.
Two out of five councils believe that the poll tax backlog will affect
implementation of the council tax either extensively or moderately.
The findings come in a previously unpublished study commissioned by the
government from CSL management consultants and leaked to Mr Jack Straw,
shadow local-government minister.
The work was commissioned to help ensure the spread of good practice among
councils in an effort to reduce the backlog before the first year of the new
tax.
The Department of the Environment agreed yesterday with Mr Straw's
assessment that more than Pounds 1bn was uncollected from the first two
years of the poll tax.
'The poll tax fiasco lives on and is likely significantly to upset the
implementation of the council tax,' Mr Straw said yesterday. 'The country
has already paid too dearly for the mess of the poll tax: it looks as though
the council tax will replace one fiasco with another.'
As councils prepare for introduction of the council tax, some Environment
Department officials believe that the average bill for a household in a band
D home (worth Pounds 68,000-Pounds 88,000 in April this year) might be more
than Pounds 500.
The department is clear that it is not committed to the estimate made last
year by Mr Michael Heseltine, when environment secretary, of the average
bill for such a household in 1991-92 being Pounds 400.
Instead, ministers will rely on the tough regime for 'capping' - putting a
ceiling on local government spending - to prevent bills from rising too
steeply, and use a transitional-relief scheme to cut the number of
households that lose extensively.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Judge rules on BCCI papers
</HEADLINE>

   By RAYMOND HUGHES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A HIGH COURT judge yesterday refused to make an immediate order that the
Serious Fraud Office disclose to the liquidators of the collapsed Bank of
Credit and Commerce International documents seized from three former
officers of the bank and a broker through which many of its treasury
transactions took place.
The documents were obtained from the homes of Mr Agha Abedi and Mr Swaleh
Naqvi from a safe deposit box in the name of Mr Zafar Iqbal, and from the
offices of Capcom Financial Services.
Sir Donald Nicholls, the vice-chancellor - the senior Chancery judge - said
that none of the four had been notified of the liquidators' application for
production of their documents. He said that those from whom documents had
been seized were in general entitled to an opportunity to present to the
court any objection they might have to the production of the documents.
Capcom should be asked its attitude to disclosure and more information was
needed about the circumstances of the three individuals and the
practicability of notifying them before he could decide whether notification
to them should be dispensed with.
The liquidators, partners in Touche Ross, were granted an order for
disclosure by the SFO of other documents obtained under compulsory powers
from Price Waterhouse, former auditors of BCCI, and from Control Securities,
a company formerly controlled by Mr Nazmudin Virani, other companies in the
Control group, and from Mr Virani himself. The judge rejected the SFO's
contention that it could voluntarily disclose to liquidators or
administrators documents it had obtained under its compulsory powers.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Delay over Maxwell ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A HIGH COURT judge has deferred until September his ruling on an application
by the liquidators of Bishopsgate Investment Management for immediate
judgment in their Pounds 450m damages action against Mr Ian Maxwell, a son
of Robert Maxwell.
The liquidators, partners in Robson Rhodes, have argued that Mr Maxwell has
no defence to their allegations that he breached his fiduciary duty as a
director of BIM, from which hundreds of millions of pounds of Maxwell
companies' pension funds disappeared.
The hearing, originally expected to take two days, lasted 5 1/2 because of
Mr Maxwell's opposition to the liquidators' claim that the case should not
go to a full trial.
On July 20 the liquidators were given final judgment in their identical
action against Mr Maxwell's brother Kevin, who was ordered to make interim
payments totalling Pounds 406.8m pending assessment of his final liability.
He said afterwards that he had not defended the action because of lack of
money.
The liquidators have since started bankruptcy proceedings due to come before
the bankruptcy court on August 17. They have said they will take a similar
step against Mr Ian Maxwell if they succeed in winning final judgment
against him.

FT  01 AUG 92 / UK fears 'chaos' in Kenya soon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NAIROBI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE British High Commission in Nairobi has warned the Foreign Office that
Britain could lose millions and face an influx of up to 40,000 people with a
right to settle in the UK if Kenya descends into chaos.
A confidential memorandum, whose authenticity was confirmed yesterday by
British officials, presents a rare glimpse of Whitehall's view of the
unfolding transition to democracy in Kenya.
It says: 'The real risk to our interest comes from the possibility (by no
means unlikely) that rather than peaceful transition, Kenya will see chaos
before the end of 1992.'
In the memorandum, published this week in Kenya's Finance magazine,
officials identify British interests as annual exports worth Pounds 250m,
investment of Pounds 1bn, military training, regional stability, Kenyan
support for Britain at the United Nations and 'avoidance of developments
which would lead to an influx of perhaps 30,000-40,000 people into the UK
fleeing disorder in Kenya and with some claim to settlement in Britain'.
Although the memorandum was written earlier this year recent developments
underline the High Commission's misgivings. A bitter power struggle has
erupted in Kenya's main opposition party, raising the spectre of clashes on
tribal or personality lines. On Thursday anti-riot police in Mombasa fired
into the air to disperse clashing supporters of the two factions in the
Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (Ford). Ethnic clashes, which have
left at least 400 dead this year, continue to simmer.
The leaked British memorandum gives an incisive analysis of the strengths
and weaknesses of Kenya's political forces and says that while both Ford and
President Daniel arap Moi share responsibility for tribal violence 'the
government bears the heavier load.'
British interests, it says, have been 'generally well served by Moi's regime
though they have been put at risk by the increasing corruption, economic
inefficiencies and degeneration of the political system.'
Relations with Kenya cooled in November after Britain joined other donors in
suspending aid to Kenya until democratic and economic reforms were
implemented.
Sir Roger Tomkys, British High Commissioner to Kenya, said yesterday he
regretted the publication of the document which had resulted from a 'breach
of trust'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN mixed US economic data published yesterday, factory orders in June
recorded their biggest gain in 11 months, while personal incomes failed to
grow at all in the same month.
The 2.3 per cent rise in orders received by manufacturers reverses the 0.9
per cent decline in May. The durable goods sector rose by 2.7 per cent,
having fallen 2.1 per cent the previous month.
Defence orders, always volatile on a monthly basis, shot up by 19.5 per
cent, mostly offsetting the 23.2 per cent decline in the previous month.
Excluding defence, overall orders rose by 1.9 per cent.
Personal incomes were statistically unchanged in June, after four months of
very modest increases. Personal spending rose by 0.5 per cent, following a
revised 0.3 per cent advance in May. The net result was a drop in the
national savings rate to 4.8 per cent in June from 5.4 per cent the previous
month.
Both sets of figures confirm the overall picture of the economy provided in
the second-quarter gross domestic product returns released on Thursday,
which showed growth at only half the rate of the first three months.
There is life, though not great vigour yet, in the manufacturing sector, and
caution on the part of consumers uncertain about the future.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of the Bundesbank's leading anti-inflation hawks yesterday accused the
government of failing to do enough to protect the D-Mark. He also confirmed
that Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, had tried to head off last month's
controversial increase in the German discount rate.
'Unfortunately, the Bundesbank currently bears an over-heavy responsibility
for the stability of the D-Mark, since pay and finance policies deny it the
necessary support,' Mr Lothar Muller, a member of the Bundesbank's
policy-making central council, said in a letter.
The discount rate rise from 8 per cent to 8.75 per cent, imposed to bring
money supply growth under control, was 'necessary, suitable and moderate',
he added.
Mr Muller, who is also president of the central bank of Bavaria, was
replying to a sharp attack from Mr Erwin Huber, general secretary of the
Christian Social Union. The CSU is a senior partner in the Bonn coalition.
Led by Mr Theo Waigel, it sponsored Mr Muller's appointment to the
Bundesbank council.
Mr Huber claimed in a newspaper interview yesterday that Mr Muller had
defied the finance minister over interest rates and abused his office with a
recent call for a referendum on the Maastricht treaties on European Union.
Mr Muller wrote to Mr Huber personally, saying he regretted going against Mr
Waigel's wishes, but making plain that the Bundesbank council was
politically independent and committed to maintaining the D-Mark's status and
stability.
The attack, which signalled a determined effort to make Mr Muller toe the
party line, if not remove him, came at the end of a week of unusually harsh
complaints about the Bundesbank's latest move.
A study from the respected DIW economics institute in Berlin accused the
central bank of pursuing a 'misguided' monetary policy. The latest rate
rise, intended to rein in money supply, would in fact increase it, and
aggravate recessionary tendencies in west Germany.
The VDMA engineering industry association, reporting a 22 per cent fall in
domestic orders for June, said the prolonged period of high interest rates
was making matters worse. Bundesbank policy had reduced industry's room for
manoeuvre, it added.
Although Mr Waigel has not objected publicly to the Bundesbank's strictures,
he and the rest of the cabinet are under heavy pressure from European
Community partners concerned that high German rates are reducing their
chances of early economic recovery.

<TEXT>
THE world airline industry has had a disappointing first half, with few
signs of a strong recovery in international passenger traffic.
Although traffic rose by 21 per cent in the first half compared with the
same period last year, the International Air Transport Association (Iata)
yesterday said this reflected the abnormal circumstances of 1991, when the
industry was hit by the Gulf crisis travel slump.
Compared with 1990, first-half passenger traffic growth was only 8 per cent
higher, Iata said.
Freight traffic grew 6 per cent in the first half. For June, passenger
traffic was 10 per cent higher and freight traffic 4 per cent higher than in
June last year.
Airlines are also continuing to maintain high capacity levels, which are
putting pressure on yields.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian cabinet sat down in front of the world's press yesterday to show
how united it was, then blew the whole thing.
The young radical reformers, fortuitously massed to the left of a long
table, were conspicuous for the absence of their leader, Mr Yegor Gaidar,
the acting prime minister.
Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, the first deputy prime minister made a show of taking
charge, but opened the proceedings with a denial that he and other new
'industrialists' in the cabinet were promoting a U-turn in economic policy.
Mr Gyorgy Khizha, one of the other new cabinet members, called for increased
cash hand-outs as the main solution to the crippling debt crisis among
enterprises, but Mr Anatoly Chubais, the deputy prime minister in charge of
privatisation and 'co-ordinating' economic reform, was quick to differ.
It was normal practice to increase working capital to keep up with
inflation, but 'any excessive' provision of new credit would trigger
hyper-inflation, he said.
When Mr Shmako left open the possibility Russia might miss financial targets
agreed with the International Monetary Fund ('We and the fund are clever
people who can always find an accommodation'), Mr Alexander Shokhin, the
deputy premier for foreign economic relations, stoutly defended the IMF
accords.
'I'd like officially to declare that we are pursuing these targets not
because they are demanded by the fund but because they are required by our
own policies,' he said. 'We don't need hyper-inflation and a huge budget
deficit.'
The economic debate continues to be confused with arguments over external
political influence. The Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper predicted yesterday
that foreign minister Andrei Kozyrev's days in office were numbered because
of his pro-western focus. He denied there were any problems.
But this still did not stop him from complaining minutes later that he had
not even been consulted over the drafting of new regulations on the movement
of foreigners within Russia - although he is in charge of operating them.

BRAZILIAN President Fernando Collor came closer to impeachment yesterday
over charges that he received money obtained illicitly by businessman Paulo
Cesar Farias.
The claim of Mr Claudio Vieira, a former Collor aide, that the money came
from a Dollars 5m loan raised in Uruguay in 1989, was undermined again
yesterday by testimony to the Congressional Inquiry (CPI) into Mr Farias.
The secretary of a Sao Paulo businessman confirmed in detail that the loan
was fabricated and that she had typed the documents last week.
Mr Vieira claimed that he had lent 7kg of gold purchased with the loan, to
Mr Farias who had then deposited the money into the account of Mr Collor's
wife when she needed clothes. He admitted he had no idea how the money had
entered the country or how the loan would be paid back.
The CPI is due to end next weekwhen an impeachment process is expected to
begin.

FT  01 AUG 92 / Fumbling Bush assailed by bad news on all sides: Opinion
polls give Clinton one of the biggest leads in history / Assessing their
import
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS WEEK'S opinion polls make chilling reading for President George Bush's
hopes for re-election.
The state polls are even more ominous than the national polls and the now
almost daily blasts of disaffection from conservative Republicans.
Mr Bush knows he is behind and is trying to make a virtue of it on his
campaign swing through Texas and California, portraying himself as an
underdog with right and experience on his side. Holidays in Maine have been
cancelled.
But only Harry Truman in 1948 has eliminated a deficit as large as that by
which Mr Bush now trails Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic nominee, and that
was in the infancy of polling. Gerald Ford nearly did so in 1976 against
Jimmy Carter, but fell two points short.
Moreover, this contest will be determined in the Electoral College, in
which, Maine and Nebraska curiously excepted, the winner of a state gets all
the votes. They key to Republican success in five of the last six elections
has been to lock up large blocs of the country, particularly the south and
most of the west.
This strategy now looks vulnerable. As tabulated by The Hotline, the
invaluable daily political newsletter, the nine latest scattered state
surveys put Mr Clinton ahead everywhere. In only North Dakota and Virginia
do his four- and seven-point respective leads fall within the pollsters'
usual margins of error.
His biggest advantages are in the two largest states; Mr Clinton leads in
California by 62-28 per cent and in New York by 58-28 per cent. Mr Bush is
even behind in Orange County, California, where Democrats are eaten for
breakfast.
The news from important 'swing' states is equally bad. In North Carolina, Mr
Clinton leads by 53-34 per cent, in Missouri by 57-29 per cent, in
Washington by 56-32 per cent and in Minnesota, with a stronger Democratic
tradition, by 60-31 per cent. Even the supposedly solid south-west looks
shaky. In Arizona, for example, Mr Clinton holds a 50-37 per cent edge.
The current polls may overstate Mr Clinton's strength as much as those taken
before the Democratic convention and Mr Ross Perot's withdrawal, showing him
leading in only two of the 50 states, underestimated it, though the race
then was three-way.
At the moment they reflect the desertion to Mr Clinton, not to Mr Bush, of
the Perot volunteer army (by a four-to-one margin in California, for
example) and the perception that the Clinton-Gore campaign is on a real
roll, while the Bush-Quayle team, whose very composition is being
questioned, cannot find the starting gate.
But, for better or worse, polls are the means by which popularity is
measured and which every politician uses to predict elections. For Mr Bush's
more conservative and sometimes reluctant supporters, their message spells
defeat.
Congressman Newt Gingrich of Georgia this week berated an optimistic Fred
Malek, the Bush campaign strategist, saying he would be 'a foolish person'
to ignore a 62-28 per cent poll result. Congressman Vin Weber of Minnesota,
cracked: 'It is one thing to say there is a hurricane coming, it is another
to see your basement flooding.'
George Will, the columnist, really opened the gates on Wednesday by calling
on the president to withdraw from the race. Since then, Richard Viguerie, a
big conservative fundraiser, has demanded that Mr Bush back out and engineer
a ticket headed by Jack Kemp, the housing secretary, with James Baker, the
secretary of state, as running mate.
Mr Adam Myerson, of the Heritage Foundation, the rightwing think tank,
confessed that 'conservatives do not think a Clinton administration could be
much worse than a Bush administration'. Mr Burton Pines, from the same
stable, added: 'For all the talk of dumping Dan Quayle, we should be talking
about dumping George Bush.'
Mr Tommy Thomas, former Republican party chairman in Florida, paid for a
full-page advertisement (Dollars 45,000) in the Washington Post calling on
Mr Quayle to step down. He later said he wanted Mr Baker to run with Mr
Bush, apparently forgetting that the law prevents both members of a ticket
coming from the same state (though Mr Bush, whose legal residence in Texas
is only a hotel room, could always declare he lived in Maine, while Mr Baker
keeps a home in Wyoming).
One veteran Washington insider, who has worked with Mr Bush over the years,
says the president has the sometimes distressing habit of heeding the advice
of the last person he has spoken to in private. The conservative laments are
public. Only James Baker, apart from Barbara Bush, has the clout and the
access to tell the president what to do.

A chain of explosions sowed terror and caused heavy casualties in central
Sarajevo yesterday in an attempt by rebel Serbs to force Bosnia's Moslem
leaders into peace negotiations, Reuter reports from Sarajevo. People fled
to safety as mortars fell on streets outside the presidency building,
parliament and city-centre shops in the worst daylight attacks for several
weeks in the Bosnian capital.
The fighting forced UN peacekeepers to close Sarajevo airport to relief
flights for the besieged city's 380,000 inhabitants and caused a visible
change of mood. The attack closed the airport just as General Lewis
MacKenzie, the outgoing commander of UN peacekeeping forces in Sarajevo, was
about to take off, Croatian radio said.

<TEXT>
FOKUS Bank, Norway's third biggest bank, yesterday reported a sharp fall in
half-year losses, before extraordinary items, to NKr165m (Dollars 28.3m)
from NKr919.8m. But it warned that this autumn it would seek up to NKr800m
in fresh state support.
Fokus was de-listed from the Oslo bourse and acquired by the state last
December in a rescue operation, after its share capital had been wiped out
by large losses.
Mr Leif Klevan, managing director, said that a call for fresh funds should
not be seen as a dramatic move as the bank would have last year sought more
capital, had the state-owned bank insurance fund had more capital at its
disposal.
The fund last December also transfered capital to Den norske Bank (DnB),
Norway's biggest bank and Christiana Bank, the second biggest bank.
Fokus reduced half-year credit losses to NKr377.9m from NKr902.4m. Mr Klevan
said that the volume of non-performing loans had been slightly reduced in
the first half but he cautiously forecast that they were likely to remain on
the same level in the second half.
Operating costs fell to NKr654m from NKr799.1m last year but Mr Klevan said
that cost-cutting measures already implemented would begin to benefit the
bank by the end of the year.

MEXICO is facing its most serious industrial trouble for more than a year,
with some 16,000 workers at the Volkswagen car plant and 22,000 textile
workers on strike.
The strike has been costing Volkswagen, the leading car-maker for the
Mexican market, about Dollars 5m a day. Workers walked out on July 21 after
discovering union leaders had secretly agreed to accept Japanese-style
working methods in the factory.
The strike by cotton textile workers is over pay and working conditions.
Their union called the strike on July 9, after employers' representatives
had refused to offer more than a 10 per cent wage increase, and wanted to
eliminate a rigid system of work shifts.

</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD Bank yesterday reported a 37 per cent increase in net income to
Dollars 1.65bn for the year to June 30, despite charging member countries a
lower borrowing rate.
The bank said its variable lending rate last year fell by 13 basis points to
7.60 per cent, thanks to a more favourable worldwide interest rate
environment and the bank's own strong financial performance.
The bank also instituted a lending rate waiver policy, which effectively cut
the spread between what it pays on borrowings and what it charges on loans,
from 50 basis points to 25 basis points, for member countries with good
repayment records.
A similar, larger waiver has been approved for this year, which will reduce
the cost of loans from 50 basis points to just 15 basis points for those
countries which meet their payments within 30 days of schedule, said the
bank.
Bank profits rose last year because more members met their repayment
obligations on schedule (partly encouraged by linking eligibility for the
waiver to repayments) and because three countries - Nicaragua, Panama and
Sierra Leone - cleared their arrears from previous years. The payment of
arrears contributed Dollars 220m to the bank's income.
George Graham adds from Washington: World Bank officials also said they
planned to launch a global bond, denominated in D-Marks, this year as part
of the bank's Dollars 13.5bn borrowing programme.
Mr Kenneth Lay, financial operations director, said he hoped to bring a
D-Mark bond to the market about the middle of the bank's financial year,
which began this month.

<TEXT>
LABOUR launched a fresh attack on the government's record on jobs yesterday
when it claimed that the Tories had failed to deliver 10,000 promised places
on their Employment Action programme, Ivo Dawnay writes.
The onslaught was a first shot in the opposition's summer offensive. The
shadow economic team charged the government with a 'callous betrayal' of the
unemployed.
Labour said in a statement released by Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor,
that Mr Michael Howard, when employment secretary, had committed the
government to finding work experience places for 60,000 people and to having
30,000 people on schemes at any time.
Yet in May, two months after a target deadline, some 10,000 places had
remained unfilled. 'In many constituencies there are as many as 10,000
people unemployed, with sometimes as few as 30 places on Employment Action
available,' the statement said.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (1): A stronger
momentum - A traditional industry that has for decades been the backbone of
the west's heavy equipment sector is responding impressively to a variety of
challenges which have transformed its manufacturing base
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THROUGHOUT the past two years of recession in many world markets for capital
goods, the power generating equipment business has maintained a healthy
momentum, fuelled by factors that promise to preserve its role as one of the
most durable sectors of engineering in the 1990s.
Events such as the privatisation of UK electricity supply have given the
power equipment industry a short, sharp shock but in general the external
influences on it are being felt at a more gradual pace.
Some are double edged - rising pressure from environmentalists is one factor
underpinning growth forecasts for combined cycle gas turbine generation, but
it has also reduced nuclear power plant development to a trickle outside
Japan, Taiwan and Korea.
And some market forces suggesting faster growth are balanced by trends
pointing to slower development. The availability of gas as a power source,
and means to transport it, lend further support to the development of
natural gas-fired combined cycle, at least for the next 10 years, but could
be offset by factors such as political influences over the pace of
privatisation among big utility customers.
Whether viewed on a regional or technology basis, the balance of power in
the global market is changing. General Electric of the US, the world's
biggest supplier, sees worldwide demand growing at an average annual rate of
2.8 per cent until the year 2001, representing 925,000MW of anticipated
orders.
Within this figure, the pattern of demand is altering. GE expects the US,
traditionally the biggest market, to remain strong, with about 113,000GW of
new capacity to be installed in the next 10 years or 20 per cent of the
world total. Westinghouse, the world's second biggest supplier, forecasts
annual compound growth of 2.3 per cent in the US market, and a comparable
figure for western Europe.
But, according to all the big suppliers, the Asia/Pacific region will be a
key growth market over the next five years, accounting for 29 per cent of
the world's capacity additions, says GE. Siemens, the big German supplier,
expects the Asian market to account for 37 per cent of expected world demand
over the next decade.
Both these projections exclude India, which GE sees as a major developing
market with an emerging middle class of nearly 200m people driving new
capacity demands. Elsewhere, the US supplier sees an 'exciting' but
uncertain market outlook for eastern Europe, a view on which Westinghouse
and the other suppliers concur.
Similar changes in the technology mix are predicted. While GE foresees
nuclear power dropping from 10 per cent of total 1987-91 orders to 6 per
cent from 1996-2001, combined cycle and gas turbine orders will collectively
rise from 39 per cent in 1987-91 to 43 per cent in 1992-95, slipping to 38
per cent in 1996-2001.
The latter figure, however, is based on total orders of 636,000MW, nearly
twice as much as the 336,000MW ordered between 1987 and 1991. Mr David
Genever-Watling, senior vice president at GE Industrial and Power Systems,
notes that the company has boosted its gas turbine and combined cycle
forecast by 15 per cent from last year, due partly to reduced worries about
gas availability.
Within the total mix, it is important also to note the healthy forecasts
being made for smaller-scale combined heat and power (CHP) equipment. A
report this month by Frost &amp; Sullivan, the international market research
publisher, says environmental concerns in Europe are now starting to affect
buying decisions for CHP equipment which has in the past been used mainly
for cost-saving.
For the equipment suppliers the global environment requires a response that
combines heavy spending on technology with corporate activity to ensure a
competitive position in markets which vary in the degree of openness and
fairness to suppliers, and where winning contracts is normally just the
start of a very politically-charged process which extends through the supply
chain to the cost of electricity.
The primary focus of the big manufacturers' R&amp;D programmes is to achieve
further improvements in gas turbine thermal efficiency, but the major
progress made over the past decade has been replaced by an era of fine
tuning. In combined cycle formation, gas turbines are achieving thermal
efficiency of 55 per cent, and it could take a decade or more to reach 60
per cent.
By that time, the availability of gas as a fuel source for power could well
be coming under question in many countries.
But improved thermal efficiencies could hold the key to widespread
commercial exploitation of Integrated Gas Combined Cycle (IGCC). This uses
gasified coal as a fuel source for the gas turbine but, at 44-45 per cent
efficiency, lags behind natural-gas combined cycle.
The corporate response takes a number of forms, but is in any case closely
linked to technology trends. The European mega-mergers of the late 1980s, to
form GEC Alsthom and Asea Brown Boveri, produced alliances that were both
technologically powerful and broad in their geographic spread - and hence
better able to handle the gradual relaxation of nationalist buying
preferences in Europe.
Both aims have been fulfilled successfully, and the deals have gone some way
to reducing the manufacturing overcapacity that still bedevils the European
steam turbine market.
The second broad thrust is a continuing flow of licensing agreements,
manufacturing deals and technology transfer agreements both between western
companies alone and between western suppliers and their counterparts in
fast-growing developing markets.
In the former category, the most significant deal since the late 1980s was
announced last month, and saw Rolls-Royce of the UK agree to transfer its
advanced aero-engine technology to Westinghouse for use in the US company's
combustion turbine designs.
Mr Frank Bakos, vice-president and general manager of Westinghouse's power
generation business unit, says the company was looking for ways to extend
its market presence, and recognised its relative lack of aero-engine
technology as a technology shortfall. The deal, he says, is 'part of a
process of being competitive in each section of the market.'
Observers at rival companies believe the deal will make the already existing
Westinghouse-Mitsubishi grouping a stronger player in world power generation
markets. Westinghouse's deal is with Rolls-Royce, but the US company will be
able to sublicense the technology to Mitsubishi and Fiat, its other partner,
if it believes it is appropriate.
Other deals have been designed to secure a more entrenched position in Asian
markets, via local manufacturing or technology transfer, or to establish a
foothold in eastern Europe. The announcement last year of a big power
equipment joint venture between Siemens and Skoda Pilsen of Czechoslovakia
was the most important single move in this direction.
But the future of the east European market is one of the big unresolved
questions for the industry, which has been complaining recently about the
lack of western finance available to support much-needed cleaner power
generation.
A further problem, at least for the US suppliers, is the so-called Fortress
Europe provisions of the European Community's Utilities Directive on public
procurement. For Westinghouse, obtaining acceptable access to the EC market
via Rolls-Royce was a further strategic reason for last month's deal, and
the near-impossibility, in some circumstances, for importers to win business
directly has also prompted GE's business alliances.

FT  31 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Market excited by ICI news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN MILLHAM, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHOCK news that ICI was considering demerging its businesses
overshadowed the chemical group's disappointing interim results and sent the
share price soaring. Opening at 1095p, the stock rose rapidly, touching
1229p before declining in hectic dealings to close a net 76 ahead at 1171p
with a hefty 14m traded.
Chemicals observers were most excited by the prospect of the proposed ICI
Bio group, which would include ICI's pharmaceutical, agrochemical, seed and
specialty chemical businesses, believing it would pave the way for further
merger or acquisition opportunities in these industries. For this reason,
Fisons, long tipped as a potential partner for ICI's drugs and agrochemical
interests, rose 10 to 173p with a substantial 9.5m dealt.
While details of the plan are scarce, Mr Martin Glen at Lehman Brothers says
he would put an initial value on the new ICI of 1250p, giving ICI Bio an
earnings per share of 15p and the new ICI one of 10p.
The excitement overshadowed ICI's interim report, which pointed to
continuing tough trading conditions and, somewhat ironically, the poor
showing by the pharmaceutical and agrochem divisions. Lehman cut its
forecast for this year by Pounds 50m to Pounds 800m and for 1993 by Pounds
80m to Pounds 920m. Kleinwort Benson is on similar ground, forecasting
Pounds 805m and Pounds 920m respectively.
Marks placing
Traders were impressed when the market absorbed a very large placing of
21.15m shares in Marks and Spencer without too much problem yesterday. The
shares were placed by Cazenove at 305p on behalf of trustees in the Marks
and Spencer pension fund, which was reacting to professional advice against
pension scheme investment in shares of its own company. On turnover of 43m,
Marks finished 8 lower at 311p.
Legislation requires a pension fund to reduce any equity holding in its own
company to less than 5 per cent by March 1994. Before yesterday's placing,
Mark's pension fund held 24m shares in the company, representing about 7 per
cent of its total assets by value. It retains a holding of 2.85m shares.
The last set of interim figures from Midland Bank, now under the control of
Hongkong and Shanghai Banking (HSBC), caused only the merest flicker in HSBC
shares, which eased 1 1/2 to 335 1/2 p on 8.2m turnover.
Lloyds Bank, reporting first-half figures this morning, gained 5 to 424p,
but National Westminster dipped 5 to 325p and Barclays 3 to 319p.
Dealings commenced in TransAtlantic, the life assurance company which took
over Sun Life. The shares were initially quoted below the 190p mark but
gradually improved to end a very quiet debut session at 195p.
Widespread bad publicity regarding water quality inspired some persistent
selling of Thames Water, 7 off at 405p. Other poor performers in the sector
included Anglian Water, 6 down at 388p, North West, 5 cheaper at 412p, and
Yorkshire, 9 weaker at 428p.
Suggestions that James Capel, the agency broker, had been recommending a
switch out of the Scottish generators into National Power and PowerGen
triggered some big activity in the sector. National (239p) and PowerGen
(251p) added 4 each, but Scottish Power retreated 5 to 184p and Scottish
Hydro eased to 204 1/2 p.
Heavy US buying of BP died away, the shares slipping 2 1/2 to 214p after an
initial level of 218p. Turnover reached 9m. Shell also ran into a flurry of
small but persistent selling, closing a net 3 off at 466p.
Lasmo was heavily traded, with 7.9m shares changing hands, and the stock was
finally a shade off at 133p.
Bad publicity over the group's oil and gas acquisitions in Kazakhstan saw
British Gas dip 2 1/2 to 246 1/2 p on turnover of 8.5m shares.
Cable and Wireless ran up strongly to close 12 higher at 537p, with the
market said to be responding to a bullish view of the stock adopted by
broker Strauss Turnbull.
MicroFocus forged ahead 45 to 1715p, with demand stimulated by the strong
performance of Wall Street in recent sessions.
British Aerospace staged a strong rally after the heavy selling induced by
worries about the group's long-term strategy. Stimulated by a handful of buy
notes, notably one from leading research house County NatWest, the shares
climbed 11 to 206p, with dealers still aware of hints that GEC may be
lurking in the background as a potential predator.
Property shares were again under pressure as an abundance of stock hit the
leading issues. Hammerson 'A' tumbled 26 to 213p, Great Portland Estates 7
to 110p and British Land 3 to 168p. MEPC lost 17 to 226p, with turnover
boosted by a late trade of 4.4m shares at 210p, believed to have been a bed
and breakfast, or tax-related, deal.
Hotel group Forte bounced after positive comments to analysts that some
parts of the hotel market were showing signs of resilience, and also news of
a large contract awarded to its subsidiary Gardner Merchant. The shares
rallied 6 to 150p.
The brewing and drinks sector was generally weak, with Grand Metropolitan
losing 8 to 415p after a small downward revision in its profits forecast by
Lehman Brothers. The US securities house remained positive on the stock,
however, saying that any weakness in GrandMet's US food operations is likely
to be offset by benefits in the international spirits trade. Guinness
slipped 12 to 532p, while Bass shed 7 to 538p.
Allied-Lyons' performance was relatively more positive, after this week's
decision that its brewing deal with Carlsberg will go ahead in spite of the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission's modifications to the agreement. The
shares finished just  1/2 off at 615p.
Regional brewer Gibbs Mew, an unlisted security, jumped 30 to 168p on an
'unsolicited approach' by Brierley Investments, which said it is considering
making an offer, although no price or terms have been indicated.
Hepworth, the building products group, added 4 at 310p after interim figures
above City forecasts. But expectations of a big bounce in the building
materials sector proved premature. RMC remained under constant pressure and
fell 12 to 489p.
Mirror Group Newspapers held at 69p but turnover, which stalled on Wednesday
after a series of heavy trading sessions, began to pick up again. By the
close of business yesterday some 3.3m shares had changed hands, with a block
of 1.2m traded late in the session at 68p.

FT  31 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity recovery changes into reverse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ATTEMPT to extend the recovery in UK equities ran abruptly into reverse
yesterday, and by the close of trading London was joining in the general
reaction on European bourses to negative comments on German interest rate
prospects from the president of the Bundesbank. Not even a 6.6 per cent jump
in ICI shares on the disclosure that the chemical group is considering
splitting itself into two public companies could save the FT-SE Index from a
28-point about-turn which left it 11.6 down on the day at 2,411.6.
Equities opened strongly, spurred on by the 45-point gain in Wall Street's
Dow Average overnight and a 459-point advance in the Nikkei Average. The
Footsie, benefiting from the steep rise in ICI, equivalent to 4.7 points on
the index at one stage, extended its initial advance to 16.5.
The stock market at first chose to brush off the rejection by Mr Helmut
Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, of the prospect for cuts in German
interest rates before the end of the year, although his comments had been
reported in the UK morning press.
London's optimism, however, was reined in when the other European bourses
began to turn easier. Hints that Wall Street might not be able to extend its
gains into a third trading session also unsettled London although, in the
event, US equities opened steadily, with the Dow Average hardly changed when
the UK market closed for the day.
It was soon clear that the institutions were less willing to chase share
prices after the substantial recovery in the UK stock market over the two
previous trading sessions. The stock index futures sector turned somewhat
erratic as the UK investment bank which had been active in the September
Footsie this week backed away. While the Bundesbank president's views on
interest rates were not unexpected, pessimism on interest rates was
underlined by falls in UK government bonds.
When the initial excitement over ICI's plans had died down a little, traders
accepted that the interim trading statement from the blue chip chemical
group had done little to lift the gloom still hanging over the British
corporate scene.
The strategy team at Credit Lyonnais Laing has examined the market leaders
in terms of funds flow and debt risk, and comments that the renewed flow of
brokerage profit downgrades has increased pressure on weak balance sheets.
Credit Lyonnais now has top-down estimates of earnings growth of 10 per cent
for both this year and next, somewhat below the aggregate view of City
analysts, which it considers to be too optimistic.
However, there seemed to be no great change in market sentiment yesterday.
Stock Exchange statistics disclosed that retail, or customer, business in
equities jumped to Pounds 1.3bn on Wednesday, confirming that the market
recovery has been led by genuine investment interest. A pause for breath was
not unexpected and seemed implied by the dip in Seaq trading volume, which
incorporates both retail and intra-market business, to 431.1m shares
yesterday from Wednesday's 566.1m.

FT  31 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow higher in spite of
retreating bond prices

Wall Street
US EQUITIES managed to finish moderately higher yesterday after shrugging
off a mixed bag of economic news, a downturn in the domestic bond market and
lower stock markets in Europe, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 12.70 at 3,391.89 after the previous
two-day upsurge of 97 points. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 eclipsed Wednesday's
record level, ending 1.69 stronger at 423.92, while the Nasdaq composite
appreciated 1.31 to 578.80.
Turnover on the New York SE was a fairly heavy 193.4m shares, but well below
the previous day's 276m. Equities put on a reasonable performance in the
face of a retreat by the bond market, where the benchmark 30-year issue lost
ground through most of the day before turning slightly higher in late
trading.
There was little reaction to economic news, which included a larger than
expected fall in unemployment claims for the week ended July 18, a
surprisingly strong improvement in new home sales for June, an unexpectedly
low reading for second quarter Gross Domestic Product and an encouraging
inflation report.
Equimark soared in NYSE trading after the Pennsylvania commercial banking
group said it had agreed to be acquired by Integra Financial through a
Dollars 296m stock swap. Equimark's stock was quoted at Dollars 6 5/8 , up
Dollars 1 1/8 , while Integra fell Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 36 1/8 in Nasdaq
trading.
ICI ADRs jumped Dollars 5 5/8 to Dollars 89 3/4 . The UK chemical company
reported a 33 per cent decline in second quarter pre-tax earnings and said
it might spin off its bioscience division.
Alliant Techsystems tumbled Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 21 3/8 on the back of
first quarter earnings from continuing operations of 59 cents a share, down
from Dollars 1.58 a year earlier.
UAL, parent of United Airlines, advanced Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 114 in
spite of a second quarter loss of Dollars 3.94 a share, compared with
earnings of Dollars 2.23 a year earlier. AMR, parent of American Airlines,
gained Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 67 1/8 and Delta Airlines rose Dollars 1 to
Dollars 56.
Canada
TORONTO ended a shade firmer after moderate trading. The TSE 300 index
gained just 1.0 at 3,425.6 and rises held a small lead over declines by 288
to 243 after volume of 24.3m shares valued at CDollars 226.2m.
PWA, which plunged CDollars 2.92 over the past two sessions, picked up 26
cents to CDollars 2.34. The drop in the share price was sparked by the
failure of its talks with American Airlines, and the belief that Air Canada
might buy the best assets of PWA's Canadian Airlines unit, leaving little
for shareholders. Air Canada regained 5 cents to CDollars 5.
Noranda, up CDollars  1/8 at CDollars 19 3/8 , announced higher second
quarter and six-month earnings and a regular quarterly dividend of 25 cents;
there had been rumors that a dividend cut was being considered.

FT  31 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets: Second quarter results revive Mexican
equities - But the market could remain vulnerable until the US presidential
race is over
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico's stock market has finally received the good news it needed. Second
quarter results were better than analysts' expectations, and the market
index reached 1,551 by yesterday's close, 5.7 per cent up from Monday's low.
The results themselves were uneven, and judged good mainly by those who had
feared the worst. Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex), the telephone monopoly that
accounts for about 30 per cent of the index, reported net profits of Dollars
1.16bn in the first half, a 5.4 per cent increase on the same period last
year.
If the non-recurring losses are excluded, however, net profits would have
risen by 18 per cent, according to the company's finance director. Fears
that Telmex was going to report very heavy foreign exchange losses turned
out to be unfounded. In the event, the group lost just Dollars 70m in the
second quarter on foreign exchange.
Many favourite companies of foreign investors repaid the faith shown in
them. Televisa, ICA, and Grupo Carso announced rapid earnings growth that
appears to justify the above-average multiples on which they trade. And
although the large industrial conglomerates - Alfa, Vitro and Cydsa -
produced flat or reduced earnings, the bad news was already discounted, and
in most cases their share prices rose after the results were published.
The past days' relative calm contrasts sharply with last week, when the
market fell 9 per cent. While June's 15.5 per cent drop was triggered by the
then prevailing popularity of Mr Ross Perot in the US presidential stakes,
an over-supply of new issues and rising interest rates, July's fall was
related more to concern about specific companies.
The market was knocked off balance by Cemex's acquisition of Spain's largest
cement companies, Valenciana and Sanson, announced during the first two
weeks of the month. Many foreign investors felt cheated, as Cemex failed to
mention such plans when selling Dollars 608m of new equity earlier in the
year.
Investors had bought Cemex because its earnings were geared to Mexico's
fast-growing economy, so they sold as soon as it became clear that some 40
per cent of sales were going to come from Spain. Cemex's share price had
fallen more than 25 per cent this month, until the recent rally.
Rumours that newly formed financial groups had suffered losses on government
bonds they had bought added to the jitters. Early reports put losses at more
than Dollars 1bn, and some feared that brokerages would sell equity holdings
to make up losses. In the event the government put the accounting losses at
Dollars 235m for banks and brokerages, about half what many analysts had
expected.
With first-half results out of the way, some analysts are predicting another
surge in prices. The stock market is cheap compared to a few months ago,
with Telmex selling at 8.5 times this year's earnings, according to Mr Jorge
Suarez, head of Latin American equity research at Nomura Research.
The government appears to be winning against inflation, which could pave the
way for lower interest rates. Inflation was just 0.3 per cent in the first
two weeks of July. Negotiations on the North American free trade agreement
are likely to be concluded soon, perhaps early next week, giving a further
fillip to the market.
Equities, however, are not out of the woods yet. For all the optimism over
second quarter results, consumer goods companies - such as VideoVisa, Femsa,
Maseca, and Kimberly Clark - fared rather poorly, reflecting the slow growth
in personal incomes, says Mr Pablo Riberoll at Baring Research.
Above all, the political and economic situation in the US is likely to hang
over the market until the US presidential election. 'Now more than ever,'
warns one cautious broker, 'it is important to select companies rather than
broad themes.'

FT  31 JUL 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar trades in tight ranges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR traded in tight ranges against the D-Mark yesterday as
conflicting economic data was issued in the US, writes James Blitz.
The US currency could have been adversely affected by the figure for US GDP
in the second quarter, which came in at a 1.4 per cent rise when 1.7 per
cent had been expected. However, this figure was outweighed by an upward
revised figure for first quarter GDP of 2.9 per cent from 2.7 per cent.
Other indicators also kept the dollar above its lows. These included new
home sales, which were up 7.9 per cent to 572,000 units in June, while the
May figure was revised to a 0.9 per cent decline from the 5.6 per cent fall
originally reported. Jobless claims for the week to July 18 slipped by
21,000 from the 420,000 reported the week before, reviving hopes that next
week's monthly employment report will show a rebound.
The data kept the dollar trading in tight ranges between DM1.4805 and
DM1.4920, before closing at DM1.4820, down from a previous DM1.4840. In New
York it finished lower at DM1.4767.
The dollar's performance underlined the view of those who believe that the
currency is destined for a long period of range trading following the recent
central bank intervention. Dealers are unwilling to have their fingers
burned again by the central banks if they push the dollar lower, while the
differential between US and German interest rates makes it too expensive to
be long of dollars.
A number of chartists also believe that DM1.49 is roughly where the dollar
now lies on a trend line drawn since it started to drop in April.
On the European crosses, the Italian lira was again the centre of attention
following the resignation of Mr Vincenzo Scotti as the country's foreign
minister. Although he has no direct impact on economic policy, his
resignation signalled a new crisis among the Christian Democrats, the
biggest party in the coalition government.
The lira came under pressure in the morning, falling to L757 against the
D-Mark from a previous close of L755.4. It later recovered, however, to end
at L755.5. The markets have clearly been impressed by the Italian
parliament's decision earlier in the week to pass a much reduced budget
programme.
Other European currencies were mostly unchanged. Sterling eased to DM2.8430
from a previous finish of DM2.8450, hindered by dollar weakness. The French
franc shrugged off disappointing unemployment data for June, with the
seasonally adjusted figure rising by 12,100 to 2,924,700. The fundamental
features of the French economy are strong, however, and the D-Mark softened
to FFr3.377 from a previous close of FFr3.378.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Money Markets: Futures bearish
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING futures performed bearishly yesterday as the market continued to
take a gloomy view of the outlook for a base rate cut in the UK.
Comments from Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, that an
interest rate reduction in Germany would not be forthcoming this year pushed
the September contract down in the morning. The fall was deepened after the
Dutch central bank decided to raise its special advances money rate to 9.60
per cent from 9.50 per cent. Dealers took the view that Dutch central bank
policy is closely tied to the Bundesbank's, and that a tightening of Dutch
interest rates one week before the Bundesbank's council meeting does not
augur well for rates.
After opening at 89.69, September short sterling dipped to a low of 89.64,
which was the closing figure. The December contract dropped even further,
ending 11 basis points down from the previous close at 89.81.
Trade in the sterling cash market was calmer, as dealers showed a far
greater willing-ness to offer bills to the Bank of England than had been
seen earlier in the week. According to one clearing bank trader, several
banks had short positions and sold bills in large quantities to the Bank in
the hope of bringing the short dates down.
If that was the strategy, it succeeded. The overnight rate sank to a low of
7 per cent offered, from a previous close of 11 per cent and, at the day's
end, the one-week was offered  1/8 down at 9 7/8 per cent. The overwhelming
bearishness in the market meant that these rates had little effect further
out, however. Three-month money closed  1/16 down on the offered side at 10
5/16 per cent and the one-year was unchanged at 10 3/8 per cent.
The Bank of England operated at the established rates of 9 7/8 per cent for
Bands 1 and 2, and 9 15/16 per cent for the repurchase agreement (repo)
repayable on August 18 and 19.
In the morning, the Bank bought Pounds 173m in Band 1, Pounds 57m in Band 2,
and Pounds 369m in the repo. The forecast was then revised down to Pounds
700m in the afternoon, and the Bank purchased Pounds 100m in Band 1.
German call money remained firm, trading just below the Bundesbank's Lombard
rate of 9.75 per cent as banks sought to boost reserves to meet end-of-month
requirements.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Government Bonds: Longer-dated US Treasuries recover earlier
losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LONGER-DATED US Treasury prices bounced back yesterday afternoon from the
pressure of mixed economic news and the increased supply in the market
following this week's two-year and five-year note auctions.
In late trading, the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was  1/32 higher at
106 5/8 , yielding 7.435 per cent after sliding to 105 31/32 earlier in the
day. Among shorter-dated maturities, the two-year note was off 3/32 to yield
4.316 per cent. Larger losses were posted by intermediate issues.
The market was jolted by jobless claims for the week to July 18, which
dropped 21,000. The market had expected a fall of 11,000. In addition, new
home sales for June were higher than expected, advancing 7.9 per cent
instead of the anticipated 3.8 per cent.
Second-quarter gross domestic product data showed real GDP advancing at an
annualised rate of 1.4 per cent compared with expectations of 1.8 per cent,
and the inflation components indicated that inflation was under control.
The Federal Reserve addressed a soft Fed Funds rate by arranging overnight
matched sales in the open market when Fed Funds, the rate at which banks
lend to each other, were trading at about 3 1/16 per cent. The draining
manoeuvre did not come as a surprise with Fed Funds trading below the Fed's
perceived target of 3 1/4 per cent.
EUROPE'S main government bond markets tumbled yesterday mainly on worries
about the prospects for lower interest rates and European economic and
monetary union. Furthermore, a fall in the US Treasury bond market overnight
and during the day added to the markets' weak tone.
ITALIAN government bonds plunged as soon as the market opened following
Wednesday's resignation of Mr Vicenzo Scotti, the foreign minister. Mr
Scotti was strongly criticised yesterday for undermining the month-old
coalition by leaving over a party row.
The futures contract, which opened at 92.01, fell to a low of 91.30 before
stabilising at around the 91.45-91.60 level. Dealers noted selling of cash
bonds out of Tokyo as soon as the market opened, and substantial selling by
domestic investors during the day.
SPAIN, one of the other traditionally high-yielding European bond markets,
witnessed a marked fall in bond prices.
The Spanish Treasury decided not to allocate any three-, five-, or 10-year
bonds at its regular auction yesterday due to the steady fall in Spanish
bond prices.
At the Treasury auction on April 30, 10-year bonds were sold at a yield of
10.91 per cent. However, since the Danish vote against the ratification of
the Maastricht Treaty on economic and monetary union, the Spanish market has
dropped sharply and yields on 10-year bonds were 12.21 per cent, against
12.09 per cent the previous day.
Dealers had expected Spanish bond prices to pick up slightly on news that
the Treasury was not going to issue any bonds at auction. But the market
fell back, taking its cue from the other European markets.
FEARS about the outcome of the French referendum on the Maastricht Treaty in
September sent French government bonds sharply lower yesterday, with foreign
investors seen as particularly heavy sellers.
The market is likely to focus on next Wednesday's opinion poll concerning EC
union to see whether there has been a swing against ratification of the
Maastricht Treaty. The most recent polls showed about 55 per cent in favour
of ratifying the Maastricht Treaty, with up to 40 per cent undecided.
However, dealers said market sentiment had not been helped by the
government's poor showing in the opinion polls and the fact that
unemployment has reached a record level, with 10.3 per cent out of work
according to figures released yesterday.
The Matif futures contract closed 70 basis points lower at 104.76, its
lowest since August 1991, and fell further in after-hours trade to 104.62.
GERMAN government bonds plunged through their resistance levels to end
sharply lower yesterday on concern about the prospects for lower interest
rates.
The Liffe bund futures contract, which opened at 87.38, breached the 87.22
resistance level to end the day at 86.97. Dealers said the weak tone in the
US and other European markets did not help sentiment, but that the market
had chosen to focus on comments in the press by Mr Helmut Schlesinger,
Bundesbank president, that interest rates will not come down soon.
Elsewhere in the D-Mark bloc, the Dutch central bank surprised the markets
by increasing its special advances money market rate from 9.50 per cent to
9.60 per cent.
The move was intended to support the Dutch guilder against the D-Mark, and
was not seen as a significant tightening in policy. Dutch bonds fell back in
line with Germany and closed lower on the day.
UK government bonds fell by nearly a percentage point yesterday as jitters
over the French referendum on Maastricht upset the gilt market, adding to
existing concerns. The gilt futures contract fell to 97.11 from 98.5 on a
heavy volume of 51,420 contracts.
JAPANESE government bonds ended slightly weaker. The benchmark No 129 JGB,
which opened with a yield of 4.90 per cent, closed at 4.91 per cent in Tokyo
and moved to 4.94 per cent in the London trading session as European
investors took profits.
The futures contract traded in a range of 104.93-105.06 and closed at
104.98.

BFr6bn
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NET profits at Solvay, Belgium's largest chemicals group, slipped by 13.5
per cent in the first half of this year, with income down on the first half
of 1991 in all three of its principal operating sectors.
The group yesterday announced a consolidated interim profit of BFr5.88bn,
(Dollars 192m) against BFr6.8bn in the first half of last year. It pointed
out that the comparative figure was lifted by speculative pricing -
particularly of plastics - during the Gulf war.
Turnover in the first half dropped by 3.3 per cent to BFr132.5bn from
BFr137.1bn although volumes increased.
Solvay said it expected its full-year results to be generally comparable
with 1991, when the group made consolidated net profits of BFr12.44bn, or
BFr10.6bn before extraordinary items.
Baron Daniel Janssen, the group's chairman, said the plastics sector in
particular was still 'a very grim picture', although it had improved since
the second half of last year. PVC prices and demand improved in the first
months of 1992, but were still under pressure from east European and US
imports. Prices continued to fall in the high density polyethylene and
polypropylene markets, eroding margins.
In the circumstances, Baron Janssen said Solvay was surprised that the
European Commission had decided, earlier this month, to open another inquiry
into an alleged PVC cartel among EC manufacturers. 'If there's one market
which is heavily competitive, it's PVC,' he said yesterday.
He added that Solvay was pursuing discussions with Cefic, the EC chemical
companies' trade association, and the Commission over suspicions that east
European PVC makers might be dumping their product at artificially low
prices in the EC market. Baron Janssen warned east European manufacturers
earlier this year that Solvay would be prepared to lodge a formal complaint
with the Commission if the practice persisted.

<TEXT>
THE recent drop in the Canadian dollar and improved commodity prices helped
Noranda, the resources group controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family, almost
to double second-quarter earnings, writes Bernard Simon.
Net income rose to CDollars 32m (USDollars 27.1m), or nine cents a share,
from CDollars 18m, or two cents a share, a year earlier. Revenues dipped
slightly to CDollars 2.21bn from CDollars 2.28bn.
Metals and minerals advanced to CDollars 55m from CDollars 16m.

FT  31 JUL 92 / International Company News: UAL blames fare wars for Dollars
95.1m loss in quarter

UAL, the parent company of United Airlines, joined its two big US rivals in
reporting a large loss for the second quarter of 1992, and warned it expects
poor results for the balance of the year.
The carrier also hinted that further cost-cutting measures may be
implemented.
UAL said it lost Dollars 95.1m after tax in the three-month period, against
a profit of Dollars 52.7m in the same period of 1991. This takes UAL's loss
for the first six months of 1992 to Dollars 187.4m, a sharp rise on the
Dollars 104.3m deficit seen in the first half of 1991.
At the operating level, UAL's deficit for the quarter totalled Dollars
73.9m, compared with profits of Dollars 63.7m a year ago. Revenues were up
from Dollars 3.14bn, compared with Dollars 2.95bn in 1991, but yield, in
terms of revenue per passenger mile, fell from 12.28 cents to 12.14 cents.
In common with American and Delta - United's two main rivals - the
Chicago-based carrier pinned the blame on the early summer's ferocious
domestic fare wars.
Mr Stephen Wolf, chairman, said: 'Our clearly unsatisfactory results reflect
the severe impact of revenue-dilutive pricing activity in the US, as well as
the effects of the recessionary environment throughout much of the world.'
Ominously, Mr Wolf warned that this situation could persist throughout 1992:
'We expect these same factors to have a negative effect on our results for
at least the balance of 1992,' he said.
And he suggested action to reduce costs might be necessary. 'Unless this
situation is reversed, alternative actions to reduce our expenses will have
to be considered,' he warned.
United has already announced it will cut at least Dollars 2bn from its
Dollars 15.8bn capital spending programme planned for 1992-95.
United is the third 'mega-carrier' to suffer large second-quarter losses.
AMR, the parent company for American Airlines, reported a net loss of
Dollars 166m - or Dollars 48m if one-off charges were excluded. Delta Air
Lines followed with a loss of Dollars 180.2m. Delta accompanied its results
with news of staff reductions, and a general pruning of costs.
Continental Airlines, the fifth largest US carrier, also reported losses
yesterday afternoon.
The carrier, which has been operating under bankruptcy court protection
since late-1990, saw an after-tax loss of Dollars 99.2m in the three months
to end-June, against a Dollars 109.1m deficit in the same period a year
earlier. Revenues were Dollars 1.37bn (Dollars 1.37bn).
Continental's six-month loss now stands at Dollars 81.8m, against a Dollars
290.4m deficit in the first half of 1991. The figures, it said, 'reflected
the impact of fare discounting programmes and relatively weak industry
traffic'.
But, despite the industry's widespread acknowledgement of damage done by
fare wars, Delta Air Lines announced it was slashing 30 per cent off the
price charged for 14-day advance purchase tickets.
This 'Fall Sale' will last throughout August and cover domestic round-trip
travel from September 14 to December 14. After September, Delta said it
would raise all domestic fares by five per cent from their current levels.
Continental Airlines, meanwhile, was reported to have cut coast-to-coast
fares to as little as Dollars 99, while Swissair reduced its fares on
round-trip travel between the US and Switzerland.

FT  31 JUL 92 / International Company News: Bramalea to default on two debt
payments
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAMALEA, the ailing property developer controlled by Toronto's Bronfman
family, is to default on two debt payments while it puts the finishing
touches to a corporate restructuring plan.
The company said yesterday it is negotiating an 'arrangement' with senior
debenture holders under which they would refrain from taking bankruptcy
action against it until at least the end of August. The restructuring is due
to be cleared with all lenders by then.
Bramalea has debts of CDollars 4.9bn (USDollars 4.15bn). Its troubles stem
largely from purchases of undeveloped land, at the peak of the last property
boom. Plans to pay down debt by selling assets have been stalled by the
severe slump in North American real estate markets.
The company said yesterday its five major Canadian bank lenders, as well as
Trizec, its controlling shareholder, have agreed in principle to the terms
of the plan, including providing financial support for the next five years.
The main thorn in Bramalea's side in recent months however, has been its
smaller lenders, including several foreign banks, which have less to lose if
it is forced to file for court protection.
The two debt payments to be skipped are a CDollars 5.2m interest payment on
a series of senior debentures, on which the grace period expired yesterday;
and a principal payment on another series of debentures.
Under the restructuring plan, Bramalea hopes to cut its debt - largely
through asset sales - to about CDollars 2bn by 1997 and to produce a
positive cash flow by next year. It has suspended all dividends.

FT  31 JUL 92 / International Company News: Turmoil in the Uni Storebrand
boardroom - The Norwegian insurer's shareholders are seeking a shift in
power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The top echelons of Uni Storebrand, Norway's biggest insurer, have been in
turmoil recently with the departure of the company's president and chief
executive and the board tendering its resignation.
Now some of its biggest shareholders, frustrated at the lack of progress at
the company, are intent on forcing a power shift within the company.
Disgruntled shareholders are campaigning for power within the company to be
transferred to the board from the executive administration where it has
languished under the leadership of Mr Jan Erik Langangen, who resigned last
Sunday.
Mr Langangen's surprise departure came amid sharp criticism by shareholders
from whom he had failed to win unconditional backing for a capital expansion
of between NKr1.5bn (Dollars 258.6m) to NKr2bn being planned for the autumn.
The capital expansion will enable Uni to meet international capital adequacy
requirements while giving the company 'breathing space' over the next year
to dispose of a NKr4.7bn, 28.3 per cent shareholding in Skandia Forsakrings,
the big Swedish insurer. This stake was a key part of his strategy to create
a pan-Nordic insurance alliance.
Shareholders' disillusion has grown in recent months over Mr Langangen's
failure to create this alliance and the fruitless, hostile raid on Skandia.
The Skandia acquisition, they maintain, was a waste of resources on a
miscalculated risk which gave the company no influence over the Swedish
insurer whose strict rules limit voting rights. In addition Skandia's
powerful leader, Mr Bjoern Wolrath, has stymied the prospect of Mr Langangen
making his vision a reality.
Shareholders were also disappointed at the progress Mr Langangen had made in
the company following a merger two years ago between Uni Forsikring and
Storebrand, out of which the group was created. They have seen Uni's Skandia
investment plunge in value by an estimated NKr2.5bn as Uni's share price
tumbled to NKr25 from NKr50, stifling its prospects for raising new capital.
Dissenting shareholders have demanded the resignation of Uni's board as a
condition for participation in that key share issue. Seeing that his freedom
to continue to decide company strategy had been significantly reduced, Mr
Langangen withdrew as the board tendered its resignation.
Uni's board appointed Mr Per Terje Vold, deputy managing director of the
group's life assurance company, as Mr Langangen's successor, but there are
also questions over his future. His experience in the industry is limited to
four years in the company although, to his credit, he was responsible for
the successful clean-up operation in 1989 of Storebrand Finans, Storebrand's
finance unit, which had plunged into deep losses.
But there are also differences among the dissenting shareholders, of which
Mr Vold's future as a president is only one element. Replacing all or part
of the board is another, and so is whether to replace senior executive
staff, loyal to Mr Langangen.
Mr Thorleif Borge, Uni's board chairman, will be forced out of his post, but
he could remain a board member since he represents the interests of the Uni
Foundation, Uni's biggest shareholder with a 26.6 per cent stake.
The shareholders' strongest candidate to replace Mr Borge is Mr Torvild
Aakvaag, chairman of the board of Norsk Hydro, Norway's biggest stock listed
company, and a current member of Uni's board.
'Mr Aakvaag is an experienced industrial leader who could restore
credibility to Uni Storebrand,' one shareholder believes. It is also widely
expected that Norsk Hydro will make a hefty contribution to Uni's capital
expansion.
Shareholders want a change of the board. 'With the existing board chairman
being the former chief executive of Uni (Forsikring), it is clear the power
of the administration of the merged company had grown too strong,' one
shareholder said. 'I think most shareholders will see to it that Uni gets
the capital it needs, but major changes to the board will have to be made,'
he said.
Four out of Uni's top 10 shareholders are foreign interests, although there
is no foreign board member.
The appointment of Uni Storebrand's new board is expected to be announced on
August 10. The board will then have to decide the fate of the company's
interim president and senior executive management.
Details of the planned September share issue will also have to be finalised
and a strategy for the disposal of the Skandia shareholding agreed.
The new board will also make clear the business priorities which Uni's
management will have to pursue. There is little doubt that improving
efficiency of the group since the merger will be a top priority.

FT  31 JUL 92 / International Company News: Revlon postpones plans for
flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REVLON, the cosmetics and consumer products company taken over by Mr Ronald
Perelman, the corporate raider, after a bruising bid battle in 1985,
yesterday postponed plans to float shares on the stock market.
Revlon first announced flotation plans in May. It said it intended to
transfer the bulk of its cosmetics, skin care, fragrance and personal care
operations to a new subsidiary, New Revlon. It would then sell 20m shares in
New Revlon to investors, leaving the rest of the equity - an 82.2 per cent
stake - to be held by a company controlled by Mr Perelman.
According to the original flotation filing, the maximum price at which the
shares were to be sold was Dollars 19 - raising up to Dollars 380m. Revlon
later amended this, reducing the size and price of the potential offering to
11m at a price of Dollars 14 to Dollars 15.
But yesterday, it postponed the flotation altogether. The company said the
'prevailing market conditions for initial public offerings have weakened
domestic institutional demand' and the offering could not 'be done at a
price we think is consistent with Revlon's overall value and operating
prospects.'

FT  31 JUL 92 / International Company News: Political shadow over KIO assets
offer - The background to Javier de la Rosa's Dollars 2.5bn bid for Grupo
Torras
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For 12 long days this month the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) sat on an
offer worth Dollars 2.5bn for all of its Spanish industrial assets from a
former investment partner in Spain, Mr Javier de la Rosa.
On Wednesday July 22, a trusted but now middle-ranking KIO official, called
Mr de la Rosa to ask him for a 'confirmatory copy' and to query points in
the offer, which he had faxed to the Kuwaiti finance minister on July 15.
The official said they wanted him to countersign the original fax.
Although irritated by the fact that he had not been approached by a more
senior official, Mr de la Rosa signed and sent a new fax, but it apparently
never arrived at the headquarters of the KIO's Spanish holding company,
Grupo Torras, in Madrid.
Mr de la Rosa did not respond to further calls from the official on the
Thursday and Friday of last week. Last Monday the bank standing by to
guarantee the offer said it could no longer wait and he sent another fax to
Kuwait withdrawing the offer.
Yesterday in Madrid, however, KIO representatives told the El Pais newspaper
the Torras companies were in serious trouble and required Dollars 3bn to put
them on a sound financial footing.
Creditor banks are being called to a meeting on August 5 to discuss a debt
moratorium which would help Prima, the Torras property arm, avoid capital
repayments on Dollars 700m of debt for eight months.
This has been almost inevitable. By forcing the Torras chemicals arm,
Ercros, to file for protection from creditors - with debts of Dollars 2.15bn
 -earlier this month following a refusal to finance it, the management which
took over at the KIO in May may have triggered a crisis of confidence in all
its companies.
Prima stock has fallen from Pta2,500 (Dollars 26.5) to Pta950 in a month.
But the rest of the Torras companies bought and built up by Mr de la Rosa
and KIO's former managers are also suffering. Stock in Ebro, a big foods
group, is weak and Torraspapel, Spain's biggest paper company, is finding it
hard to raise new credit.
At the same time, the new KIO management has ordered Torras' auditors,
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, to prepare accounts for 1991 removing all extraordinary
profits and valuing its portfolio at current stock market prices, not at
book value.
This slashes a modest Dollars 3m profit reported by the company to a loss of
Dollars 300m. Ironically the Kuwaiti government still accounts for its
worldwide holdings on the same book value method employed by the old KIO
managers.
But if the companies are in such trouble, why did the KIO not immediately
test the seriousness of Mr de la Rosa's offer and begin negotiations. He had
worked closely with KIO's old management for six years and managed direct
investment in Spain by KIO of Dollars 3.7bn. So why provoke him by asking to
check his signature? Why did a senior KIO official not call him?
The KIO might fairly be said to have thought the 10-day initial response
time contained in the negotiating offer was flexible.
Also, the KIO is still valuing its Spanish portfolio. But for the KIO to
appear in the Spanish press yesterday running down the quality of its
investments and stating that some, such as Prima, are on the verge of
collapse is an unusual way of generating confidence.
Part of the explanation is mired in the village politics of Kuwait, where
elections are to be held in October. The old KIO management, with whom Mr de
la Rosa is closely identified and still friendly, was a creation of the
ruling Al-Sabah family.
Since the end of the Gulf war, the Al-Sabahs have been forced to bend to
demands from rich Kuwaiti merchant families for more power and KIO's new
management reflects a shift of resources to the merchants.
Grupo Torras probably does not need Dollars 3bn to survive but the blacker
the empire created by the old pro-Sabah management is painted and the bigger
the crisis in Spain appears, the more effective a political weapon Torras
may become in the run up to the elections.
That is one view. The other is that the KIO's new management have indeed
found themselves in a mess in Spain, with big debts, loans pegged to equity
stakes in its companies and a rapidly shrinking economy which calls for
desperate measures.
But if this is the case, the obvious question again raises its head. Why was
Mr de la Rosa's Dollars 2.5bn offer not then acted upon with urgency?
Mr de la Rosa, according to people close to him, is almost certain to make a
new bid for Torras, probably in August.
He is understood to have two major industrial partners, from the UK and
Germany, interested in entering the Spanish market in sectors occupied by
Torras companies.
Extremely well connected, he is quite capable of raising the money though,
following the crisis leaks to El Pais yesterday, a new bid is likely to be
lower than the first.

Rustenburg Platinum

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSTENBURG Platinum, the world's largest platinum producer, yesterday
unveiled a 33 per cent fall in attributable profits for the year to June,
due to lower metal prices, particularly for Rhodium.
Sales of the South African company fell 15 per cent to R2.9bn (Dollars
1.05bn) from R3.43bn in 1991. Income from platinum fell by 9.9 per cent,
largely because of the lower metal prices. The average price for the year
received by Rustenburg and its smaller sister mine, Lebowa Platinum, was
Dollars 363 an ounce compared with Dollars 428 in 1991. This was partially
offset by a more favourable exchange rate.
Income from by-products, principally rhodium, fell 19.3 per cent due to a
lower rhodium price - Dollars 2,684 an ounce in 1992 compared with Dollars
4,601.
Profit on metal sales fell 32.5 per cent to R928.9m from R1.38bn. Other
income dropped to R90.7m from R143.1m, mainly because of lower cash holdings
following a rights issue and a special dividend by the developing PPRust
platinum project. The tax and lease charge was well down leaving
distributable profits 33.4 per cent lower at R402.3m against R604m. The
dividend was cut by a similar margin to 230 cents a share from 350 cents.

Dunkeld Group, the clothing manufacturer formerly Aitch Holdings, returned
to profits in the six months to May 31. However, expected second half
losses, due to trading patterns, should reduce this for the year.
The new management said the turnround was achieved by a large reduction in

reorganisation 10 offshoots were closed or sold.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 626,000, compared with losses of Pounds 995,000
and losses of Pounds 7.32m for the year to November 30, which included
exceptional costs of Pounds 2.86m. Turnover fell from Pounds 18.7m to Pounds

FT  31 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Novo calls for Pounds 9m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Novo Group yesterday announced a sharp rise in profits, an Pounds 8.8m
rights issue to help fund a Pounds 3.3m acquisition, and a capital
reorganisation.
For the 12 months to March 31 profits at the pre-tax level rose to Pounds
1.08m helped by the acquisition in April 1991 of Novo Communications for
Dollars 14m. Turnover amounted to Pounds 12.8m.
The figures compared with Pounds 158,000 and Pounds 9.45m for the preceding
18 months. Earnings were 10.1p (1.44p).
The underwritten rights issue is of 29.38m new ordinary shares on a 16-for-3
basis at 30p per share.
The directors said the 'geographical mix of the group's earnings and its
unwieldy loan structure' had combined to prevent it paying its preference
dividends. The ordinary payment is therefore omitted - a 1.6p total was paid
for 1991.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
J SAVILLE Gordon, the property, pipeline and securities trading company,
reported a strong return to the black in the year to April 30 and announced
that its securities dealing side had ceased to trade at the year-end.
Pre-tax profits emerged at Pounds 3.83m (losses Pounds 2.3m) after
securities and commodities dealing earned Pounds 1.84m at the operating
level. Last time this activity lost Pounds 3.69m.
The clearing of the investment decks resulted in sharply increased turnover
in the dealing division - up from Pounds 13.2m to Pounds 30.2m. Borrowings
at the year-end stood at Pounds 35m (Pounds 43m), giving gearing of 73 per
cent (92 per cent).
Turnover in the property side grew to Pounds 7.49m (Pounds 5.89m) giving
flat profits at Pounds 5.39m.
The pipeline and stockholding side was affected by the ills of the
construction sector and turnover and profits declined to Pounds 19.5m
(Pounds 22.1m) and Pounds 1.01m (Pounds 1.68m) respectively.
Earnings emerged at 3.2p (losses 1.5p) per share and the final dividend is
held at 1.7p for an unchanged total of 2.2p.

FT  31 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Harland Simon denies SE investigation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HARLAND Simon, the troubled controls systems group, yesterday responded
angrily to reports that the Stock Exchange was investigating possible
misleading statements.
Mr David Mahony, chairman, said: 'To the best of my knowledge the Stock
Exchange is not investigating the company.'
It is understood, however, that the Stock Exchange has been monitoring the
situation at Harland Simon.
Its shares have plunged from 585p in February following a profits warning,
just two months after the interim statement.
Last night the shares closed up 1p at 17p.
Harland has also come under scrutiny from shareholders for its holding in
Perfect Information, a network information company.
Earlier this week Harland said that no director or company associated with
it had been the beneficial owner of the shares purchased from a
Liechtenstein trust.
Mr Mahony said he would not comment further on any investigation by the
Stock Exchange.

FT  31 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Cost controls help CIA to 27% rise at
Pounds 1.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CIA Group, the independent media-buying concern, bucked the sector trend in
the first half of 1992 with a 27 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from
Pounds 1.47m to Pounds 1.87m.
Tight control of costs was given as a principal cause for the improvement.
Further, the USM-quoted group revealed that this time a higher proportion of
its profits were from trading - 56 per cent, against 46 per cent - and that
this growth was both organic and by acquisition.
Turnover rose to Pounds 116.3m (Pounds 79.3m). Of this, organic growth
accounted for Pounds 10m domestically and Pounds 14m internationally, with
new companies - Maedia Solutions and the 20/20 Media joint venture -
contributing an extra Pounds 13m.
The group put on Pounds 48m of new business and lost only Pounds 5m.
The group increased its cash by about Pounds 1m to Pounds 8m.
Earnings per share expanded to 8.59p (6.82p).
The interim dividend is raised from 1.15p to 1.32p.

FT  31 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Institutions may vote against WPP
restructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LENDERS TO WPP, the worldwide marketing services group, have more to lose
than to gain by sending the company into liquidation and are unlikely to
make good on their threat to do so if shareholders fail to support a
proposed restructuring, a leading institutional shareholder said yesterday.
Mr Anthony Bolton, senior investment director at Fidelity Investment
Services, which has a 9.5 per cent stake in WPP, said: 'Administration
cannot be a goal for them.'
Among other things, the lenders would be left as owners of a group of
companies for which no immediate buyer exists.
Furthermore, clients would be unlikely to transmit payments for purchases of
advertising space to companies that are already in receivership.
Shareholders must decide by August 5 whether to accept the terms of the
restructur-ing.
WPP's management and its financial advisers, Samuel Montagu, have
recommended that they do so while the lenders have said they have no
alternative.
Mr Bolton said that Fidelity and a group of other shareholders, who between
them represent 30 to 40 per cent of WPP's convertible cumulative preference
shares, are considering voting against the restructuring proposal which will
effectively give the lenders a majority equity stake in the company.
So far, the banks have refused to try to reach a negotiated settlement, he
said.
In particular, the preference shareholders believe the terms are
particularly disadvantageous to them.
According to one institutional shareholder, the voting and income rights of
preference shareholders will be cut to three quarters of that of ordinary
shareholders, instead of the 150 per cent as the current securities provide.
Mr Bolton said that he personally believed the terms were too generous to
the lenders.
'The banks lent imprudently to finance an expansion which was unsustainable
and they have to accept some of the pain,' he said.
Fidelity has suggested several compromises to the lenders including a plan
to issue warrants to preference shareholders exerciseable between 45p and
60p per share.
This would dilute the banks' stake down to as low as 33 per cent.

FT  31 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Henry Ansbacher climbs 73% to Pounds 1.91m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX PROFITS at Henry Ansbacher, the merchant banking group, rose by 73
per cent in the half year to June 30, after a strong performance from its
offshore operations and asset trading depart ment.
Mr Richard Fenhalls, chairman, said that the increase had been achieved
despite the recession and without any improvement in market conditions in
the UK or the US.
Talks about a possible takeover by Singer &amp; Friedlander are continuing but
the group declined to give further de-tails.
Two of Ansbacher's main shareholders - Pargesa, the Swiss investment group
controlled by Belgians and Canadians, and Groupe Bruxelles Lambert, which
together own about 62 per cent of the shares - have been in contact with
Singers for more than two months.
Pre-tax profits, after all provisions, were Pounds 1.91m, compared with
Pounds 1.1m last time. In the year to December 31 1991, the group incurred a
pre-tax loss of Pounds 8.23m.
Its banking operations continued to shrink. The total loan book net of cash
backed loans was Pounds 99.1m at the end of June compared with Pounds 155.5m
a year earlier. Corporate finance was said to have done well.
Losses by the group's mergers and acquisitions division were said to be well
down on those of 1991 as a result of cost reductions made in July 1991.
The New York mergers and acquisitions operation will be wound down
gradually, allowing remaining senior staff to serve out their contracts
while the rump of its operations in London have been merged in the group's
corporate finance department.
Group central costs were up by 4.7 per cent, from Pounds 523m to Pounds
548m.
Earnings per share were 0.3p (losses of 0.2p).

FT  31 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Second quarter setback leaves Hepworth
lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEPWORTH experienced steady trading in the first three months of this year,
but the second quarter saw a further decline in demand from its main UK
markets.
The building materials and home products company reported a 7 per cent
decline in pre-tax profits to Pounds 32.8m for the six months to June 30 on
turnover 3.6 per cent lower at Pounds 319.1m.
However, the group said trading in the important continental markets had
been reasonably good, with Saunier Duval, its gas boiler maker, performing
particularly well.
Building products benefited from buoyant demand for European clay pipes and
held profits at Pounds 11.9m on flat turnover, in spite of worsening trading
conditions in the UK.
Management was continuing to introduce new products and a reduction in the
division's UK workforce from 2,400 to 2,000 had already been announced,
costs of which would be taken in the second half.
The home products division, which experienced reduced UK demand for its gas
boilers and garage doors, saw profits fall from Pounds 7.3m to Pounds 6.3m
on turnover of Pounds 49.8m (Pounds 52.6m).
Saunier Duval raised profits to Pounds 13.5m (Pounds 10.5m) on turnover of
Pounds 90.9m (Pounds 75.6m). Demand for combination boilers remained buoyant
in its main French and Spanish markets and the outlook remained favourable.
The worst performance came from refractories where weak demand worldwide saw
profits fall from Pounds 9.2m to Pounds 4.6m on turnover of Pounds 64.6m
(Pounds 78.5m).
Management responded by significantly reducing the cost base and further
rationalisation is being implemented. The group warned that these costs
would fall in the second half, and full-year profits would be much lower
than last time.
Reduced demand also affected the mineral and chemicals division, but a
reduction in costs made last year partly mitigated the impact of weaker
trading. Although turnover dropped from Pounds 51m to Pounds 38.5m after a
disposal, profits fell just Pounds 300,000 to Pounds 5.5m.
Gearing dropped from 33 per cent at the year-end to 25 per cent.
Capital expenditure had been curbed in the light of deteriorating market
conditions, although heavy investment was continuing at Saunier Duval.
Earnings per share were 11.3p (12.2p). The interim dividend is held at 5.5p.
COMMENT
Hepworth is clearly a class act in the bombed-out building products sector,
but that was not enough to prevent the shares being marked down in May after
it became clear there was going to be no immediate post-election boom in the
UK. These results are respectable, given the present trading conditions -
although cost-cutting might reduce full-year profits by Pounds 8m - and the
company's caution following destocking of its boilers by merchants. Overseas
business now accounts for more than 40 per cent of profits and sales, partly
because the UK is so flat. What is impressive is the way Hepworth keeps on
cutting costs and improving products, and not just waiting for the upturn.
The shares closed 4p higher at 310p putting them on a prospective multiple
of just under 16. Hepworth remains one of the best quality recovery plays.

FT  31 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Unitech hit by slowdown in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SLOWDOWN in the Jap-anese economy adversely affected Unitech, the
international electronics group, which suffered a 35 per cent fall in
pre-tax profits for the year to May 31.
Pre-tax profits fell from a restated Pounds 18.5m to Pounds 12m on sales of
Pounds 251.8m, down from Pounds 256.7m.
The proposed final dividend is halved to 3.75p, making a total of 5.85p,
compared with 11.7p.
Mr Peter Curry, chairman, said: 'There was a very significant fall in demand
in the second half. We had to move some of our high cost production
facilities out of Japan into Malaysia.'
This was reflected in exceptional restructuring costs of Pounds 2.13m
against Pounds 1.3m in the previous year.
Trading profit amounted to Pounds 19.3m (Pounds 26.7m) before exceptional
costs.
Trading in Japan has a significant effect on the power supplies division.
Sales of Nemic-Lambda KK, its Japanese power supply subsidiary, fell by 8
per cent against a growth of 18 per cent.
Demand was flat in North America. Profit from this source fell from Pounds
19.8m to Pounds 13.5m.
The Far East is still the biggest profits source accounting for 42 per cent
compared with 32 per cent in Europe (the UK accounts for less than 10 per)
and 26 per cent in North America.
Mr Curry said all the company's markets outside Japan appeared to be static
or showing signs of slight improvement.
An extraordinary gain of Pounds 4m related to the sale of Rathdown
Industries, a manufacturer of pay phones. This helped reduce net debt from
Pounds 54.5m to Pounds 40.9m and gearing from 61 per cent to 43 per cent of
net assets. Earnings fell to 7.3p (11.5p).
COMMENT
The dividend cut reflects the group's difficulty in being a UK-based group
with an international business. An increasing percentage of the profits is
earned outside the UK and given that this trend is set to continue,
additional tax outlays could be incurred from unrecovered advanced
corporation tax without a cut in the dividend. The high tax rate of 44.3 per
cent, due to the Japanese businesses, has to be set against a strong balance
sheet coupled with a mix of businesses ready to benefit from any worldwide
economic recovery. With forecasts of pre-tax profits of Pounds 10.4m, giving
earnings per share of 8.3p, the shares - which rose 6p to close at 144p -
are on a prospective multiple of 17.3. The premium rating is probably fair
since either the Swiss group Electrowatt or the Italian lawyer Tito
Tettamanti, who between them own just over half the company, may make a bid.

FT  31 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Brierley Investments considers Gibbs Mew
bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRIERLEY Investments Limited, which holds stakes in Budgens, the supermarket
chain, Alvis, the defence contractor, and Mount Charlotte, the hotels group,
yesterday announced that it was considering making an offer for the 80.3 per
cent of Gibbs Mew, the Salisbury-based brewer and commercial property group,
that its subsidiary, BIL Securities (Far East), does not already own.
It said its offer would be at a premium to 138p, Gibbs Mew's share price at
the time of the announcement. Gibbs Mew's shares jumped to 173p, to fall
back to 168p.
The possible offer hinges on certain pre-conditions: that Gibbs Mew's
activities remain as normal; that it makes no disposals or acquisitions; and
that it does not issue or allot any shares.
Last night BIL would not comment further than its statement. Gibbs Mew was
equally reticent.
However, it is thought that a dispute is growing between the USM-quoted
brewer and its biggest non-family shareholder over possible moves the Gibbs
Mew management may be considering and the announcement of BIL's possible bid
is designed to stymie the management plans. Market rumours suggest one such
move might be the acquisition of a business connected with the drinks side
of Gibbs Mew's operations.
Gibbs Mew was founded in the 1850s by the great-grandfather of Mr Peter
Gibbs, the current chairman. Some 58 per cent of the equity is held by Mr
Gibbs, his three daughters and his son.
BIL was founded by Sir Ron Brierley, who was ousted in a boardroom coup in
1989 by Mr Bruce Hancox, the current chairman, and Mr Paul Collins, chief
executive.

FT  31 JUL 92 / UK Company News: T Cowie ahead of offer forecast with 56%
rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
T COWIE, the car leasing, motor trading, bus and tractor group, announced a
56 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 12.1m in the first half of the
year.
The figure beat the forecast of not less than Pounds 11.5m Cowie made in its
offer document for its Pounds 25m all-paper bid for rival Henlys Group.
Cowie's shares rose 4p to 132p, valuing each Henlys share at 66p under the
1-for-2 offer terms. That matches Henlys shares which were unchanged
yesterday. Cowie's offer was accepted by only 0.6 per cent of Henlys
shareholders at its first closing date. Cowie can change the terms of its
offer until August 18.
Cowie's increase in operating profits was a more modest 12.8 per cent to
Pounds 31.5m, on sales up 10.7 per cent to Pounds 322.6m. Interest charges
fell from Pounds 20.1m to Pounds 19.3m. The group is highly sensitive to
falling interest rates, each percentage point cut adding Pounds 2.4m to
pre-tax profits.
However, the group had capped 90 per cent of its borrowings, which totalled
Pounds 315m or 321 per cent of shareholders' funds at the half-year end, so
that it would be relatively immune to any rise in interest rates, Mr Gordon
Hodgson, chief executive, said.
The group gives a divisional break down of its profits at the pre-tax level.
Its vehicle leasing business increased profits by 64 per cent to Pounds 8.2m
on sales 26 per cent up at Pounds 124.8m. Acquisitions, which added 9,000
vehicles to the fleet taking it to 60,000, led to economies of scale which
boosted profits. Lower interest rates also helped.
The motor division's profits rose to Pounds 3.5m (Pounds 3.2m). The group is
expecting to benefit from some relaxation of franchise restrictions.
Profits of Cowie's Grey-Green bus business, which operates a number of
routes in London, rose from Pounds 507,000 to Pounds 854,000. Its bus and
coach distribution side made Pounds 941,000 (Pounds 349,000) and the
agricultural division put in Pounds 147,000 (Pounds 143,000).
After a tax charge estimated at 30 per cent (25 per cent) earnings per share
rose by 46 per cent to 6.68p. As indicated in the offer document, the
interim dividend is 2p (1.5p).

FT  31 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Kwik-Fit shares remain out of favour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KWIK-FIT Holdings, the tyre and exhaust fitter, said yesterday that it had
noted that several brokers had downgraded their forecasts for the current
year to February 28 1993.
This, the company said, had resulted in a sharp fall in the share price
recently.
Yesterday the decline continued, to 104 1/2 p.
On June 4, the shares stood at 223p, on July 24 at 176p, on July 27 at 169p,
slumping 120p the following day.
The company stressed that buoyant tyre sales in the final quarter of last
year had been followed by a May, June and July down on last time, though
demand for other products continued 'at a good level'.
Tyre sales generally had fallen, though the company had maintained its
market share.
The balance sheet was strong, the company said, with relatively low
borrowings.
It fully expected to maintain the level of its dividends.
In the year to February 29 1992, the company had achieved a 66 per cent
advance in pre-tax profits to Pounds 32.1m in defiance of the recession.
This it had accomplished with operating margins up from 10 to 15 per cent
and with interest charges down by Pounds 4m.

FT  31 JUL 92 / The Breakup of ICI: Teesside braces itself for further job
losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TEESSIDE, which has the highest concentration of ICI manufacturing assets in
the world, has been bracing itself for unpleasant news from the
long-heralded restructuring.
Fears have been growing that Teesside is vulnerable to big job losses from
its biggest private sector employer because of its over dependence on the
bulky, least glamorous parts of ICI's business.
Although ICI remains the dominant local employer with about 11,000 on its
Teesside payroll, this is fewer than half the number employed before the
last recession began in 1979. With the rundown in numbers the traditional
image of ICI on Teesside as a paternalistic employer has dwindled, a shift
recently reinforced by the proposed deal under which Du Pont will acquire
ICI's European-based nylon business.
Middlesbrough council yesterday called on ICI to invest more cash in its
bio-science businesses in the Teesside area. 'That is obviously ICI's latest
success story and we want to be part of it', said Mr John Jones, deputy
leader of the council.
Mr Peter Crowe, chief executive of the Teesside Chamber of Trade, said it
was much too soon to tell what the implications of ICI's proposed demerger
would be for Teesside.
'I hope this won't mean any threat to employment on Teesside,' he said. 'If
ICI feels this helps them in a global market place and won't threaten
employment or investment on Teesside any more than the known restructuring
going on the Chamber won't criticise them for doing it.'

FT  31 JUL 92 / The Breakup of ICI: Shareholders react with glee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDERS in ICI yesterday reacted gleefully to the news that the
bio-sciences businesses will be spun off into a new company. They said the
move was even more aggressive than they had hoped for.
'It's good news for shareholders,' said Mr John Thompson, director of UK
equities at Standard Life.
The demerger, mooted in meetings last summer with Sir Denys Henderson, ICI
chairman, as one option for improving value for shareholders, was broadly
welcomed by shareholders as a mechanism to allow the companies mushrooming
pharmaceuticals business to flourish unfettered.
In earlier discussions, ICI directors had hinted that they planned to
demerge no more than the pharmaceuticals business, so the extent of the
demerger caused surprise.
However, shareholders generally agreed that the new business groupings were
sensible.
'The structure has been ridiculous,' said one shareholder. 'Not so long ago,
the man in charge of pharmaceuticals was also in charge of paint production.
So he had to look at the salaries of paint workers in Slough as well as one
of the most complex businesses in the world.' Had ICI not spun off the
bio-sciences businesses, they would likely have withered under the company's
enormous bureaucracy and diverse product mix.
Even if the two individual companies were no better managed than the current
conglomerate, investors said there was still likely to be improvement in
share prices simply because markets can more accurately value shares of
companies in single industries than those of conglomerates.
Shareholders pointed hopefully to the share price performance of Courtaulds'
two business segments since they were separated in 1990. Shares in both
companies have significantly outperformed the FT-A All-Share index and ICI
investors are hoping for more of the same.
However, while euphorically watching the share price soar 76p to close at
1171p - adding roughly Pounds 800m to the company's share capital -
shareholders had some concerns about exactly how the demerger would work.
'I really want to know how much this is going to cost,' said one leading
shareholder. 'Advisers can be fairly rapacious in deals like this.' The
concern is that fees and the costs of business restructuring may, at least
in the early years, outweigh added returns to shareholders.
Shareholders are also anxious to see details of the bio-science companies'
planned capital raising exercise and plans for spending the new funds. It is
expected that the fresh capital will be used to reduce debt shifted to the
bio-sciences division from the industrial division.

FT  31 JUL 92 / The Breakup of ICI: Bulk fears may put Runcorn on the spot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REACTION TO the ICI announcement ranged from enthusiasm to fear yesterday,
depending on who was involved, where they were based, or what business they
were in.
Mr David Collins, economic development officer for Cheshire County, said:
'We have very mixed feelings.' ICI employs about 6,000 people in Cheshire
but they are split between pharmaceuticals and bulk chemicals.
The pharmaceuticals business has its world headquarters in Alderley Edge,
near Wilmslow in the prosperous eastern half of Cheshire. Its future,
already assured, will be strengthened by its leading role in the new ICI
Bio.
However, Cheshire also houses the core of the old ICI Mond division at
Runcorn on the south bank of the Mersey facing Widnes, in the poorer western
half of the county.
Chlorine manufacture at Runcorn is already under pressure from
environmentalists, following leaks of gases and concern over pollution of
the Mersey, while ICI has also warned recently that the rising cost of power
may force closure anyway.
At Cheshire county hall yesterday, the implications of Runcorn not having
pharmaceuticals to lean on far outweighed any improved prospects for
Alderley Edge .
ICI's specialities business has its world headquarters in the north, at
Blackley in Manchester. Its future looks bright as part of ICI Bio,
especially since its surfactants operations - mainly bulk production for
detergents and located on Teesside - would be transferred to chemicals and
polymers.
Blackley would therefore be able to concentrate on specialities with high
added value for use in industries such as cosmetics and health care. Its
staff - and Manchester - are understood to be enthusiastic about the
changes, which they see as a natural evolution.
The changes are also understood to be welcome at ICI Paints, which has its
world headquarters at Slough, in the Thames Valley.
The paints business - a mixture of well-marketed decorative products and
high-margin industrial coatings - will emerge from the shadow of
pharmaceuticals to become the star performer of the new non-bio ICI.
Coincidentally, it will occupy the same position in the new grouping as Akzo
Coatings does in Akzo, the Netherlands chemicals group, with about 20 per
cent of the total busi-ness.
ICI Paints - which competitors saw as a sleeping giant in the mid-1980s -
has since been woken up under Mr Herman Scopes, its chief executive. Its
tight, professional managerial standards are expected to have a noticeable
influence on the new bulk chemicals business.
Mr Philip Okell, investment management director of Charterhouse Tilney, the
Liverpool-based stockbroker, said yesterday: 'We are very keen on this
development. This will free the better parts of ICI to do even better but it
will expose the bulk chemicals business.
'They will be on their own and their management teams will become more
focused. Making a similar split between mature and thrusting businesses has
worked very well for Courtaulds. People were gloomy about the prospects for
Courtaulds Textiles but it has done well on its own,' Mr Okell added.

FT  31 JUL 92 / The Breakup of ICI: Global overcapacity threat to
petrochemicals manufacturing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER SPINNING off ICI Bio, the new ICI will be left with a mixed bag of
high-volume, capital-intensive and very cyclical businesses. They were
highly profitable in the chemicals boom of the late 1980s but worldwide
overcapacity in bulk chemical manufacturing means that ICI is unlikely to
see such good times again in the 1990s, however well the world economy
recovers.
The most vulnerable part of the new ICI is in petrochemicals - making
plastics out of oil and gas. It is one of the smaller global petrochemical
manufacturers, with sales of around Pounds 2.5bn a year compared to Shell's
Pounds 6bn, and its production economics are generally less favourable than
for oil companies such as Exxon and BP which have more flexibility to take
petrochemical profits up or downstream.
In some key areas of petrochemicals, such as olefins and aromatics, ICI is a
regional rather than a global player. These operations are likely to be
prime candidates for disposal. As Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, said
yesterday, 'We believe the right way to go is down the global route.
Regional businesses can be satisfactory but they have to earn their corn.'
One regional business that is not earning its corn at present is the
UK-based chlor-alkali operation, which has been hit hard by what Sir Denys
called 'an absolutely disgraceful increase in electricity prices'.
Sir Denys threatened to close the chlor-alkali business down, saying 'we
have got to a critical point - if anyone thinks we're just rattling sabres,
just wait and see.'
But the new ICI has several businesses in which it can fairly claim to be a
world leader.
For example:
Paints has continued to trade strongly during the recession and is set for
strong growth when the world economy picks up.
Explosives is expanding into new areas such as the safe disposal or
recycling of surplus military explosives and ammunition.
The fluorocarbons business is building new plants in the UK, US and Japan
for chemicals to replace CFCs (which are being phased out because they
destroy the ozone layer).
Tioxide, which became a wholly-owned ICI subsidiary last year, is cutting
costs and investing in less polluting plants to produce the white pigment
titanium dioxide.
The future of ICI's materials business will depend very much on the outcome
of current negotiations to sell its fibres interests to Du Pont of the US
and buy Du Pont's acrylic interest instead. The swap is still awaiting
clearance from the European and US competition authorities but, Mr Ronnie
Hampel, chief executive designate of the post-spinoff ICI, said yesterday:
'We believe it is part of the more general restructuring which the chemical
industry in Europe requires and which will enhance its competitiveness.'
One issue threatening the competitiveness of the new ICI is environmental
legislation. As an industrial chemical producer, it will have to invest
heavily worldwide in cleaner factories and facilities to reduce wastes.
Although Tioxide is now benefiting from recent investment of this sort, ICI
as a whole has not yet faced up to the environmental challenge in the same
way as its German competitors, BASF, Hoechst and Bayer.
There is no good international model for the new non-biological ICI. Perhaps
the closest match is Union Carbide of the US - though Carbide is still
struggling to escape from the financial and moral damage done by the Bhopal
disaster six years ago.
The company will also have a lot in common with two other American chemical
giants, Du Pont and Dow Chemical, which have spun off their pharmaceutical
companies but still have substantial agrochemical operations.

FT  31 JUL 92 / The Breakup of ICI: Unions will campaign against the
demerger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S biggest trade union yesterday denounced ICI's plans and said it
and other trade unions would campaign to dissuade the group against such a
move.
Mr Fred Higgs, national secretary of the TGWU, said: 'ICI is trying to
pacify the short-term demands of the City rather than address the long-term
health of the business.'
Mr Higgs said the demerger proposal presented a major threat to employment.
The plan would effectively isolate and leave exposed those businesses which
would find it difficult to survive the current recession without being part
of a large and diverse group.
Trade unions and ICI's management have enjoyed a good relationship. They
campaigned together last year against the threatened hostile bid by Hanson
Group.
Mr Higgs said the trade unions accepted the need for certain
rationalisations at ICI, but they believed that in the absence of a vigorous
acquisition policy ICI was effectively contracting the business.
In May, unions representing UK employees of ICI's fibres business met to
discuss the company's divestment policy.
Union concern had been heightened by the announcement that ICI was to swap
its European fibres operations for the acrylics businesses of Du Pont, the
US chemicals group. Du Pont, which is to take on ICI fibres employees under
the deal, was also paying Pounds 250m.

FT  31 JUL 92 / The Breakup of ICI: Pharmaceuticals division entering flat
period after decade of success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF ICI Bioscience were demerged this year, it would account for 31 per cent
of the group's sales - and 70 per cent of its profits and research spending.
ICI Bio will take the fast-growing, science-based businesses that have
propped up ICI's fortunes during the recession of the last two years.
The international company closest in shape to ICI Bio is Ciba-Geigy of
Switzerland, which is also dominated by a large and profitable
pharmaceutical business and a large and less profitable agrochemical
business, with a scattering of smaller specialist chemical activities.
Monsanto of the US and Sandoz of Switzerland are other international
chemical groups with a biological orientation similar to ICI Bio.
The pharmaceutical division was ICI's most successful operation in the last
decade. It has not only shared in the general prosperity of the
international drugs industry but also contributed some best-sellers of its
own, particularly to treat heart disease and cancer.
However, most analysts believe the current, rapid growth of ICI
Pharmaceuticals is over. Indeed, the half-yearly results announced yesterday
show that drug sales and profits are up only marginally on 1991. The best
that Mr Ronnie Hampel, ICI chief operating officer, could say was: 'We
continue to expect pharmaceuticals to perform over the whole year at a level
approaching that of last year.'
Pharmaceutical sales are suffering from the expiry last year of US patent
protection on Tenormin, ICI's best-selling heart drug. Already 30 per cent
of Tenormin prescriptions have been replaced by its cheaper generic version,
atenolol.
ICI did at least expect to lose Tenormin revenues. This year's unexpected
blow was the withdrawal, because of side-effects, of Temafloxacin, the
antibiotic which the company licensed from Abbott of the US in order to fill
a gap in its product line.
On the positive side, sales of ICI's three newest drugs - Zestril (heart),
Zoladex (cancer) and Diprivan (anaesthetic) - are all up by more than a
third this year. And Dr Tom McKillop, technical director of ICI
Pharmaceuticals, says the company has 'a very strong portfolio' of drugs at
various stages of development, with about 10 in clinical trials. These could
give ICI Pharmaceuticals a new burst of growth in the late 1990s after a
relatively flat period.
However successful the new drugs are, ICI Bio may find it difficult to keep
the pharmaceuticals business running independently as a medium-sized player
in an increasingly competitive global industry.
ICI is only number 17 in the world league of drug companies in terms of
sales. Analysts predict it will have to link up with a competitor - through
merger, acquisition or a comprehensive global alliance - in order to
maintain strength in research, development and marketing. Last year there
was speculation about an ICI-Wellcome combination, which would make
strategic sense, and both the recent Wellcome share sale and proposed
demerger of ICI Bio would make this easier.
Although restructuring is on the agenda for the international pharmaceutical
business, it is a more urgent priority for the agrochemicals industry in
which ICI is the world's second largest player after Ciba-Geigy. Curbs on
agricultural production, especially in Europe, are reducing sales of farm
chemicals and leading to overcapacity. ICI Agrochemicals has a strong
scientific and marketing base but its prospects do not look bright.
ICI Seeds is still a much smaller business than agrochemicals but it has
better growth prospects. The company is developing a range of genetically
engineered seeds for crops ranging from non-squashy tomatoes to
herbicide-resistant corn.
Other promising ICI Bio businesses include Quorn, the fungal food, and
Biopol, a biodegradable plastic made by bacteria.

FT  31 JUL 92 / H&amp;C rises 12% after cost-cutting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE IS trading in croissants for breakfast cereal, helping Harrisons &amp;
Crosfield, the chemicals, building supplies, food and agriculture company to
report interim pre-tax profits 12 per cent higher at Pounds 40.6m.
'They have at long last discovered breakfast cereal,' said Mr George Paul,
chief executive. The group's breakfast cereal factory in northern France had
performed 'excellently' in the first half and would be expanded, he said.
The main impetus to profits, however, appeared to be a combination of
cost-cutting and a 67 per cent improvement in H&amp;C's traditional plantations
business.
Higher palm oil prices helped this division to increase operating profits
Pounds 3.4m to Pounds 8.5m.
Mr John Maltby, chairman, said the group had seen no sign of an upturn in
the UK, although there were slight signs of recovery in the US. Group
turnover fell 4 per cent to Pounds 873m for the six months to June 30.
The dividend was maintained at 3.6p, barely covered by earnings of 3.7p
(3.6p) per share.
Mr Paul defended the group's decision to maintain the dividend. 'We are not
trying to send any signal except confidence,' he said.
Mr Bill Turcan, finance director, said the group could contain a maintained
total dividend for the year of 9p, without exceeding its gearing target of
about 60 per cent. Gearing at the half-year was 56 per cent.
Harrisons' timber and building supplies business showed a resilient
performance in the US and the Republic of Ireland, and operating profits of
that division rose 13 per cent to Pounds 11.1m.
The chemicals division rose 5 per cent to Pounds 17.2m, while food and
agriculture fell from Pounds 16m to Pounds 14.8m. The latter division was
lower because of the sale of a savoury flavours business at the beginning of
the year and a decline in malt deliveries.
The integration costs of BOCM-Silcock, the animals feeds business purchased
for Pounds 67m in April, would come to Pounds 16m, said Mr Turcan. He added
however, that the costs would be recovered through the sale of assets and
sites. There would be no effect on the profit and loss account, he said.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Walbrook salvage plan rejected by creditors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WALBROOK Insurance, the insurer and reinsurer which has net liabilities of
Pounds 170m, has failed to gain approval from its creditors for a proposed
package to stave off liquidation.
The collapse of the agreement raises the prospect of a call on the funds of
the Policyholders' Protection Board, the UK insurance industry safety net,
and exposes creditors to liquidation procedures before any assets are
recovered.
Walbrook, which is a subsidiary of London United Investments, a property and
investment company placed in administration in 1990, was one of the leading
insurers and reinsurers of US liability business in the London market during
the 1980s. It covered US doctors, hospitals, accountants and lawyers, and
their insurers, against legal awards for negligence.
The company said yesterday: 'The level of support for the directors'
proposals, while encouraging, was insufficient to continue developing the
plan even though the number of those replying adversely was small.'
The news followed a deadline last Friday for the proposal to receive
non-binding approval from sufficient creditors to cover net liabilities and
a safety margin totalling Dollars 814m (Pounds 425m). It is believed that
about 90 of the 200 main policyholders, representing about Dollars 500m,
voted in favour.
The main policyholders owed more than Dollars 1m each in outstanding claims
were asked to accept a plan which would have left the directors to run an
informal plan of arrangement. They would have received a 100 per cent
dividend but immediately returned 60 per cent in exchange for redeemable
preference shares. Other creditors would have been paid in full.
However, some creditors, including Transit Casualty, a Missouri-based
insurance company which went into receivership in 1985, said provisional
liquidation would be quicker and cheaper. Transit has brought a winding-up
petition in the High Court in London which proposes the appointment of a
provisional liquidator.
The directors may still attempt to create a scheme of arrangement which
would allow them to remain in charge of Walbrook.
However, the scheme will need to be approved by 75 per cent of creditors by
value, and it is likely that Walbrook will be forced to appoint a
provisional liquidator.
Unpublished 1991 accounts for Walbrook show underwriting losses of Pounds
178.5m, and negative net assets of Pounds 170m after new estimates of Pounds
461m for outstanding claims and claims incurred but not reported were drawn
up in April. It has gross liabilities of more than Dollars 2bn.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Midland head warns of soft recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANY recovery for the banking industry will 'feel much like recession', Mr
Brian Pearse, chief executive of Midland Group warned yesterday.
However, his bank, recently acquired by Hongkong Banking Corporation, has
returned to profit in the six months to June 30. It made a pre-tax profit of
Pounds 89m, compared with a Pounds 71m loss in the comparable period. But
the profit in the most recent half is less than the Pounds 107m before tax
made in the second half of 1991.
Mr Pearse also gave details of the group's new management structure and said
that, as part of the Hongkong Bank, Midland would push to increase its share
of the UK banking market.
The regional structure for UK branch banking is being changed to devolve
considerable management power to new regional units. The bank has appointed
five regional general managers: for London, the Midlands, the North, the
South and Wales.
The effects of the recession on Midland have altered in recent months. The
charge for bad debts has fallen from Pounds 530m to Pounds 355m. However,
this has been partly offset by a 5.1 per cent drop in group income to Pounds
1.59bn.
Midland's customers have been making fewer banking transactions, reducing
fees and commissions paid, and the bank has also cut the volume of loans.
Mr Pearse said the fall in the bad debt charge was largely due to an
improving trend for personal customers. The corporate bad debt charge of
Pounds 249m was only Pounds 1m less than in the second half of last year,
and was mainly attributable to small companies.
The property and construction industries suffered most, contributing 54.3
per cent of the total corporate charge.
Mr Pearse did not expect a rapid improvement in bad debts. He said the
number of companies looked after by the bank's 'intensive care unit' had
fallen during the past six months. But he said that 'those in intensive care
are in a worse state than before'.
He also said: 'When recovery comes, it will not feel much different from
recession.' He expected companies would continue to collapse in the early
stages of recovery, and was concerned that customers would spend less and
borrow less.
Midland is not paying a dividend, because of the transfer of ownership to
Hongkong Bank. Its shares will, however, continue to be traded for a short
while and yesterday they closed unchanged at 467p.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Honecker charged in Berlin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE COLITT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR ERICH HONECKER, the former East German leader, was charged yesterday on
49 counts of manslaughter after his extradition from Moscow on Wednesday.
The 79-year-old ex-communist leader was charged in connection with the
shooting by border guards of 49 would-be refugees at the Berlin Wall and
other parts of the frontier with West Germany between 1961 and 1989.
Mr Honecker was also charged with breach of trust in connection with the
privileges enjoyed by the communist leadership at its compound in Wandlitz
outside Berlin. The East German treasury, the charge sheet said, lost
DM15.5m (Pounds 5.4m) in hard currency during 1988 and 1989 alone.
Mr Honecker's lawyer, Mr Friedrich Wolff, described his client as 'very
shaken' after the hearing. Carrying his trademark fedora hat, Mr Honecker
smiled wanly at his lawyer and shook his hand after the hearing.
He was returned to the hospital of Berlin's Moabit detention prison. Mr
Honecker was once imprisoned in Moabit by the Nazis as a young communist
militant. The former leader was examined by prison doctors, who found him in
good health for a man of his age.
Mr Helmut Kohl, the chancellor, advised of Mr Honecker's return, said: 'It
was about time. Now the trial can begin.'
Mr Wolff said his client had no chance of a fair trial because reunited
Germany had already found him guilty. The lawyer, who once defended East
German dissidents, said the uproar surrounding Mr Honecker's return from
Moscow after 16 months as a fugitive made it almost impossible to stage an
effective defence.
'Honecker has been tried in public and by the media and has been found
guilty,' Mr Wolff told reporters. 'A fair trial is not possible when one
considers how he has already been prejudged.'
Former East German officials put on trial for manslaughter or fraud so far
have been acquitted or given light suspended sentences.
Mr Wolff said his client had refused to leave the compound of the Chilean
embassy in Moscow after hearing on Wednesday that the Chilean government no
longer desired his presence. Russian security men then entered the embassy
and told him to leave - a move Mr Wolff described as a breach of
international law.
Meanwhile, Mr Honecker's wife, Margot, left Moscow on a flight for Chile,
according to the Itar-Tass news agency.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Wine levy row leads France to block EC VAT plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE is to block adoption of this week's provisional accord on European
Community value added tax and excise duties rather than upset its farmers
before the September referendum on the Maastricht treaty.
The British presidency of the EC had hoped to break down outstanding French
objections to Monday's deal by midnight last night. But France said
yesterday it would not abandon its demand that EC members should impose a
tiny 'control levy' on their wine producers and needed more time to discuss
the issue.
According to French officials in Brussels, France's nominal duty of Ecu3 -
about Pounds 2.15 - per 100 litres of wine helps it monitor the quality of
wine production. The small amount of administration involved means
wine-growers have to operate in a reasonably business-like way. France is
alone in wanting the same system to apply to countries such as Germany and
Italy, which under EC proposals could continue to exempt their wine from
duty.
The French stand appears to be based on a point of principle and on a desire
to avoid aggravating tense relations with its farmers before the September
20 referendum. French wine-growers are said to be worried about imports of
low-quality 'unmonitored' wine from Italy, for example.
Monday's late-night meeting of EC finance ministers came within a hair's
breadth of the required unanimous agreement on a complex package of eight
indirect tax directives. The French stand will delay formal adoption of
Monday's breakthrough deal until the next meeting on September 28.
A legally binding agreement on indirect tax - including a minimum standard
VAT rate - is regarded as a prerequisite for the barrier-free single market.
Although British officials said they were disappointed and 'flummoxed' by
France's intransigence, they do not believe it will put the whole package at
risk or delay the lifting of frontier controls on January 1 1993. 'I think
we would all look a bit foolish if the whole deal were to break down over
Ecu3 per hectolitre of wine,' said one UK official.
France also has reservations about the proposed minimum duty on mineral
oils, which it believes is too low, and about plans to allow Germany and the
Netherlands to maintain reduced rates of VAT for flowers and other
agricultural products.
Reduced rates were lifted in France last year on the understanding that
other EC member states would have to follow suit. French objections on these
points are less fundamental than its call for an EC-wide wine levy.
The dispute between Britain and Spain over the taxing of sherry is also
unresolved, despite further bilateral talks yesterday. Spain wants Britain
to bring the duty on British sherry in line with that on the Spanish
product, which is taxed more heavily.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Compulsory metering of water backed by minister for first
time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPOSALS for compulsory metering of household water won vigorous support
yesterday from Mr Michael Howard, secretary of state for the environment -
the first time a minister has given formal backing to such a move.
He noted the cost of installing household meters in England and Wales,
estimated at up to Pounds 3bn, 'would ultimately have to be borne by the
consumer' but said that this 'would be spread over many years'.
Metering would probably lead to lower water bills than at present for small
households, while large households would see their bills rise, according to
the Department of the Environment's consultation paper on the efficient use
of water, published yesterday. Mr Howard added that the impact of metering
'on poor families clearly needs attention'.
The DoE paper attracted sharp criticism from Mr Chris Smith, opposition
spokesman for environmental protection. He said that under pilot schemes in
areas such as Blackburn, 'metering has nearly doubled water bills for large
families with children'.
The DoE paper sees an urgent need - particularly after four dry winters in
the south east - to curb growth in demand for water which is running at
about 1 per cent a year.
The report says households in England and Wales, accounting for 54 per cent
of water use, are key to reducing demand. It says trials show household
metering leads to a 13 per cent fall in water use overall and a 20 per cent
cut at peak times.
Very few houses have meters - most water bills still being calculated on the
rateable value of each house. However, water companies have been told to
find other ways of charging their customers by the end of the century.
Water companies have the power to insist on fitting meters, but have done so
on only a small number of new buildings.
The DoE suggests that Ofwat, the regulatory authority, should be given
powers to approve water companies' choice of charging method. Mr Ian Byatt,
Ofwat director-general, welcomed that suggestion, adding: 'I am pleased to
see that the paper supports the case for metering.'
The report says measures to reduce demand should include a close look at
possible water recycling by industrial companies, which use a quarter of the
country's water.
A further quarter of the country's water is lost through leakage between the
water mains and the customer, according to the DoE, which wants water
companies to investigate the cost of finding and plugging these leaks.
Water companies are committed to spending Pounds 28bn by the end of the
decade on improving the quality and volume of water supplies.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Europe's satellite makers are knocked out of orbit: US
manufacturers have been able to achieve economies of scale and undercut
rivals across the Atlantic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's satellite manufacturers have been left languishing on the launch
pad by US rivals which are establishing dominance over the rapidly expanding
industry.
Over the past 18 months, only two of 27 international civil
telecommunications satellite contracts went to European contractors. In
Europe's deregulated satellite television market, six new satellites have
been ordered, all American.
Abandoned by their customers, European companies are being forced to
restructure. British Aerospace last month cut 600 jobs - about half the
workforce - at its Stevenage satellite-manufacturing plant. This week,
Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) said it was interested in acquiring the satellite
division, which has not won a new order since last year.
To succeed, Dasa will have to beat off Matra-Marconi, a joint venture
between GEC of the UK and Matra of France which has stalked BAe's space
business since last year.
The Matra-Marconi alliance was itself created as a response to the 'growing
intensity of competition in space markets', says Mr Richard Wignall, its
deputy managing director.
Dasa's German rival ANT, the space subsidiary of Bosch, has also been in
talks to join forces with Matra-Marconi. But even a three-way alliance
between BAe, Matra-Marconi and ANT would be only half the size of Hughes
Aircraft, the General Motors subsidiary that is the world's biggest
telecommunications satellite maker.
Even France, Europe's leader in space industries, has felt the pressure.
Alcatel invested between Dollars 30m and Dollars 50m (Pounds 15.7m-Pounds
26m) over the past three years in a new telecommunications technology - very
small aperture terminals (VSATs), which reduce the size of dish needed for
satellite communications. Earlier this year it abandoned the project,
blaming US competition. Alcatel now plans to market VSATs made by Hughes.
The divergent fortunes on either side of the Atlantic are largely the result
of US military spending and other government contracts. This has provided a
stream of orders and allowed US satellite makers to achieve economies of
scale. They have thus been able to undercut European rivals by up to 40 per
cent in contract tenders.
The size of the US industry and the importance of defence expenditure is
clear in 'Aerospace Alley', an area surrounding the offices of the United
States Air Force Space Systems Division in El Segundo, central Los Angeles.
The division is devoted to procurement and has an annual budget of more than
Dollars 7bn. Total US government space spending is four times that figure,
and six times the combined amount spent by Europe's governments.
Big money in US defence has created big companies. Hughes Aircraft, one of
El Segundo's defence contractors, employs about 9,000 people working on a
satellite order book worth about Dollars 3bn. It has the world's only mass
production line for telecommunications satellites.
The defence contracts which fuelled the growth of Hughes and its El Segundo
neighbours have so far remained secure in spite of cuts in US defence
spending. In particular, long-term projects - such as the Defence
Department's 24-satellite Global Positioning System which allowed General
Norman Schwarzkopf to navigate across a featureless desert in the Gulf war
last year - are yet to be completed.
Fears of a decline in military contracts however, have, pushed US
manufacturers into the civil sector. 'Four years ago, we did 85 per cent of
our business with US government agencies,' says Mr Steve Dorfman, president
of Hughes Aircraft's Space Systems division. 'Now it is nearer 50-50.'
This shift is visible across the US industry. TRW, another El Segundo
satellite manufacturer, with annual sales of Dollars 3bn, is proposing to
build a 12-satellite global mobile telephone network. Motorola, the
electronics and cellular telephone company, plans to put 77 miniature
satellites into orbit to provide a similar service.
The US manufacturers' move into the civil sector is well timed. More civil
satellite contracts are going to open tender and are not restricted to
domestic manufacturers. The world market for civil telecommunications
satellites, for example, worth about Dollars 8bn in the 1980s, will almost
double in the next decade, says Euroconsult, the Paris-based space
consultancy
Over the next few years, the biggest buyers on the open market are likely to
be the international communications co-operatives, Intelsat, Inmarsat and
Eutelsat. These organisations, owned by national telecommunications bodies
such as British Telecom, Deutsche Bundespost and AT&amp;T, provide most of the
world's satellite telecommunications links. They owe no national
allegiances, and are free to buy from anyone.
European manufacturers fear that this freedom will result in more orders for
US rivals. In response they are demanding protective measures. Eurospace,
their trade association, has called for a 'comprehensive, collective space
policy' in Europe to help 'resist foreign domination'. It seeks preferential
treatment in international tenders from European satellite buyers.
But protection is unlikely to provide a solution. Import controls are out of
the question because satellites do not legally cross any frontiers. Even if
such a policy could be enforced, international telecommunications
co-operatives remain free from obligations to buy from particular suppliers.
European satellite makers can rely on a trickle of orders from their own
governments. BAe, for example, is expecting to win a Ministry of Defence
contract for the Skynet IV military communications satellite. And there
would still be some subcontracting work for US-based companies: Inmarsat's
latest generation of satellites is being built by GE-Astro of the US with
Matra-Marconi making the radio equipment.
But for Europe's satellite industry this is survival in the second division
and, in an industry where size is increasingly what counts, probably
unsustainable.
The response from senior executives in many European satellite companies is
to seek co-operation and alliances with their American rivals.
Some deals have already been struck. Alcatel and Aerospatiale of France,
together with Alenia of Italy, last year paid Dollars 182m for a 49 per cent
stake in Space Systems/Loral, the commercial satellite business of defence
contractor Loral, the third-biggest US satellite maker.
Last month, Dasa, the aerospace arm of Daimler Benz of Germany, paid Dollars
57m for its own 12 per cent stake in Space Systems/Loral.
More alliances are likely to be formed over the next few years as European
companies fight for a share of the growing market. For Mr Olof Lundberg,
director-general of Inmarsat, they have little choice. 'In Europe, there is
clearly too much satellite manufacturing capacity. A restructuring is
inevitable,' he says.

FT  31 JUL 92 / A long road to reform: The process behind the proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Phoenix, Arizona, was the unlikely setting for the start of one of the most
fundamental restructurings to have shaken the UK chemical industry. Sir
Denys Henderson, ICI's chairman, was visiting the city in October 1989 when
his company's third-quarter results were telephoned through.
'I went ho-hum. They weren't bad, but they weren't as robust as they should
have been. Something clearly had to be done,' says Sir Denys. He rang Mr
Colin Short in San Francisco to ask the former treasurer of Chevron, the US
oil company, if he would consider becoming ICI's finance director.
Mr Short accepted and, after a brief discussion, the two concluded the group
required radical cost-cutting. Shortly afterwards a review of the group's
structure was begun.
Ever since September 1986, when the company announced that its four bulk
chemicals divisions were to be merged, there have been reports that ICI
would float off its plastics and petrochemicals divisions.
The need for a strategy review became increasingly apparent. 'The world
economy was sliding into recession. It was getting nastier and deeper,' says
Sir Denys.
Two study groups were set up in September 1990. One, under Mr Ronnie Hampel,
ICI's chief operating officer, was given the task of examining the group's
organisation. The other, under Mr Tom Hutchison, a board director since
1985, was to look at strategy.
Mr Hutchison's strategy group concluded ICI did not have enough resources to
finance all its activities. Its report led to a restructuring plan announced
in February 1991. The group also began actively considering hiving off parts
of the company. A hint that such measures were being considered was given in
the 1990 annual report when Sir Denys said the board would 'pursue with
vigour the reshaping of the ICI group still more radically in the years
ahead'.
But, says Sir Denys, 'we all became rather distracted from the process when
a certain gentleman took a considerable minority shareholding'. He was
referring to Lord Hanson, whose company bought 2.8 per cent of ICI's shares
in May 1991.
At the end of that year, Sir Denys rang Sir David Scholey, chairman of ICI's
advisers, S G Warburg. He asked him to provide someone who would approach
the group restructuring with a financial and City perspective. Sir David
chose Mr John Mayo, a 36-year-old corporate finance director at Warburg.
For the next two weeks Mr Mayo read hundreds of ICI policy documents.
Working with a small team of ICI planners, he examined about 40 well-thought
out proposals. Of these 12 were practical, but only one was outstanding,
says Mr Mayo.
By April, that outstanding plan was put to the executive directors and then
the non-executive board members. The main board agreed the plans on Tuesday.
Yesterday ICI announced one of the largest restructurings of the European
chemicals industry since the Allies broke up I G Farben at the end of the
second world war.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Arts: Sawallisch bows out in Munich - Summer Festivals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER nearly quarter of a century at the centre of Munich's operatic life,
Wolfgang Sawallisch is leaving - and the city has suddenly begun to suffer
withdrawal symptoms. In an otherwise unexceptional July Opera Festival,
Sawallisch's performances alone captured the festival spirit - not just his
mature, fresh-minted Wagner, Strauss and Mozart, but his surprising decision
to bow out with a modern work: Henze's Der Prinz von Homburg.
Sawallisch became music director of the Bavarian State Opera in 1971 and
quickly established a close working relationship with Gunther Rennert. Had
he been able to find a suitable partner after Rennert's death, he might not
be leaving now. It was his rivalry and incompatibility with Rennert's
eventual successor, August Everding, which led him to seek the post of
overall director in the early 1980s - a role to which he was temperamentally
unsuited. Sawallisch could not handle the political side of the job, he had
little success as an artistic planner and was dogged by bad luck. The past
ten years have effectively soured his relationship with his home city, and
apart from a handful of performances in September it is doubtful whether he
will ever again conduct opera in Munich.
Anyone who has experienced a Sawallisch evening in the National or
Cuvillies-Theater must realise this is a tragedy. Despite his imminent move
to the Philadelphia Orchestra (and EMI's attempt to sell him as a recording
star), he remains a theatre conductor at heart. He is one of a select group
of conductors who can transform a performance, no matter how moribund the
staging. His relationship with the Bavarian State Orchestra is one of
implicit trust and mutual inspiration, built up over years of intensive
work.
Sawallisch's Munich performances always carried an air of musical substance
from start to finish - a special cogency, an unmistakable stamp of on-going,
unshowy German tradition, whether in Meistersinger or Arabella, Cardillac or
Palestrina. Such qualities - increasingly scarce as conductors take the fast
route to fame on the international circuit - have been taken for granted in
Munich in recent years, but they proved crucial to the success of the new
Henze production.
Der Prinz von Homburg, premiered in Hamburg in 1960, remains one of Henze's
least known stage works (a British company has yet to tackle it, though the
BBC broadcast a studio performance in 1989). Judging by this well-cast
production in the Cuvillies-Theater, staged by Nikolaus Lehnhoff and
designed by Gottfried Pilz, it is also one of his most eloquent and
aesthetically pleasing. Henze and his librettist Ingeborg Bachmann turn
Kleist's early 19th century tale of Prussian militarism into a dream play:
the Prince inhabits the stage like a universal somnambulist, treading the
dangerous tight-rope between dream and reality, state power and individual
freedom, duty and feeling.
Despite its unfashionably utopian ending, the opera has lost none of its
contemporary relevance. Nor has the music dated. The score is notable for
its richly poignant lyricism, its emotional power, its plasticity and swift
durchkomponiert quality, transcending the episodic nature of the stage
drama. All the effects are precise, piquant and refreshingly
un-Expressionist - particularly the dappled instrumental tapestries at the
opening and close, and the brilliant crescendo to the Act one finale. No
meandering, no overladen textures, no dogmatic serialism - though the
transparent clarity of the Munich production owed something to Henze's
re-editing of the score, resulting in a pruning of wind, percussion and
chorus parts.
The performance itself was mesmerising. Sawallisch's command of Henze's
idiom, his elucidation of the work's structural complexity and animation of
its rhythmic undertow, suggested thorough preparation and commitment.
Lehnhoff's staging was equally perceptive. It focused exclusively on the
poetic symbolism of the drama, unfolding in a semi-circular stage-tower
behind a misty blue gauze - an isolated, abstract world, monumental and
simple. The only props were three tables, positioned in line or strewn about
the stage to evoke council of war, battle and prison. The costumes were
austere period suits and gowns; the lighting exquisite.
Francois Le Roux's idealistic young Prince made a strong,
handsomely-declaimed centrepiece. William Cochran brought gravity and mature
poise to the Elector of Brandenburg. Claes Ahnsjo was the highly sympathetic
Count Hohenzollern. Helga Dernesch lent the shadowy Electress a welcome size
of personality, while the blossoming Mari Anne Haggander really tugged the
heart in Natalie's plea for the Prince's pardon.
The Bavarian State Opera now faces ten months of upheaval, camping out in
Munich's underused older halls and theatres while its main home, the
National Theater, undergoes repairs to the stage hydraulics. Peter Schneider
arrives as music director in January, and Peter Jonas takes up the post of
intendant at the beginning of the 1993-4 season. Sawallisch's final duty
will be to take the company on tour in November to Japan. The fact that he
has chosen to leave the company with a new production of Die Frau ohne
Schatten in Tokyo and not in Munich shows where his sympathies now lie.

Either woman would have snatched a bronze if she had gone clear after New

from grace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EXPULSION of three of Britain's Olympic competitors following positive
drug tests has provoked a burst of outrage and indignation from UK
politicians.
British sports minister Robert Key said he was 'horrified' and claimed that
there would be 'no hiding place' for cheats.
Lord Howell (formerly Labour sports minister Denis Howell) said: 'There can
be no athlete in the country unaware of the dangers of taking forbidden
substances, and I only wish every other nation behaved in such a decisive
manner as we have done.'
The three athletes - Jason Livingston, a sprinter, and weightlifters Andrew
Saxton and Andrew Davies - were snared in random tests conducted by the
Sports Council, Britain's umbrella sports organisation, prior to the Games.
All three were sent home before having a chance to compete in Barcelona.
Livingston, 21, who was entered in the 100 metres and 100m relay, tested
positive for the anabolic steroid Methandianone. He was known as 'Baby Ben'
by other British sprinters because of his resemblance to his hero, Canadian
sprinter Ben Johnson.
The Canadian was stripped of the 100m gold medal at the Seoul Games four
years ago after failing his drug test.
Saxton and Davies, both 25, gave test samples containing Clenbuterol, a
banned stimulant.
International sport is threatened by a wave of new-generation
performance-enhancing drugs, often difficult to detect.
Ironically, Britain has long claimed a pioneering role in fighting drug
abuse, and has repeatedly called on the International Olympic Committee to
toughen its stance against cheats.
The three have a right of appeal, but face being banned. Dick Palmer,
Britain's Olympic chef de mission, said the scandal had caused 'emotional
distress' to the three competitors, the administrators and to the rest of
Britain's 400-strong team.
Livingston was tested on July 15. He was told he had tested positive three
days ago and was told to return to Britain. Palmer said Livingston 'took the
news very quietly'.
Davies was tested on July 10, Saxton the following day. Both were 'very
upset', said Palmer.
The weightlifters admitted they had taken Clenbuterol. The substance is
banned in the UK but is available elsewhere, including Germany, as a
treatment for asthma. According to Palmer, Saxton said he took it for his
asthma and gave it to Davies later.
Livingston equalled the European 60m indoor record last February and lowered
his 100m personal best to 10.09sec early this summer. He stood a good chance
of a medal as part of the British 100m relay team.
Saxton was a weightlifting outsider, but Davies was runner-up in his class
in the world championships in 1989 and Commonwealth champion the next year.
Since then his results have been less impressive.
During the Olympics, drugs tests are normally completed within 48 hours.
Palmer said these British tests had taken so long because of a backlog. The
Sports Council had tested 1,050 samples in the last six months.
Palmer said that he would have preferred the results to have been known
before the Olympics. That way, the matter could have been dealt with by the
British governing bodies of the two sports and 'we could have avoided the
spotlight here.'
He added that all the Sports Council tests had been completed and that none
of the others was positive. He said: 'We are determined to carry on
continual and continuous out-of-competition testing: our job is to stop
drug-taking.'
John Carlisle, chairman of the Conservative backbench sports committee at
Westminster, said it was well known that 'a lot of top athletes are using
drugs.'
He said it was to the credit of the British Olympic Association that it had
taken the decision to send the three home.

FT  31 JUL 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Red faces on Britain's blackest day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The British Olympic Association's vigorous anti-drugs policy left it in an
embarrassing position yesterday. It caught three of its own team and had to
expel them from the Games in the glare of world attention.
The three - sprinter Jason Livingston and weightlifters Andrew Davies and
Andrew Saxton - had been tested as part of the BOA's random drugs testing
programme. Competitors are tested without notice at training or at home. The
first they know about it is often a knock at the door.
Livingston was the best-known of the three, because athletics is such a
high-profile sport. Livingston, from London, was second in the world junior
championships in 1990. After that it seemed that he failed to grow enough to
realise his promise. He was 5ft 6in in a sport where a good big 'un always
beats good little 'uns.
This year, however, Livingston's performances improved sharply. He equalled
the European 60m record and cut his 100m best to 10.09secs. His short,
stocky build made him look a bit like Ben Johnson, the hulking Canadian who
finished first in the 100m in Seoul but then failed a drug test and was
dubbed sport's biggest-ever cheat.
Livingston shaved his head to emphasise his resemblance to Johnson. Linford
Christie, Britain's 100m silver medallist in Seoul and Livingston's training
partner, even nicknamed him 'Baby Ben.' The official games profile says that
Livingston 'imitates the way Johnson starts and his room is full of posters
of the Candian.' It seems that imitation went to far.
Livingston's disgrace was seen as good news in some quarters. Bob Inglis
said yesterday that he resigned as Britain's national sprint event coach
after the 1990 Commonwealth Games in Auckland. 'On the basis of what I could
see, I anticipated this kind of situation and I wanted to distance myself
from the sport.
"There will be other sprinters with higher levels of anxiety than yesterday,
and not just in the British team.' The world of sprinting, said Inglis, was
'pretty unsavoury.'
'In the last ten years I have found no legitimate way to move sprinters into
the area of performance you see regularly on television.'
Inglis said it was possible to guess which athletes were using drugs. 'When
you see no body fat and when you take that with the improvement of times
over 12 months you can have a reasonable guess.'
Dick Palmer, British Olympic chef de mission, was at pains to stress
yesterday that Britain's drugs testing programme was not a mechanism for
ensuring that drug-takers were clean before the Games, but was intended to
eliminate drug use.
Yesterday, Primo Niebolo, president of the International Amateur Athletics
Federation, claimed the federation was doing its best. 'We are making a
great battle but there are too few laboratories in the world. There are none
in Africa, just three in Asia and only one in South America.'
Tony Ward, of the British Athletic Federation, called on the IAAF and the
International Olympic Committee to establish an international random drugs
testing programme. Soon, sportsmen and women everywhere could hear a knock
on the door.
Prior to yesterday, Britain's sports associations professed pride in their
relatively clean records.
In 1989 Britain was a signatory to the Europan Anti-Doping Convention, which
agreed on the need to introduce random, out-of-competition testing without
advance warning.
Earlier this month, Wally Holland, secretary of the British Amateur
Weightlifting Association, said he believed Britain was 'getting on top' of
steroid abuse in weightlifting, generally regarded as the sport in which
drug use is most prevalent.
In international weightlifting competitions now, Holland says that up to 40
per cent of competitors are tested. But he has also admitted that the
temptations of new types of drugs are enormous.
'The trouble is keeping up with new methods of doping. If I came up with a
new drug tomorrow that would increase chances of winning, but also had
chances of killing a competitor, I would still find plenty of people willing
to take it.'
Clenbuterol, the drug that put Andrew Saxton and Andrew Davies out of
Olympic competition, is one of the most popular of a new generation of
performance-enhancing drugs. It was originally developed as an asthma
medication. Despite Saxton's and Davies' contentions that they employed it
to relieve bronchial conditions, its main interest to athletes lies in two
key qualities.
The first is its fat-burning ability. In its chemical composition
Clenbuterol, a non-steroid drug, is related to adrenalin, a hormone
naturally secreted by the body. Like adrenalin - which is released only in
periods of stress - Clenbuterol stimulates the burning of large quantities
of fatty acids in the blood.
Clenbuterol also has strong anabolic, muscle-building properties. Without
the side effects of steroids - hair loss, acne and testicular shrinking - it
has a stronger effect than many steroids and pays a quick muscle-building
bonus.
Although there is general condemnation of drug abuse, there are individuals
within many groups who have an interest in keeping drug abuse under cover:
athletes and their trainers, sports federations and national sports
committees wanting to avoid embarrassment, and commercial sponsors and
advertisers.
To work, say reformers, testing must be fairly and uniformly applied by all
national and international sporting bodies.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Technology: US brewers go alcohol free - The reasons why
American companies are intent on developing the fastest growing part of the
beer market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After a late start in the non-alcoholic brewing business, American beer
companies are catching up fast with their European competitors as a result
of a determined drive.
Until 1989, the US non-alcoholic beer market was occupied almost exclusively
by European imports. A few years ago, Heileman, Miller and Anheuser-Busch
marketed their first non-alcohol products, and the US brewers have been
swiftly and single mindedly gaining market share at home ever since.
As a result, all the chief US groups now offer non-alcoholic beers. Coors
and Stroh launched their own brands last year, and even small American
brewers are starting to get in on the act.
The reason for the new love affair with non-alcoholic brews can be simply
stated: the fact is that in a stagnant market, non-alcoholic and low-calorie
beers are expected to provide the only real growth in the industry during
the next few years.
'No-alcohol and low-calorie beer are the only parts of the beer market that
are really growing fast,' says Julie Dulow, a spokesperson for Coors. 'The
non-alcoholic market is expected to be up 40 per cent next year.'
Although that would still represent scarcely a drop in the bucket compared
to the overall beer market - non-alcoholic beer accounts for less than 1 per
cent of total sales - it may help provide expansion room for an otherwise
stagnant industry.
The campaign in both Europe and the US against drink-driving and the trend
to a healthier lifestyle make non-alcoholic beer a real attraction for
consumers.
Ron Siebel, a beer market consultant in Chicago, thinks that non-alcoholic
beers have an important edge over other non-alcoholic products.
'If you take the alcohol out of beer and you produce it right,' he argues,
'you will have a beverage that will taste like a beer. You can't make a
non-alcoholic wine because if you did, you'd have grape juice; and if you
had a non-alcoholic spirit you'd have water.'
Even if it is granted that non-alcoholic beer may be much easier to make
than non-alcoholic wine, American brewing companies have found that taking
the alcohol out while leaving the taste in is no mean feat. According to
industry standards, non-alcoholic beer must contain less than 0.5 per cent
alcohol.
In taste tests, consumers still say that non-alcoholic beer often has a
sweet or watered-down quality. The technology has been improving, and the
American brewers are starting to come up with their own methods.
'The Europeans have been at the (non-alcoholic) game longer, but the
Americans have quickly moved to the cutting edge of new technologies in the
market,' said Joseph Owades, a technical beer consultant who credits himself
with concocting the first light beer in 1967.
Stroh has come up with a new, patented method to produce its Old Milwaukee
NA brand. The process, enigmatically dubbed the Alfa-Laval Centritherm
method, uses centrifugal force to separate the alcohol.
One of the problems with non-alcoholic beer has been the unwanted but
hitherto seemingly inevitable loss in taste which is a result of the heat
which is applied to the mixture during distillation. Stroh's method applies
a lower temperature more briefly. Stroh is adamant that the result is a
better tasting product.
Membrane separation is still considered one of the best methods of
production. The process does not rely on heat: instead, it pushes the
brewing mixture through a semi-permeable membrane to remove water and
alcohol from the beer solids.
The mixture is then diluted with de-aerated, carbonated water to attain the
desired alcohol level in the finished beer.
As membrane technology is constantly being perfected, many people in the
industry believe it represents the shape of the future.
'Membrane technology will become more important,' says Hugo Patino, director
of brewing research and development for Coors.
'Of course, the real goal is to have a membrane that would be selective only
for alcohol, but that's hard.'
One important variation upon the membrane technique is what is known as a
'dialysis system'.
After separating the alcohol and water from the beer mixture through the
membrane, the alcohol and water go through a distillation column which
removes the alcohol alone.
The same water is then put back into the beer mixture.
The idea behind the dialysis system is that many of the 'taste' molecules
which are flushed out with the alcohol would be replaced with the old water
at the end of the process. However, this technique is largely experimental,
and has not yet been embraced by any of the large manufacturers.
The main problem with membrane technology is its high cost. Membrane
technology requires heavy initial investment in plant.
Only the largest brewer in the US, Anheuser-Busch, which accounts for 44 per
cent of total US beer sales, uses the membrane method for its non-alcoholic
product.
Switching to membrane technology would be feasible for most of the other
larger brewers - the cost of making the beer is, after all, not so high
compared with the cost of marketing. For smaller brewers, however, it is out
of the question.
One popular lower-cost method is to control fermentation. Several variations
on the technique exist. One is to use selective yeasts which do not produce
as much alcohol; another is to keep the brew at a very low temperature in
order to arrest fermentation.
Coors and Miller both use this method for the production of their
non-alcholic brands.
During the last few years, small breweries in the US have been enjoying
something of a comeback.
For them, many of the new technologies are too costly to seriously consider.
One new method, though, is gaining in popularity. To produce a non-alcoholic
beer, many of these small-time brewers are simply producing a very
concentrated malt mixture, which is later diluted with carbonated water.
Some analysts are enthusiastic about this new process.
'Using this method,' said Mr Siebel, 'it is possible to vary your color
levels and bittering in the finished beer.'
Others are not so sure. 'It doesn't taste that much different than pouring
beer into a glass at home and adding carbonated water to it,' says Mr Patino
of Coors.
Non-alcoholic beer is proving too important a market for US brewers to
ignore it, whatever the cost issues may be in the short term.
The big beer companies can be expected to continue their quest for the
perfect non-alcoholic beer, and with the new technologies, the final product
is constantly improving.
Yet for all the investment in new methods, the market has not yet achieved a
non-alcoholic beer that tastes exactly like the real thing.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
PERHAPS THE ultimate 'better mouse trap' has been devised by Rentokil, the
UK-based pest control company.
The Mouse Alert system uses a series of strategically sited mouse-acceptable
boxes, each fitted with two miniature infra-red beams and a radio
transmitter.
When a mouse enters and breaks both beams (to eliminate false alarms), the
transmitter signals the control box and shuts the trap's doors.
The control box, which can serve more than 200 traps, displays a visual
alarm, sounds a bleeper (which can be muted for discretion) and then
automatically dials a sequence of up to four telephone pager numbers.
Once alerted, the control technician switches off the alarm, removes the
mouse in a special container for humane disposal off site and re-sets the
system. The whole process is also confirmed by a control box print out.
No toxic bait is used in the trap, so there is no risk of contamination.
Labour intensive inspections and reporting are also eliminated, the response
is immediate, and the system provides round-the-clock protection.
Mouse Alert is intended for high risk premises or high value goods where
damage or contamination caused by even one mouse could be catastrophic, such
as food and pharmaceutical manufacture and protecting high technology
equipment.
Potential users of the advanced mousetrap include air and rail traffic
control centres.

MEASURING the temperature of molten steel manually is dangerous and costly,
so Vesuvius International, part of Cookson, the international industrial
materials group, has developed a new long-life sensor which can measure the
temperature of molten steel up to 1,8000C for more than 300 hours at a time.
'Steel companies throughout the world are trying to improve the quality of
their steel,'said Wolfgang Loser, president of the German-based Accumetrix
division of Vesuvius.
'Our sensors will monitor the whole process, tell them second by second what
the temperature is and guarantee they produce the best quality steel.'
The new long life sensor, manufactured by the Accumetrix plant in Beaver
Falls,Pennsylvania, is made out of platinum and rhodium and can measure the
temperature of more than 18,000 tons of molten steel being cast at the rate
of six tons a minute.
Vesuvius is also working on a new range of sensors, the size of a walking
stick, which will measure the sulphur, hydrogen,oxygen, phosphor and
nitrogen content of steel.

FRESH FRUIT, flower and vegetable growers face a dilemma if the markets for
their products are far away.
Sending perishable goods, like peaches, by air is expensive, but prolonged
cold-storage leads to a loss of juiciness and 'bloom'.
Research for Australian National Line, the Melbourne-based shipping group,
has led to the development of an 'active wrapping' which can keep perishable
goods fresh for several weeks, enabling them to be sent by ordinary sea
transport and cutting growers' costs substantially.
'Essentially the wrapping puts the fruit to sleep,' said Mr Simon Crean,
Australia's Minister for Primary Industry at a recent product demonstration.
'It controls the gases surrounding the fruit so that the biological
processes are greatly slowed for the duration of the voyage. The ripening
process and normal plant respiration are put into suspended animation.'
The new material has four elements. A permeable membrane lets through the
precise amount of carbon dioxide gas and oxygen to keep the product dormant.
Then it is impregnated with an organic chemical which soaks up ethylene gas
exuded by vegetable matter which hastens ripening.
In addition, it keeps the air around the product very humid, while removing
moisture which condenses inside the package. Finally, the wrapping is
impregnated with minute amounts of slow release fungicide which inhibits
mould growth.

Norman Askew (right), president and managing director of TI Aerospace and
Titeflex International, is the new managing director of East Midlands
Electricity in succession to Dan Cowe, who is retiring.
As the number two to chairman John Harris, Askew, 49, says it was too good
an opportunity to pass up, despite the fact that he was leaving TI 'at a
very exciting time for the business', following the acquisition of Dowty.
He had been at TI for 26 years.
The fit with East Midlands he describes as simply a common philosophy -
'excellence in customer service'. Asked whether customers' most immediate
preferences might not be for lower prices, he says that he does not believe
companies should have to apologise for making money.
East Midlands Electricity has just reported a 41 per cent increase in
pre-tax profits for the year to March 31 1992. He adds that continuing
improvements in distribution efficiency can lead to lower prices 'in the
longer term'.
He is also looking forward to continuing 'a fairly ambitious programme' for
expansion of the non-regulated businesses such as energy services, control
systems and electrical and mechanical contracting.
Cowe, a light rapid transit systems and model railway enthusiast, is
retiring at 60 at the end of September.

THE GOVERNMENT has given Training and Enterprise Councils a mid-September
deadline to decide whether they want a new central body to co-ordinate their
activities.
A shortlist of possible models is being prepared by Sir Christopher Ball,
former warden of Keble College, Oxford, and they will be disclosed to Tecs
for discussion next month.
A decision on the type of umbrella organisation, if any, that should
represent the 82 Tecs in England and Wales is one of the most difficult
facing them.
It might entail tough talks with the Department of Employment, which is
awaiting the results of the Tec consultation. Some ministers would oppose a
body that would give Tecs greater independence from the government.
The issue has come to the forefront of the Tec agenda because the remit of
the National Training Task Force, set up by the government to help it launch
the Tec movement, will end this December. The task force has given a
national dimension to many of the functions performed by Tecs locally.
Most Tecs want structural change in their relationship with the government.
They want more influence with the government and less interference from it.
Some fiercely independent Tecs wanted no formal structure between them and
Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary.

<TEXT>
GREATER LONDON will show the weakest economic performance of the main
British regions this year, with a fall in output of 0.8 per cent, according
BSL Business Strategies, an economic consultancy.
Its latest regional outlook forecasts that the UK economy as a whole will
grow by a minimal 0.1 per cent this year. Output will rise slightly in the
second half, with growth of UK gross domestic product quickening to 2.8 per
cent next year. BSL says regional growth differentials will remain
relatively small as growth gets under way, contrasting with experience in
the 1980s.
Mr David Fell, BSL's principal economist, said: 'We do not expect the
re-emergence of a strong north-south divide.'
BSL expects that East Anglia and the north-west will head the regional
growth league this year with GDP increases of 1 per cent and 0.8 per cent
respectively. It believes that the south-east will be the strongest-growing
area in 1993, with 3.3 per cent growth, although within that region Greater
London will continue to perform relatively badly. Greater London's GDP is
expected to grow at the national average rate of 2.8 per cent next year. Job
losses in the capital since 1988 will have totalled 450,000 by next year.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Fresh fall in company starts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE number of companies being formed is continuing to fall, according to a
survey that is likely to heighten worries about the effect of the recession.
Jordans, a business information group, says 56,022 companies were created in
the first half of this year, a drop of 3.1 per cent from the 57,788 starts
in the same period last year. Although the year-on-year fall is lower than
the rates recorded early in the recession, the figure indicates how the weak
economy has reduced opportunities for budding entrepreneurs.
According to Jordans, the number of company starts has declined,
particularly in northern and eastern England with the west Midlands and
Scotland less affected.
Besides the poor business outlook, the reduced enthusiasm of banks to back
fledgling businesses is seen as a further factor behind the fall in company
starts.
Jordans' figures for company formations are based on registrations at
Companies House and cover the UK excluding Northern Ireland. This year's
figures follow a year-on-year fall of 9.1 per cent last year, and one of 7.1
per cent the previous year. Last year, 110,108 companies were formed, down
from a peak of 130,478 in 1989.
In the first half of this year compared with the same period last year,
there was a 28 per cent fall in the number of companies established in
northern England. In eastern England, the east Midlands and north-west
England the falls were 25 per cent, 24 per cent and 20 per cent
respectively.
Scotland and the west Midlands each saw a drop of just 7 per cent, while
outer London had a decline of 12 per cent.
The figures for the south-west, south-east, Yorkshire and Humberside region,
and southern England were 18 per cent, 17 per cent, 16 per cent and 14 per
cent.
Inner London and Wales saw rises of 12 per cent and 8 per cent in the
numbers of registered companies. That, though, reflects large numbers of
'shelf' companies registered with accountants and agents in London and
Cardiff, and does not accurately reflect new economic activity in those
areas.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CADBURY committee on the financial aspects of corporate governance
should give greater consideration to enforcement, the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of Scotland said yesterday.
The institute called in a submission which broadly supported the Cadbury
report for greater detail on how the Stock Exchange will ensure that
non-compliance with the proposed code is publicised.
It said a number of improvements should be made before the final version of
the report is published later this year. The institute argued that the onus
is on a company's auditor to demonstrate its independence, adding that an
auditor should disclose more information on the services it provides in
addition to auditing, as well as its fees.
The institute said large private companies should be encouraged to abide by
the code, which is directed at public companies. It emphasised the
importance of the need for a continuous review of the effectiveness of
implementation of the code.
The institute added that greater consideration should be given to the
informal ways in which financial information is passed on to analysts, to
ensure that there is equal access for all participants in the market.
The institute also emphasised that Cadbury should steer clear of the idea of
two-tier boards - in which executive and non-executive directors are seen as
working separately - and stress the importance of unitary boards, where the
two work together.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Cowes in distress for want of liquidity: Fashionable yacht
crews plotting a course through perils of recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COWES WEEK will start with a boom, a triumph of individual money over
corporate indifference.
Just after 10am tomorrow, the cannon at the exclusive Royal Yacht Squadron
(secretary: Major Robin 'I don't give interviews' Rising) will fire to set
off a week of 225 yacht races pitting skill against skill, bank balance
against bank balance.
The sharp report of the cannon will not only echo over the Solent and send a
little tremor through the benign suburbia of Cowes, where the calm of the
retired bourgeoisie obscures rising unemployment and a high illegitimacy
rate. It will also signal that tradition is alive and well: the sporting
event that fills the gap in the calendar between Henley and Goodwood, on the
one hand, and the grouse shooting of the Glorious 12th, on the other, is
surviving recession.
Britannia, the royal yacht, will be in attendance. The Royal Navy has
navigated the constraints of the defence budget to provide an escort vessel.
The Duke of Edinburgh will be donning his oilskins. The balls and the
dinners have been arranged. Everybody is geared for a splendid time. No
doubt everybody will have just that: it, too, is part of the tradition.
But Cowes Week is rather like a recession-ridden engineering company: the
margins are under pressure.
Captain Dan Bradby, who organises the regatta for the combined yacht clubs
of Cowes, expects 780 boats to enter this year. Last year, there were 850.
The total, he explained 'is governed by the number of billets to secure the
boats. We can cope with 900.' So throughput has fallen by 8 per cent and he
is operating 13 per cent under capacity.
Engineering chiefs, under present conditions, would be relieved at such
figures. But, to stay in the market, Cowes has reduced its entry fees this
year - they range from Pounds 5 a day to Pounds 70 a race - by an average of
10 per cent.
The fees are tiny compared to the cost of a boat - the proverbial drop in
the ocean. But people are 'feeling the pinch', according to Capt Bradby.
The costs of Cowes Week are nearing Pounds 150,000 and rising - not least
the price of the prizes. This is not Wimbledon-style prize money; rather it
might cover the cost of buying a handy gadget, such as a portable clothes
locker.
With income declining, costs increasing and a slender asset base, Cowes Week
cannot rely on the bank for extra working capital. It has been forced back
on the sponsor, Land Rover.
The businesses that have sprung up around Cowes Week have been less
fortunate. The town has two marinas. The one nearest the racing, West Cowes
Marina, is in the hands of the receivers. It is a victim of the classic
property company bind. Crusader Estates, the previous owner, ran up debts
and ran out of income.
Locals and yachtsmen alike have seen West Cowes Marina as rather shabby.
This year, though, after some investment by the receiver, it is looking its
best for years.
Mr John Whitehead, another former naval man, was put in as manager last
January. This week, inside the breakwater, there will be 'wall-to-wall
boats, all of which have pre-booked and pre-paid', he said. They will have
paid the same as last year - a daily charge of Pounds 1.20 for each foot of
boat.
This is the sprat to catch the mackerel. The marina has to be seen to be
working, to attract a buyer as a going concern. Over the next few days, it
will be a hive of activity, not least because more crews than ever before
will be sleeping on their boats.
Such economy measures have their downside. Mr Tim Clogg owns Marvins, the
estate agents, 'founded in 1868, patronised by royalty'. He rents out houses
for Cowes Week.
'Bookings are probably 30 per cent down, but last year was a record year for
us,' he said. Prices are down. 'Last year they were between Pounds 20 and
Pounds 25 a night. This year they are between Pounds 15 and Pounds 18.'
The more people who sleep on boats, the better the business is likely to be
at the shore installations of West Cowes Marina. Not only is the marina like
the pits at a motor racetrack, it is also a social centre.
Looking around the blue-and-white marquees on the shore, Mr Chris Troup,
whose Inn-On-The-Road is organising the West Cowes Marina festivities, said:
'This is like a huge pub - a 180-foot bar - we do more beer in a week than
the average pub does in a year.' More than 500 barrels, in fact.
Setting up the catering and the entertainment involves an investment of
Pounds 50,000, and Mr Troup seeks it in sponsorship. 'It was very hard this
year to get the financing for the site,' he said. Normally people actually
beg us to be here; it's an indication things are hard.'
Cowes Week, it is true, has never been excessively popular with the
corporate fat cats. This year it is even less so. In the shop window of
Wallace Clark, the yacht brokers, there is a special offer for chartering
Sea Lass, a motor yacht: down to Pounds 600 a day from Pounds 800.
'The better yachts get the charters. The ones not doing so well are those
where the owner says 'We've got a boat, let's charter it',' observed Mr
Rodney Barton, the Wallace Clark managing director. By contrast, his boat
sales have been doing very well since just before the general election.
There is a dichotomy between what individuals are prepared to do to get on
the water and what companies are prepared to spend to cash in on the
popularity of water sports.
For the traditionalist, tapping in to the memory of 170 years of regattas,
this is not a cause for concern. Rather, it provides an opportunity to evoke
the Corinthian spirit.
'Okay, the traders will go and make their money, and that's fine. But, as
far as the regatta is concerned, it's the fact you've got 700-plus boats -
and they're not top racers. They come together for an event where it's not
just the good racing but the atmosphere of Cowes Week,' says Capt Tony
Pearson, secretary of the Island Sailing Club which is not quite as posh as
the Royal Yacht Squadron.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Businesses report scarcity of skills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW skills shortages are emerging that will constrain the UK when it emerges
from recession, according to a survey of large companies.
The survey, by Gallup on behalf of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy and
management consultancy firm, indicates that the recession has removed some
of the UK's traditional skills shortages.
But many of the 100 companies polled say they are experiencing difficulties
in specific skills areas where shortages are now almost as severe as before
the recession.
Shortages persist in information technology, languages and managerial,
professional and supervisory skills, they say. Shortages of linguistic
skills have worsened during the recession.
The report says: 'These are precisely the areas where the same companies see
the greatest demands emerging between now and the year 2000.'
Companies, according to the survey, fail to equip individuals with requisite
skills.
Only 50 per cent of companies have, for example, specified the areas of
competence they require of managers.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand say appraisal systems in many companies do not lead to
skills development and are in danger of becoming mere annual rituals. 'That
is in spite of the increasing recognition of the growing demands on
managers,' says the report.
Few companies are equipping older people with the skills needed. 'This could
put the UK's economic survival in jeopardy,' says Coopers &amp; Lybrand. 'The
number of under-35s in the UK workforce is falling, so companies need to
retain older members of staff and make sure that they have the right
skills.'
The survey found that government measures, such as Opportunity 2000 and the
Management Charter Initiative (MCI), had made little impact on companies'
training plans. Miss Sheila Drew Smith, a Coopers &amp; Lybrand partner, said
this may be because the companies in the survey had already developed their
own strategies in these areas.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Building workloads drop 25%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent and VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSTRUCTION industry criticism of the government's handling of the economy
intensified yesterday after publication of a survey indicating a 25 per cent
fall in work during the past 12 months.
A survey of 1,000 offices of quantity surveyors, by the Royal Institution of
Chartered Surveyors, showed that order books during the three months to the
end of June had fallen by a quarter compared with the same period last year
and by 4.7 per cent compared with the previous three months.
Since much quantity surveying work, like that of architects, occurs early in
the construction process, the findings can be related to the prospects for
the industry as a whole.
Mr Christopher Vickers, a senior partner at EC Harris cost consultants, one
of the largest firms of quantity surveyors, said: 'All we get from ministers
are platitudes. They seem to be unaware of the long-term damage which is
being done to the construction industry.' Mr Vickers said there was
increasing concern that the government would cut capital investment in
construction as a means of controlling public expenditure.
His comments were made ahead of publication today of forecasts from the
National Council of Building Material Producers. They are expected to show a
further sharp fall in construction output and indications that the recovery
will be delayed until 1994.
A separate survey by the Royal Institute of British Architects estimates
that a third of the country's 30,000 registered architects are unemployed or
working below capacity. It says architects' earnings fell by 2 per cent on
average last year to Pounds 23,000, the first decline in cash or real terms
since records began in 1976.
A survey to be published today by the Federation of Civil Engineering
Contractors is expected to reveal a steep decline in expectations since the
general election. It is expected to warn that the outlook for orders and
jobs is the worst for years.
MOST commercial property lenders expect no improvement and even a decline in
the market over the next year, according to a survey of 58 banks and other
financial institutions, Vanessa Houlder writes.
It shows that lenders have revised their forecasts as the expected recovery
has failed to materialise. This month, only 48 per cent expect an
improvement in the market over the next 12 months, down from 55 per cent in
January and 70 per cent in July last year.
The report by Chesterton Financial, a property adviser, and Chartered
Surveyor Weekly magazine suggests that the next six months may be critical
for struggling property companies.
Sixty-nine per cent of those polled expect the upward trend in receiverships
to continue over the next six months. Confidence Barometer. Chesterton

FT  31 JUL 92 / Taxman set to drive a hard bargain: The Inland Revenue's
proposals for company cars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Inland Revenue says some 1.2m drivers would benefit under its proposals
to restructure company car taxation - but the 700,000 losers would face
higher tax demands running to thousands of pounds a year in some cases.
The Revenue emphasised yesterday that the proposals were only the start of a
3 1/2 -month consultative process.
It can expect to be inundated, for the issue is important for manufacturers,
which make nearly a third of sales to business users, and for the
government, which receives Pounds 1.4bn annually in income tax from the
company car benefit scale charges, as well as for the nearly 2m company car
users.
The proposals aim to make fairer what is essentially a crude banding system,
unchanged in all essentials since it was introduced 16 years ago. But they
are also intended to take account of criticisms, including some by the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission, that the combined price and engine
capacity thresholds of the company car taxation system distort the market,
obliging manufacturers to produce 'tax break specials' causing market
bunching and potentially putting specialist manufacturers such as Jaguar at
a disadvantage.
There are about 1,200 car models available in the UK, but the present scale
system divides them into only five categories, using both price and engine
size. That means, to use the Revenue's own example, that the driver of a
sub-Pounds 9,000 Ford Fiesta diesel pays the same as the driver of a Pounds
19,000 BMW 520i if their business mileages are similar.
The Revenue says its proposals to base the tax charge mainly on price is
fairer and more easily understood than the present system.
The Revenue has resisted pressure to abandon banding in favour of basing the
scale charge on a percentage of the list price of the car. The Revenue
wished to avoid the need for individual tax calculations and PAYE recodings
each time a car is changed.
The Revenue is proposing 12 price bands, each higher band covering a
successively wider range of car prices. The advantage seen in such a
structure is that it would be sensitive in the Pounds 10,000-Pounds 19,500
region where company cars are concentrated.
Business car buyers will have to wait until the final scheme is set out in
next year's Budget for the exact detail. But to generate the same revenue
yield as the present system, the document indicates a scale representing two
ninths of a car's value for drivers covering 2,500-18,000 business miles a
year; one third for low-mileage (below 2,500 miles) users and only one ninth
for those covering more than 18,000 business miles a year. The document
proposes no changes to the business mileage bands.
The effects of the change are likely to be uneven. The Revenue says more
than half of the 750,000 company car drivers in the existing 1.4 litre to 2
litre engine band would gain modestly, most with a tax charge cut by about
10 per cent, and about 70,000 drivers of most basic cars by up to 25 per
cent.
But even the Revenue acknowledges that better-equipped saloons in the Pounds
12,500-Pounds 16,000 range would attract increases of more than 10 per cent,
affecting an estimated 360,000 drivers. The typical middle-ranking
executive, driving a high-specification car of just under 2 litres and just
under the present Pounds 19,250 threshold, would be among those worst
affected, facing a typical increase in tax of about 40 per cent.
Cars now costing between Pounds 19,250 and Pounds 29,000 would be split into
two bands. The 60,000 cars in the lower half of the current band would have
the tax charge cut by 15 per cent on average; those costing more than Pounds
24,500 - involving about 20,000 cars - would be modest losers.
For the most expensive cars, priced now at more than Pounds 29,000, those at
the bottom of the range - up to Pounds 39,000 - would have a tax charge
reduced by more than 30 per cent, a benefit to companies such as Jaguar.
Above Pounds 39,000, the tax charge would rise, by 35 per cent for cars
costing between Pounds 50,000 and Pounds 60,000.
Mr Brian Friedman, managing director of Stoy Benefit Consulting, said the
system 'will inevitably hit senior executives driving the most expensive
cars'. He suggested that, since many of these drivers were user-choosers,
'the logical result will be a general downsizing of company cars'.
The scheme also aims to minimise incentives to drive thirsty cars. And while
there are no specific provisions to encourage economical diesel cars, they
will be encouraged indirectly by the proposals.
Diesel cars need larger engines than petrol equivalents in order to have
acceptable power and are therefore often put into a higher band under the
present scale structure. A price-only band would end such discrimination, as
well as tending in general to favour cheaper - and generally more
fuel-efficient - cars.
There is a strong administrative argument for the Revenue's proposals:
whereas the whole business car sector usually waits on tenterhooks each
Budget to see what changes in scale charges are announced, a multi-band
price system would be broadly self-correcting and require no Budgetary
attention. Cars would simply drift up through the price bands, depending on
inflation.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Smith promotes leftwingers to front bench
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, yesterday moved to encourage party unity
by including several prominent leftwingers in his frontbench team.
The 76-strong list - only marginally shorter than the outgoing team - took
in Ms Clare Short, Mr Tony Banks and Ms Maria Fyfe, all of whom resigned
under Mr Neil Kinnock's parliamentary leadership in opposition to Labour's
stance on the Gulf war.
The Smith front bench also includes well-known rightwingers such as Mr
Stuart Bell at trade and industry, underlining that the leader has ignored
political labels and made his selections on merit.
'What is quite clear is that, with 91 per cent of the vote for the
leadership, John Smith feels free to choose his team on the basis of
performance, not ideology,' an official said. 'People will keep their jobs
or lose them on how they perform and nothing else.'
Also given jobs were eight new faces, among them Mr Keith Vaz, the Leicester
East MP who has gained prominence as a vigorous campaigner for depositors
and staff of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
Mr Clive Soley, formerly the party's housing spokesman, has returned to the
back benches, reportedly at his own request, as has Mr Mark Fisher, until
now arts spokesman.
Among the most obvious promotions are a newly prominent role for Mr Alistair
Darling, MP for Edinburgh Central, who moves from home affairs to the
Treasury team, and for Mr Derek Fatchett, MP for Leeds Central, who appears
set to take on City affairs from Ms Marjorie Mowlam.
Ms Mowlam, newly elected to the shadow cabinet with responsibility for the
Citizen's Charter and women, appears one of the main beneficiaries of the
changes with a back-up team of Mr Brian Wilson, Mr Lewis Moonie and Ms Kate
Hoey.
The European portfolio - the number two job in Mr Jack Cunningham's shadow
foreign affairs group - stays with Mr George Robertson, who has held the job
since 1983. But Mr Martin O'Neill, the former defence spokesman, now moves
to energy in Mr Robin Cook's trade and industry team.
Mr Tom Pendry replaces the veteran Mr Denis Howell as shadow spokesman for
sport.
Other treasury spokesmen under the leadership of the shadow chancellor, Mr
Gordon Brown, are Mr Andrew Smith and Mr Nick Brown. Mr Paul Boateng has
been shifted sideways to the team shadowing the Lord Chancellor's
Department. Mr Cook's trade and industry team includes Mr Nigel Griffiths
and Mr Jim Cousins, a newcomer to the front bench.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Bogus tour agents vanish with Pounds 1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM LAWRENCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE Frenchmen who masqueraded as travel agents in the UK and advertised in
Belgium and France have disappeared with payments estimated at more than
Pounds 1m.
The men, who set up an office in north London three months ago and sold
non-existent airline tickets and holidays, left the premises last Friday,
according to Mr Steve Nicholls, principal trading standards officer at
Camden Borough Council.
The men said they would return on Tuesday, but have apparently vacated their
offices and are believed to have left Britain, Mr Nicholls said.
'We have no knowledge of any flights and holidays that have been
successful,' he said.
Belgian customers were the first to report the men's disappearance and
Belgian police are investigating. It later emerged that French customers had
also booked flights and holidays through the office.
Camden council received about 50 complaints between Monday and Wednesday,
and the trading standards office is now directing complaints to Belgian and
French police. 'The 50 complaints are only the tip of the iceberg,' Mr
Nicholls said. It is believed that the advertisements, bookings and payments
were all made on the Continent.
The Metropolitan and City of London police are not taking part in the
investigation.
The men, two of whom are in their late 20s and one who is in his late 30s,
used an office in Lissenden Gardens, Tufnell Park. They lived in rented
rooms in West Hampstead.
They advertised on the Continent in local newspapers and on local radio as
two separate companies, Branch &amp; Co in Belgium, and Notais &amp; Coin France.
Neither was a registered company.
The British consulate in Brussels has been contacted by six people who
booked holidays with Branch &amp; Co. One man from the US said he had booked a
holiday and paid a BFr50,000 deposit - just under Pounds 1,000. Belgian
police have put a restraining order on a Belgian account, according to the
consulate.
Mr Francois Fonck, who is leading the investigation from the Police
Judiciaire in Belgium, said it was believed the men had used false names,
and it was not known in which country they now were.
THE pre-tax profits of Britain's top 30 air tour operators increased by 160
per cent to Pounds 104.8m last year, the Civil Aviation Authority said
yesterday.
The increased profits were achieved on turnover of Pounds 2.74bn, only
marginally up on the 1990 figure of Pounds 2.73bn.  Pre-tax profit as a
percentage of turnover was 3.8 per cent, the highest level achieved since
1983. The Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) said the average level
of profit per holiday was Pounds 11.50.
The authority said that 24 of the top 30 companies made profits last year
totalling Pounds 110.9m, while six made total losses of Pounds 6.1m. The 30
top companies account for nearly 80 per cent of licensed air holidays sold
in the UK. The authority said the remainder of the industry achieved similar
levels of profitability.
The increased profits of the the top 30 companies followed the collapse last
year of the International Leisure Group, then the second-biggest operator.
Its demise allowed the remaining companies to maintain their prices and
prevented big discounting that was a feature of previous years.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Names may fight on in Canada
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANADIAN NAMES at Lloyd's of London insurance market are considering
appealing to their Supreme Court after an attempt to sue Lloyd's for alleged
fraud was defeated earlier this week.
The Ontario Court of Appeal upheld a decision that the Names - the
individuals whose assets support the insurance market - would have to bring
their case in an English court.
The court also overturned injunctions obtained against some Canadian banks
to prevent them from paying out guarantees taken out by the Names as part of
the assets pledged to the market.
Mr Justice Carthy, Mr Justice Osborne and Mr Justice Abella ruled that the
Names must comply with the clauses in their membership agreement with
Lloyd's that any litigation would be conducted through English courts.
Lloyd's could switch quickly to offering limited liability to its Names, a
report from Davies Arnold Cooper, a firm of solicitors, argued yesterday.
The report says the present position of unlimited liability is a historical
accident and that a simple change in a by-law would allow admission of
people without full liability.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Adjudication urged in gas dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GAS Consumers' Council, which represents 17m gas customers, is calling
on British Gas and the industry regulator Ofgas to refer to the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission their dispute over the rate of return on the gas
pipeline business.
Letters from Mr James Cooper, chairman of the council, were delivered
yesterday to Mr Cedric Brown, who will take over tomorrow as chief executive
of British Gas, and Sir James McKinnon, director-general of Ofgas. Mr Cooper
said he could see no alternative to a wide-ranging inquiry into the
structure of the UK gas industry.
As moves were made towards greater competition in the industry, it was
essential to ensure that public interest was being properly served, he
added. 'There is a risk that the consequence of increased competition will
be higher prices. Such a risk is too great to be accepted without a public
inquiry.'
Mr Cooper suggested that some changes proposed by the government and the
Office of Fair Trading might be 'going too far or too fast', and it was time
for an 'impartial referee' to adjudicate.
Under the terms of an agreement with the OFT, British Gas must hive off its
transportation and storage business into an arm's-length subsidiary by 1994.
A pricing system is due to be published by September.
British Gas insists that it must be allowed to earn an adequate rate of
return from the pipeline business - a return which it puts at 6.7 per cent
on existing assets and 10.8 per cent on new investment. Mr Brown said last
week he did not rule out a referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission
if there was no agreement. Sir James is believed to favour a lower return,
although he has yet to respond to British Gas's submission.
The consumers' council says the case for a review of the price cap, which
limits the rise in consumer gas prices to the RPI minus 5 per cent, is
'worryingly strong' while British Gas faces additional costs from its
separate pipeline and storage business. That might result in higher prices.

THE debts of Land Travel, the Bath-based travel company that collapsed last
week, are likely to exceed Pounds 10m, Mr Robert Buller of the liquidators,
Grant Thornton, said yesterday, Michael Skapinker writes.
That is five times as high as initial estimates. Grant Thornton is still
talking to potential purchasers of Land Travel's database, but there is no
prospect that people who made bookings with the company will recover their
money.

MEPC, the UK's second-largest property company, has sold an office building
in Croydon, south London, to Rotch Property Group, a private company, for
about Pounds 45m.
The 442,500 sq ft building is let to the Department of the Environment. MEPC
said it had sold the building, called Apollo and Lunar House, because of its

ALMOST 20 per cent of the emergency fund to help the Maxwell pensioners has
been paid out. Payments to cover pensions in August for members of the
Headington pension plan and the Maxwell Communication works pensions scheme
bring the total spent to more than Pounds 477,000.
The Pounds 2.5m fund was set up in June as a temporary measure to help
Maxwell pension schemes, which would otherwise have been unable to continue
making payments.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Wellcome launches employee share plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WELLCOME, the drugs group, has launched an employee share option plan which,
it claims, will be one of the most ambitious international schemes ever
mounted.
Employees in 26 countries will be given options to buy 500 shares in
Wellcome at 772p a share. That compares with a price of 800p at which the
Wellcome Trust, the medical charity, sold 270m shares this week.
Employees can exercise their options between three and 10 years from now.
The plan applies to about 15,000 of Wellcome's total of 18,500 employees.
Companies setting up international schemes have usually opened them only to
senior executives.
Wellcome's innovation lies in making the scheme tax-efficient to employees
in different tax regimes. In the UK, the options are being granted under the
1984 Finance Act, making them income-tax-free.
There are some countries where it has proved impracticable to launch the
offer, but the company says it is exploring other methods in those places.
An employee share option trust has acquired 400,000 shares. If the options
are exercised in full, the company will have to issue about 7.5m shares,
worth about Pounds 58m.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Airways cabin crews have set next Tuesday as the date for the first
of a series of one-day strikes.
The TGWU general union, which represents 2,600 of the airline's 2,900 cabin
crew, said yesterday: 'We will definitely close down domestic, European and
Concorde services unless BA agrees to further talks over the new pay and
conditions.'
BA has conceded that, if the strike attracts strong support after midnight
on Monday, short-haul services will be disrupted. It is thought unlikely
that Concorde will be affected.
The union said it was expecting all members to support the strike call, but
officials admitted privately that it was impossible to predict how many
members actually would do so.
BA said it was planning a normal schedule on Tuesday. The company said the
ballot for the action had produced only a 121 majority in favour of action,
in a turnout of about 70 per cent. An earlier ballot, which produced a
bigger majority, was ruled unlawful.
BA said it hoped short-haul crews would report for work on Tuesday and that
'we will operate all our domestic and European services without
inconvenience to passengers.'

FT  31 JUL 92 / Top Granada executive to head ITV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ANDREW QUINN was yesterday named as ITV's first chief executive on a
three-year contract with total remuneration likely to be between Pounds
400,000 and Pounds 500,000 a year.
Mr Quinn, the 55-year-old chief executive of Granada Television - who will
be responsible for an annual budget of about Pounds 500m - said: 'There is
no doubt ITV will have to be more commercial in future. The Independent
Television Commission recognises that.' Mr Quinn emphasised that his
strategy would be: 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it'. But he added that:
Current-affairs programmes would need audiences of 8m to 9m to earn their
slots in prime time. Granada's award-winning World in Action has been
drawing audiences of 7.5m.
Scheduling techniques such as 'stripping' - running the same type of
programme at the same time each evening - was now possible.
He would argue for extension of the definition of prime time from 10.30pm
until 11pm. That might allow News at Ten to run half an hour later if it was
decided that was necessary for scheduling purposes.
Mr Quinn also warned that further rationalisations would be needed in ITV.
'There is a whole duplication in the system with 15 sets of everything.'
The choice of Mr Quinn took ITV right back to the beginning in their search
for a chief executive to run the new centralised network from this autumn.
Mr Quinn was the first choice of senior ITV executives at the beginning of
this year after unofficial approaches to Mr Michael Grade, chief executive
of Channel 4 had been rebuffed.
Then came the internal upheavals at Granada and the forced resignation of Mr
David Plowright, chairman of Granada Television. Mr Quinn decided he could
not leave Granada at such a time.
Headhunters were called in and more than 70 names considered before the job
came back on the market after Mr David Arculus, group managing director of
Emap the publishing company, turned it down. The headhunters are expected to
be paid about Pounds 100,000 for 'finding' Mr Quinn and a central scheduler.

FT  31 JUL 92 / BT chief accuses regulators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR IAIN VALLANCE, British Telecommunications chairman, yesterday accused the
regulators of privatised industries of threatening the success of the 1980s
privatisation programme.
He coupled the attack, at his annual shareholders' meeting in Birmingham,
with a warning that BT would find it very difficult to accept the tighter
price-controlled regime put forward by Oftel, the telecommunications
regulator.
If Oftel and BT cannot agree on controls, the issue will be referred to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Oftel has told BT to cut the price of a basket of its basic services each
year by inflation minus 7.5 percentage points, compared with 6.25 points at
present. The company has also been told to ensure small retail customers
share in the price cuts.
Mr Vallance said the proposed price regime was 'extremely tough by any
standard', and many of the detailed provisions would add to the proposals'
negative impact on BT.
He called for a change in the regulatory regime that would leave 'management
free without interference', and for a commercial price structure based on
cost.
Mr Vallance said: 'It is also unclear how the regulators themselves are to
be held accountable. The regulated industries have little right of appeal,
and, in practice, no effective recourse to judicial review.
'We firmly believe that there is an issue of governance concerning the
regulators which the government must tackle if the real successes of the
privatisation programme of the 1980s are not to be undermined.'
He said an MMC referral would make 'huge demands' on management time.

FT  31 JUL 92 / SFO is backed over Nadir
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Serious Fraud Office has surmounted the first legal hurdle in its
attempt to win reinstatement against Mr Asil Nadir, former chairman of Polly
Peck International, of 46 charges thrown out by the trial judge.
The High Court yesterday rejected Mr Nadir's contention that it had no
jurisdiction to review Mr Justice Tucker's decision last month to dismiss
the charges, which alleged the theft of Pounds 119m from PPI.
Mr Nadir, whose trial is fixed for next March, may appeal to the law lords.
The SFO says Mr Justice Tucker's decision was wrong in law, and if accepted
would amount to 'a fraudster's charter'. The argument in the case must now
await a Lords ruling in an action involving the same point of law.
The dismissed charges alleged theft by the transfer of funds from PPI's bank
accounts to accounts of Unipac, PPI's Turkish-Cypriot subsidiary, or
Industrial Bank of Kibris, a northern Cyprus bank owned by Mr Nadir.
Mr Justice Tucker said Mr Nadir was authorised by PPI to make transfers, and
decided that the transfers in question had been merely preparatory acts not
involving misappropriation. He said there was, however, evidence that the
subsequent withdrawal of the funds from the Unipac and IBK accounts was
unauthorised.
The SFO contends that the judge erred in holding that Mr Nadir was
authorised to make the transfers in circumstances where they were made, not
for PPI's purposes, but for the dishonest purpose of then transferring funds
to himself or his private interests.
After dismissing 46 of the 66 charges against Mr Nadir, Mr Justice Tucker
allowed the SFO to substitute 44 others which allege thefts from Unipac. The
SFO plans to present an indictment containing 16 specimen charges of theft
against Mr Nadir at the trial. At present, 10 of the 16 relate to alleged
thefts from Unipac. If the SFO wins on review and has the dismissed charges
restored, the charges at trial will all allege thefts from PPI.

FT  31 JUL 92 / A leader beleaguered: The political bribery scandal in
Brazil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNTIL recently, visitors to Braslia with Dollars 10 and a few hours to kill
could amuse themselves with something called a Corruptour - a guided tour of
the capital's 'most notorious dens of corruption'. High on the list was the
presidential palace, Congress and the ministries of labour and health,
former incumbents of both of which are under police investigation.
The tourist authority, shocked by the image the tours gave of the country,
banned them - but it is far harder to try to halt the torrent of corruption
allegations filling the Brazilian press and threatening to unseat President
Fernando Collor, whose position looks less and less tenable.
Every day, new characters and new accusations emerge in the farcical saga
which has emerged since May, when Mr Collor's younger brother first accused
the charismatic young president of using his position to accumulate wealth.
The resulting congressional inquiry into Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, friend and
alleged front-man to Mr Collor, is drawing higher viewing figures for its
televised daily hearings than the Olympic games.
Now in its 10th week, the inquiry has collected a mass of material that is
alleged to incriminate Mr Farias and Mr Collor, including 40,000 cheques and
bank statements locked in a safe. These, it is claimed, show that Mr Farias
had been running a multi-million dollar extortion racket and using the money
to pay the president's expenses.
They also show that Mr Farias has been meeting the maintenance payments for
the children of Mr Collor's ex-wife, and funding the expensive clothing
tastes of his current wife, despite Mr Collor's insistence that he has had
no contact with Mr Farias since becoming president two years ago and that
the deposits were in fact made by Mr Claudio Vieira, his former private
secretary, out of a Dollars 5m loan raised in Uruguay in 1989.
The latest nail in Mr Collor's coffin was hammered on Wednesday when the
secretary of a Sao Paulo businessman said it was only last week that she had
typed documentation purported to be related to the Uruguay loan, which is
supposed to have been made three years ago. She said she had been driven to
reveal 'Operation Uruguay' after being sickened by watching its instigators
toast its success with champagne.
Mr Collor was elected on an anti-corruption platform; few people now believe
in his innocence. Mr Luis Bresser Pereira, minister of works in the last
government, wrote in an article yesterday: 'The consensus of society is
already formed - now all that remains is the consensus of the politicians,
and we'll have the resignation or the impeachment of Collor.'
Yet Mr Collor grimly refuses to resign, bolstered by the presence in his
government of Mr Marclio Marques Moreira, the much respected economy
minister. So far, the president has faced no real protests in the streets;
Brazilians seem to believe all politicians are corrupt anyway.
Indeed, Mr Collor has gone on the offensive. Claiming that the campaign is a
'conspiracy by coup-makers' and opponents of his economic reforms, he has
formed a heavy squad, led by the president of the state-owned Banco do
Brasil and threatening income tax investigations of Vice-President Itamar
Franco (who would become president if Mr Collor were ousted), leading
congressmen and presidential aspirants.
Mr Collor hopes the whole episode will be swept under the carpet, in
traditional Brazilian style, because of fears of where further inquiries
might lead and of the destabilisation that a lengthy impeachment process
might cause.
But Brazil's main opposition parties have already decided to call for
impeachment of the president after the inquiry concludes on August 11.
Meanwhile, leading politicians are expressing their support for Mr Franco,
and discussing the formation of a 'government of national unity' which would
take office until a referendum next April on Brazil's future political
system.
There is much confusion over impeachment. The relevant part of the 1988
constitution has yet to be ratified. Specialists say impeachment would
require two-thirds support in both the House of Representatives and the
Senate.
The Collor government is trying, through judicious spending of public money,
to muster the 168 votes he would require to survive in Congress. His party
holds only 23 seats out of 503 in Congress and, even with supporting
parties, the government bloc totals only 123.
Through it all, inflation stays above 20 per cent a month and much-needed
fiscal reform remains delayed. Yet the political crisis has had some
positive results. The inquiry has highlighted the hypocrisy of the law
forbidding politicians to accept campaign contributions from business.
Candidates in general rely heavily on donations from construction companies
which stand to gain from future government contracts.
Even more important - constitutional processes are functioning, despite
Brazil's past of military rule, and the men in khaki are indicating no
desire to step back into office. Mr Genebaldo Correia, congressional leader
of the main opposition party, says: 'We're showing the world that Brazil is
a strong democracy.'

FT  31 JUL 92 / Slow US growth weighs on Bush
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush flew his faltering re-election campaign to Texas and
California yesterday, weighed down by the excess baggage of a US economy
that continues to disappoint.
He left Washington as the Commerce Department reported preliminary estimates
that gross domestic product in the second quarter of this year had expanded
at a real annual rate of only 1.4 per cent, less than half the revised 2.9
per cent increase of the first three months. Earlier estimates for first
quarter growth had been 2.7 per cent.
In Texas, the president conceded that 'the economy is not growing fast
enough' but he added, 'we should resist the urge to exaggerate our
problems.'
Senior administration officials hold to the prediction that growth would
average an annualised 3 per cent in the second half of the year. Mr Bush
insisted: 'We've got to act now to guarantee that."
But, in yet again blaming the Democrats in Congress for 'dillying and
dallying' over his economic recovery plan, he offered no new policy
solutions to an economic problem that is seriously undermining his electoral
chances.
It is providing the surging campaign of Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic
presidential nominee, with ammunition and it is inducing some Republican
conservatives to start demanding that Mr Bush step down, rather than ditch
Vice-President Dan Quayle, as others have suggested.
In fact, on Wednesday night, the Senate Finance Committee agreed a Dollars
21.8bn tax bill containing some elements proposed by the president, among
them the creation of 25 urban enterprise zones, a 15 per cent tax allowance
on new investment undertaken over the next year and a Dollars 2,500 tax
credit for new home buyers.
Excluded, however, was a general capital gains tax cut which Mr Bush had
favoured.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Clifford 'deceived' in dealings over BCCI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Clark Clifford said yesterday there was 'not one scintilla of direct
evidence or proof, either oral or in writing' that he had committed any
crimes related to his stewardship of the Washington bank holding company
alleged to have been secretly acquired by the Bank of Credit and Commerce
International (BCCI).
The defiant 85-year-old former US secretary of defence was responding to
indictments brought on Wednesday accusing him of fraud, bribery, conspiracy,
larceny and racketeering. He attacked 'a gross unfairness in the manner in
which the publicity about a criminal proceeding is brought.
Mr Clifford denied that he and his co-defendant, Mr Robert Altman, his law
partner, 'were overwhelmed by the nature of the publicity this morning'. He
would fight the charges 'as long as I have the strength and health to do
it'. Mr Clifford's lawyer reported that his client's doctor had warned: 'He
may not live very long.'
Mr Clifford said his lawyers had learned 'that neither the district attorney
in New York nor the Justice Department in Washington has any direct,
credible evidence of our participation in any wrongdoing.'
He then detailed his version of his 13-year relationship with the group of
14 Middle East investors ('men of excellent reputations, men of fabulous
wealth') who had sought control of Financial General, the bank holding
company whose name was later changed to First American Bankshares.
Nowadays, though, he said, 'any time anyone mentions anything about BCCI,
it's like mentioning Aids.'
But, in 1982, when the bank takeover took place and he was persuaded to
become its chairman, BCCI was a respectable international financial
institution, 'vouched for' by the Bank of England, audited by Price
Waterhouse, and with a 30 per cent minority shareholding held by Bank of
America, then 'the largest and most respected' US bank. 'I am saying we
accepted them then for what they were. We were deceived.'
Nor, at the time, did he have any reason to distrust Mr Agha Hasan Abedi,
BCCI's ailing founder. In the 3 1/2 years prior to the bank purchase, 'I had
gotten to know Abedi well. Commitments he had made at various times he had
always kept. We had come to respect him. He seemed to be what he pretended
to be.'
At no stage before the BCCI denouement, Mr Clifford said, did he know that
his bank was controlled by BCCI. He dealt with it mostly for practical
convenience because it was easier to correspond with BCCI and Mr Abedi than
with the 14 individual investors.
Mr Clifford also flatly denied he had improperly profited from the
relationship, as charged on Wednesday. For years, he said, he only drew a
salary of Dollars 50,000 a year, at a time when the chairman of the biggest
local rival bank was earning Dollars 1.5m.
Senator John Kerry of Massachussetts yesterday charged that the government
of Abu Dhabi has stopped co-operating with the US investigation of BCCI.
This was immediately denied by Mr Ahmed al-Sayegh, representative of the
BCCI majority shareholders group.
Meanwhile, a US federal judge has ordered the Abu Dhabi royal family to
forfeit Dollars 104m invested in ICIC Investments Ltd, which she desribed as
'the alter ego' of one or more of the BCCI corporate defendants. Judge Joyce
Hens Green drew attention to the conmingling of funds in the complex BCCI
network.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US HOUSE of Representatives has voted to keep alive the Dollars 40bn
American space station project, despite criticism both of its cost and of
its scientific utility.
Although opponents of the costly project had hoped their cause would profit
from a new eagerness to tackle extravagant government spending, the House
voted 237:181 (almost exactly the same margin as a year ago) against
cancelling the station.
'In difficult economic times, the Congress stood up and did what's right for
the future,' said Mr Daniel Goldin, administrator of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa), who has led ferocious lobbying
to preserve the space station.
But Congressman David Obey charged that many in Congress had been swayed by
Nasa contracts placed in their districts.
Even so, the House voted only Dollars 1.7bn for the space station in the
1993 fiscal year - Dollars 500m less than the Bush administration had
requested.
A Senate committee yesterday voted Dollars 2.1bn for the project, which
would probably fall behind its aim to launch the station in 1995, if it
received only the Dollars 1.7bn agreed by the House.

<TEXT>
IRAQI President Saddam Hussein made key changes in his cabinet yesterday,
sacking his finance minister and moving the foreign minister to the finance
job, agencies report from Baghdad.
Diplomats attributed the dismissal of finance minister Majeed Abed Jaafar to
Iraq's grave economic problems under UN sanctions, still in place 17 months
after the army was driven from Kuwait.
The sanctions have blocked oil sales abroad, Iraq's main source of income.
The country also has high inflation and a crisis over forged banknotes.
Foreign minister Ahmed Hussein al-Samaraei, who entered the cabinet after
the Gulf war, takes over the Finance Ministry even though he has held no
previous economic post. He rose through the military branch of the ruling
Ba'ath Party and was formerly an ambassador. His move from the Foreign
Ministry follows criticism of his handling of Iraq's latest confrontation
with the United Nations over weapons inspections, according to Associated
Press.
Michael Littlejohns adds from the UN in New York: Iraqi forces using heavy
artillery have attacked civilian targets in Shia villages in the southern
part of the country and committed 'massive human rights violations',
according to reports the UN believes are reliable. Mr Max van der Stoel,
special representative of the UN human rights commission, appealed to
Baghdad to end 'intentionally repressive policies'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ZIMBABWE is seeking a hefty increase in foreign aid to help cover emergency
drought relief in a year of economic gloom, according to the 1992-93 budget
which was presented to parliament yesterday.
The finance minister, Mr Bernard Chidzero, said public spending would be cut
to 41 per cent of GDP from 49 per cent last year, and the budget deficit
(before aid grants) is forecast at 9 per cent of GDP in 1992-1993, the same
as in the previous year.
Mr Chidzero has budgeted for an increased deficit of ZDollars 2bn (Pounds
209.4m) after aid grants of ZDollars 800m. Aid in the past year amounted to
ZDollars 349m.
The main tax change in the financial package is the imposition of a 5 per
cent drought surcharge on individual taxpayers for the current year and
payable by companies during both the 1992 and 1993 tax years.
During the current year individuals will pay a top rate of 57.75 per cent,
while the effective rate of corporate tax rises to 44.6 per cent for the
next two years when the drought levy is included.
Mr Chidzero said inflation was the country's number one problem. It was
running at more than 36 per cent on an annual basis at the end of May and
was expected to average 40-45 per cent for 1992. He added, however, that the
government was committed to its 18-month-old economic reform plan as 'the
only way forward even in these difficult times'.

HOPES of a breakthrough in South Africa's political stalemate rose yesterday

Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, the ANC secretary general, said the two sides had met to
discuss the release of remaining political prisoners, one of the central
conditions for the resumption of constitutional talks.
The news came as Mr Pik Botha, the South African foreign minister, announced
that the government had 'no objection to the presence of impartial and
objective observers' from the United Nations as monitors of next week's
two-day general strike. About 10 UN officials would observe the
demonstrations. They are scheduled to leave for South Africa today and
remain for two weeks.
The government move, supporting a proposal made earlier by Mr Nelson
Mandela, the ANC president, will help ease the tension likely to surround a
week of industrial action intended to force the speedy transition to a
majority rule government.
Mr Ramaphosa said Mr Vance, who leaves Johannesburg today at the end of his
10-day fact finding visit, had 'facilitated contact between the ANC and the
government to ensure the release of all remaining political prisoners'.
Mr Botha led the government delegation at Tuesday's meeting; Mr Thabo Mbeki,
director of international affairs, led the ANC team. It is the first
official meeting since the ANC pulled out of all negotiations after the
Boipatong massacre on June 17.
More than 400 political prisoners were still being held in South Africa and
the homeland territories, Mr Ramaphosa said. 'A further meeting is scheduled
for the near future,' he said, adding that the ANC expected the prisoners to
be released before Mr Vance's departure this evening.
Mr Vance, who met President FW de Klerk in Pretoria yesterday for the second
time, said afterwards that he hoped to report to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali,
the UN secretary general, next week.
Mr Vance said he believed existing structures could be used to help solve
the country's problems, a reference to last year's national peace accord
signed by all leading parties and to the Goldstone Judicial Commission
investigating political violence.
Mr Ramaphosa said a 'hitch' had arisen because of the non-arrival of a
'communication' from Mr Kobie Coetsee, the justice minister. But he
understood that Mr Vance had raised the problem at his meeting yesterday
with Mr de Klerk. 'We have reason to believe that he will stress the
seriousness of this matter with the state president . . . a quick resolution
to this problem of political prisoners is one of those steps that the
government needs to take,' Mr Ramaphosa said.

already claiming victory in next Sunday's polls

<TEXT>
CROATIA'S president is already claiming victory in next Sunday's elections -
the first test of his nationalist government since its fight for
independence from Yugoslavia led to a bloody war with Serbia.
Mr Franjo Tudjman, a 70-year-old former Communist army general, says the war
is over as far as Croatia is concerned. 'It was won a long time ago. It was
won when we prevented Yugoslav and Serb authorities from overthrowing the
authorities in Croatia.'
The opposition parties, however, dismiss this notion. They say the price of
independence was the loss of 10,000 lives and control over a quarter of
Croatian territory, now patrolled by United Nations peacekeepers.
The country, which was recognised by the international community, is now
providing refuge to some 700,000 people displaced by the war in Bosnia and
Croatia.
They also charge that the ruling Croatian Democratic Union (CDU), since
coming to power in April 1990 on a vow to win independence, has failed to
introduce democracy and monopolised the political agenda. The CDU has purged
the press by sacking unsympathetic journalists and maintains an iron grip
over Croatian television.
Nonetheless, Mr Tudjman and his CDU look set to do well in Sunday's poll,
which will elect both the president and the new parliament. This is partly
because the war has been so painful that many Croatians fear further change,
and partly because of the way the government has organised the elections.
There are fears that the government's failure to announce the number of
voters until tomorrow leaves open the possibility of election rigging.
Mr Zarko Puhovski, a professor of political philosophy at Zagreb University,
said: 'Elections cannot work in a state in which there is no way of knowing
how many voters there are until the Saturday before the ballot.'
It has not yet been announced whether polling booths will be open in the
zones disputed with Serbia, which are under UN protection.
Croatian voters abroad will be allowed to vote and the recent move to allow
some 800,000 Bosnian Croats to have dual citizenship appears to indicate
they, too, will be voting. They are expected to cast their ballot for Mr
Tudjman or extreme nationalist parties, for their political and military
support.
The role of the UN peacekeepers (UNPROFOR) has been crucial in the election
campaign. 'The bottom line on this issue with almost all opposition parties
is that they say: we don't need UNPROFOR, it is partisan and favours the
Serbs and we have to diminish its role if we can't throw it out all
together,' explains Mr Puhovski.
The war has given rise to ultranationalism throughout Croatia. Mr Dobrosav
Paraga, leader of the Croat Party of Rights and the Croatian Defence Force,
its military wing, has campaigned on the slogan 'UNPROFOR go home'.
His party is expected to win support especially in the war-torn regions. He
calls for Croatia to extend its borders east to the city limits of Belgrade,
the capital of Serbia.
His fiery appeals to Croats to 'burn Serbian cities' will win him support
among the more desperate section of the population. But Mr Tudjman is likely
to ride high for having at least achieved independence for his country.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Ogata to discuss refugee 'safe zones'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MRS SADAKO OGATA, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said
yesterday she would discuss the creation of 'safe zones' for victims of
conflict in Bosnia-Hercegovina with Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN
secretary-general.
Although the UNHCR has serious reservations about the idea, Mrs Ogata came
under pressure to pursue it at Wednesday's conference in Geneva on the
refugee crisis in former Yugoslavia.
How the zones would be protected and by whom, given the UN's overstretched
resources, is one key issue. The UNHCR also fears that moving people into
'safe zones' could encourage 'ethnic cleansing' - the forced expulsion of
ethnic minorities from their homes.
However, there appears to be growing support for the idea of 'preventive
protection' of existing mixed areas where the presence of international aid
workers and monitors could deter expulsions, now running at up to 10,000 a
day.
A meeting of the 'follow-up committee' to Wednesday's conference, involving
38 countries directly concerned, also commissioned the UNHCR to study the
legal implications of according temporary asylum to those fleeing the former
Yugoslavia. Baroness Chalker, UK overseas development minister, has said she
opposes creating a special refugee category for this group alone.
However, other governments think 'temporary protected status', as applied in
the US, which would not grant permanent resettlement rights, would make it
easier to keep their borders open.
The meeting also discussed the aid needs of countries buckling under the
pressure of refugees, such as Croatia, Slovenia and Hungary.
Defence and foreign ministry officials from the Western European Union met
in Rome yesterday to draw up contingency plans for military protection for
humanitarian convoys, Reuter reports.
The meeting began among growing signs that the US and its European allies
were moving towards the idea of a limited use of force in the Yugoslav
conflict, at least to guarantee the safe-passage of relief supplies to
crisis areas.
In London, now Lord Owen has urged Mr John Major, the prime minister, 'not
to accept the conventional wisdom that nothing can be done militarily. . .
.' Nato had powers 'to stop by threat of force' use or movement of military
aircraft, tanks, armoured vehicles ot artillery in former Yugoslav
territory.
Canada yesterday said it will grant residence to 26,000 refugees from former
Yugoslavia, Reuter reports.

   MILAN ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Oscar Luigi Scalfaro of Italy yesterday severely rebuked Mr
Vincenzo Scotti, the Christian Democrat politician who resigned as foreign
minister on Wednesday. He indicated that he viewed the widely criticised
resignation as unjustified at a time of severe economic crisis and rising
organised crime, which have severely damaged the country's image abroad.
The prime minister, Mr Giuliano Amato, last night tried to calm fears that
the resignation could trigger instability in his month-old government. He
told parliament that he himself would temporarily act as foreign minister
and would not be rushed into any decisions on a replacement for Mr Scotti,
whose departure he presented as an internal party matter.
The resignation was badly received on the financial markets, with both the
lira and the Milan stock market under pressure. Dealers said the move
implied further tensions in government and party.
Shares on the Milan bourse fell to their lowest level this year, while the
lira declined against the D-Mark after a period of relative calm earlier
this week. The lira slipped to 756.25 against the D-Mark, after being fixed
at 755.91 on Wednesday. Italian government bond futures prices in London
dropped more than a full point from Wednesday's 92.71 closing.
Mr Scotti resigned over a new Christian Democrat policy which says that
members who are ministers should renounce their parliamentary seats. The
doctrine has encountered some hostility in the party, and Mr Scotti
evidently valued his Naples constituency more than his ministerial post.
The resignation highlights the extent of internal differences among
Christian Democrats, who have been without a leader since Mr Arnaldo Forlani
stepped down soon after the April 5 general election.
President Scalfaro, a Christian Democrat before becoming head of state,
accused Mr Scotti of irresponsibility. 'If instead of serving the interests
of the people, factional interests are allowed to take priority over the
interests of the state, then this is a crime against the state.'
France and Italy appealed yesterday for an urgent meeting of EC interior and
justice ministers to stop the spread of organised crime, Reuter reports from
Rome.
It is feared the Mafia will try to exploit the ending of border controls
inside the Community on January 1. Action to stop money laundering and a
German proposal for a common EC police force are likely to be high on the
agenda.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Business chiefs join call for devaluation of sterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER, IVO DAWNAY, and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TREASURY yesterday rejected demands for the government to change its
economic policies as two senior business leaders joined calls for a
realignment of the European exchange rate mechanism.
Outspoken comments from Mr Brian Pearse, Midland Bank chief executive, and
Sir Denys Henderson, ICI chairman, indicated the growing willingness of
businessmen to speak out about the problems caused by sterling's high value
within the ERM.
Professor Douglas McWilliams, economic adviser to the Confederation of
British Industry, said businessmen were increasingly worried that the
government was not doing enough to influence the economy. 'They are not
marching on Downing Street yet,' he said. 'But they are very restive.'
Treasury officials insisted a realignment of currencies in the ERM was 'not
on the agenda' and that the government was determined to stick by its policy
of no devaluation of sterling in the European Monetary System - a position
strongly emphasised by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, in an interview in
today's Daily Express.
As long as France refuses to allow the D-Mark to revalue against the franc,
the Treasury sees no prospect of a change in ERM relationships. British
officials have in any case made clear that the UK will not devalue sterling
against the D-Mark.
Mr Pearse told Reuters newsagency in an interview, however: 'It's no good
slavishly sticking to the ERM only to find that we have no business left at
the end of it all. It does mean doing something so that the currencies are
realigned.'
He warned that Midland did not foresee any growth in the UK until there was
'quite a substantial cut in interest rates'. Speaking on ITV News at Ten, he
quantified this as a cut of about 3 percentage points. A rise in rates would
be 'absolutely disastrous'.
Sir Denys told the BBC that Mr Lamont and his European counterparts 'should
look very hard at some kind of general realignment . . .because there is no
doubt that those of us who are big exporters are finding sterling at a
pretty high level against the D-Mark and, even more importantly, against the
dollar'.
Speaking on Channel 4 News, he was also sharply critical of government
economic policy, saying: 'If the price for zero inflation is zero growth,
then for me that's too high a price to pay.'
While German reunification had made it 'very difficult', he said, Britain
had entered the ERM at too high a rate and it 'had to face up to that'.
While the Labour party ruled out support for a cheaper pound, Mr David Kern,
chief economist of National Westminster Bank, said sterling's rate against
the dollar was a serious problem, although it was only slightly overvalued
against the D-Mark.
He saw Dollars 1.40 to the pound as appropriate against yesterday's London
close of just under Dollars 1.92.

FT  31 JUL 92 / World News in Brief: UK competitors sent home in drugs
scandal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Three British compet-itors were sent home in disgrace from the Barcelona
Olympics after positive drug tests, in what is one of the most damaging
scandals in Britain's Olympic history.
Expelled before competing were Jason Livingston, 21, a 100m runner, and
weightlifters Andrew Saxton, above, and Andrew Davies, both 25. The drugs
tests were conducted in the UK earlier this month, with the results made
public yesterday. Livingston tested positive for the anabolic steroid
Methandianone. He is known as 'Baby Ben' because of his resemblance to his
hero, Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson, who was stripped of the 100m Olympic
gold medal at Seoul four years ago after failing a drug test.
Davies and Saxton, shown yesterday after returning to his home at Cowley,
Oxford, gave test samples containing Clenbuterol, a banned stimulant. Saxton
protested his innocence. UK sports minister Robert Key promised there would
be 'no hiding place' for cheats.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Company car tax changes proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 200,000 UK executives driving high-specification company cars face
steep increases in their income tax bills under proposals announced by the
Inland Revenue yesterday.
They face a 40 per cent rise in the tax payable on the private benefit of
their cars, under the proposals for a system based mainly on 12 price bands.
But the Revenue claims that 1.2m out of a total of 1.9m company car drivers
would benefit from a revised structure for company car taxation set out in a
consultative document. Their tax bills could fall by up to 25 per cent under
the review, foreshadowed by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, in his 1992
Budget.
The Revenue is aiming to create a fairer company car taxation structure
while encouraging businesses to use more fuel-efficient vehicles.
It is partly a response to persistent claims by business that the current
system, based on a combination of only five price and engine size bands,
discriminates against essential company car users in favour of low-mileage
'perk' cars. The existing system has also been criticised by the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission for distorting the new car market by causing bunching
of models just below the price and engine size breakpoints.
At the heart of the Revenue's proposed system are a dozen new bands, based
wholly on price and stretching up to Pounds 60,000. Apart from engine
capacity bands, the current system, described as outdated and crude by the
Revenue, has only two price thresholds, at Pounds 19,250 and Pounds 29,000,
above which the assessed tax benefit to the user rises sharply.
Launching the document, Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the
Treasury, said the current system 'to some extent fails the fairness test'.
At its most extreme, it meant that the driver of a basic 1.8 litre Ford
Fiesta diesel paid the same tax as that of a Mercedes 190.
While the Revenue stressed that the proposals form only the basis of a
consultation process, the essentials of the plan are likely to remain
largely intact when the final scheme is announced by Mr Lamont in his Budget
speech in the spring.
It is expected that the revised system will not be introduced before the
spring of 1994, to avoid creating further uncertainty in this year's already
severely depressed UK new car market.
The size of the increase entailed for many 'perk' users is expected to
encounter growing resistance when companies begin seriously to digest the
Revenue's proposals today.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Dixons' Pounds 1m to aid study into ethics of business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR STANLEY Kalms, the elec-tronics dealer who turned a modest photo business
into the Dixons group of 1,500 shops, said yesterday the company was
donating Pounds 1m to the London Business School to promote the study of
business ethics.
That is small beer in comparison with the tens of millions spent by Dixons
in deadly contests waging and resisting hostile takeovers. But it might,
perhaps, help to make the takeover market a little more gentlemanly when it
begins again after the recession.
For Mr Kalms, who never attended university and began in his Polish-born
father's photo business at the age of 16, joint ventures with the likes of
London Business School are novel. But - no stranger to heated disputation -
he would have a distinctive contribution to make to the LBS seminar circuit.
The Dixons funding will be used to create a chair - one of the first of its
kind in the UK - and a 'major research and teaching programme' in business
ethics and social responsibility. The aim, says the LBS, is to create 'a
European flagship programme in the area'.
Its claims on that score will not go undisputed. Manchester Business School
believes it got there first, with its Co-op Bank chair of Corporate
Responsibility, set up last year and about to be filled.
The LBS stresses 'pressures' and 'processes' as the core of business ethics;
the words 'right' and 'wrong' do not appear to feature.
'Businesses have responsibilities to many different constituencies -
employees, customers, shareholders, local residents, the wider public and
the environment - creating conflicting pressures,' says Professor George
Bain, the dean at the LBS.
'It is vital that managers are made aware of how to manage the process of
reconciling those pressures.'
Dixons is no stranger to ethics controversies. In the late 1980s it was
caught up in a storm about the surveillance of former employees during a
hostile takeover bid. A private detective employed by the company was jailed
for bugging, unbeknown to Mr Kalms, the phones of former employees.
Explaining his donation, Mr Kalms said ethics training should be 'a part of
the ordinary process of skill development for managers'.
Maximising return for shareholders? 'You should still maximise it, but in a
framework of responsibility,' he responded.
If MBA students at the LBS will do their 'ethics management' between stints
on marketing and balance sheets, the Co-op and Manchester Business School
appear more at ease with the ancient verities.
Mr Terry Thomas, the Co-op Bank's managing director, explained the purpose
of their funding: 'The post-war years have seen the development of the mind
of the corporation: it's now overdue for the heart and soul of companies to
receive equivalent attention.'

FT  31 JUL 92 / ICI sets out radical plan to split its operations: Two units
envisaged to cover drugs and bulk chemicals operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPERIAL Chemical Industries yesterday signalled the European chemicals
industry's most important shake-up since the second world war by proposing
to split itself into two separate companies.
Under the radical proposal, ICI, founded in 1926, would float off its drugs
and agrochemicals operations, to be known as ICI Bio, as a separate
publicly-listed company. The remaining bulk chemical business would be known
as ICI.
The company also said ICI Bio would plan to raise cash through a share issue
at the time of the demerger.
The surprise move was welcomed by analysts, although some said the company
still had to answer questions about the allocation of debt and tax
liabilities before the demerger's benefits could be evaluated. In spite of
poor half-year results announced yesterday, ICI's shares ended 76p up at
Pounds 11.71.
Sir Denys Henderson would be chairman of the two groups which would continue
to share the headquarters at Millbank in London for at least two years.
Mr Ronnie Hampel, presently chief operating officer, would be chief
executive of ICI. Mr David Barnes, presently a board member with
responsibility for the Americas and Europe, would become chief executive of
ICI Bio.
Shareholders would receive one share in each of the new companies for every
existing ICI share.
ICI, with a turnover of about Pounds 9bn, would drop from number five in the
world chemicals industry to number seven. The pharmaceuticals company, with
turnover of about Pounds 4bn, would become the world's ninth largest drugs
group.
The decision to draw up detailed plans to split the company was taken in
December last year, seven months after Lord Hanson surprised the City by
taking a 2.8 per cent stake in the chemicals giant, prompting speculation
that he might make a bid.
The proposal was put forward by Mr John Mayo of SG Warburg, ICI's financial
adviser. Mr Mayo, a 36-year-old corporate finance director at Warburg,
worked with a small team on the proposal for four months. It was
unofficially put to the board in April, and was finally approved in
principle on Wednesday.
A final decision on whether to demerge will not be taken until the
publication of the group's preliminary results in February 1993. Sir Denys
said the proposals would allow the separate groups to take part more fully
in the coming restructuring of the world's chemicals industry.
'For the businesses, the move would provide the chance to seize
opportunities for global expansion from a firm financial platform,' Sir
Denys said.
'Each of the new groupings would enable each company to respond better to
future opportunities.
'ICI now comprises two distinct families of businesses with the same values,
but very different technologies, operating requirements and market needs.'
Analysts argue that the separation would also make the two groups far less
vulnerable to takeover. ICI's Bio would be too expensive for a contested
takeover. The group's remaining operations would be unattractive as a
target.
Lord White, chairman of Hanson Industries, the conglomerate's North American
arm, and partner of Lord Hanson, said yesterday: 'If ICI had not spent so
much time during the last year fighting a bid that was never made and spent
it on seeing how it could improve shareholder value it might have come up
with a better solution a lot earlier.'
The plan would represent one of the largest restructurings of the European
chemicals industry since the Allies broke up I G Farben of Germany.
The plan envisages ICI consisting of its existing paints, materials,
industrial chemicals and explosives businesses. ICI Bio would have the
pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, seeds and remaining specialty chemicals
operations.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Survey of Yorkshire and Humberside (7) County of deceptive
power - Tradition of stoicism cushioned West Yorkshire from recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEEDS, Bradford, Halifax, Huddersfield, Dewsbury and Wakefield are the
cities and towns of West Yorkshire, a county of deceptive power. This is
where the brass is made, or money as it is called elsewhere. The figures
prove it.
With 40 per cent of the 5m population of Yorkshire and Humberside, West
Yorkshire contributes 43 per cent of the region's gross domestic product of
about Pounds 34bn, itself about 8 per cent of the UK's total.
The county is deceptive in that it never seems this powerful. Topography and
geography are the reasons. The communities are scattered in dales, separated
by Pennine mountains and hills that have never allowed their coalescence
into a large conurbation, as has been the case with Greater Manchester, West
Yorkshire's bigger neighbour.
Yet the two counties, straddling the Pennines and joined by the spinal M62,
are the twin main engines of the northern economy. The war of the roses -
red against white - is mainly between these two nowadays. West Yorkshire may
be 20 per cent smaller - perhaps because its communities never coalesced -
but it is the giant of the east Pennine region and underpins the Yorkshire
and Humberside economy.
South Yorkshire accounts for 23 per cent of regional GDP, Humberside for 19
per cent and North Yorkshire for only 15 per cent. West Yorkshire dominates
and provides the regional capital in Leeds, a city of 750,000 people showing
little sign of serious population decline. Its full range of financial and
professional services now competes nationally.
The region has more than 120 quoted companies, nearly two-thirds of them in
West Yorkshire. In Leeds alone, there are 14,000 businesses - about one for
every 50 people. Industry and commerce in the county as a whole is spread
through a wide range of sectors, such as engineering, textiles,
construction, retail, chemicals, electricals, food and miscellaneous
industrials.
It also houses Britain's most powerful concentration of building societies.
The Halifax, the Bradford and Bingley, the Leeds and Leeds Permanent are not
so named by accident, but after their places of birth.
Recession is not absent from West Yorkshire, but it arrived late and has had
nothing like the impact it had in 1980 - 82. 'I still have plenty of clients
who ask, 'What recession?',' says Mr Peter Bancroft of the Leeds office of
Haines Watts, the national accountancy firm specialising in small and
medium-sized unquoted businesses.
Variety, spread, diversity - and a relatively small service sector when
compared with the south-east - cushioned the economy, says Mr John Siddall,
Leeds' economic development officer.
Not everything has survived. Mr Siddall says Leeds' clothing manufacturers
are 'evaporating', but he points to Leeds having the lowest unemployment
rate - 9 per cent - of any city in the UK.
Lessons have been learned since 1982. Companies knew not to overborrow, but
to build cash reserves and spread their customer base. Mr Peter
Coles-Johnson, chief executive of Leeds chamber of commerce, says the region
accounts for a disproportionately high 11 per cent of UK exports. Practiced
West Yorkshire companies chased sales abroad as soon as southern English
markets started to falter.
There is also considerable intra-regional trading, says Mr Ken Denton of the
Huddersfield-based Kirklees and Wakefield chamber. He says there is also a
tradition of stoicism among older companies, whose owner-managers never
spend to the limit of their corporate income, or borrow heavily against it,
and save profits from good times to tide them over the bad.
This is seen locally as prudence, however much it was criticised as
unadventurous by some London analysts when the national economy was booming.
West Yorkshire also has something else on its side - location. It is at the
nexus of the M62, M1 and A1, and is only 50 minutes from Hull. Nowhere has
this advantage been better exploited than by Wakefield, the metropolitan
borough through which all three roads pass. This is now one of the most
attractive places for high value-added manufacturing and distributive
industries.
Wakefield suffered from pit closures in the 1980s and still has a residue of
unemployment from them, but the most recent job losses - about 300 at Asda -
are more the result of that company's reorganisation than national economic
factors.
In any event, Procter &amp; Gamble is bringing in 350 new jobs in the autumn,
relocating its Cover Girl cosmetics business from Bournemouth. This is not
even unusual: Mr Richard Fung, principal inward investment officer, says
Wakefield has won 50 large investments in the past four years.
The biggest were a Pounds 50m Coca Cola canning factory and a Pounds 20m
plant built by Pioneer to allow the Japanese consumer electronics company to
attack European markets. Two big inquiries - each involving 400,000 sq ft
factories are nearing completion. They will join such businesses as Netto,
Superdrug and Safeway. Del Monte's presence is a large banana ripening
centre.
The borough council also expects Wakefield to house the region's 20-acre
Channel Tunnel terminal, a joint venture with Amec and Railfreight
Distribution, offering rail-road flexibility on a 400-acre site called Port
Wakefield on the M62 between the M1 and A1.
Apart from some relatively minor steel and coal closure money from the EC,
Wakefield has achieved all this with no help from the public purse.
There are some parts of West Yorkshire that need such support, however.
Leeds' inner city has the most pressing case, although the city's image of
general prosperity has prevented its getting all it needs.
Mr Martin Eagland, chief executive of Leeds Development Corporation, a
government agency, says the organisation is now constantly short of funds
because the scale of the job it had to do was initially underestimated.
'The estimation was when the market was in a much more confident state,' he
says. The view was that Leeds would not need so much, but infrastructure
improvements, such as basic drainage on some sites at Pounds 1m a time, were
not foreseen at all. Mr Eagland only needs Pounds 10m a year to operate as
effectively he would like, but has to make to do on Pounds 8m.
Generally, Leeds gets only two-thirds of the level of funding of comparable
urban development corporations in Sheffield or Manchester - Pounds 65m over
its lifetime against about Pounds 100m for the other cities. It has given
good value, levering Pounds 4 from the private sector for every Pounds 1
from the taxpayer and creating 6,000 jobs.
Leeds' great coup - with Mr Eagland and Mr Siddall both active - has been
the capture of the Royal Armouries from the Tower of London. They will move
to a purpose-built museum in 1995 in the heart of the city, but Mr Eagland
worries lest his underfunding prevents the right incentives attracting
associated developments.
Mr Jon Trickett, leader of Leeds City Council, says West Yorkshire's general
prosperity should not be allowed to mask the problems of an emergent, inner
city underclass. 'We have new tower cranes going up, but I fear the emotions
building up in the inner city. People need jobs, but they can't get them
without training. And of course they need better housing.'
Leeds failed to get City Challenge urban funding because it did not involve
the inner city community closely enough in its bid.
Mr Trickett says: 'We genuinely feared what might happen if we failed and
they felt let down. They are surrounded by success and affluence. It could
well have sparked off something.'

FT  31 JUL 92 / Survey of Yorkshire and Humberside (8) Financial sector
takes off - Regional strength is reflected in professional services industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YORKSHIRE and Humberside have a thriving new industry which has grown
rapidly in the past eight years. Mr Richard Wilson, joint senior partner of
Gordons Wright &amp; Wright, a Bradford solicitor, sums up why.
'It is the M62 which has made the difference, together with the network of
roads feeding into it,' he says. 'The north can now operate as a business
centre regardless of London. In the past it was harder to get about locally
and all road and rail networks converged on London like a spider's web.
People went there for everything.'
The new industry is in financial and professional services. The base for it
already existed, but was fragmented. It came together in the 1980s, about 10
years after the M62's completion, at a time when London prices were upwardly
mobile.
By 1987, more and more companies were using local firms, even if they kept
the names of some London firms in their annual accounts for prestige
reasons. London was expensive and its firms were becoming big and anonymous.
Yorkshire corporate leaders were not serviced by the top partners and often
not even by the same junior one on successive visits to the capital.
Only merchant banking was in local short supply. Mr Alan Bottomley, senior
partner of what was then AV Hammond, another firm of Bradford solicitors,
was one of the first senior West Yorkshire professionals to demand that
solitary London merchant bankers get on the train to Bradford, where all the
other professionals associated with a deal could gather in half an hour,
rather than the locals taking a mob-handed journey in the opposite
direction.
A lot has happened since. AV Hammond broke out of Bradford and is now
Hammond Suddards, one of the Leeds 'big five'. All five are all in the top
10 law firms by size outside London and their combined critical mass is one
of the reasons why Leeds now enjoys a reputation as Britain's most
significant legal centre after the capital.
In 1987, three of the others - Booth &amp; Co, Hepworth &amp; Chadwick and Simpson
Curtis - boasted they employed 500 people between them. It is double that
now. The fifth, Dibb Lupton, has since joined forces with Broomhead, the
Sheffield leader, and added the Manchester-based Priors, to create a
powerful empire straddling the Pennines and Peaks.
London offices, coupled in some cases with links to similar corporate law
firms in other large cities, mean that all now compete in the national
market. Size and spread, however, are not prerequisites for success.
Brooke, North and Goodwin manages with 'only' 11 partners and 60 staff in
Leeds but has only half its work in Yorkshire and Humberside. Mr Michael
Goodwin says size may attract some big clients but all clients want value
for money and quality.
Leeds legal partners cost half London levels, an important selling point,
but what about local competition? 'Although we are competitors and would
each like to do all the work available, we recognise the strength of acting
together through the Leeds finance forum,' says Mr Martin Shaw, managing
partner of Simpson Curtis.
Mr Peter Smart of Walker Morris, however, says: 'The issue is not so much
costs as accessibility. We are acting for Kalon in their bid for Manders and
can get to the company in about 15 minutes.'
Walker Morris, a solicitor employing under 200 people in 1988, has often
been in the shadow of the big five from a publicity point of view, but has
just got on with it. It now has 25 partners with an average age of about 35,
a total complement of around 300 and is still growing and recruiting.
'It's only just coming home to London firms that Leeds is a major force,' Mr
Smart says. 'We are not competing so much for London's international work,
but within the UK, and the north in particular, where companies have decided
they don't want to go to London any more for their services.'
He believes an important transformation is under way in Leeds, with clients
becoming more selective and picking specialists outside their main advisers
for specific jobs. This applies to all professions. A company might, for
example, use one of the big six national accountants for its audit, but
another for tax work and yet another for some specialised consultancy.
Mr Smart believes this keeps advisers on their toes - making them offer
keener prices to bread-and-butter clients - while providing the chance to
prospect for a wider range of business from a temporary client for a
specialised service.
He also says the rise of Leeds has been noticed abroad: when overseas
companies now do business in the north, they no longer turn automatically to
London. For example, Walker Morris acts for Netto, the Netherlands retailer,
which is expanding in the north.
Mr Gordon Horsfield of Price Waterhouse, the accountants, agrees that the
use of second advisers for specialist functions is growing. PW, which
employs 320 in Leeds, audits 11 of the 50 largest quoted companies in the
region but does other work for another nine. 'There is a growing
transactional basis for buying services and less one-stop shopping,' he
says.
Peat Marwick, which also audits 11 of the top 50, has a similar spread of
specialists on offer.
Mr Ralph Preece, partner-in-charge of corporate special services at Touche
Ross, sees considerable opportunities arising as the recession ends. 'There
is a growing realisation by the banks that you can't look at businesses in
terms of fixed assets.
'A company's major asset comes in at eight, goes home at seven and is on
site 365 days a year. Bank managers are not skilled at evaluating such
people. We are. We have seen a lot of corporate failure and corporate
success. We will do that work. We are doing a lot already.'
This is crucial work, because there is a shortage of debt. However, one
thing that will probably never be in short supply in Yorkshire and
Humberside is equity finance. Where few venture capitalists ventured in the
early 1980s, a dozen now compete.
The regional network of professionals helps them greatly. All the big
accountants have active corporate finance departments and the lawyers have
plenty of dealmakers. Merchant banking and development capital services are
on hand at County NatWest, Lloyds, Singer &amp; Friedlander and NM Rothschild.
Henry Cooke and BWD Rensburg offer a range of services from stockbroking to
corporate finance.
All stand ready to compete with each other - or combine to get a piece of
any syndicated action if they cannot win outright or the deal is too big for
them. Good businesses on the lookout for capital do not have to look for
long. Deals can be done in an afternoon because most offices are walking
distance from each other.
Mr David Wilkinson, the 3i director for the region, says his three offices
in Leeds, Hull and Sheffield did 56 deals last year - exactly the same
number as in the preceding 12 months, but Pounds 29m was invested, against
Pounds 18m in 1990.
'The trend is continuing this year. We have put about Pounds 150m into our
Yorkshire and Humberside portfolio. Of course there is a recession but there
are plenty of opportunities to invest in some good, solid businesses.'
It is this, the local market, that has spawned Leeds' new professional
service sector. It does not appear much damaged by the recession. This must
say something about the underlying strength of the regional economy.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Survey of Yorkshire and Humberside (5) A long wait for
better times - Sheffield's recovery has been delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THESE ARE frustrating times for Sheffield. It was battered in the last
recession, boosted in the late 1980s and the city is now waiting, edgily,
for its promised new dawn. It seems a long time coming.
This should have been when all the effort ploughed into public/private
sector partnership and derelict land reclamation in recent years, coupled
with heavy investment in important new sporting and retail facilities,
combined to produce dramatic growth in the city's economy.
Instead, the recession has put on the brakes, leaving Sheffield with a
patchwork of smart new developments alongside vacant sites and blighted
properties awaiting better times.
Mr John Hambidge, chief executive of the Sheffield Chamber of Commerce, sums
it up: 'While we thought we were on the launchpad we've been hit by a
national recession and national lack of confidence. The property collapse
came at just the wrong time for us.'
The picture is not all gloom. The chamber's export documentation section is
working flat out to cope with a 15 per cent increase in work compared with
last year. Mr Hambidge says that Sheffield businesses which survived the
last manufacturing recession, which hit the city so hard, have learned
lessons and those with strong export and niche markets are even doing well.
He observes, however, that nowhere can insulate itself from a national
recession. And while the picture is more mixed in Sheffield than in some
more southerly parts of Britain, recession is biting, at least in the
short-term.
According to the city council's latest quarterly Economic Bulletin, the
increase in Sheffield's unemployment, currently 11.2 per cent, flattened out
in the first months of 1992, against the national trend, but looks likely to
rise over the coming months.
After losing 40,000 net jobs between 1981 and 1987, Sheffield gained 13,300
between 1987 and 1989, bringing its employment up to 233,400. But the
council estimates that there has been a net loss of 3,000 jobs in the past
two years. It reckons that 24.4 per cent of Sheffield's jobs now are in
manufacturing - 2.6 per cent down on 1989, with the service sector up from
65 per cent to 68.8 per cent.
The bulletin says that development starts and approvals in the city have hit
all-time lows, although developer interest remains relatively healthy.
The high degree of local ownership of companies and strong exporting
activity are helping to protect Sheffield's manufacturing sector.
Furthermore - again contrary to the national trend - its finance sector
looks set for jobs growth.
This is mainly thanks to Norwich Union's choice of Sheffield for its
northern headquarters, and Abbey National's decision to locate a new 200-job
share dealing base at the new Carbrook Hall Business park in the Lower Don
Valley.
The arrival of Norwich Union, which is now upgrading a listed building in
the city for its 900-job first phase), is highly significant, says Mr Rod
Jones, city council director of land and planning. 'It's crucial to the city
because it's blue chip.'
But this project, too, is not immune to recession; because of cuts
elsewhere, more Norwich Union staff are likely to transfer to Sheffield,
meaning fewer job opportunities for locals.
The Sheffield Development Corporation (SDC), formed in 1988 to regenerate
2,000 acres of the Lower Don Valley, Sheffield's traditional steel industry
heartland, and create 20,000 new jobs, says the recession has produced a
'definite slowdown', but it is pressing ahead with land reclamation and site
marketing.
So far, says the SDC, Pounds 484m of private sector investment has come into
its area: Stadium Developments' Pounds 400m Meadowhall complex, one of
Europe's biggest retail schemes; British Steel's trade centre; a massive
warehouse, and the Carbrook Hall business park.
In addition, work is about to start on the prominently sited Pounds 70m
Canal Basin redevelopment. At Meadowhall, a Retail Park is to open shortly;
anchor tenants include Toys R US.
'We tend to be slightly schizoid about Meadowhall,' Mr Hambidge admits.
This is hardly surprising, when Sheffield city centre retailers report drops
in their takings, since it opened, of between 4 per cent and 25 per cent.
Consultants are about to report on the city centre's current state and how
it can attract investors.
Disappointingly for all concerned, Sheffield failed in its City Challenge
bid this month - the city had hoped it would revitalise development of the
blighted shopping and markets area around the Haymarket.
The city centre may also face problems from Sheffield's new, partly
government-funded Pounds 240m Supertram; although its first phase, to
operate from late 1993, could bring shoppers in from Meadowhall it may
equally take them there from the city centre.
Better transport links are an important theme in the city's regeneration
plans. Work starts at the end of the year on the SDC's spine road through
the Lower Don Valley and negotiations are under way with airline operators
over routes to be offered from the proposed airport on the
Sheffield/Rotherham boundary, on a site currently being opencasted for coal.
Recently, Sheffield city council has suffered bad press because of financial
problems; it has to find savings of Pounds 13m this year and could face cuts
of Pounds 40m in 1993-1994. Leader Mr Mike Bower says it will sell property,
including investment opportunities, to raise money. But cuts and
redundancies look likely.
The council's financial problems reach back at least to the mid-1980s but
were compounded by its decision to host last summer's world student games,
which entailed capital expenditure of nearly Pounds 150m and left behind not
only outstanding sporting facilities but a Pounds 10.5m operating loss.
The games were intended to gild Sheffield's image; the losses have done the
reverse.
Yet while thinking so big in the cause of image improvement, the council
could perhaps help itself in more modest ways.
Weeds grow high on the traffic island which serves the city's central
shopping area. While the council has worked hard to create a 'cultural
industries quarter', with about Pounds 10m invested so far, it is
publicising this to passing motorists with a sign on a tatty building - as
yet unimproved, but prominently located - which is daubed with flyposters
for Megadeath's 'Symphony of Destruction' and Def Leppard's 'Seven Day
Weekend Tour'.
Mr Hambidge, a director of the company which controls the new sports
facilities, says they are pulling in top events and capacity audiences as
hoped.
But he says the swimming facilities and stadium are not expected to run at a
profit; the arena, it is hoped, will generate enough profit to cover their
deficits as well as contributing to capital costs.
To the east, in Doncaster, Kyle Stewart Properties has begun work on a
65-acre site owned by Doncaster borough council, adjacent to British Rail's
main east coast line. One mile from the M18, it is alongside one of BR's
three UK Train Operating Centres, intended as freight marshalling points for
Channel Tunnel traffic.
Doncaster council sees the 'Direct for Europe' project as a means of
capturing not only international freight handlers and warehousing
businesses, but also manufacturing companies operating Just In Time delivery
systems.
The council envisages a branch line leading from the site to BR's
marshalling sidings. But BR has chosen Wakefield for its Channel Tunnel
railport; it is still awaiting the result of a public inquiry about its
site.
'We believe the private sector will choose,' says a Doncaster council
spokesman.
For the council, the project would build on the town's long history as a
communications crossroads, a traditional confirmed by BMW's opening this
year of its new UK distribution centre at Doncaster.
Over in Rotherham, where tradition was rooted in coal and steel, a council
official admits - with refreshing candour - that there is little new to
report.
He reminisces about the postwar heyday, when 20,000 people, five times
today's total, worked in coal and steel in Rotherham. 'The employers were
interviewed by the potential employees in those days,' he says wistfully. It
seems a very long time ago.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Survey of Yorkshire and Humberside (6) How green is Dearne
Valley? - Pastoral landscape is simply a by-product of the decline of the
mining industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS almost dark, on a hot, sultry July night. Along little country lanes,
flanked by stone-built houses garlanded with roses, small groups of people
are sipping beer outside country pubs.
Can this really be the Dearne Valley, one of the UK's most devastated,
de-industrialised heartlands, a national unemployment blackspot suffering
from severe economic, environmental and social problems?
By day, admittedly, parts of the valley - such as the blackened, despoiled
Wath Manvers site, reputedly the UK's largest single area of dereliction -
look pretty grim.
But the slide back into a greener, almost pastoral landscape - noticeable on
such symbolic tracts of land as the site of the former Cortonwood colliery,
flashpoint of the 1984-1985 miners' strike - is one of the by-products of
the rundown of an industry which, in the last century, precipitated the
growth of the Valley's towns and villages, today home to 80,000 people.
The Dearne Valley, 20 square miles of what was the heart of the South
Yorkshire coalfield between Barnsley, Rotherham and Doncaster, epitomises
the problems and possibilities of the many communities in Britain where a
now vanishing mining industry shaped everyone's life.
Given the dearth of alternative employment in the valley - especially for
men - many local people would not surprisingly prefer coal mining to
greenery.
Local politicians such as Mr Hedley Salt, leader of Barnsley borough council
and chairman of the national Coalfield Communities Campaign, believe the
decimation of Britain's mining industry and consequent sterilisation of
reserves is criminally shortsighted.
But he and his colleagues have also concluded that, in areas where that
battle has been lost, their top priority must be economic diversification,
environmental upgrading and educational and community development.
This pragmatism has paid dividends; Barnsley is the only local authority to
have won the government's Pounds 37.5m City Challenge funding twice over:
first last year, as part of the Dearne Valley Partnership, with Doncaster
and Rotherham Councils; and this month, for Barnsley's north-east corridor.
A strong spirit of partnership with the private sector and the local
community was an important factor.
Coal mining in the Barnsley area, where the seams outcropped conveniently
near the surface, dates back to the middle ages, but its rapid expansion,
creating swift growth of the town and its surrounding villages, came in the
last century.
A few pits sunk in Victorian times, such as Houghton Main and Grimethorpe,
two of just three surviving collieries in Barnsley borough, cling on. But
their days are numbered: Mr Salt gives these two and Edwardian Goldthorpe,
the borough's other pit - and also the last in Dearne Valley - only five
years.
In the past decade, about 30,000 mining jobs have been lost from Barnsley
and the Dearne Valley; some of the area's remaining miners now commute up to
70 miles a day to the Selby complex. Many who took redundancy have learned
to their cost the difficulty of finding other work.
The Dearne Valley's problems are exacerbated by poor communications;
traditionally, coal was moved by rail and collieries were in walking and
cycling distance of home. Construction of link road from the M1 to the A1,
now under way, has been a top priority.
In a bold move to change the valley's culture, as well as its appearance,
the partnership has selected Sheffield University to produce a development
plan for a Pounds 100m university college, to be built on the Wath Manvers
site where four collieries, until a few years ago, disgorged their coal and
spoil.
The concept of a university on the doorstep is a big change in an area where
the Coal Board was a cradle-to-grave employer, and school staying-on rates
were low.
But change is already in the air around Barnsley and not only in the
greening of its environment. The council proudly promotes its track record
of inward investment, including Japanese roller bearings makers Koyo Seiko,
and talks of building a new enterprise culture.
There are more subtle changes too; Mr Salt, quite unprompted, apologises for
using the word manpower. 'It's not sexist,' he explains, 'Because it was men
who worked in the mines.' That too, underlines the area's revolution; male
employees in the Dearne Valley are now in a minority.
In 1984 the Yorkshire coalfield had 53 pits employing 52,000 men: now it
employs 14,596 at 21 collieries, mainly grouped around the North
Yorkshire/West Yorkshire border, in the Barnsley/Rotherham/Doncaster axis
and just over the county boundary in Nottinghamshire.
According to the widely-leaked Rothschild report only 14 pits, seven of them
in Yorkshire, would be fit for privatisation. On this basis, the Yorkshire
coalfield would shrink to a few isolated collieries, plus parts of the
Pounds 1.4bn Selby complex, which now produces British Coal's cheapest deep
mined coal.
Whether or not privatisation reduces the industry to such a small rump, more
Yorkshire collieries are certain to close as British Coal fights to reduce
its costs in order to compete against cheap imported coal and the new
generation of gas-fired stations.
North Sea gas is a threat; new combined cycle gas turbine stations are being
built by both National Power and PowerGen at Killingholme, south Humberside.
These plants are among eight large gas-fired stations proposed for the area
between the Humber estuary and the Wash.
Plans for a big new coal import terminal at Immingham, also South
Humberside, were shelved before the general election but could still be
revived, as National Power and Powergen, which currently buy 80 per cent of
British Coal's output, have yet to conclude negotiations over its supplies
to them after the present contract expires next March.
The Pounds 700m flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) project at the Drax power
station, which with Eggborough station takes the Selby pits' entire output,
is vital to coal's credibility as a suitable fuel for a more environmentally
aware age; the project will cut emissions of sulphur dioxide, a critical
element in acid rain, by 90 per cent. The first two FGD units will begin
operating next year at Drax, Western Europe's biggest power station; the
other four will be phased in up to 1996.
At Selby, whose five deep mines came into production between 1983 and 1991,
output reached 9m tonnes in 1991-1992. The complex, intended to produce
around 10m tonnes annually for more than 25 years, has struggled with
geological problems but in 1991/2 achieved 9m tonnes output. Yet, even so, a
nasty shock came earlier this year when British Coal announced 190 job cuts.
North Yorkshire County council is pressing the European Commission to make
its RECHAR and Objective II aid programmes available to Selby, to counter
employment decline in mining and electricity generation. It is also lobbying
for the Selby/Goole/Castleford/Pontefract area, which straddles three county
boundaries, to get UK government assisted area status.
All this can only heighten the stiff competition for new investment between
areas which share a common problem.
But Mr Salt refuses to be downhearted. 'It's not very many local government
politicians who ever have the chance to reshape their own community. With
the collapse of the mining industry, we have that opportunity. We're
grasping it with both hands.'

FT  31 JUL 92 / Survey of Yorkshire and Humberside (3) Humberside's surge
aids fight for life - The 'unloved' county closes a national gap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THIS AUTUMN, Sir John Banham is going to need his renowned skills of
analysis and diplomacy. It is then that the new Local Government Commission,
which he chairs, will start to look at the future of Humberside.
The county is an amalgam of most of the old East Riding of Yorkshire and
North Lincolnshire, joined by the Humber Bridge in the middle and a
no-man's-land of a district called Boothferry at its western border with old
Yorkshire.
Traditionally, Tykes live to the north of the Humber and Yellow Bellies to
the south, but Boothferry, lacking an estuary for opposing factions to shout
across, offers no similarly convenient cultural division.
A populist campaign to break up Humberside has been raging for the nearly
two decades of its existence, and the county has been officially 'under
review' since 1985.
First, the Boundary Commission decided things should stay as they are, then
changed its mind after a flood of complaints. Before anything could be done,
however, the government decided to re-examine the structure of local
government generally under Sir John.
In the meantime, something unusual has happened to Humberside: it has become
almost average. The latest figures for regional gross domestic product (GDP)
show a transformation during the 1980s.
At the beginning of the decade, Humberside's was a laggard. Its GDP per head
was 87 per cent of the national average, adding to arguments that this was
an enforced, unnatural grouping of communities which did not mesh.
But at the end of the decade, Humberside's GDP index was 99.1 per cent, an
unheard-of achievement in northern counties. Yorkshire and Humberside as a
whole managed only 90.7 per cent. Across the Pennines, north-west England
was at 91.2 per cent.
North Yorkshire, supposedly the richest county east of the Pennines, was at
95.2 per cent. West Yorkshire, which generates most of the region's wealth
in absolute terms, had a GDP per head 93.1 per cent of average, with South
Yorkshire down at 79.1 per cent.
The scale of Humberside's improvement is even more astonishing when compared
with southern England. At nearly 134 per cent, it was the sixth best in
Britain. The increase in economic performance was greater than those of
Warwickshire, Oxfordshire, Bedfordshire and Berkshire, and not far behind
Northamptonshire, West Sussex, Surrey and Buckinghamshire. Only Clwyd, in
north-east Wales, showed faster growth than all of these counties.
Humberside County Council has worked hard at promoting the county as the
north's leading gateway to Europe. It claims a fragmentation of authorities
could not have had the same effect, because they would have competed with
each other and diluted the impact for a Humberside community that totals
only 860,000.
Economically, the picture looks like getting even rosier as the Humber ports
expand rapidly in the wake of abolition of the national dock labour scheme
in 1989, which freed them from trade union restrictive practices.
'No one can suggest Humberside doesn't work, especially now,' says Mr John
Parkes, the county's chief executive. 'Even the Boundary Commission admitted
it does. We have a coherent policy for economic development that benefits
both Tykes and Yellow Bellies and which is now proving itself. If it ain't
broke, don't fix it.'
The test of this argument will not be how it squares with local opinion, but
whether it will impress the Local Government Commission.
Both sides pin their hopes on Sir John, but the county council thinks it may
have an edge: a former director-general of the Confederation of British
Industry and former head of the Audit Commission - the government watchdog
on local authority spending and efficiency - he understands business and the
arcane world of local government finance.
Mr Parkes estimates it would cost Pounds 11m in transitional costs, plus
Pounds 2m a year thereafter, to abolish Humberside's nine district councils
and make the county a unitary authority. But, he says, it would be even
costlier to do the reverse.
A split into two authorities - one for each bank of the river - would still
leave the question of Boothferry, and neither would be big enough to be
efficient. Other options, such as Hull and Grimsby each going its own way,
would create tiny urban islands and, in Hull's case, permanent Labour
dictatorship.
Dr Norman O'Neill, a county councillor who chairs the economic development
committee, says: 'A lot of people who want to split up Humberside don't
recognise the relationship of local government to economic development.'
He thinks that much of the opposition to Humberside concerns its name.
Calling the county authority a regional council or renaming it East
Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire might defuse the issue. So might a simple
change of postal addresses.
Polls on the issue are confusing. Humberside is unloved, with people
preferring old county names, but more than 70 per cent are satisfied with
its services and performance. At the same time, younger people, who never
knew East Riding, identify with it.
Although people want single tier authorities, rather than the present
district and county council structure, there is no consensus on which
options to choose. Regional economic growth in the face of national
recession may well be a powerful argument to leave things as they are if
growth looks likely to be diminished by break-up.
There is also the argument that this is not a local issue. Mr John Gunnell,
Labour MP for Leeds South and Morley, and chairman of Yorkshire and
Humberside Development Association, says: 'Humberside has great economic
significance for the region and the north. It has a lot to offer
strategically as a unit and its ports are a big selling point for inward
investment anywhere within reach of them. There is a very good rationale for
keeping Humberside together.'
Dr O'Neill says: 'Sir John is a rational man who understands local
government finance and is not in the pocket of the government. We shall be
making a rational case.'

FT  31 JUL 92 / Survey of Yorkshire and Humberside (2) Little room for
complacency - Local economy is less secure than it seems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   A CALM SEA, with a storm raging underneath
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
that, says Mr Jonathan French, North Yorkshire County Council's senior
assistant economic development officer, summarises the county's economy.
North Yorkshire is probably the most prosperous county in the north of
England. With its beautiful countryside, charming towns, its air of
wellbeing and its unemployment rate of 5.4 per cent compared to the UK's 9.6
per cent national average, it might seem to have nothing to worry about.
In January this year, only Berkshire and Oxfordshire, among English
counties, enjoyed lower unemployment figures.
Yet North Yorkshire's economic development officers insist that there is no
room for complacency.
While some northern areas are tussling with population decline, the county
faces the challenge of satisfying the employment needs of a citizenry which
is growing at more than twice the national average: 714,000 last year - this
is expected to reach 761,000 by 2001.
By 2006, the workforce may have risen by 10 per cent; an increase which,
just to stand still, would require 2,300 net new jobs every year.
Given its relatively low unemployment, North Yorkshire, England's largest
county, might seem well equipped to cope, especially because its schools'
educational achievements are well above average and its workforce is highly
qualified, with nearly 50 per cent in white collar occupations.
But its economy is more vulnerable than is immediately apparent.
The first Labour Market Study by the North Yorkshire Training and Enterprise
Council, published last year, estimated that agriculture was 3.6 times more
significant in the local economy than nationally, followed by coal
extraction (3.2 per cent), railways (2.9 per cent) and food and drink (2.9
per cent).
According to the county's 1992-1993 Economic Development Strategy, 12,600 of
its 270,000 employees work in agriculture - 5 per cent, compared with just 1
per cent nationally. Mining and power engineering account for 4 per cent in
the county, against 2 per cent nationally.
The reformed EC common agricultural policy looks certain to mean more job
losses from the agriculture sector - in North Yorkshire and nationally - as
land is taken out of production.
And not even the modern, strongly performing Selby mining complex in the
south of the county can presume itself immune from the struggles of the
British coal industry to compete against cheap imports, competition from gas
and the uncertainty over future demand from the electricity generators.
Railway engineering, centred on York, has been through traumatic times in
recent years, and B r i t i s h R a i l privatisation proposals mean that
the county cannot take its railway jobs for granted, even though it has the
benefit of being served by the now fully electrified east coast line,
cutting York-London journey times to just 1 hour and 43 minutes.
And only this month the county has been reminded of the vulnerability of the
defence sector, which provides 18,000 jobs for servicemen and civilians
within its boundaries.
As part of its Options for Change review, the government announced that it
is to close both the Royal Electrical Mechanical Engineers army workshop at
Strensall near York, at a cost of about 200 jobs, and the RAF's Catterick
base, where 75 civilians work. Hopes that the Army will take it over have
not been confirmed.
Harrogate, which is already undergoing the loss of 550 white collar jobs in
National Power's corporate restructuring, also faces 1,250 civilian job
losses in the proposed relocation of the town's RAF support base - a
national facility - to Huntingdon.
The presence in North Yorkshire of large food companies, such as those which
make up York's confectionery sector, looks relatively secure, but jobs are
still likely to go through technological advance and capital investment.
However, the food sector in the county brought some good news last week:
Dalepak, the Leeming Bar manufacturer of frozen and chilled foods, reported
a 30 per cent growth in profits to Pounds 3.93m on turnover of Pounds 40.6m.
In a bid to spread awareness of the county's high quality food producers,
including diversifying farmers, the county council formed The Yorkshire
Pantry, providing buyers with a focal point of contact for products ranging
from wild boar to handmade biscuits.
The Pantry's latest showcase was its own food hall at this month's Great
Yorkshire Show in Harrogate.
Yorkshire food has also had an inadvertent publicity boost from the Milk
Marketing Board's (MMB) decision to close its Wensleydale cheese factory in
Hawes; the last commercial producer of the cheese in the dale.
Yorkshiremen - and cheese lovers nationally - were outraged at the MMB's
temerity in suggesting that Wensleydale made in Lancashire could taste just
as good. (A rescue committee, led by Dales businesspeople who are convinced
of Wensleydale's good market prospects, is trying to clinch a deal to buy
the dairy from the MMB.)
With brewers John Smith, Sam Smith and Bass all at Tadcaster, brewing is
important too - and not only for beer lovers. To the sober souls at County
Hall in Northallerton, brewing represents biotechnology, a growth sector.
In April this year the county's brewing tradition led to a highly successful
Pounds 850,000 share offer, under the Business Expansion Scheme, for Mr Paul
Theakston's new Black Sheep Brewery in Masham.
Mr Theakston, formerly managing director of the family brewing firm T&amp;R
Theakston before its takeover by Scottish and Newcastle in 1988, is about to
start commercial production of traditional Yorkshire ale.
Between 1981 and 1989 the numbers employed in North Yorkshire grew by
29,400; a growth rate of nearly 1.5 per cent a year, three times the
national average.
But nearly 80 per cent of the net new jobs were part time, and three
quarters of them occupied by women. And since 1989 the growth has come to a
halt.
Losses in traditional manufacturing industry have also contributed to a drop
in the number of companies, with more than 300 employees, serving non-local
markets. In 1978, 20 per cent of North Yorkshire's employment was in this
sector; by 1989 it had dropped to 14 per cent, spread between 41 firms.
'While we've had a steady increase in employment, we're going through a very
substantial change which has an impact on the labour and land markets,' says
Mr French. 'Very few children will work in their parents' workplaces.'
The county's position in the top three of the low unemployment league is
also ambiguous. Since January 1989 it has shot from the 23rd position, a
rise caused largely by the relatively greater impact of the recession on the
south. The risk is that, after the recession, the county will slide back
down the league table again.
Recent recession-related increases in unemployment in North Yorkshire have
been greatest in the better off areas. But the county's enduring economic
problem areas are on its fringes, in the coastal strip a r o u n d W h i t b
y a n d Scarborough, and on its border with West Yorkshire.
North Yorkshire's strong tourist industry provides seasonal employment on
the coast - and spin-off for much of the year in York - but it cannot be
expected to solve deeper structural problems within the local economy.
The council is lobbying the government to preserve Development Area status
for the Whitby and Stokesley Travel to Work Areas in the forthcoming
national review. It is also pressing for UK and European aid for the Selby
coal mining area.
It is also monitoring the Rural Development Commission's review of its
operating areas: the RDC currently spends more than Pounds 1.5m every year
in the county.
Mindful that self-help is the theme of the times, the county council
recently launched the North Yorkshire European Community Office, a Pounds
100,000 project to ensure that the county's companies, especially its 25,000
small businesses, are geared up to compete in the Single European Market.
The county's high technology sector has been strengthened by the decision of
Smith &amp; Nephew, the health care products manufacturer, to relocate its R&amp;D
headquarters from Harlow in Essex to the new science park at York
University.
Smith and Nephew's Pounds 10.5m building, where 200 scientists and
researchers will work, is now being fitted out.
The park, a Pounds 23m joint project by the university and P&amp;O Developments,
is one of the few private-sector-funded UK science parks. Smith &amp; Nephew's
building is the first and largest on the 21-acre site; the park's second
phase is now being marketed.
The Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food has also opted to relocate
its central science laboratory and its headquarters operations for food,
pesticides and plant health to North Yorkshire, further boosting the
county's strengths in research and bio-science.
Like neighbouring Humberside, North Yorkshire is in the first wave of local
authorities which are being examined under the government's review of the
structure of local government.
Unsurprisingly, the county council favours the status quo, arguing that
devolution of its services to the eight districts would cost Pounds 12m a
year.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Survey of Yorkshire and Humberside (4) Ports are catching
the tide - The dock that came back from the dead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE ARE no plans to rename Hull's Alexandra Dock after Lazarus, but there
should be. It was laid to rest in 1981, its overmanned quays undercut by
leaner-staffed wharves in the Humber and Trent. It has just been
successfully called back from the dead.
Sustained by a swelling drip-feed of 300,000 tonnes of freight over the past
12 months, the 33-quay dock gets stronger by the day and is expected to
reach its 1m-tonne annual potential of general cargo over the next few
years, instead of being a decaying trading relic.
Nothing could be more symbolic of what has happened to Britain's large old
ports since the abolition of the national dock labour scheme in 1989. The
scheme gave dockers at these ports jobs for life if they wanted them; the
result was overmanning, resistance to change and restrictive practices.
In Hull's case, this meant the port was open to shipping 24 hours a day, but
ship owners were lucky to get one eight-hour shift out of its dockers. They
sailed to 'non-scheme' or foreign ports or - having broken up larger cargoes
at them - to wharves in the river.
The removal of these constraints has led to surging growth at all the old
'scheme' ports, but Hull believes it is the only one that has actually
reopened a silted-up, abandoned dock. 'We knew things would improve, but the
speed of lift-off has surprised us,' says Mr Mike Fell, who manages Hull for
Associated British Ports (ABP), its owner.
'We have yet to notice the recession because we have been growing
continuously. The only downturn we have seen is in Russian timber imports -
and that is because of the problems at their end,' he adds.
His port is strategically important to the whole of the north of England for
several reasons. Not only does it face mainland Europe and is easy to get
to, but it also has 2,000 acres of land which can be developed.
Moreover, it is versatile. Its King George, Queen Elizabeth and Alexandra
Docks handle passengers, dry and liquid bulk cargoes, containers and
roll-on, roll-off (ro-ro) freight. This spread kept it alive in the lean
years; it now offers the chance of growth.
Hull struggled to 5.3m tonnes of freight in 1989, the last year of the dock
labour scheme. That was the year it shut its container terminal after 20
years of losses and a two-year wrangle over manning levels after United
Carriers had pulled out, citing high costs and restrictive working
practices.
The terminal was reopened after the scheme was abolished and realistic
staffing was agreed. United Carriers is back again, operations are
profitable and the terminal is shortly to be extended in size by about 50
per cent.
In the whole port there were no compulsory redundancies, but ABP's workforce
went down from 1,400 to 400 almost overnight, with dockers now employed by
six lean, stevedoring companies independent of ABP.
The impact of managerial and marketing freedom - combined with pent-up
pressure in the marketplace - was a leap in annual freight levels to 7.6m
tonnes in 1991. The 1992 figure is surging towards 9m tonnes.
Meanwhile, North Sea Ferries - jointly owned by P&amp;O of the UK and Nedloyd of
the Netherlands - has broken through the 1m passengers-a-year barrier with
its overnight services for people and their cars or trucks to Rotterdam and
Zeebrugge.
This is the base on which the port of Hull is now going to build, with ABP
and Hull's users pouring in investment. ABP is spending Pounds 20m over 18
months, including Pounds 3.5m on four general purpose cranes, the first new
ones for 20 years.
It cost Pounds 2m to reopen Alexandra Dock - a considerable act of faith, as
not a single piece of business was in sight. Now, formerly competing wharves
operators are setting up on its quays.
Port users have more than Pounds 10m of investment under way. Coal imports
for power generation will rise from 500,000 tonnes last year to an annual 3m
when new bulk handling, roads and terminal facilities are completed.
Nippress, a Netherlands company, is putting in the port's first cold stores.
Anglia Oil is expanding is palm oil business.
Cement, paper, timber, steel and grain are all growing cargoes. Indeed, one
irony is that while Hull first developed in the last century to export coal
and import grain, it now exports grain and imports coal.
North Sea Ferries has two Pounds 31m ro-ro superfreighters under
construction which will operate to Rotterdam from a new jetty that ABP is
building in the river itself. Adjustable linkspans between the jetty and the
ships will enable them to load or unload at any stage of the tide.
ABP's share of the project, which includes about 500,000 sq ft of paved,
terminal area, is about Pounds 11m. The ships will carry 156 units - trucks
with or without trailers - but will accommodate 114 drivers, rather than the
handful of people that smaller vessels carry on present services.
The new service will run at 22 knots and not have to pass through any locks,
as the ships will already be in the river. One will sail in each direction
at 10pm each night, enabling shippers to optimise the balance between
driving time and rest periods.
With 40m people in Britain within four hours' driving time of Hull - and
with Rotterdam offering similar benefits in the Netherlands, Germany,
Belgium and northern France - the benefits are obvious for trade in both
directions.
ABP also runs three other Humber ports - Immingham, Grimsby and Goole. They
compete with each other, though not so much as to damage total profits by
any of them doing inappropriate work at the expense of another. Between
them, they shift a growing 60m tonnes of freight a year.
'This puts the Channel Tunnel in perspective,' Mr Fell says. 'It will do
only one-tenth of the Humber ports' volume.'
Much industry in the north of England and northern Europe has already taken
the point and voted with its wheels.
There are hiccups. Industrial heritage enthusiasts who rushed to get the
Alexandra Dock listed after its closure have seriously impeded its return to
work. Dock gates had to be de-listed to be modernised and wrangles are still
going on because they are attached to listed quays and the new mechanisms
proposed for them look too modern for some conservationists.
'We are trying to run a dock, not a museum,' Mr Fell says. 'It is private
land and assets and there is no public access. The most infuriating thing
has been a suggestion we should find old granite coping stones to repair the
quayside instead of using modern materials. We are not talking about saving
architectural gems, but restoring very ordinary facilities.'
Nevertheless, he is a happy man. At a recent meeting with his opposite
number in Hamburg, his host had to break off for an urgent labour relations
problem. 'It was with much pleasure I told him I hadn't seen a trade union
official for more than two years,' he said, smiling broadly.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Survey of Yorkshire and Humberside (1) Hoping for a slow
upturn - A diverse economic base, lessons from the early 1980s and local
attitudes to wealth have helped the region, one of north England's main
economic engines, withstand recession. Can its industry and commerce survive
recovery?
</HEADLINE>

IT IS not the recession which dominates talk around business lunch tables in
Yorkshire and Humberside, but the recovery. Managers fear its arrival. The
worry is whether business can afford anything more than a long, slow uplift.
Recession has had patchy effects. Some businesses have expired or been taken
over; some places have not even felt it. Wakefield, for example, is so well
placed at the nexus of the M1, M62 and the A1 that it hardly has to sell
itself to inward investors, who continue to arrive.
Only 50 minutes away, along the M62 or the M180, the four main Humber ports
are in a state of unfettered growth following abolition of the national dock
labour scheme in 1989.
The Humber estuary is therefore developing rapidly as the main European
trading gateway for northern England and much of the Midlands. One large
dock in Hull, shut down as hopelessly uncompetitive in 1981, has been
cleared of silt and successfully reopened.
Trucks from Ireland, Scotland, the Netherlands and Germany stream across
northern England. In 1974, 8.6 per cent of UK seaborne trade was through the
Humber. In 1990 (the latest available figures) it was more than 12.5 per
cent. In 1985, throughput was 46m tonnes. It passed 60m tonnes two years
ago, with a total value approaching Pounds 20bn.
Mr Mike Fell, who runs the docks at Hull for Associated British Ports, says
this puts the Channel Tunnel - which eventually expects to handle an annual
16m tonnes of freight - 'in perspective'.
If recession had really bitten in the region, it would have shown more
drastically in unemployment figures. The rate for the region improved to 9.5
per cent in June, having apparently bottomed out at 9.8 per cent in the
first quarter.
Yet in January 1988, more than 262,000 of the region's 2.4m workers were
unemployed; a rate of 11.2 per cent. This had fallen to 6.9 per cent in
October 1989, but as recession started to bite in the south, the effect such
a change used to have on the north was not evident.
The relatively small fluctuation in unemployment levels since then would
seem to indicate a marked change in regional economic behaviour.
In part, this is because of a changed structure. Big manufacturing closures
took place more than 10 years ago and local economic reconstruction in the
coalfields is slowly having an effect.
Yorkshire and Humberside's economy now has a better spread by type and size
of businesses. Many of them trade briskly between themselves. Leeds alone
has 14,000 businesses in six sectors. 'This diversity has helped us to
weather recession,' says Mr John Siddall, the city's economic development
officer.
Local cultural factors are also at work. Mr Richard Wilson, senior partner
of Gordons Wright &amp; Wright, a Bradford solicitor, says: 'People have always
liked to have more of their own money in their businesses than they borrow
from the bank.
'This may make them more cautious, but it also makes them less vulnerable.'
Mr Ken Denton, editor of a business magazine published by Kirklees and
Wakefield chamber of commerce, says that owner-managers in textiles or
engineering have always been used to ups and downs. 'Their attitude is,
'Let's make some money and get it in the bank to help us through the bad
times.' This tells you something about why many such businesses have
survived.'
Mr David Thurston, production director of BTH Building Systems, which makes
temporary premises, says: 'Businesses should always proceed with caution,
however good the market looks. You should make a bit, invest a bit and never
try to do everything in one big leap. If you can't expand out of your own
resources, should you be expanding?'
Mr Richard Dunhill, of Hill Woolhouse, a chartered surveyor, says there is
no glut of office space in Leeds because most of the region's developers
rarely do more than one project at a time, proceeding to the next only after
exiting profitably from the last.
Indeed, Mr Jon Trickett, Labour leader of Leeds city council, points proudly
to new tower cranes going up in the city - although public spending is a
factor here, with the relocation, to Leeds from London, of the Departments
of Health and Social Security.
Mr Dunhill says this stimulates a chain of demand as suppliers of associated
services also move in or set up. He says the mechanism has been proven in
Sheffield over the past 10 years, following the move of the government's
manpower services to that city.
The government this month announced a Pounds 20m grant to help relocation of
the Royal Armouries museum from the Tower of London to Clarence Dock in the
Leeds canal system. This is expected to stimulate property development
around it.
Prudence, rather than conservatism, is the way Yorkshire people like to
describe their business attitudes. 'People here are used to managing a flat
market,' says Mr David Wilkinson, who heads 3i's offices in Leeds, Hull and
Sheffield.
'We have some very sound investments in very good, solid businesses. Maybe
some did not seize the opportunities of the 1980s, but they are better able
to stand up to what is happening now.'
Yorkshire and Humberside contain 5m people - about the same as Scotland -
and account for 8 per cent of UK gross domestic product. Mr Peter
Coles-Johnson, who heads the combined chambers of commerce in the region,
says Yorkshire and Humberside does 11 per cent of the UK's exporting and
this has also has helped business resist recession.
However, groups of business leaders assembled this month for chamber of
commerce meetings or Bank of England informal lunches have unanimously
agreed that there is no end to recession in sight. They have battened down
to hang on, but anxiety is mounting about coping when the things turn up
again. Finding enough working capital is the worry.
Yorkshire prudence, combined with the lessons of 1980-82, ensured that many
businesses went into the recession with cash reserves. Those which did not,
or were overgeared, went into liquidation early. But cash is draining away
from the rest while the national climate remains depressed. Many have
started using up their overdraft facilities.
Mr Wilkinson says: 'The general picture is that the flow into receivership
has thinned. But if there is now rapid or uncontrolled growth, that picture
will deteriorate.'
Mr Charles Burton and Mr Peter Bancroft run the Bradford and Leeds offices
of Haines Watts, a national accounting firm which specialises in small or
medium-sized unquoted businesses owned by their managers. They say about 80
per cent of businesses are now running at their overdraft limits.
Limits are tighter because banks have reduced their exposure during the
recession. Banks insist they do not operate a formula on this, but a
case-by-case judgment of what is prudent.
Few customers believe this: Haines Watts says lending is usually set at 50
per cent of asset value and 30 per cent of debtors, compared with a
respective 70 per cent and 50 per cent previously.
However, Mr Trevor Skelley, chief manager of Natwest's business centre in
Leeds, says: 'If we are satisfied with the probity of management, companies
will not be starved of working capital. There is no joy for us in seeing our
customers go down.'
Mr Ralph Preece, a Touche Ross corporate recovery specialist, says more
one-off investigative work on behalf of banks suggests that they are asking
accountants to judge this managerial probity company by company, as each
seeks more working capital.
His opposite number at Price Waterhouse, Mr Gordon Horsfield, agrees. There
is no point in foreclosing on a business if its assets are unrealisable, so
the banks are looking for reasons to support recovery if a business's
prospects look fair.
'What we are going to find on the way out of recession is not so much which
are the good companies, but who are the good bankers,' Mr Horsfield says.
'But whatever happens, we are going to need a very long runway for
take-off.'

FT  31 JUL 92 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (10): Water into juice
 -A reversal in the fortunes of hydroelectricity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN DUNN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE history of hydroelectric power schemes is littered with shattered
dreams.
However, Gorm Gundersen, executive vice-president of ABB Norway, believes
river power is due for a revival. Only 20 per cent of the world's potential
for hydroelectric schemes has been tapped so far, he says.
Gundersen is a member of the management team responsible for the worldwide
hydroelectric business of ABB, the giant Swiss-Swedish power consortium.
Over the past 15 years new hydroelectric schemes have been in decline, he
says. Big dams and reservoirs were unpopular with environmentalists and the
vast capital costs made fossil fuel and even nuclear power generation more
attractive.
But fears of global warming and problems over nuclear waste disposal have
shifted attitudes towards hydroelectricity, says Gundersen. 'It is clean,
efficient and a renewable source.'
ABB expects to see the market pick up again in the developing countries such
as the US, Canada, Norway, Switzerland, and Italy where so far only 50 per
cent of the potential for hydroelectric schemes has been developed. 'But the
most important market for us will be the Third World,' says Gundersen.
'There, just a fraction of the potential, as little as 5 per cent , has been
tapped.'
In spite of the high capitalcosts, hydroelectricity is very attractive, he
says. There are no fuel costs and a large share of the 80 per cent of a
project's cost that goes on civil engineering work can be undertaken
locally. Also, he says, there is the added benefit in some cases of
combining hydroelectric schemes with irrigation schemes. As a result, says
Gundersen, ABB is beginning to see a significant growth in the market of
about 10 per cent a year.
Hydroelectricity accounts for about 20 per cent of total world energy output
 -620 GW (Gigawatts) out of 3,000 GW. Gundersen expects the level to reach
25 per cent in the next decade.
ABB estimates the total world market for hydroelectric schemes to be about
Dollars 3bn a year. This represents rather less than the 10 GW of new
capacity installed annually during the late 1970s. The two biggest markets
are China and south east Asia, particularly Taiwan, Malaysia, Korea and
Vietnam. But Pakistan, India, and South America are all potentially
exciting. And in Africa, Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique, Namibia and
Angola all have considerable potential for hydroelectricity, Mr Gundersen
says.
Although the number of new hydroelectric schemes has declined, total order
values have risen because of the growth in the retrofit market. A
refurbished power station can generate up to 30 per cent more power from the
same turbines at 10-20 per cent of the cost of a new station. Better
electrical insulator materials mean that old generators installed in the
1950s can have their windings replaced by new ones that squeeze more copper
wire into the same space.
Refurbishing and upgrading stations now accounts for 25 per cent of ABB's
hydroelectric business, says Gundersen. It is particularly popular in the
US, although Germany, the UK, Sweden, Norway, Italy and Switzerland are
upgrading existing stations. ABB also has some refurbishing projects
underway in the Third World where many power stations have not been properly
maintained says Gundersen.
ABB believes the future of hydroelectricity lies in reducing installation
and running costs rather than developing more efficient generators. It is
developing automated control systems to run power stations virtually
unmanned as well as condition-monitoring sensors to warn of early signs of
faults in generator insulation and bearings.
Over the last 10 years, some 83 GW of new hydroelectric capacity has been
installed, of which ABB claims 23 per cent. Its nearest rival has been
GEC-Alsthom with 16 per cent, followed by General Electric of Canada and the
East Europeans each with 9 per cent and Siemens with 8 per cent.
All the Japanese power companies together accounted for about 17 per cent.
But during 1989-91, GEC-Alsthom's share shot up and ABB's fell as
GEC-Alsthom won a huge order in Taiwan. This year, ABB reversed the figures
again by winning Dollars 350m worth of business from Iran's 2,000 MW scheme
at Karum.
Mr Alan Stothard, managing director of the GEC-Alsthom turbine subsidiary,
Rugby-based Neyrpic, sees hydroelectricity as the power source of the
future. 'If you had asked me two years ago, I would have said there would be
a boom by now.' But he was reckoning without the worldwide recession. And
despite his long-term optimism, Stothard is not expecting any big upturn in
new schemes for the next few years.
'Hydroelectric work is very flat at the moment. Construction work may take
off in the next five years, but it will be a further three years before the
equipment suppliers get in. Business is going to be very flat over the next
eight years,' he says.
Neyrpic will be relying on refit and rehabilitation work which has accounted
for up to 50 per cent of its business in recent years. 'A station installed
10 years ago with a rating of 100 MW now probably only has a rating of 75 MW
because of degradation. We can upgrade it to 130 MW, giving a leap in power
from 75 MW to 130 MW for as little as 10 per cent of the cost of a new
station.'
Ewbank Preece, the Bri ghton based engineering consultancy, says that the
world's leading funding authorities such as the World Bank and the European
Investment Bank now require an environmental impact report for any proposed
new hydroelectric power scheme. This makes raising funds even more
difficult.
As a result, it says, the trend over the next 10 years will be towards
smaller, environmentally friendly new schemes and towards refurbishment of
existing ones. Technology will reduce the size of generating equipment
needed and lead to an increase in turbine speeds which will in turn lead to
lower machinery costs.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (11): Success through
flexibility - Profile, GEC Alsthom Large Machines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MODERN manufacturing techniques vary enormously across different industries,
but the production of power generation equipment in an increasingly
competitive global environment brings special challenges.
The key to successful manufacturing in power equipment is flexibility.
Predicting the product mix months ahead or even, in some cases, days ahead,
is an 'absolute killer', says Dr Mike Lloyd, director and general manager of
GEC Alsthom Large Machines.
The average batch size going through the company's Rugby plant is just under
two, he says. Coming off the production line are 800 units a year  - motors
and generators - in a wide variety of types and sizes ranging from 100KW to
100MW, and higher still for hydro-generators.
The need to increase flexibility - along with productivity, and
responsiveness to customers' needs - helps to explain why Large Machines has
just completed a Pounds 27m site reorganisation at Rugby to concentrate
production into a streamlined, cost-effective modern factory, sweeping away
90 years of history and outmoded 'us and them' attitudes.
The tangible signs of the four-year reorganisation, at a sprawling, 106-acre
site (which employed 12,000 in the 1950s), include some tried and tested
techniques such as design-for-manufacturing and flexible manufacturing
cells. But the 'World Class' programme has gone a long way beyond that, to
envelop total quality management, multi-skilling and teamwork.
Results are already coming through. A crash programme of demolition and
refurbishment has more than halved the floor area (to 600,000 sq ft), and
the headcount has been reduced from 1,400 (in 1987) to 1,000. Yet sales have
increased in the same period from Pounds 36m to a projected Pounds 60m this
year, and, on average, production lead-times have been halved.
Even from four years ago, the factory floor is now unrecognisable. The
introduction of 12 cells, coupled with the reorganisation of production into
a more logical flow, has drastically reduced the distances travelled - and
hence time wasted - by semi-finished products.
Where necessary and practical, equipment has been duplicated in order to
speed up flows - such as the provision of a second small testing centre for
testing high voltage coils and complete stators.
In the machine shop, which is one-quarter the size of its predecessors, two
new machining centres have been installed, each of which can handle tasks
which previously would have required five or six machines.
But high levels of automation are applied only to the extent that they can
contribute to flexibility and quality. 'We are not pushing to get these
machines running all day just to get our investment back,' says Dr Lloyd,
'but to get exactly the product we want, no more and no less.'
The semi-automated approach has required the reorganisation team to focus as
much on 'people' issues as on production techniques. Hence, training on new
equipment was matched by company-wide training and communication, to create
a climate of improvement to which each individual can contribute.
Other important innovations include a sophisticated noise test facility
which the company claims is the world's first for a power equipment
manufacturing plant, and a new machine test department, costing about Pounds
6.5m.
The centrepiece of the large machine test facility is a Pounds 3.5m
cycloconverter, for variable speed machine production testing. The ability
to test large machines, often in excess of 5m in diameter, within the
factory enables site commissioning problems to be minimised before despatch.
This is particularly important, because much of the 'intelligence' in
variable speed drives is written into software that drives the electronics
in the cycloconverter.
The external aspects of the reorganisation extend to the suppliers: the core
number has been reduced from 650 to 450, and Dr Lloyd aims to reduce regular
suppliers to below 300 - and, naturally, to the customers. Last month GEC
Alsthom showed 400 of these round a factory which can now be used as a
marketing tool.
'I'm not saying we've got all the answers,' says Dr Lloyd, 'but we've made
as good a start as any I have seen in this industry.'

FT  31 JUL 92 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (12): Gadgetry of
excellence - Computers and controls play a bigger role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CURRENT emphasis on reducing costs and increasing efficiency in power
generation, and the technological transformation of the industry caused by
gas turbines, are presenting new opportunities for suppliers of monitoring
equipment and computer-based facilities management systems.
Inevitably, the privatisation of Britain's electricity industry has meant
that many of the most significant developments in this field are happening
in the UK - or are casting UK companies in a lead role.
Last month for example, the European Commission awarded a major project to a
consortium led by Intelligent Applications, a Scottish-based software
company, to develop the next generation of fault diagnosis and prediction
systems for gas turbines.
The Pounds 2.8m Tiger project is supported by the EC's Esprit Programme. It
involves six companies, including Exxon Chemicals' Fife ethylene plant and
John Brown Engineering in Glasgow.
According to Dr Robert Milne, managing director of Intelligent Applications,
the project will develop the world's most advanced gas turbine monitoring
and diagnosis system, through the application of knowledge-based systems and
artificial intelligence.
Gas turbines are highly complex pieces of equipment, and it is becoming
increasingly difficult to identify developing faults and understand the
cause of any current problems or alarms. The project, says the Scottish
company, will use advanced modelling techniques to predict failures that
even the best human experts are not able to anticipate.
A different approach is taken by Beran Instruments, a Devon-based company
which 18 months ago launched a condition monitoring system developed in
conjunction with the UK power industry. This uses sensitive transducers to
establish the rate of change of vibration, enabling engineers to predict
when a piece of plant needs maintenance. Mr Tim Salter, Beran's sales
manager, says the UK market for such systems has exploded over the past
year.
But not all the innovations are UK-based. Another recent development,
announced in May by the New Jersey-based Micron Instrument Company, is a
temperature monitoring instrument package designed to detect infra-red
emission from exit gases in power generating plants.
The system is based on Mikron's M67 Transducer, which converts the infra-red
reading into an electrical signal proportional to the temperature reading of
the gases. The aim is to increase efficiency, allowing operators to keep the
gas temperature below the ash level and determine whether soot blowing is
needed to maintain efficient heat transfer from gases to the boiler.
According to Mikron, the advantage of the system is that the instrument does
not come in contact with hot gases, due to its ability to read temperatures
from its fixed position on a standard observation door.
Another US development, launched into the European market last year by
Detector Electronics, is a range of flame scanners for large industrial and
utility boilers. The company's new all-fuel self-checking flame scanner
eliminates the need for separate ultra-violet and infra-red scanners in
burner management systems.
Away from the power generation process itself, information technology
companies such as Isicad, a Wokingham-based facilities, cabling and
communication systems management company, are increasingly promoting the
need for utilities to manage their computers and controls better.
Over the past 20 years, utilities' computer installations have tended to
grow like Topsy, with insufficient attention paid to the wiring that
interconnects successive generations of equipment - in buildings that
rapidly run out of space and require redevelopment to house the next
generation of computers. Consequently, identifying hundreds of miles of
wiring can be a mammoth task.
Over the past three years, Isicad has been working for Southern Electric on
the phased installation of a facilities management system which enables the
utility to model on screen its computer rooms, with all the associated
wiring and connections, to accuracies of less than a centimetre.
For Southern Electric, privatisation has increased the need for
competitiveness, requiring responsiveness to the market place and internal
efficiency. This has prompted a pro-active approach to innovations such as
the Isicad system, but also ensured that every step of its installation has
been ruthlessly examined in cost terms.
Mr John Anderson, Isicad's managing director, believes the opportunities for
systems such as Isicad in the power generation business are immense. 'What
is important is that managements are buying into this system, and are asking
themselves what they have to do to be more competitive.'

FT  31 JUL 92 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (9): When cleanest is
cheapest - Environmental example from the Mongolian plains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIC WYMAN, of The Engineer
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN IT comes to technology, backward societies are sometimes more advanced
than those of developed countries.
In a number of other poor countries, machines are used every day to
renewable sources such as the wind, the sun and flowing water into
electricity and heat.
In cattle-rich Mongolia, for example, a study is taking place, with United
Nations backing, of small, portable 'digesters' that produce valuable
methane gas from animal waste.
The Mongolian demand for renewables led to the import of of several hundred
small solar cell units, rated at about 60 W, supplied from the US, Europe
and China.
Western demand for renewable energy has prompted ambitious schemes such as
large 1 MW wind turbines, being developed to satisfy the rising demand for
base-load electricity. They are intended to compete with conventional power
plants burning fossil fuels such as coal, and with nuclear power.
The technologies and the markets are far from mature. Yet by 1987 renewables
were already supplying an estimated 6 per cent of the world's primary
energy, equivalent to the energy from 476m tonnes of oil. Most of that was
from large hydroelectricity schemes.
By 1990 the world already contained an estimated 20,000 wind turbines, one
of the most developed of the renewables, feeding an annual 3.2bn kWh of
electricity into power grids. Europe has about a quarter of the installed
wind power capacity.
Yet all renewables will become increasingly important. 'Worldwide
development of renewable energy systems on a large scale will be necessary
in the future, due to the inevitable and accelerated exhaustion of reserves
of fossil fuels,' says the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development.
Renewables promise a reduced dependence on imported fuels, a diversification
in power supply to improve energy security, and the freeing of finite fossil
fuels such as oil for premium uses such as processing into valuable
commodities.
Over the past couple of years the clean nature of renewables has added to
their attraction. Burning fossil fuels releases the greenhouse gas carbon
dioxide (CO2) that has been locked up in the fuel for millions of years.
Renewables, however, usually draw on the less polluting physical effects of
the sun, such as the wind. And the CO2 released by biofuels renewables,
including the burning of straw and trees, was taken from the atmosphere only
a few years previously.
The European Wind Energy Association (EWEA) says that about a third of CO2
emissions are from electricity generation. 'For every 1 per cent of
electricity generation capacity which is displaced by renewable energy, a
0.3 per cent reduction in total CO2 emission is therefore obtained,' it
says. That is a cut of 15m tonnes a year in the European Community alone.
There would also be large reductions in the emissions of other pollutants
such as nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxides that contribute to acid rain,
and 1m tonnes less power station slag and ash whose disposal is becoming
increasingly expensive and contentious.
The EWEA says that only if renewables are combined with more efficient use
of energy will the developed world meet its targets for controlling
pollution.
Yet renewables have their own environmental problems, including noise and
visual obtrusiveness. The latter bedevils wind power. 'The undoubted
benefits of renewable energy sources must not blind us to their
environmental costs,' warns the Council for the Protection of Rural England.
The growth of renewables promises plenty of business for manufacturers, and
operating and maintenance jobs.
The EWEA says that the bulk of the wind turbines will probably be built in
Europe which is home to most of the world's 30 or so established producers.
They include respected engineering concerns such as MAN of Germany and the
UK's British Aerospace, and little known but successful small Danish
companies. Outside Europe the two big wind turbine manufacturers are US
Windpower and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan.
Many countries are committed to renewables. The European Commission, which
is funding research and development, says small hydroelectric units could
provide 2-3 per cent of the European Community's electricity and solar power
1-2% of its total energy, mostly as heating.
Denmark, one of the world's leading wind power countries, produces about 2
per cent of its electricity from turbines, with a target of 10 per cent by
the turn of the century.
Yet kick-starting a renewables market is not easy. And the sheer size and
cost of large wave and tidal power schemes, such as a proposed Pounds 1.1bn
tidal barrage in the UK's Mersey estuary, make their construction unlikely.
In Europe, subsidies for renewables installations have been backed by
stimulants such as tax relief on investments or earnings, and premium
payments for the power produced.
Denmark, for example, introduced a 30 per cent private turbine installation
subsidy that disappeared in 1989 as the technology improved. Such schemes
are, however, open to abuse and costly to run.
And although the UK government has provided Pounds 180m for renewables
research and development since 1979, and currently subsidises the
electricity from installations, it is unclear whether it will meet its
target of 1,000 MW of renewables, or 2 per cent of the UK's generating
capacity, in place by the turn of the century.
Critics say this is a fraction of the potential and that renewables should
receive more in subsidy than the current 1 per cent of the Pounds 1.2bn
being collected this year from the Non Fossil Fuel Obligation (NFFO) levy on
electricity from fossil fuels. The balance supports nuclear power.
The NFFO subsidy is also due to end in 1998, which critics say is far too
soon for relatively unproved renewables to provide a return for investors.
Technical studies point to 20 year lives for wind turbines although large
machines have yet to clock up that sort of lifetime.
There is also the cautionary tale of the UK company Howden which lost Pounds
13.2m as a result of problems on turbines it supplied to California. In 1989
Howden pulled out of the market.
The turbine market should, however, be helped by the current development of
international standards that investors will be able to trust.
The UK government now intends to review its renewables strategy after the
completion of an independent study in the autumn. Yet the UK's unsettled
approach to renewables is not fundamentally different from that of other
industrialised countries.
The hurdles for renewables are many and the technologies in many cases have
yet to prove economic. However, like is not being compared with like, as few
economies allocate the true cost of the pollution from burning fuels, for
example.
As countries move towards more sophisticated energy and environmental
pricing, typified by the energy and carbon tax proposals from the European
Commission, the renewables market could get a new wind.

FT  31 JUL 92 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (8): They're cutting
big holes in the floor - Andrew Baxter visits GE's plant at Greenville, S.
Carolina
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE rapid growth in the global gas turbine market over the past five years
has prompted heavy investment by producers to raise manufacturing capacity,
taking advantage of modern production technology and reorganising to
maximise efficiency.
The trend is particularly well illustrated at General Electric's gas turbine
factory at Greenville, South Carolina, where a three-year, Dollars 150m
plant expansion and reorganisation is nearly complete.
Construction workers are still cutting some very large holes in the floor to
accommodate the foundations for new machine tools or provide spin wells for
the turbines.
When the expansion is completed, says Mr Edward Darien, advanced programmes
and customer relations manager at the plant, floorspace will have increased
30 per cent to 1m square feet - at what is already the world's largest gas
turbine factory. GE opened the Greenville plant in 1968, but the seeds of
the current manufacturing strategy were sown in the mid-1980s when the
dearth of power generation orders worldwide prompted the company to end gas
turbine manufacture at Schenectady, New York state, and consolidate
production at Greenville.
But GE also had to think carefully, says Mr Darien, about precisely what it
wanted to produce. This led to a Dollars 55m consolidation and modernisation
programme from 1987-1989, with a clear focus on the core technologies of gas
turbine manufacture - blades, buckets, combustion hardware and nozzles.
It also led to a worldwide sourcing policy for the basic, unmachined,
castings, forgings and casings. Some of the biggest forgings come from Japan
 -no one in the US can make them - while GE's worldwide business associates
supply many turbine parts.
The current programme is intended to strengthen the focus on core
technology, increase throughput by more than 40 per cent, and support new
models.
Apart from a heavy dose of reorganisation, the expansion includes a
materials distribution centre to free space for manufacturing, a new
combustion and coating manufacturing building and an additional test
facility for GE's 'F' series of advanced gas turbines.
New processes and equipment are in evidence throughout the production flow.
The crucial interlocking points of the turbine buckets are being protected
from wear with powder applied by laser, while additional ultra-modern vacuum
plasma spray facilities with an automated co-ordinate measuring centre have
been introduced for coating the buckets.
Further along the production line, a new Lapointe Champion broaching machine
is making the dovetail slots on the rotor wheels quicker and more accurately
than its predecessors, while a nozzle machining cell, based around five
Cincinnati Milacron machining centres, is reducing cycle times by servicing
several nozzle configurations simultaneously.
Shorter cycle times is one of the priorities of modern turbine manufacture,
and Mr Darien said the first half of this year had produced some
'significant hits' in reducing both cycle times and inventories (stocks).
Further gains will be made as the expansion is completed, he says.
However, GE is keenly aware that reducing cycle times cannot be left to new
technology alone. The cycle time for turbine blades - from the issuing of
the paper work to the finished blade - was very quickly halved from 26 to 13
weeks with new machine tools, but it has taken considerable efforts on
organisation, training and teamwork to bring it very close to a target of
just two weeks. It sounds, perhaps, like an old cliche, but Mr Darien
stresses Greenville's biggest asset, its people and their very positive -
non-union - work ethic.
Employment will be close to 1,900 by the end of this year, compared with 752
in 1986, and over the past five years there has been much greater emphasis
on employee participation. Hourly-paid workers, for example, have been sent
to machine tool suppliers to accept equipment for delivery.
The next target for Greenville, apart from filling the remaining holes in
its factory floor, is to win certification to the ISO-9000 quality standard.
Mr Darien hopes that will be achieved by the end of this year.

jet age - Gas turbines are now utilities' preferred choice

GAS turbines have been at the cutting edge of turbomachinery technology for
more than a decade, and are likely to remain so, although the giant strides
made in recent years have already been superseded by a more gradual process
of change.
The relatively new position of gas turbines at the heart of the utilities'
equipment arsenal is due partly to the availability of gas for power
generation, facilitated by the development of combined cycle gas turbine
power plants which use the waste heat from a gas turbine to power a
secondary steam turbine.
The attraction of the system is clean, efficient, and relatively cheap and
quick-to-build power generation, but the advances in gas turbine technology
have involved a hard slog to reach current levels of efficiency and
compactness. In the early 1960s, the thermal efficiency of combined cycle
plants was about 28 per cent, rising to about 40 per cent by 1975 - much the
same as for the most efficient coal-fired steam turbine plants now
available.
Currently, the thermal efficiency of the best gas turbines in combined cycle
has reached 55 per cent. The industry, prompted by its customers, believes
it can raise the figure, but is not promising that it can be done quickly.
'We are still on a rising curve of development in gas turbines,' says Mr
Charles Shields, general manager for sales and marketing at John Brown
Engineering in Clydebank. 'I expect combined cycle to reach 56-57 per cent
efficiency in the next few years, and 60 per cent in the next 20 years.'
Equipment suppliers are not expecting to be able to produce what would
normally be thought of as a 'quantum leap' to propel combined cycle's
thermal efficiency ahead quickly. 'We can see ways of achieving 60 per cent
efficiency thermodynamically,' says Mr Chris Buck, managing director for
Aero and Technology at GEC Alsthom's European Gas Turbines unit. 'How we get
there will be dictated by success of a number of discrete improvements, and
could take a decade or more.'
Manufacturers, in turn, have long recognised that the key route to improved
thermal efficiency is higher firing temperatures in the gas turbine, thus
increasing the exhaust temperature and maximising the application of the
reheat steam cycle.
General Electric's Frame 9F, developed jointly by GE and EGT and claimed as
the world's hottest gas turbine at 1,260 degC, is more than 500 degC hotter
than Frank Whittle's first gas turbine. Its exhaust temperature is 583 degC.
Raising temperatures has been a steady process of advance via 50 degC jumps
as new models are introduced, according to Mr Buck, suggesting that 1,500
degC could be reached in a decade.
The achievement has involved a constant quest for better cooling techniques
within gas turbines. These are often derived from aero-engine practice, and
have passed on to the power generation world many of the sophisticated
prediction methods enabling better design and use of materials in crucial
parts such as turbine blades.
Another way to enable higher temperatures, again handed down from the
aero-engine world, is the use of new heat-resistant materials. In
particular, EGT is looking at single crystal technology which can 'grow' a
turbine blade from a single crystal of a very heat-resistant alloy.
Hitherto, the size of the components in power generation gas turbines has
been a major obstacle to this process, which has been applied in military
aero-engines and is now available on commercial aero-engines. Mr Buck
believes the obstacles to what would be a true quantum leap for combined
cycle technology are close to being overcome, although he warns that such
individual innovations can only be introduced gradually so as to maintain
reliability.
Raising firing temperatures also risks creating a 'two-step forward, one
step back' problem for manufacturers by exacerbating the potential NOx
emissions problem - although carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide emissions
are reduced. This requires a compromise between improving the combustion
process and increasing the firing temperature.
The other main area of interest in combined cycle power generation is in
harnessing different fuels to the process, thus reducing the consumption of
gas for power generation - although most estimates suggest it could be as
much as 15 to 20 years before gas supply will become a real issue.
The most important development is coal gasification, and in particular the
Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle, which combines coal gasification, a
more sophisticated version of the old coal-derived 'town gas,' with combined
cycle gas turbine technology.
The process has been shown to be commercially viable, under certain
circumstances, and has a number of advantages and disadvantages. In terms of
thermal efficiency, it is better than conventional coal-fired generation but
still lags behind natural gas-fired combined cycle at about 44-45 per cent.
But the expected improvements in gas turbines should lift efficiency to 46
per cent in two years or so, according to Mr Shields.
As for emissions, the gasification takes the sulphur out of the coal, thus
removing the need for flue gas desulphurisation equipment that can be
retrofitted to conventional coal-fired plant. Otherwise, emissions are worse
than for natural gas-fired combined cycle.
Perhaps the biggest problem for IGCC in the current power industry
environment is the extra capital cost, which could be prohibitive over the
lifetime of the plant unless there is a source of cheap coal. For the
manufacturers, this provides a spur to develop processes that can reduce the
subsidy such a system might require, says Mr Buck.
The equipment industry is betting that IGCC will feature strongly wherever
coal is an important element of a country's power strategy. In the UK,
studies have assessed the technical performance of both large and
small-scale IGCC, while in the US the Dollars 274m Cool Water project in
California began operating as long ago as 1974.
Last month General Electric announced details of three IGCC projects in the
US which are intended as examples of how full-scale applications of the
technology will be in operation in the late 1990s. GE says numerous IGCC
projects are currently being planned or studied in North America, Europe and
Asia.
In contrast to IGCC which is being targeted at medium- to large scale power
generation, small scale combined cycle generation - up to 10MW - is also
being developed using biomass, an organic vegetable substance which can be
pulverised to produce methane to fuel the gas turbine. Similarly, commercial
exploitation of other fuels for combined cycle such as wood resins and
landfill gases are likely to be concentrated in smaller plants, whether for
power generation alone or in combined heat and power (CHP) projects.
