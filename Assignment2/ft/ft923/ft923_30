FT  27 JUL 92 / Bush in quandary over Baghdad
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE past week's confrontation between Iraq and the United Nations placed the
US administration in a quandary: if President Saddam Hussein did not learn
his lesson in the destruction wrought on his army and his nation by
Operation Desert Storm, what kind of action would be likely now to force him
to comply with the ceasefire terms he grudgingly accepted a year and half
ago?
Yesterday's apparent climbdown by Iraq averted any immediate need for
military action, but US officials feared that the stand-off at the
agriculture ministry in Baghdad - where UN inspectors had been stopped from
entering in pursuit of their quest for details of Iraq's programme to build
nuclear and chemical weapons - was just one facet of a much broader pattern
of Iraqi defiance in recent weeks.
The regime has been razing rebellious Shi'ite villages in the south of the
country, damming up the waterways that feed the southern marshes, bombing UN
and humanitarian organisations in the north-east, and refusing to co-operate
with the UN commission drawing the boundary between Iraq and Kuwait.
'What may be most disturbing is that it seems in the last several weeks
there's begun to be a pattern of Iraqi rhetoric reasserting their claim to
Kuwait as the 19th province of Iraq, going right back to the original cause
of the conflict,' said Mr Paul Wolfowitz, defence under-secretary.
Although this broader pattern makes Iraq's defiance harder to ignore, it
also widened the range of threats that the US and its coalition partners
could plausibly use.
Possible targets for bombing raids range from surviving military factories
and communications facilities to the airfields Mr Saddam is using to attack
the Shi'ites. US senators have suggested targeting the national electricity
grid or Mr Saddam himself.
US officials believe that they will have to keep their target list close to
hand, for there are few in Washington who believe that President Saddam will
not try his luck again.
Officials fear, moreover, that while limited military action could well
force an Iraqi retreat in any particular confrontation, nothing short of the
removal of Mr Saddam is likely to bring Baghdad permanently into line.
Pentagon planners have warned President George Bush that they cannot
guarantee President Saddam's death or removal without a ground invasion of
Iraq in even greater force than that brought to bear for Desert Storm - an
option that appears unlikely to be acceptable either internationally or
domestically.
Mr Dick Cheney, the defence secretary, said yesterday that Mr Saddam was a
legitimate though incidental target as part of the Iraqi chain of command,
but that the only way to ensure his capture would be 'to send a lot of
American troops to downtown Baghdad.'
He defended, however, last year's decision not to pursue the Desert Storm
campaign all the way to the Iraqi capital.
'The question is how many additional American casualties would you have been
willing to accept to get Saddam Hussein? And my answer was then and is now,
not very damn many,' Mr Cheney said.
With Mr Saddam still in power, Iraq remains a political albatross around
President Bush's neck. Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential
candidate, has affirmed his complete backing for the president in the
confrontation, but misses no opportunity to remind his listeners of the Bush
administration's cosy relationship with Mr Saddam right up to Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait.
More damaging than these questions about Mr Bush's pre-war Iraqi policy,
however, is the image of a president as baffled and powerless as President
Jimmy Carter in the face of the Iranian hostage crisis in 1980.

FT  27 JUL 92 / LDP tightens grip on power in Japan: Miyazawa pledges
reforms after low turnout

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP) tightened its hold on power
yesterday by capturing more than half of the 127 seats being contested in an
upper House election conspicuous for a record low turnout.
Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, surprised by a turnout estimated at
48 per cent, well below the previous low of 57 per cent, promised to
introduce electoral reforms to increase confidence in the political system.
Meanwhile, Mr Makoto Tanabe, leader of the Social Democratic party (SDPJ),
the leading opposition party, was under pressure to resign to take
responsibility for the party's poor showing.
The trade union-backed Rengo, an ally of the SDPJ, failed to win a single
seat.
Early today, final results showed that the LDP had won 68 of the seats
contested in the election for half the total seats in the House. This was
four more than its official target and enough for Mr Miyazawa to interpret
the outcome as a vote of confidence in his leadership.
The SDPJ won 22 seats, while the New Japan party, a new centrist party that
hopes to usurp the SDPJ as the main opposition party, collected four seats
in its first election and could play a significant role in a general
election due in 1994.
Opposition parties had viewed the election as a referendum on LDP
legislation to allow the dispatch of military personnel on United Nations
peace-keeping operations, but most Japanese voters were unimpressed by the
opposition's campaign.
Japan's economic slowdown worked in favour of the ruling party, as
opposition parties did not offer an alternative economic policy. Mr Miyazawa
had called an emergency cabinet meeting on Friday to discuss the ailing
stock-market and to reinforce his party's economic credentials.
The LDP, which controls the more powerful lower House, will still be a few
seats short of a majority in the upper House, but is now in a strong
position to regain control at the next half-house election in 1995.
Mr Tanabe admitted that the SDPJ has 'defects'.
However, he said that, rather than resign, he should 'take responsibility
for overcoming these defects'.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Japanese spurn 'ox-walking opposition': The failure to take
advantage of mishaps within the ruling party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, last night painted in
the eye of a traditional daruma doll to celebrate the ruling Liberal
Democratic party's electoral successes, the country's opposition parties'
leaders pointed to a record low turnout as evidence of disillusionment with
the LDP.
But the turnout was more a measure of popular disgust with the opposition
parties and, in particular, the Social Democratic party (SDPJ), which was
called the Socialist party when it scored a remarkable victory in the 1989
upper House election.
Last night, Miss Takako Doi, the party's leader during that triumphant
campaign, insisted that the country 'must not forget the hundreds of
thousands who died in the (second world) war'. Her statement was a defence
of the party's decision to focus its campaign on the use of Japanese
military personnel for international peace-keeping organisations, and to
ignore most other issues.
However, Miss Doi, replaced as party leader last year, is herself a symbol
of the inability of the SDPJ to make itself a genuine alternative to the
LDP. During the past three years, the ruling party has been tainted by a
succession of scandals and factional farces, and yet popular support for the
leading opposition party has crumbled.
For many Japanese, the party has become known as the 'ox-walking
opposition', a reference to the painfully slow steps taken during the
parliamentary vote last month on the peace-keeping legislation.
Japanese do harbour doubts about that legislation, but they are also looking
for sound economic management and a fair share of the public works pork
barrel.
The inability of the SDPJ to offer an alternative is rooted in the factional
make-up of the party. While the LDP's factions, and the patronage system
they encourage, are rightly famous, the SDPJ is also deeply divided and
remains under the influence of an ideological left wing more determined to
guard the faith than to win an election.
'Seventy per cent of the party is to the right of the left wing', as a
senior official put it, but the remaining 30 per cent, including Miss Doi
herself, controls many of its policy-making committees. This left-wing
faction is almost incoherent on issues such as relations with the US and the
status of South Korea - the faction is a firm supporter of North Korea and
Kim Il Sung, its authoritarian Great Leader.
The SDPJ has been feeble in fashioning economic policy and its present
leader, Mr Makoto Tanabe, preferred to attack a 3 per cent value-added tax
introduced before the 1989 election than to recommend measures to stimulate
the slowing economy. Japanese are beginning to fear that the economy will
get much worse before it gets better, yet these concerns were not seriously
addressed by Mr Tanabe.
The results are a victory for Mr Miyazawa, whose first few months in office
were awkward. His faction manager, Mr Fumio Abe, was forced to resign in
January when arrested for allegedly accepting bribes, and it was rumoured
then that Mr Miyazawa would be replaced before the summer.
Among the smaller opposition parties, final results early today confirmed
that Komeito (the Clean Government party) can rely on its religious base,
the Soka Gakkai movement, to deliver the votes to maintain its minority
status. But Rengo, the trade union party, discovered that it cannot rely on
its union base to ensure success, as it did not win a seat.
One of the parties that was supposed to lead a 'realignment of Japanese
politics', Rengo brawled publicly over the peace-keeping legislation with
the SDPJ, which had supported that party's candidates at the previous
election.
Rengo argued in favour of lower taxes and higher pensions, but when Mr
Tasaburo Furukawa, the party's secretary-general, was asked before the
election about plans for an opposition party alliance, he replied vaguely:
'We have a plan, but we can't discuss it now.' Voters were apparently not
impressed.
The result leaves the LDP in a strong position to take control of the upper
House at the next half-house election in 1995, when the seats won by the
surging SDPJ in 1989 will be recontested.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Italian government decides bolster security forces in Sicily
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian government decided at the weekend to send 7,000 troops to Sicily
to bolster the security forces in their operations against the Mafia on the
island, writes Robert Graham. The use of the army marks a significant
escalation in the fight against organised crime; it is the first time in the
post-second world war era that army personnel have been deployed in this
way. The troops will protect public buildings, high-risk personnel and
conduct searches.
The move follows the Sicilian Mafia's increasingly brazen defiance of the
state. The organisation is considered responsible for the assassination of
Italy's two leading anti-Mafia magistrates, along with eight of their
bodyguards, in the past two months.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Crucial week for Italy's emergency economic package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian government's emergency economic package faces a decisive week in
parliament.
The package, which seeks to raise L30,000bn (Pounds 13.9bn) through revenues
and spending cuts, is due to be debated by the Chamber of Deputies by
Wednesday. Mr Giuliano Amato, the Socialist prime minister, has yet to
decide whether to urge a vote of confidence, but he may be forced to do so
to ensure swift approval.
Some 500 amendments have been tabled mainly by the populist Lombard League
and the breakaway communists grouping, Reconstructed Communism. But so far
the package, announced on July 10, has gone through the lengthy
parliamentary procedures in record time.
Mr Amato said at the weekend that he had repeatedly underlined the dramatic
state of Italy's finances to all 16 parties in parliament over the past two
weeks, and believed the message for urgent action had sunk in.
His message has been reinforced by the continued weakness of the lira and
latest figures on the public sector deficit. During the first five months of
the year the deficit reached L83,000bn, 24 per cent higher than the same
period in 1991.
Even with the emergency package this means the deficit for 1992 is unlikely
to be less than L150,000bn against the original estimate of L128,000bn,
equivalent to 10.3 per cent of GDP.
Mr Amato's government - backed by the Christian Democrats, Socialists,
Social Democrats and Liberals - only has a 16-seat majority in the chamber
of deputies. But the prime minister still hopes to broaden his support,
encouraged by a softening of the small Republican's party's opposition to
the measures.
He admitted last week's decision to abandon the creation of two
superholdings to facilitate privatisation of the main state entities was a
political set-back. However, Mr Amato said the two superholdings risked
becoming unworkable.
He confirmed reports that Prof Giuseppe Guarino, the industry minister who
proposed the scheme, had offered to resign. One of the factors weighing
against the move was Mr Amato's discovery that the Italian banks, who were
expected to underwrite bonds to the tune of L4,000bn this year in the
superholdings, would have done so only if specifically pressured by the
prime minister.
Mr Amato said he believed it would now be easier to privatise directly
through the main state entities, which in the past two weeks have become
joint stock companies. He expected the first privatisation move would come
from the flotation of Agip, the oil exploration subsidiary of ENI, the state
oil concern.
ing, might sell off one of its banking subsidiaries. The government, he
said, was still committed to raising at least L4,000bn through
privatisations this year.
Mr Amato said the abandonment of the two superholdings did not mean a change
in his government's broader aim of slimming down the state sector. Control
of the four main state entities which had become joint stock companies -
IRI, ENI, Enel, the electricity authority, and INA, the insurance institute
 -was in the hands of the Treasury.
There is likely to be a big battle over how IRI obtains new funds, if it is
to remain as head of a group controlling a L79,000bn turnover with debts of
L60,000bn. IRI is due to have its new statutes approved on August 6 but it
only has provisional capital of L1,873bn.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Change of heart on peace talks: Britain has reluctantly
accepted the need for an enlarged conference to end fighting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S decision to call an international conference on Yugoslavia,
probably to be held in London at the end of next month, represents a
remarkable change of heart.
After persistently maintaining that the European Community-sponsored peace
conference, chaired by Lord Carrington, remained the best forum for
negotiating a settlement between the warring parties in Bosnia-Hercegovina
and other parts of the former Yugoslavia, Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign
secretary, has pragmatically, if reluctantly, accepted the view that it must
be widened.
Under Mr Hurd's proposal, made in his capacity as current president of the
EC, not only the United Nations and the 52-member Conference on Security and
Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) will be represented at the enlarged
conference, but other 'principal governments and parties concerned', such as
the US and Russia.
Mr Hurd, who disclosed his proposal over the weekend in a BBC radio
interview in Manila, where he was attending a conference between the EC and
the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean), described the new forum
as 'an evolution of the EC peace effort'. He said he would chair the
conference, but that Lord Carrington would remain co-chairman.
The conference would look at 'all possible options' to end fighting,
initially in Bosnia-Hercegovina, where about 7,500 people have been killed
since the region's Serbs rose up against a vote in March by the republic's
Moslem and Croat population in favour of independence. However, Mr Hurd made
it clear he did not consider the use of military force to impose a political
solution to be a feasible option.
Following the repeated failure of ceasefire agreements negotiated by warring
parties under the umbrella of the EC peace conference, a ceasefire on the
ground will not be a precondition for holding the enlarged conference. But
it is clear that, in the absence of a halt to fighting in Bosnia, it will
not be any easier to negotiate a political and constitutional settlement
than it was in the EC forum.
It was a public outburst last week by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN
secretary-general, who complained about the lack of consultation between the
EC conference and the UN, which was being asked to perform supervisory
functions in Bosnia beyond its present capacities, which brought matters to
a head. Mr Hurd made a stopover in New York on his way to Manila to smooth
Mr Boutros Ghali's ruffled feathers. It was then that the groundwork was
laid for the new conference.
However, an enlarged international conference was originally proposed by
President Francois Mitterrand of France, on the grounds that the Carrington
conference had, in the words of his foreign minister Roland Dumas, 'reached
its limits'.
Not surprisingly, France has welcomed Mr Hurd's initiative. A Foreign
Ministry spokesman said one of the advantages of an enlarged international
forum was that it would bring in the Russians, who were best placed to exert
pressure on the Serbs, while the Germans, with their close relationship with
Croatia, could also have a bigger individual role to play in a wider
conference.
Notwithstanding the fact that the EC conference is on the point of being
superseded, Lord Carrington is going ahead with a meeting in London today of
the three warring parties in Bosnia.
This was called on July 17 following agreement on a ceasefire, which was
supposed to last at least 14 days but which collapsed almost as soon as it
was signed.
Acceptances to attend the meeting have been received from Mr Radovan
Karadzic, leader of Bosnia's Serbs, and Mr Mate Boban, the region's Croat
leader.
Moslem President Alija Izetbegovic has said he will send a representative.
Lord Carrington has made it clear he will no longer attempt to negotiate a
ceasefire, but will try to focus the talks on a constitutional settlement.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Broad Yugoslav conference 'must look at refugees'

<TEXT>
GERMANY yesterday threw its weight behind the British initiative for a
full-scale international peace conference to end fighting in former
Yugoslavia, and called for the growing refugee crisis to be high on the
agenda.
The conference was announced at the weekend, as part of a European Community
effort to broaden the scope of existing peace efforts.
Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, said the conference, to be held
in late August, probably in London, followed calls from several quarters -
including France, the United Nations Security Council and the EC - for an
international initiative.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, called for a radically improved
aid effort by both the EC and the rest of the international community. As
the first three of six special trains arrived in Germany carrying 2,600
refugees fleeing fighting in Bosnia-Hercegovina, Mr Kinkel said: 'No time
must be lost. This conference must begin as quickly as possible.'
He called in particular for Russia to be involved in the conference, in
addition to the UN, EC and the Conference on Security and Co-operation in
Europe, in order to exploit Moscow's influence on the Serbian leadership.
Mr Kinkel said the fighting in Bosnia had already unleashed the greatest
flight of refugees in Europe since the second world war, and Germany had
borne the brunt of it. Since the start of the war in the former Yugoslavia,
more than 200,000 people from the region have been allowed into Germany as
asylum-seekers or refugees.
'We can only help the refugees by acting together,' he said. 'This problem
cannot be solved without European and international solidarity.'
He also appealed to the UN to allow aircraft involved in the present
humanitarian airlift into Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, to be used to carry
children and wounded refugees out.
Mr Kinkel insisted the conference be based on principles already worked out
by the EC peace conference, chaired by Lord Carrington. These include the
refusal of international recognition of any territory conquered by Serbia by
force, guarantees of the rights of ethnic minorities, and an immediate
renunciation of the use of force.
In London, the Foreign Office said discussion of military options would be
on the agenda, but only insofar as they could help secure a long-term
solution to the region's problems.
British officials are anxious to portray the international conference as a
continuation of existing efforts, in order to safeguard undertakings already
given.
UN officials were considering yesterday an air drop to Gorazde, the last
Moslem stronghold in eastern Bosnia, after the failure of efforts to reach
the besieged town overland, writes Laura Silber in Belgrade.
Mr Fabrizio Hochshild, representative of the UN High Commissioner for
Refugees, said yesterday: 'The only other option is a ceasefire, but given
the history of ceasefires this seems unlikely.'
After returning to Sarajevo with a relief convoy, Mr Hochshild ruled out the
possibility of overland relief to Gorazde, besieged by Serb forces for 80
days. Some 70,000 people are trapped in the town without water or
electricity and supplies of food and medicine are badly needed.
The UN convoy was trapped 12 km outside Gorazde after hitting two landmines
on a road strewn with the corpses of Serb soldiers.
Meanwhile, after heavy shelling overnight Radio Sarajevo said that fighting
had eased in the besieged capital yes-terday.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French government has cancelled a radio and television campaign for a
Yes vote in the September 20 referendum on European union, after the CSA
broadcasting authority demanded changes.
The move, triggered by opposition claims that the FFr25m (Pounds 2.56m)
campaign was a waste of taxpayers' money, is an embarrassment at a time when
the popularity of President Francois Mitterrand and Mr Pierre Beregovoy,
prime minister, is sinking to new lows.
However, the government claims it has not climbed down and will continue
with a poster campaign, to start in 75 newspapers and on 6,814 billboards
today, representing well over half the campaign's cost.
Mr Mitterrand's popularity has fallen by two percentage points over the past
month, to 26 per cent. This is the lowest level since before last March's
disastrous regional elections, according to an Ifop poll in Le Journal du
Dimanche newspaper yesterday.
Only 32 per cent of French voters are satisfied with Mr Beregovoy, while 39
per cent are dissatisfied, according to the survey.
This is the first time Mr Beregovoy's unpopularity rating has exceeded his
popularity score since he came to office in April, an indication that his
prime ministerial honeymoon is over.
The Maastricht campaign row further dents the government's image, already
battered by the truckers' strike - which shortly predated the Ifop poll -
farmers' demonstrations, and scandals over political corruption and the
distribution of Aids-infected blood by the national transfusion service.
Mr Philippe de Villiers, an anti-Maastricht member of parliament in the
pro-European UDF party, complained to the CSA that the television and radio
advertising campaign, which was due to start today, breached a 1990 law
against broadcasting political publicity. It was not a straight public
information campaign as it was biased in favour of the Maastricht treaty, he
maintained.
Political posters and newspaper advertising are not covered by this law.
Mr Philippe Seguin, a leading anti-Maastricht campaigner in the Gaullist RPR
party, dubbed it 'a scandalous misappropriation of public funds' and called
on the government to scrap the poster campaign as well.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of the largest remaining obstacles to a barrier-free European market
could be removed later today, when EC finance ministers will make their
strongest attempt yet to agree minimum VAT rates and excise duties.
At a 10-hour meeting in Brussels last week national officials swept away
some of the remaining hurdles to a harmonised indirect tax regime.
The British presidency of the EC has now arranged for ministers to have a
whole day to tackle the remaining problems, following up their meeting last
month when they came close to agreeing the package of eight indirect tax
directives.
If they fail, further discussion will be delayed until after the EC's
unofficial summer break, making it practically impossible to implement the
new system by the end of the year. That would give member states an excuse
to postpone the lifting of border controls on goods come 1993.
'It is essential that we don't wait for the September meeting, but sort
these things out on Monday,' said a senior Commission official at the
weekend.
The meeting will be chaired by Mr Norman Lamont, Britain's chancellor of the
exchequer. He raised hopes for an agreement last month when he indicated the
UK could relax its long-standing opposition to a binding minimum standard
VAT rate of 15 per cent. At today's meeting the British paymaster general,
Sir John Cope - who will represent London's position - is likely to insist
that the directive on rates should be reviewed after four or five years.
The greatest worry is that agreement on the whole package might be derailed
by individual national concerns about the tax rating of everything from
children's seat-belts to guide dogs for the blind.
Mr Lamont is expected to table a compromise on one outstanding problem -
excise duty on whisky. The deal will be based on an earlier Portuguese
compromise which would split national duties into two tiers. Ministers will
be asked to decide where to fix two levels of duty. Under the Portuguese
suggestions, only Spain would have to increase its tax on spirits, while
duty in most other countries would be frozen at current rates.
Other potential problems include Belgian concerns about the VAT exemption
for gold in neighbouring Luxembourg. France is also worried that the
Netherlands and Germany may win the right to apply reduced rates to flowers.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Collor crisis nears climax: Brazilian president's former
private secretary to testify
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZILIAN President Fernando Collor's desperate attempt to save his
political career is expected to come to a head today with the crucial
testimony of Mr Claudio Vieira, his former private secretary, which Mr
Collor says will prove his innocence of corruption charges.
The crisis has gripped the nation for two months, since Mr Collor's younger
brother accused him of corruption. This provoked a congressional inquiry
(CPI) into alleged extortion by the president's friend, campaign treasurer
and alleged frontman, Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, who is known as PC.
The noose had tightened around Mr Collor last week after documentary
evidence presented to the CPI revealed financial connections between Mr
Farias, the government and the president's family.
Congressmen from all parties emerged shocked from CPI sessions in which they
scrutinised more than 40,000 cheques, receipts and bank statements made
available by the central bank and federal police. The documents allegedly
show that Mr Farias was running a kickback scheme, controlling 30 per cent
of the government budget and receiving millions of dollars from construction
companies in exchange for arranging government contracts.
Questioned by the police, the owners of these companies have been unable to
explain the payments which, in one case, amounted to Dollars 3m (Pounds
1.5m).
According to Brazilian press reports, the documents also show that Mr Farias
and his companies, often using fake names, were paying the president's
household expenses including his car, fittings, payments to his first wife
and the wardrobe of his second wife, Rosane.
Calls for the president's impeachment have reached a new level and his
future hinges on today's evidence. Mr Collor has claimed in a nationwide
address that he has had no contact with Mr Farias for two years and that Mr
Vieira was controlling all his bank accounts.
Mr Collor, who returns to Brazil today from the opening of the Olympic Games
in Spain, continues to insist he is the victim of a 'campaign by

FT  27 JUL 92 / Rome considering new tax incentives
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S government may be about to introduce new tax incentives to encourage
private investors to buy shares to smooth the path of its planned
privatisation programme.
Mr Giovanni Goria, finance minister, called on stockbrokers for 'a few more
days of patience, then the measures to support the bourse will arrive'. He
gave no details of the items being considered.
However, bankers believe a suspension, or possible abolition, of the
country's relatively new capital gains tax on equity dealings may be among
the priorities. Some also think the government might be considering a new
law, similar to France's Loi Monory, offering private investors tax
incentives to purchase equities.
Any measures to encourage share buying would have to be modest, in order not
to divert private savings out of funding the budget deficit. Private
investors are currently the main buyers of short-term Treasury bills, which
have traditionally been given tax advantages over equities in order to
siphon investors' savings into covering the deficit.
Suspending capital gains tax, which was revised three times before finally
being introduced last year, would be popular on the bourse. Brokers say the
tax, which has produced only modest receipts for the Treasury, has had a
substantial impact on sentiment towards equities.
Last week was one of the most dismal in the history of the Milan stock
market, with the Comit share index falling to its lowest level since late
1986. After plunging on Monday after the Mafia murder of a leading judge,
equities continued to slip on the back of sinking confidence in the domestic
economy and corporate profits.
However, a lively stock-market is one of the pre-requisites for the plans of
Mr Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, for a large-scale privatisation
programme.
Although shares in public-sector companies will be sold internationally, the
domestic market will be expected to absorb a substantial proportion of the
equity on offer.

<TEXT>
TRADE ministers from the US, Canada and Mexico yesterday concluded their
weekend talks in Mexico City aimed at ironing out remaining differences over
the North American free-trade agreement without announcing any big
breakthrough, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City.
The ministers said there had been progress and that they would meet again
this week to build on the momentum.
Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, suggested the negotiations would
draw to an end soon. But she added that a number of key texts - including
those on cars, textiles, financial services and investment - had not been
completed.
Mr Michael Wilson, Canada's trade minister, said his country had
difficulties with the rule of origin proposed by Mexico and the US in the
textile sector, but would try to obtain relief with tariffs.
The talks are reported to have advanced a number of substantive issues, with
progress made negotiating texts on agriculture, government procurement,
foreign investment and energy. The agriculture text was almost finished, a
senior Mexican official said.
Under US trade law a completed text can be presented to the US Congress 90
days after it has been initialled by the trade ministers. If President
George Bush intends to send Congress the agreement a few days before the
November 3 presidential elections the deadline for negotiations is the
beginning of August.

<TEXT>
THE South African government yesterday promised an investigation into a
pathologist's claim that police had murdered prisoners in detention, Reuter
reports from Johannesburg.
Dr Jonathon Gluckman, the pathologist, has examined the bodies of about 200
people who died in custody. He said he believed 90 per cent of them had been
killed by police.
'Tragic case after tragic case goes on and on,' he said yesterday. He added:
'The lower rungs of the police are totally out of control.'
Dr Gluckman, who gave evidence at the inquest into the 1977 death of black
activist Steve Biko, made his claims in Johannesburg's Sunday Times.
Mr Hernus Kriel, law and order minister, said he took the allegations very
seriously but dismissed suggestions that the police were out of control. 'We
should investigate this situation further.'
A decision would be made this week on whether to set up a judicial
commission of inquiry or order attorneys general to reopen cases.
Mr Kriel said natural deaths and suicides occurred in detention. 'Deaths in
detention do occur. But to say that police are responsible for people dying
in detention is simply not true.'

FT  27 JUL 92 / Lamont defends tough strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN LAMONT, the chancellor, hardened his defence of the government's
tough economic strategy yesterday in the face of renewed calls for other
approaches to remedying Britain's economic woes.
In an interview with BBC Radio 4, Mr Lamont said the pursuit of low
inflation was the only policy that would bring lasting economic recovery and
improve Britain's competitiveness.
He again ruled out a devaluation of sterling within the European exchange
rate mechanism, saying such a move was 'not on the agenda'.
His comments came on the eve of more bad news for the domestic economy.
Tomorrow the Confederation of British Industry's quarterly industrial trends
survey will show there was a sharp drop in business confidence during the
past month and that manufacturing companies do not expect their orders to
increase over the next few months.
Figures will also be released this week showing that mortgage lenders
repossessed more than 30,000 homes in the first six months of the year, only
a small decrease from the record 38,000 in the previous six months.
Over the weekend, several mortgage lenders again warned that they might have
to raise rates, even if base rates stay unchanged, to make up for bad debts
and heavy losses from repossessions.
Mr Lamont admitted that the recession had lasted longer than he had expected
but said this did not justify 'alarmist' talk of a 1930s-style slump.
Although he understood why people were impatient for some improvement, he
insisted that the government's anti-inflation strategy was a pre-condition
for sustained recovery.
On the same programme, Lord Tebbit, the former Conservative cabinet minister
and prominent Euro-sceptic, accused the chancellor of surrendering economic
control to Germany.
'At the moment the German economy needs high interest rates. I suspect that
the British economy needs rather lower interest rates and we have locked
ourselves into a position where the Chancellor has no discretion at all,'
Lord Tebbit said.
The Labour party accused the chancellor of 'breathtaking and arrogant
complacency'. Mr Gordon Brown, the new shadow chancellor, said: 'He is now
misleading us in saying there are no alternative policies to follow.'

FT  27 JUL 92 / Contractors drop prices up to 30%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRICES CHARGED by contrac-tors for construction work in Britain have fallen
by up to 30 per cent since 1989, according to contractors, customers and
building professionals surveyed by the Financial Times.
The findings emphasise the depth of the recession, which contractors say is
the worst for more than half a century and which has caused a large number
of company failures and redundancies.
Many contractors, desperate for cash from advance payments, have been taking
work at zero margin or even at a loss.
The worst affected part of the industry is in southern England where
recession and over-building, particularly of offices in the late-1980s, has
led to a big fall in new construction work, forcing prices down sharply.
Mr Peter Birse, chairman of Birse Group, says: 'Anybody who claims that they
are doing better than just covering overheads on contracts won in southern
England is lying.'
E C Harris, a firm of international cost consultants which prepared a study
of construction tender prices for the Financial Times, estimates building
prices in London have fallen 22 per cent since the second quarter of 1989.
It warns that customers accepting loss-making tenders may have to cope with
their contractor going out of business or face claims for extra payments as
contractors seek to recover margins on loss-making jobs.
Margins are at rock bottom in many parts of the country as contractors try
to move into new areas to offset the decline in private-sector office
building.
The transport department estimates that national prices for road
construction have fallen by about 20 per cent since 1989. Anglian Water,
another large customer of the construction industry, estimates building
prices have fallen 30 per cent in two years.
Price falls have affected other parts of the building industry.
The Royal Institute of British Architects, which last week complained about
architects having to take work at a loss to keep teams together, estimates
that over the past two years about a third of the country's 32,000
registered architects lost their jobs.
Redland, one of the country's biggest building material producers, estimates
that prices of some bricks have fallen by 40 per cent since 1989. Lower
building material prices have helped to cushion some of the impact of
falling contracting prices.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Iraq bows to UN pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IRAQ yesterday averted its most serious clash with the United Nations since
the Gulf war by agreeing to allow inspectors to search its agriculture
ministry in Baghdad.
The agreement appeared to lift any immediate threat of western military
action against Iraq to enforce the terms of the Gulf war ceasefire.
But President George Bush branded Iraqi President Saddam Hussein 'a bully, a
dictator, a merchant of death' and warned that the world would not tolerate
further Iraqi defiance.
Mr Rolf Ekeus, the UN official overseeing the dismantling of Iraq's weapons
of mass destruction, is due to arrive in the Iraqi capital tomorrow
accompanied by a new UN inspection team headed by a German. The team was
appointed after discussions with the Iraqis at the weekend.
As a gesture to Baghdad, two American members of the team will not enter the
disputed ministry but will stay outside, sifting through any material their
colleagues take from inside.
Asked if the crisis was over, Mr Ekeus said: 'I feel the immediate problem
is now settled. I am convinced about that.'
Mr Abdul Amir al-Anbari, Iraq's ambassador to the UN, said the dispute had
been resolved to the 'mutual satisfaction' of the UN weapons inspection
commission and the Iraqi government.
In London, the Foreign Office said Iraq had seen sense in the face of
international resolve. Its 'blatant attempts' to flout the UN ceasefire
resolutions had failed.
Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the Democratic challenger to Mr Bush in
the November presidential election, said the US and its allies should
continue to press Baghdad to comply fully with the terms of the Gulf war
ceasefire. The agreement yesterday was a 'good first step,' he said.
In his scathing remarks about the Baghdad regime, Mr Bush said the Iraqi
leader had lied about the extent of Iraq's weapons programmes. Its agreement
to give UN weapons inspectors access did not change that.
Asked about a proposed ultimatum threatening force against Iraq, Mr Bush
replied: 'I don't know that anything more is required at this minute.'
But 'the real test' of Mr Saddam's behaviour would come in Iraq's response
to future inspections, he said. 'Behaviour along the lines we have just
witnessed will not be tolerated.'
Over the past week the US, France and Britain have made increasingly overt
threats of military action against Iraq after the UN inspectors were barred.
The inspectors were forced to camp for 18 days outside the ministry
building, which they believed housed information on Iraq's missile
programme.
Mr Ekeus acknowledged a probability that during the stand-off the ministry
building had been 'effectively cleaned out'. But there might still be
material significant for UN inspectors, including some relating to missiles
and nuclear weapons.
Asked if Iraq's intransigence had thwarted UN efforts to eliminate its heavy
arms capability, he said: 'I think we have successfully identified existing
weapons and destroyed them.'
Even more important, he said, was that the Iraqi production capability had
been destroyed, and there was no possibility of a major new effort to
reconstruct the missile programme. He said that UN operations since the
ceasefire meant Iraq was no longer a 'threat through intimidation and
terror'. But it still had a formidable air force and a strong land force.
US officials warned earlier yesterday that the resolution of the inspection
crisis was only one element in a pattern of confrontation by Iraq.
Mr Richard Cheney, the US defence secretary, said that as well as giving
unrestricted access to UN inspectors, Iraq must:
Agree to the destruction of anything that supports a programme of weapons of
mass destruction and ballistic missiles.
Agree not to use military force to suppress Shia Moslems in the south.
Participate in the UN-sponsored commission to resolve the boundary dispute
with Kuwait.
Allow UN refugee and humanitarian officials to continue to have unimpeded
access to Iraq.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Japan cuts discount rate by 1/2 point
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of Japan cut official interest rates early today in an admission
that the economy is in worse shape than it had previously conceded.
The central bank's decision to cut the official discount rate (ODR) from
3.75 per cent to 3.25 per cent was immediately welcomed by Mr Tsutomu Hata,
the finance minister, as 'a timely and appropriate step'.
The move had been awaited eagerly by the securities industry, which had
feared that the Tokyo stock market would continue to fall this week after
losing 3.4 per cent on Friday to close at a six-year low.
Share prices opened higher this morning after the cut, with the Nikkei
average up some 400 points, or 2 1/2 per cent, after an hour's trading. On
the Tokyo currency market, the dollar opened at Y127.63 against a New York
closing rate of Y128.1 on Friday.
Central bank officials said that the rate reduction would contribute to
realising stable domestic economic growth. Previously the bank had hoped
that the lowering of the ODR from 4.5 per cent on April 1 would be the last
cut for the year, but a quarterly forecast published last week recognised
that recovery would not, as predicted, come in the autumn.
After the deregulation of Japan's financial markets, the effects of an ODR
cut will be more symbolic than real, although it will encourage downward
movement in market rates. In recent days, the central bank had allowed
market rates to fall, heightening speculation that a cut was imminent.
The cut is certain to be widely interpreted as an attempt to bolster the
stock market, but Mr Yasushi Mieno, Bank of Japan governor, has previously
insisted that 'official interest rates are not reduced to support share
prices'. He is concerned that growth is being retarded by the 'pessimistic
mood' of Japanese consumers. The bank is also worried that pressure is
increasing on Japanese financial institutions, which are restructuring a
growing number of corporate clients exposed to the stock and property
markets, and unable to trade themselves out of trouble.
Japan is also under growing US pressure to meet the official 3.5 per cent
growth forecast for the year to end March 1993. That target now appears out
of reach, and private institutions are generally forecasting growth of
little more than 2 per cent for the year.
The slowdown has led to a surge in Japan's trade surplus - a record Dollars
49bn (Pounds 25bn) for the first half and still rising. The US and Japan
begin a two-day review tomorrow of a pact signed in 1990 to remove
'structural impediments' to bilateral trade, and the US is certain to ask
Tokyo to stimulate the economy.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Survey of New Zealand (16): A small nation's sense of
self-respect - Sport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAI HAYWARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BY ANY standards, New Zealand is one of the great achievers in world sport.
Its roll call of world champions and record holders, now and in the past, is
impressive and out of all proportion to what might reasonably be expected
from a country of only 3.3m people.
Its medal haul at the last few Olympics has been impressive. On a medal per
population basis it exceeded that of any other country, putting this small
south Pacific nation in the forefront of international sport.
It has also achieved great success in non-Olympic sports such as the
Whitbread Round the World Yacht Race, where in the last event, after 24,000
gruelling miles, New Zealand yachts fought out an exciting climax to finish
first and second.
International sports administrators and athletes sometimes ask why such a
small country, with a population fewer than many large cities, excels in
such a wide variety of sports, both as individuals and in team events.
New Zealanders take their sports seriously. When the national rugby team,
the All Blacks, were beaten in the semi-final of last year's Rugby World
Cup, millions of words were written and hours of television time were
devoted to analysing the defeat in minute detail.
Retribution was also swift. The selectors, coach, assistant coach, captain
and several senior players - all deemed to have let their country down -
were dropped.
In a few weeks, New Zealanders will vote in a referendum to determine the
method of selecting future governments. Fewer than one in 1,000 voters knows
the meaning of the referendum alternatives. By contrast, only one in 10,000
does not know that the All Blacks were beaten by Australia by only one point
in early July.
This means that every child and adult in the country has access to ample
facilities in any sport they choose. People of all ages are actively
encouraged through government-backed community service TV advertising to
'have a go' and participate in some sporting activity.
Other aspects of the New Zealand lifestyle and environment help to encourage
sporting prowess. The country's clean air, congenial climate, good quality
housing, easy access to beach, bush and countryside, outdoor living and
plenty of healthy food - even for the less well-off  - all provide a solid
base to encourage and develop sporting ability.
The shoreline is the fifth largest in the world. With its numerous natural
harbours, lakes and rivers, this is an ideal environment for water sports.
The colourful sight of thousands of yachts on the sprawling Auckland harbour
on summer weekends has earned it the title of City of Sails. Children aged
10 to 12, in specially designed small yachts, have their own competition
races. These help to develop their skill from an early age.
At the last two Olympics, New Zealand won several medals in yachting,
canoeing, kayaking and sailboard riding. It has been a major competitor in
the Whitbread Race and in the America's Cup.
One big disadvantage for world class New Zealand sportsmen or teams is
distance. To compete in the northern hemisphere or the US where most world
championships are staged is costly in time and money.
To send the country's equestrian team to the Barcelona Olympics will cost
more than NZDollars 250,000 (Pounds 80,000). Teenage girls, members of the
hundreds of pony clubs around New Zealand, have contributed to the team's
fund-raising. This is one sport in which the country has high hopes of
winning a medal. The team includes Mark Todd, a champion rider hoping to
gain his third successive gold medal.
The cost of sending the full Olympic team of 138 athletes will be more than
NZDollars 3m (Pounds 1m).
Without financial support, topline individuals or sporting bodies would not
be able to compete in international events to the same extent as they do
now. Helping to meet some of the costs is the Hillary Commission, a
government-appointed body which this year has NZDollars 24m from lottery
profits to fund sporting organisations.
While some of the funds will help to finance the Olympic team, a
considerable amount of money is spread widely to encourage all types of
sporting and leisure activity. Each year, hundreds of organisations benefit.
Some grants are modest to help local sports club acquire or build better
facilities. Grants can range from helping to build a new mountain hut for
alpine climbers to providing equipment for a rural softball team.
The major objective is to encourage all New Zealanders of all ages to
participate in some form of sporting or leisure activity. For continuing
sporting success, particularly against larger, wealthier nations, has given
New Zealanders confidence and a sense of self-respect.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Survey of New Zealand (14): Target trebled after visitors
top 1m - Tourism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGELA WIGGLESWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN VICTORIAN times, New Zealand's early tourists flocked to see the famous
Pink and White Terraces near Rotarua in North Island until this landmark was
destroyed by a volcanic eruption in 1886. Today, most tourists go to New
Zealand for its scenic beauty and the innumerable outdoor activities it
offers.
For the first time, in the year ending April 1992, visitors topped the
million mark with 1,016,589 international arrivals mainly from Australia,
the US, Japan, the UK and Germany. 'This puts the tourism board right on
track for reaching its target of 1.123m visitors by the end of 1992,' says
Mr John Banks, the country's tourism minister.
Last year, the government formed a private sector-managed tourism board. Of
its budget of NZDollars 60m, the government provides NZDollars 20m , with a
further NZDollars 20m to be awarded, so long as the commercial sector
matches the sum, which it is on target to do within the year.
'This is three times the amount we have previously had and it provides us
with a wonderful opportunity,' says Mr Norman Geary, chairman of the tourism
board. 'We are telling airlines, tour operators and others involved in the
New Zealand travel scene that we are going to put more money on the table to
help them, but they have also got to make funds available. The more costs
are shared, the more benefits there will be for those who contribute towards
them.'
Tourism currently generates NZDollars 6bn (around Pounds 3bn) a year, the
largest single amount of overseas income. In a comprehensive strategy for
growth, the board has set out its plans up to the end of the decade. Its
long-term aim is to attract 3m visitors by the year 2000.
That is a staggering figure since it is about New Zealand's present
population. But the benefits to the industry and economy generally of
achieving this target, says Mr Geary, would be NZDollars 5.7bn in foreign
exchange earnings with 270,000 jobs in tourism, double the present figure.
Was there not a danger that that many visitors would destroy the very things
they came to see? Mr Ian Kean, the tourism board's chief executive, admits
that if there is too much growth, the environment will suffer. 'Growth must
be managed carefully, sensitively and correctly,' he says. The board works
actively with the Department of Conservation and the national parks to
ensure visitors do not spoil any natural attractions.
Investment opportunities exist in abundance, says Mr Kean, and the tourism
board work as a catalyst 'with anyone to make things happen'.
The board has begun a series of investment seminars in some of the world's
main markets to promote opportunities in New Zealand. One has been held in
Singapore and others will follow in Britain, Japan and Korea. The campaign,
the board hopes, will help shatter the myth that New Zealand is clean, green
but boring.
This year, too, Auckland has broken a northern hemisphere grip on a million
dollar-a-day business by winning a bid to host the 1994 world conference of
the Society of Incentive Travel Executives. About 300 travel planners,
controlling budgets totalling more than NZDollars 17bn a year, will see what
New Zealand has to offer.
Ask most visitors what they like about the country and the answer is likely
to take in the unspoilt landscape, the cleaniness of the cities, the
unpolluted air, the friendliness of the people, the Maori culture. You can
find the scenery of the whole world in New Zealand, packed into a country
the size of Britain: snow-topped mountains, rainforests creeping to the feet
of glaciers, turquoise lakes and rivers, wide plains, fiords, fine beaches,
steaming mudpools and geysers.
Older people may like to experience these from the comfort of a car or coach
(there are many organised tours). But now, with the introduction of
lower-cost charter flights, more young people are able to get to New Zealand
and the 24-35 age group - who walk the long- distance tracks, swim with
dolphins, go whale watching, bungy jumping, river rafting and skiing, to
name a few of New Zealand's many sporting activities - has become an
important target market.
Uncrowded roads make for easy driving but InterCity coaches and trains are
comfortable (some have sheepskin seats), clean and punctual. Bus drivers and
train guards give cheerful commentaries; Devon cream teas are served on the
Tranz Alpine Express as it climbs the spectacular Southern Alps, and you can
reach the inter-island ferry at Picton by the Coastal Express that travels
up the east coast of South Island to the Marlborough vineyards.
New Zealand has its share of top hotels but more visitors are discovering
that Home and Farm Stays are good value. These are a fairly new development,
the equivalent of bread-and breakfast in the UK, and a first handbook about
them has recently been published.
For disabled visitors, the country has been called the most accessible on
earth. Every new public building and major reconstruction is required by law
to provide adequate access for people with disabilities and there is a a
guide available for 'the less mobile traveller'.
This year, Air New Zealand, which announced a consolidated net profit of
NZDollars 56.1m in its half-yearly results to December 31 1991 and won a
magazine 'Airline of the Year' award as Best Carrier to the Pacific for the
ninth year running, is adding a fourth weekly flight to Auckland with a
Boeing 747-400 aircraft which, says Mr Bruce Leonard, the airline's regional
general manager Europe, will boost accessibility to many Pacific islands.
Together with Jetset, the company is offering a 10-day fly-drive holiday
from Pounds 997 to include return flights from Gatwick and 10-day campervan
hire. A combination of flights and rental car for 10 days costs from Pounds
1,009 with accommodation vouchers available from Pounds 18 per person a
night.
For two people travelling together, British Airways offers, till the end of
October, one return ticket at Pounds 960, the other at Pounds 360. Several
tour companies have cut-price rates: one, Abta-recognised, quotes Pounds 599
for a return to Auckland. Courier rates, to deliver mail direct to their
destinations, are charged at a third of the full price on BA flights.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Survey of New Zealand (17): Patchy recovery on the farm -
Dairies are the bright spot, while exports have improved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AGRICULTURAL exports, including fish, are playing a major role in returning
the New Zealand economy to better health. While a 10 per cent currency
devaluation over the past eight months has been significant, exporters'
confidence has been buoyed by the growing international acceptance of New
Zealand products of all types.
The primary producing sector was hardest hit by the economic reforms between
1984 and 1990. A combination of a high exchange rate and interest rates that
sometimes hit 25 per cent forced many farmers to leave the land.
A remarkable return in farming confidence has followed the arrival of
minimal inflation, coupled with more competitive exchange and lower interest
rates.
But it is a patchy recovery. Sheep farmers, while better off, are still
struggling. To be profitable the average farmer needs a return of NZDollars
40 for lamb but he is getting only Dollars NZ22, according to the Meat and
Wool Board's economic service.
Yet viewed across all farming sectors, profitability is rising. The rate of
return on total farm capital has historically been in the range of 2 to 4
per cent for sheep and beef farms. But the top group of farms (12 per cent)
now show a return of 10 per cent or more on capital and 34 per cent of farms
achieve a return of between 5 and 10 per cent.
The major characteristics of the top farms are high stock performance and
more livestock units per person. Mr Rob Davison of the Meat and Wool Board's
economic service says gross farm incomes could be boosted by a third over
the next five years, which would restore profitability to the levels of 15
years ago.
The tough times that New Zealand farmers have faced are reflected in the
fall in the numbers of animals farmed. In 1984-85 New Zealand exported 40m
lambs, but this year only 26m will be available. In 1982 there were 13m more
sheep and cattle on farms, and declining profits have forced many farmers to
cut back on maintenance, allowing parts of many properties to start
reverting to bush.
Despite this, a better-than-expected 1991-92 wool season ended on June 25 on
a more confident note. Morale had been low at the start of the season after
the suspension of the Wool Board's minimum price scheme left the board
holding a stockpile of 565,000 bales, and prices were low due to the
international recession and because of the absence of two major buyers, the
Soviet Union and China.
However, China resumed buying again, and some improvement in world demand
saw a gradual pick-up for the wool market indicator from 370 cents a kg in
late November to peak at 535 cents in early June. Then prices weakened
again, in line with falling international demand to 468 cents. However, it
was a considerable success to reduce the stockpile by around 156,000 bales:
this was seen as a great achievement in a world recession.
New Zealand is the world's largest producer of crossbred wools, used in
carpets, and is meeting success in selling to growing markets making
hand-knotted carpets in China, India, Turkey and Iran. The industry hopes
that a new marketing plan will boost real returns, which are at a 25-year
low. Returns from sheepmeat have been good, and profitability is being
boosted by a growing trend for added processing of carcases before export.
This year for the first time, more lambs will be exported in processed form
than in carcases. The live sheep trade to Saudi Arabia has also been
buoyant.
Beef prices, which hinge on US demand, have eased due to rising worldwide
production and recessionary trends which have seen intense competition from
pork and chicken. Exports to Korea and other parts of Asia are developing
rapidly.
Dairying is the one really bright spot. Nine months ago there were serious
concerns within the industry that another low payout, similar to last year's
Dollars 3.75 a kg of milkfat from the co-operative dairy board would force
farmers to walk off their land. However, an unexpected lift in demand from
October saw the pay-out from the board rise steadily to end the season at
Dollars NZ5.20, and farmers will receive additional payments from their
local dairy companies which could see them earn Dollars 6 a kg.
With forecasters expecting another good season, dairy farms are undergoing a
resurgence of interest. In some provincial districts, such as Southland and
Canterbury, beef and sheep farmers are converting their properties to dairy
cattle.
There is some nervousness over further trade reform and protectionism within
the EC, as well as worries that EC export subsidies will increase. However
there are hopes that the Gatt round can be satisfactorily settled, as an
agreement could avoid a further round of negotiations over access to the
important British market. New Zealand's current access is restricted to
55,000 tonnes, but under the present proposals it could be lifted to 76,000
tonnes, the average for the three years between 1986 and 1988.
The dairy industry is meeting good demand for cheese and dairy powder in
Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. A good wet season has encouraged
farmers to boost output, and there is substantial investment in new
technology. Fishing has turned into a winner: helped by a worldwide shortage
of white fish. This industry now accounts for 5 per cent of the country's
exports.
Last year New Zealand's extensive 200-mile economic zone handled 2.5 per
cent of the world's tinned fish catch. In the year to December, it earned 30
per cent more - at over NZDollars 1bn than in 1990, and is said to be on
target to do even better in this calendar year. The Fishing Industry Board
expects it to earn over Dollars 2bn a year by the end of the decade. While
most varieties have met strong international demand, there are hopes for a
strong resurgence of interest in squid, which could earn as much as Dollars
400m a year.
The board says the industry has improved its competitiveness by 16 per cent
in the past 18 months and believes the outlook remains promising .

FT  27 JUL 92 / Survey of New Zealand (12): Closer, but still some way apart
 -Relations with Australia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW ZEALAND'S political and trading relationships with Australia have
undergone striking changes since the signing of the closer economic
relations pact a decade ago. Today they are major trading partners, with
increasingly close links in defence, aviation, customs and police.
It was not always so. For though both countries had similar British origins
and links in war, migration flows (New Zealand is much closer to the main
Australian population centres of Sydney and Melbourne than these are to
Perth in West Australia) and similar democratic systems, both jealously
guarded their independence.
New Zealand, as the more Anglophile of the two, retained closer trading
relationships with Britain after it joined the EC. Australia, the stronger
economy, increasingly looked to Japan and Asia. Enthusiasm for closer
economic relations was stronger in New Zealand. Signing of the CER agreement
succeeded because of the enthusiasm of Mr Hugh Templeton, National's trade
minister, and Mr Doug Anthony, Australia's deputy prime minister and leader
of the minority Country party, both frustrated at the slow progress of
Nafta, the previous trade pact.
Today it would be difficult to imagine any serious rupture in the CER
agreement as it has produced significant benefits to both countries. Yet the
fragility of the relationship was shown last month when Mr Don McKinnon, New
Zealand's deputy prime minister, needed considerable diplomatic skills to
defuse a strong move within the governing Australian Labor party and the
ACTU, the trade union organisation, to impose work permits on New Zealand
workers who were allegedly working outside the union movement for cut price
wages, and not paying Australian tax.
As seen from New Zealand, the issue was a crucial one, and struck at the
heart of CER, as an open and free labour market was seen as a vital
component. Work permits had never been needed between the two countries, and
the issue, initially sparked by the Australian Shearers' Union, seemed
trivial.
In his talks with Australian ministers Mr McKinnon hinted delicately that
New Zealand could retaliate with reciprocal requirements. This could have
profound effects on major Australian companies in the banking, insurance and
manufacturing industries which have recently moved to dominate some sectors
of New Zealand business.
Disrupting the free movement of labour, Mr McKinnon warned, could act to the
ultimate detriment of the Australian economy. Mr McKinnon, who has excellent
relations with senior labour figures, succeeded in his mission with an
agreement that tax matters would be investigated. But the matter left a
feeling of nervousness in New Zealand government circles that a relatively
minor issue, whipped up by trade unionists, got as far as it did in nearly
undermining CER.
There is also some concern in Wellington that the review of CER, due this
year, seems to be making very slow progress. It is concentrating on a number
of issues, including making it easier to trade, travel (where some progress
has been made) and to invest in and work between the two countries. The
review is also supposed to consider such questions as a new double tax
agreement which would facilitate the paying of imputation, or tax on shares
in companies in the two countries.
Widespread publicity in Australia about the success or otherwise of New
Zealand's economic reforms, especially in curbing union power and cutting
wage agreements, has antagonised some Australian ministers in the Labor
government who, judging from recent speeches, seem keen to stop the spread
of what is known in Australia as 'the New Zealand disease'.
Both Mr McKinnon and Mr Jim Bolger, the prime minister, are expected to
concentrate their efforts in the coming months on trying to play down
ideological differences with the Australian government and return to the
warmer relationship that existed between 1984 and 1991 when both countries
had Labour governments.
During that period, the reformist New Zealand government of David Lange
swept aside a vast array of controls on the economy, including relaxing
ownership rules on companies. This led to a rush of Australian investment,
which accelerated after the 1987 share market crash as share values
plummeted in New Zealand.
The strengthening business links became apparent in May and June when the
Australian government was seen in Wellington to have shown considerable
flexibility to the New Zealand position in establishing its new aviation
policy. The first step in this was to create a single aviation market
between the two countries, while New Zealand needed to move to protect the
interests of Air New Zealand, in which Qantas is a substantial shareholder.
Politically, there remains considerable public disquiet over the signing of
a NZDollars 2.4bn agreement by the Labour government in 1988 under which the
Australians are to build two frigates for New Zealand. Costs have risen by
31 per cent already, and a government committee has expressed reservations
about the wisdom of the deal which was supposed to have led to NZDollars
700m worth of business for New Zealand manufacturers. The frigates could
have been bought much more cheaply from British or European shipyards.
While overall trade statistics show that trade between Australia and New
Zealand is broadly in balance, that reverses the situation from the 1970s
when Australian manufacturers dominated. New Zealand exported Dollars 2.11bn
worth of goods to Australia in 1990-91, the latest year when figures were
available. This was a 1 per cent drop in 1990 figures, and represented 17.9
per cent of all New Zealand exports (compared with 18.9 per cent in 1990).
The drop was due to recessionary trends in Australia.
New Zealand now supplies 4.7 per cent of all Australian imports. Australia
has increasingly drawn ahead of Japan, the EC and the US to become New
Zealand's most important market, taking 52 per cent of the country's
manufactured goods. It is estimated that, thanks to the economic reforms,
currency changes, lower wage and industry costs, New Zealand companies enjoy
a 25 per cent cost advantage over their Australian counterparts.
From the New Zealand perspective, there are several worries over the future
of the agreement. These rest on the need to maintain the present competitive
advantage; uncertainties of how far the Australian tariff reduction reform
programme will go and what effect this will have on exports of top quality
New Zealand apparel and garments. On the positive side, it is now widely
acknowledged in business circles that barring unforeseen political problems,
the two countries will inevitably grow increasingly close, leading to the
hoped-for single market.
Among business people, there is also growing talk of eventual political
union, with New Zealand in effect becoming a state of Australia. However,
this is unlikely to happen quickly. Older New Zealanders - and the present
generation of politicians - will not rush to give up their notions of
independence.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Survey of New Zealand (13): Just right for British palates -
Angela Wigglesworth salutes a growing reputation for fine wines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGELA WIGGLESWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GRAPHIC indication of the meteoric rise over the last decade of New
Zealand's reputation for fine wines is that there was no mention of them in
Hugh Johnson's encyclopaedic book published in 1966. Not until the 1980s did
New Zealand wine begin to have international status: in 1981 exports to the
UK totalled 37,890 litres; 10 years later they had jumped to 2.2m litres.
For the 11 months to June this year, the figure is 3.3m litres.
While domestic wine sales are expected to fall from over 41m litres in
1990-91 to 39m litres in 1991-92 (last year's budget curtailed retail
spending and raised wine prices through increased excise duties), exports
have grown by 21 per cent in volume and 32 per cent in value over the same
period. White wine accounts for 83 per cent of output, red wine (growing at
the fastest pace) for 11 per cent, sparkling wine 4 per cent and fortified
wine 2 per cent. The UK, which takes 42 per cent of the country's wine
exports, is New Zealand's biggest market.
'More people in Britain are becoming aware that New Zealand makes wine that
is of high quality and sells it for just under Pounds 5 a bottle,' says Ms
Vicky Bishop, UK manager of the New Zealand Wine Guild, a group of export
wineries established last year. The range is large for a relatively small
country and, at the guild's annual tasting in London this year, visitors
were able to try 200 different and many award-winning wines - Sauvignon
Blanc, Chardonnay, Chenin Blanc, Riesling, Cabernet Sauvignon and Pinot Noir
 -from 43 of the country's 100 or so wineries.
The main wine-producing areas - the most easterly in the world - are in
north-west Auckland, the Bay of Plenty, Gisborne, Hawke's Bay and
Martinborough, the Canterbury Plains, Nelson, Central Otago. In Marlborough,
the Wairau Plains has become one of the 10 great wine-producing regions in
the world and the largest in New Zealand. It is hard to believe the first
grapes were planted here only in 1973.
But wine-growing in other parts of New Zealand goes back 140 years: Mission
Vineyards at Hawke's Bay dates from the settlement of French missionaries in
1851. Corbans in Henderson was established in 1902 and Te Mata in 1909. Many
winemakers and growers are third and fourth generation descendants of
European immigrants who brought the skills of winemaking with them.
Montana, for instance, was founded in 1944 by a Dalmatian immigrant Ivan
Yukich and now has 850 hectares of vineyards yielding up to 15,000 tonnes of
grapes. With a 1,000-tonne winery crushing an estimated 45 per cent of New
Zealand's entire grape crop, it is the largest winemaker in the country.
The most successful winery, says Bob Campbell in his New Zealand Wine
Annual, is Cloudy Bay whose Sauvignon Blanc 'developed cult status almost
immediately after the release of the first vintage in 1985 and has remained
highly sought after ever since.' Mr Kevin Judd, a wine-maker who was born in
England but left when he was nine to live in Australia, told me, over
Vivaldi's music in the winery, how the company began: David Hohnen, the
Western Australian winemaker, had 'got successful with his reds, wanted to
make whites, but wasn't getting the right quality.'
In 1984, four New Zealand winemakers dropped in to see him, produced a
bottle of their Sauvignon Blanc which so impressed him that within a year Mr
Hohnen was in New Zealand having a look round. 'In 1985 he offered me the
job of winemaker,' says Mr Judd, 'and we set up Cloudy Bay.' Today around 90
per cent of its wine is exported round the world where it is pre-sold before
delivery.
Another success story comes from the three Nobilo brothers, the second
generation to run their family winery, Nobilo Vintners, which is nearly 50
years old. Last year they signed a NZDollars 3m contract to supply 1.5m
quarter bottles of their Poverty Bay Chardonnay to British Airways. The deal
boosted New Zealand wine exports by 6 per cent and made BA the first airline
to serve non-European wine on its European flights, according to Mr Peter
Russell, BA's public affairs manager.
New Zealand's only methode champenoise specialist is Mr Daniel Le Brun, a
12th generation champagne maker from Epernay in France, who came to
Marlborough in 1979, bought 35 acres and opened the winery six years later.
'He came looking for a hillside and found this,' his wife, Adele, who comes
from Cumbria and is the winery's marketing manager, says. 'This' was,
indeed, a hillside and Mr Le Brun dug deep into it to create the only
underground cellar in New Zealand to provide him with a naturally cool
environment for maturing the wine.
'Everyone thought he was completely round the twist,' Adele says, 'but it's
worked.'
Many vineyards have introduced Visitors' Tours and Trails (one company runs
a 'de luxe scenic wine trail with white water rafting' two-day package) and
there are at least 10 local wine and food festivals.
The largest is in Marlborough, sponsored by Air New Zealand, which also
offers a wide selection of New Zealand wine on its aircraft, changing the
wine list quarterly to bring innovative local winemakers to the fore. Their
festival, held every February on Montana's Brancott Estate and now in its
ninth year, is so popular that a hectare of grapes has just been pulled up
to make more room for its 14,000 visitors.
'You can sample a glass of the best Sauvignon Blanc in the world, while
relaxing on a hay bale enjoying the musical entertainment in the sunshine,'
says Mr Mike Blair, the festival's enthusiastic co-ordinator, adding that a
pink and blue toilet built specially for the Queen's recent visit to the
area but never used, was now the festival's information centre.
Avery, the Bristol shippers, wine merchants and agents for Nobilo, was one
of the first to bring New Zealand wine to the UK. 'We are always looking for
wine that tastes as if it was Pounds 7 a bottle but costs Pounds 5,' says Mr
David Pinchard, marketing manager. 'What makes New Zealand wine so special?
It has to do with the climate (warm sunshine, light summer rains and a long
autumn ripening period) which seems to produce these very dramatic
Sauvignons that don't taste like anything else in the world.'
The way they make some of the wine is unusual, too, he says. They pick
grapes on South Island, truck them up overnight to Auckland and arrive at
the wineries with the fruit pressed down and frost on it. 'It's a vision of
wine making that is different from anything that exists in Europe.
'All of us in the business,' he adds, 'are terribly keen for the New Zealand
wine industry to work. The wines are so good they're forcing the French to
re-evaluate theirs.'
The New Zealand Wine Guild will be taking part in a regional wine tasting in
Bristol (September), the Sunday Times/Decanter show (October), the BBC Good
Food Cooking and Kitchen Show (November) and a consumer tasting in London on
December 8 at the Commonwealth Institute.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Survey of New Zealand (11): Challenge that could not be
turned down - Profile of Ian Donald
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER SEVEN difficult years in charge of the restructuring of pulp and paper
group, Fletcher Challenge Canada, Mr Ian Donald seemed a surprise choice to
be recalled to Auckland to become chief financial officer for its parent -
New Zealand's biggest company.
With revenues of USDollars 8bn, Fletcher Challenge has substantial overseas
investments in Australia, Brazil, Chile, Canada, Britain and the US. Mr
Donald's original term had been extended by two years. It was expected he
would stay in Canada till the company returned to profit after the losses of
the past two years.
Mr Donald is the last remain
ing senior executive of the old Wellington-based Challenge Corporation which
merged with Fletcher Holdings of Auckland in 1981. After the transfer of the
head office in 1987 from Wellington to Auckland, senior Fletcher people
increasingly dominated its management. Yet, had the merger not occurred, Mr
Donald seemed earmarked to succeed Sir Ron Trotter as chief executive of
Challenge, the country's biggest rural group.
As financial officer, he succeeds Mr David Sadlier, one of the country's
most popular business figures who had held that post, first with Fletchers
and then with Fletcher Chal
lenge, for over 20 years.
Mr Donald dominates any group. He is 6ft 6in, powerfully built, with a
booming voice. He was born in Liverpool in 1941. His doctor father, who was
serving with the Eighth Army in North Africa, sent his young family for
safety to Canada and then South Africa. When the family was reunited after
the war, they emigrated to New Zealand. Mr Donald worked on farms for three
years before deciding he needed better qualifications.
After completing degrees in commerce and accounting, he gained
qualifications in farm accounting in England and agricultural economics at
Michigan State. He joined Challenge Corporation in 1972, becoming head of
the rural division of Fletcher Challenge in 1981. As head of the company's
operations in Canada from 1987, he oversaw the merger between British
Columbia Forest Products and Crown Forest Industries to form Fletcher
Challenge Canada, and the CDollars 1.4bn upgrade of its plants.
The company's sales total USDollars 2bn, but because of the recession
profits have been erratic. In 1989 the group earned USDollars 250m after
tax, but it incurred a USDollars 20m loss last year, with a similar result
expected this year. Mr Donald says he is very bullish about the industry and
prices should pick up as the slow economic recovery gains pace in key North
American markets.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Survey of New Zealand (9): Financiers with the highest
profile - The rise of Fay, Richwhite
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MERCHANT bankers Sir Michael Fay and David Richwhite are symbols of the
successes of the economic reforms launched under the Labour government from
1984.
Their company Fay, Richwhite has been at the centre of much of the state
asset sales either as adviser, facilitator or financier. They have been
involved in many corporate mergers and takeovers. Last week they agreed to
sell their 27 per cent holding in Bank of New Zealand, which has been
acquired by National Australia Bank.
Fay, Richwhite has a vigorous, fast-growing operation in Australia and is
also represented in money market operations in Britain, the centre of its
European operations.
In New Zealand's list of wealthy people, the two regularly feature near the
top. And Sir Michael has become something of a national folk hero through
his dogged attempts to win the America's Cup: twice on the water and once
through a special challenge and ensuing protracted court actions in New
York.
The two have been partners since 1975, and both are 43. Sir Michael, a
lawyer, met Mr Richwhite in the early 1970s when both worked for a
pioneering merchant bank, Securitibank. The pair have a reputation for good
timing: both resigned to set up their own business well before
Securitibank's collapse in December 1976.
Only once have they been caught out: when they rushed to buy the stake in
the Bank of New Zealand in 1989. The bank later discovered it had massive
bad debts totalling NZDollars 1.4bn in Australia, and Mr Richwhite has said
they failed to do their homework properly.
Early days for the partnership were difficult: the two operated from a tiny
office and experimented with property speculation, financing restaurants and
films.
However they prospered from the early 1980s when controls were put on
interest rates as part of a freeze. As early supporters of the Labour
government of Mr David Lange and Sir Roger Douglas, they helped set in
motion the reforms of the Rogernomics years, and are quick to say they made
a fortune out of being the first, and for a time the only, players in the
Euro-Kiwi financial markets which took advantage of the lifting on controls
on currency and investment.
Their company took an active role in advising the government on possible
asset sales. They handled the biggest sale of all, Telecom, to Bell Atlantic
and Ameritech for NZDollars 4.2bn in 1989, also being responsible for
Telecom's international public float last year.
Both men are now seen as key figures in the Auckland establishment. They are
personally charming: attributes which have helped them rise to the top of
acceptability from running what was considered a fringe operation in a
remarkably short period of time.
Sir Michael has the high profile: Mr Richwhite is cast as the backroom boy
who makes sure the company and all its deals run smoothly. Fay, Richwhite is
New Zealand's most prominent financing organisation, and appears determined
to stay that way.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Survey of New Zealand (8): Britons are targeted -
Immigration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNDER A NEW migration policy, New Zealand is once again actively promoting
itself in Britain, the source of most of its European migrants since the
whaling and sealing days of the early 1800s.
From annexation by Britain in 1840, New Zealand's migration statistics have
been dominated by British migrants. (This changed in 1976, when the Muldoon
government, concerned about over the high economic cost of settlement in the
face of the first energy crisis, clamped down on all migration.) Thousands
of New Zealanders, many in senior positions in business, government and the
bureaucracy, today speak with English accents and are proud to say they were
assisted migrants under the long-running Pounds 10 assisted passage scheme.
Thanks, possibly, to their numbers and the influence of their descendants,
there is no anti-monarchist republican movement as there is in Australia.
From the 1960s New Zealand received increased waves of Polynesian migrants
as the country struggled to find unskilled labour for its protected
industries. With the dismantling of protection since 1984, many are now
unemployed. Most Polynesians now gain admission through family connections,
although overstaying by island people on holiday, or with expired work
permits, is a continuing problem for the authorities.
Since the Fijian coup, New Zealand has had a high level of Indian migration,
while thousands of Asians, many from Hong Kong, Taiwan or Malaysia, have
gained admission through various entrepreneurial schemes.
Officially, New Zealand welcomes migration from all parts of the world. But
a preoccupation of Mr Bill Birch, the new minister of immigration, has been
to emphasise skills. Mr Birch, regarded as the most powerful man in the
cabinet, is the driving force behind the new policy which initially targets
British migrants - and sets out to make them aware of their acceptability.
Under the new system, people interested in buying an existing enterprise, or
seeking a top position to manage the changes now under way in the country,
will be keenly sought. Among others, this policy has led to the recruitment
of Dr Peter Troughton, the former Telecom head who is now a senior
government adviser on health, and Ms Angela Griffin, the new Wellington city
manager.
A second target group is people loosely described as wanting to 'take a
chance with a new initiative, or doing their own thing, or in competing for
management positions.' The British initiative has had a good response; in
the first few days 600 applied for information from New Zealand House. A
simple points system is designed to tell intending migrants quickly of their
acceptability.
Over the past year, the number of migrants from Britain appears to have
reversed a declining trend - it is believed that the complex admission
systems were a great handicap.
A total of 3,547 British migrants received residence permits in the year to
June 1990; 16.19 per cent. In the year to June 1991, 3,875 people settled
from the UK (15.58 per cent) and in the year to June 1992, 3,267 - 16.92 per
cent - have been accepted. Under the new policy this number is expected to
grow over the coming months.
Europe is also targeted (from the New Zealand embassy in Bonn): 5.54 per
cent were accepted in 1990; 7.16 per cent in 1991; 6.72 per cent to June
this year. The rest of the world provided 17,146 (78.27 per cent) in 1990;
19,209 (77.26 per cent) in 1991, and 14,745 (76.36 per cent) to June this
year.

as much as anyone - wants to see a strong revival of the UK economy and its
tourist industry.
The man who spearheaded Brierley Investments' purchase of the British hotel
group, Mount Charlotte, now faces pressure to prove to a somewhat sceptical
New Zealand investment community that it was a good move. The purchase in
1991 represented Brierley Investment's single biggest investment, and was
seen as a declaration that Mr Collins, not founding chairman Sir Ron
Brierley, was now running the company with the support of Mr Bruce Hancox,
the executive chairman.
Mr Collins, who has been chief executive of Brierley Investments since 1983,
was enthusiastic about Mount Charlotte and its management team led by Mr
Robert Peel from the time BIL bought its initial stake in 1987. To address
the balance-sheet strains, Brierley this year sold its other major British
investment, Tozer Kemsley and Millbourn, the car group, arguing it was now a
mature investment. TKM was restructured over much of the previous decade by
Mr Reg Heath, its chief executive, with full BIL financial backing and the
support of Mr Hancox.
Mr Collins, who visits Britain most months to study the Mount Charlotte
investment, has become a walking encyclopedia on the British hotel and
tourism industry. He has a remarkable ability to remember facts and figures
about the company he heads, its investments and technicalities in its
balance sheets and those of its subsidiaries. This seems to have been bred
into him. Both his father and grandfather were New Zealand auditors general,
and his uncle, Sir Bernard O'Connell, was a brewing magnate.
Now 39, Mr Collins was a key player with Mr Hancox in the boardroom coup
which led Sir Ron Brierley to step down as chairman in 1989. This followed
the 1987 crash and differences of views on how the company should be run in
a new investment climate. Sir Ron was reluctant to sell some major assets,
and was keen to invest in others. Mr Collins' innate caution triumphed, and
led to the sale of NZI, Winstones, New Zealand Newspapers and most
contentious of all, IEL, the Australian investment vehicle that Sir Ron had
developed over 20 years living in Sydney.
Since the coup, Brierley Investments has been accused of lacking Sir Ron's
vision. Confusingly, both Mr Collins and Mr Hancox argue they run the
company on Sir Ron's guiding principles. Sir Ron still provides some input
on the board and runs the Brierley subsidiary GPG, which has BIL backing.
Mr Collins says that caution is among his personal weaknesses, along with
perfectionism. He has imposed disciplines, especially on financial
reporting, on the company, and as one of its largest individual
shareholders, he is determined to see it succeed. He has a reputation for
being single-minded. 'I make no apologies for being tough. There are no
rewards for second prize, and every transaction must be done to the best
extent you can,' he says.

The Maoris' Grievances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A bid to settle grievances that have strained relations with the Maori
people since the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi with the UK in 1840, the
New Zealand government is painstakingly working through hundreds of land
claims. The aim is to achieve a 'full and final settlement' by the turn of
the century to try to bring about greater harmony.
The land issue is the most graphic sign of problems between Maori and other
races in New Zealand. But there are other difficulties, such as Maori
bitterness at the enormous influx of Polynesians from neighbouring Pacific
territories. There are now 20,000 more people from Polynesia living in
Auckland than Maoris; Polynesians will also soon outnumber Maoris in
Wellington. Largely unskilled, they tend to compete with Maoris for jobs and
live in similar state housing areas.
Apparently due to peer pressure, Maori children tend to leave school at the
earliest opportunity, a point being addressed by the government which raised
the leaving age for all races to 16 in the July budget.
Maoris form a dispropor- tionate percentage of people in jail: a figure
possibly related to their higher than average level of unemployment. Efforts
are being made through work schemes to tackle their lack of skills.
Their leaders retain confidence that some of the Maoris' economic problems
will be settled through the hearing of claims over the Waitangi Treaty. This
has already seen the Maoris receive a substantial share of offshore fishing
resources, as a direct result of the previous Labour government backdating
all claims to 1840.
The land issues have been more contentious, especially a controversial claim
by the Ngai Tahu tribe for most of South Island. As privately-owned land is
outside any claim, in effect this is a claim for all government land, most
of which was transferred to state-owned enterprises.
The Ngai Tahu people have to date received around NZDollars 35m from their
claim through a land bank procedure. It is hoped this could lead to a
settlement of all their claims within a year, possibly netting them
NZDollars 350m. In such cases the Maoris tend to invest the money, often
with the target of creating work for their people.
In the North Island protracted delays in reaching settlements have led to
isolated incidents such as the burning of a farmer's home recently after he
sought higher compensation than the government was prepared to pay over a
disputed parcel of land.
Mr Doug Graham, minister of justice, hopes the claims will have the effect
not only of improving race relations but also of letting Maoris 'out of the
dependency mode where they've been for much too long. They need to take
their place in the sun like everyone else.' He says durable solutions are
being achieved when both sides think a deal is fair.
'In the past the Maoris never had that opportunity. They were just told:
This is how much you're going to get, and you're damn lucky to get it.
'What the Maori people want is something that gives them a leg up to where
they were before the expropriation took place,' he says.

country's relations with its island neighbours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW ZEALAND in the 1980s and early 1990s has become increasingly aware of
its relatively small size. This realisation has been bolstered by its
banishment by the US from the Anzus defence pact, and awareness that its
once close links with Britain are fading as the UK becomes more deeply
involved in the European Community.
Much to its surprise, it continues to be regarded as a Pacific power by many
of its smaller island neighbours. In part, this is historic: following the
First World War it became a colonial power itself as Western Samoa, a German
Pacific territory, was ceded to its control. Many Pacific Island leaders
studied in New Zealand schools and universities, fostering links that remain
strong to this day.
Relations with France, the region's last remaining colonial power, remain
uneasy because of French nuclear tests. The Fijian coup caused a rift which
is healing under a new National government.
Turbulence often marks relations with states such as Samoa, although these
tend to centre on migration problems, particularly New Zealand's treatment
of overstayers. Recent New Zealand governments have run into friction over
aid matters, as they seek to earmark donations to causes that are seen as of
economic value to the island nations.
The five cyclones that devastated many of the nations in the past 18 months,
however, have shown the deep links with New Zealand in a generous outpouring
of aid by both the government and individuals. More Samoans now live in
Auckland than in Western Samoa. Remittances from migrants working and living
in New Zealand to relatives are an important part in sustaining some island
economies.
New Zealand has always been a trading nation. For over a century it has
supplied foodstuffs to French territories such as Tahiti and New Caledonia.
These commercial links led the Bank of New Zealand to become the main retail
bank in most of these territories. The bank's financial problems from 1987
forced it to sell these subsidiaries to Australian banks.
Today the Pacific, including Papua New Guinea, remains a significant market
for New Zealand products. This includes meat - the area takes 5 per cent of
all meat exports - and fresh vegetables. New Zealand places a considerable
effort in diplomatic relations with these often highly sensitive small
states. These efforts seem to be successful: despite occasional problems,
New Zealand is warmly regarded as its smaller size makes it less threatening
to tiny nations. As a result, New Zealand is set to win an increasing share
of trade with these countries.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Survey of New Zealand (4): Electorate turns cynical -
Politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS A flash of lightning reveals all on a dark night, this February's
parliamentary by-election in the affluent south Auckland suburb of Tamaki
illuminated the main contours of New Zealand's political landscape.
The by-election in this 'blue ribbon' National (Conservative) seat was
caused by the resignation from parliament of Sir Robert Muldoon, prime
minister from 1975 to 1984. Sir Robert was the last of New Zealand's
'borrow, tax and regulate' leaders: his defeat unleashed the programme of
modernisation and liberalisation dubbed 'Rogernomics', after Sir Roger
Douglas, Labour's radical finance minister, which in five years turned the
country upside down.
The electorate thought it was voting for a breather when it turned back to
National in 1990. But Mr Jim Bolger's government has taken Rogernomics into
pastures new, notably industrial relations and welfare. For all the
controversy caused by reforms such as the Employment Contracts Act,
deregulating labour relations, or part-charges for hospital visits, the
leaders of both main parties unite in their rejection of the ancien regime.
Sir Robert's departure, after years of ineffectual carping on the sidelines,
laid the ghost of an era.
For Mr Bolger, with a trail of broken election promises and a deeply
unpopular welfare-cutting budget to defend, a by-election defeat at Tamaki
seemed likely. Significantly, the challenge came not from Labour, but from a
new rainbow 'Alliance' of five parties - including Greens, defectors from
both main parties, and Mana Motuhake, a Maori party - thriving on popular
discontent with both main parties.
Yet on the day National squeezed back with a greatly reduced majority. The
run-up to polling day saw a succession of favourable economic indicators;
and the cohesion of the Alliance crumbled under the media spotlight. The
real loser, though, was Mr Mike Moore's Labour party, which came a poor
third, unable to pick up the protest vote.
Polls still show Labour ahead in the race for the next election, due by
November 1993. But a recent survey put the parties neck-and-neck and Mr
Moore has neither the credibility (as a member of the Rogernomics cabinet)
nor the inclination to play the populist card against Mr Bolger. The
Alliance, with a steady 20 per cent in the polls, can be relied on to do
that, boosted perhaps by Mr Winston Peters, a Maori National MP sacked from
the cabinet last year, who appears to be angling for expulsion from the
party with a series of vitriolic attacks on the supposed misdeeds of its
business allies.
But remember Tamaki. Labour and the Alliance will be up against the same
problems in the next election, with National starting from a higher base.
The Alliance lacks not only coherent policies, but even a leader - and the
favourite for the post, Mr Jim Anderton, a 1980s defector from Labour's
left, is unlikely to strengthen its appeal to the middle ground. As for
Labour: 'we will win because we are the conservative party', says Mr Moore,
pointing to the array of interests antagonised by the latest dose of reform
medicine. Perhaps, but the generally perceived strength of the economic
upturn is working to National's advantage, while Mr Bolger's evident
capacity to trim to the tide - as in the succession of back-downs from
especially unpopular aspects of Ms Ruth Richardson's 1991 budget - is
softening the edges of antagonism.
The odds, therefore, must be on Mr Bolger surviving next autumn with a small
majority. However, for both main parties an arguably more critical test is
less than two months away, in the shape of a national referendum on
proportional representation. A shift from first-past-the-post to a form of
PR would break the mould of New Zealand's two-party system, with
fragmentation, coalitions and inter-party wheeling and dealing the most
likely consequences. Suffice it to say that National and Labour are
campaigning side by side to preserve the status quo - which fact alone may
be enough to ensure its destruction, say the cynics.
In a bid to avert that, the government has erected a veritable obstacle
course to electoral reform. On September 19 voters have to choose between
five systems - first-past-the-post and four more or less proportional
alternatives. If there is a majority for change, a further referendum will
be held on the same day as the next general election, offering a straight
choice between the existing system and the reform option gaining most
support in the first poll - which is most likely to be the 'mixed member'
system, a variant on that used in Germany. The politicians are hoping that
even if a majority vote for change first time - which appears likely - the
disparate pro-reform movement will have run out of steam in a year's time.
In case it does not, the issue is to be complicated further still by a third
referendum, on restoring New Zealand's second chamber, to be held in tandem
with the second and the general election. The revival of the upper house,
abolished in 1951, is a pet scheme of Mr Bolger's. He supports it for
traditional Tory reasons (mature reflection on legislation and so on), but
there is even less agreement on the form of a new second chamber than on a
new electoral system.
So constitutional revision is very much in the balance. But it is important
to remember why it is on the agenda at all. Neither main party felt it could
face the last election without offering voters the chance to change the
system, and PR, endorsed by a royal commission in the 1980s, was and is the
most popular panacea.
Panacea for what? Mr David Lange, the former prime minister, says bluntly:
'It is deep- seated cynicism about politics and parliament. It is massive
alienation of the electorate from the elected. It is lack of confidence in
our system.'
Unless they can restore confidence, no amount of clever footwork will save
New Zealand's politicians from a still stronger backlash. And with or
without PR, their best hope of salvation lies in prosperity.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Survey of New Zealand (5): Shock of a shake-up - The impact
of social reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS just over a year since Mr Jim Bolger's newly-elected National
government launched a calculated Blitzkrieg against New Zealand's health,
education and industrial relations establishments. Determined to extend the
outgoing Labour government's 'Rogernomics' to the labour market and welfare
state, Mr Bolger and his colleagues knew they had to move decisively in year
one before the trimming inevitable in the run-up to next year's election
stopped reform dead in its tracks.
The Employment Contracts Act (ECA) is the most ambitious component of the
package, cutting a swathe through half a century and more of industrial
relations policy. Gone, in one fell swoop, is the closed shop which held
sway over large chunks of (mainly blue-collar) industry, and with it
national, occupation-based, union-negotiated awards which are still the norm
in Australia. The act swept away the special negotiating rights and
privileges of trade unions, allowed employers to insist on individual or
enterprise-wide contracts in place of the former collective contracts, and
limited the role of the courts in employment disputes.
These changes, largely drawn from plans formulated in the late 1980s by the
influential Business Roundtable, have had most impact on the unionised 40
per cent of the workforce. But there have been significant knock-on effects
for the country's managers. 'General managers now have to manage the most
important aspects of their business - pay and conditions,' claims Mr Alan
Jones, industrial relations director at Fletcher Challenge, New Zealand's
largest conglomerate. 'It's been a shock for many of them - but it's about
time,' he adds.
For Campbell Tubes, a small car components manufacturer in Thames, near
Auckland, the ECA has meant a zero pay increase this year, greater
managerial flexibility in deploying staff, and an end to the old regime of
time-and-a-half for the first three hours of overtime and double time
thereafter. But only after a week-long stoppage before the Engineers' Union
would sanction the new single-company contract. The union sent its national
officials down to Thames to consult the staff and negotiate the deal - the
first time the company can recall seeing them in Thames.
It has been a similar picture throughout unionised industry, with
tourist-related concerns the biggest gainers. New Zealand's business elite
is convinced the ECA has given the country an edge over 'sleepy' Australia,
for whom an equivalent of the ECA is still but a gleam in opposition leader
Dr John Hewson's eye. But it is early days, and as yet concrete examples of
investment diverted are hard to find.
Predictably, the Council of Trade Unions cries foul play. But the transition
has proved fairly smooth in most of the private sector, which was anyway in
the throes of radical restructuring in reaction to the 'Rogernomics' and
economic slowdown of the 1980s. Mr Ken Douglas, the council's president,
claims that wages have been screwed down. But with inflation at 2 per cent
and declining, and the economy still weak after a decade of low growth, it
might more accurately be described as an end to the 'cost plus' mentality.
However, in the public sector the transition has been far from painless. In
particular, the government's termination of collective contracts for
teachers has led to strikes and virulent protest. Teacher unions see the
move as an integral part of ministerial designs to shift all state funding,
and with it control of teachers' pay and conditions, down to schools. This
is undeniably the government's objective.
Dr Lockwood Smith, the education minister, is piloting complete devolution
of funding to the 'trustees' (elected governors) of 60 schools, and before
even assessing the pilot has shifted funding of all senior staff to schools.
Dr Smith speaks approvingly of England's grant-maintained schools, and wants
to create similar 'private schools without fees' in New Zealand.
Health reform is driven by the same desire - and UK models - for separating
'purchasers' from 'providers' and evicting politicians from the detail of
public sector management. The country's 14 integrated area health boards are
being replaced by four appointed regional health authorities which will buy
services from between 20 and 25 'Crown Health Enterprises', each of which
will run a general hospital plus a range of ancillary services.
Unlike Britain, the model is not to be extended to primary providers, but in
New Zealand they were only ever partially absorbed into the 'free' national
system, and the government has contented itself with removing entirely the
subsidy paid for visits to GPs by above-average income earners. They must
now pay the full cost - averaging around NZDollars 30 (Pounds 9) - for such
visits.
Gone, too, are most remaining universal welfare benefits, including a
significant reduction in payments to pensioners. Most controversial, though,
are new part-charges for hospital visits, introduced earlier this year.
Labour and leading health practitioners say this is the first step towards
fully privatised health care.
Mr Simon Upton, the health minister, vigorously refutes such claims. 'Our
agenda is simple: to cope with the fact that we are a heavily indebted
country that will have to contain spending to survive,' he says. The charges
will extend to only 20 per cent of users - but now the charging structure is
in place, they can easily be extended downwards, say the critics.
To an outsider, the welfare reforms look positively revolutionary. But Mr
Upton insists: 'The only significant political debate in New Zealand is
whether governments of whatever party will be able to resist calls for a
social dividend from growth.' For the government, debt reduction must have
first call; doctors, teachers and union leaders have other ideas.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Survey of New Zealand (3): How the bank governor controls
economic policy - Don Brash is interviewed by Andrew Adonis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW ZEALAND has achieved what Britain's economics establishment can only
dream of: an independent central bank, free of month-to-month interference
from politicians, with but one prime objective, to conquer inflation for
good.
The publicly-a vowed objective of New Zealand's Reserve Bank could not be
clearer: '(to) formulate and implement monetary policy with the intention of
achieving a stable general level of prices by the year ending December 1993
and maintaining price stability beyond that date'. Price stability is
defined as an annual rate of increase in the consumer price index of between
zero and 2 per cent.
The target is almost certain to be met. Inflation is currently at just over
1 per cent, down from 12 per cent five years ago. It could be virtually zero
in a year's time.
Until the Reserve Bank Act of 1989, New Zealand's monetary policy was
directed by its Treasury, with the Reserve Bank largely subservient. The
decision to grant the bank independence was political: with an inflation
record for the previous 20 years far worse than the average for leading OECD
countries, the then Labour government determined to attack the hydra once
and for all.
The remedy was of a piece with wider reforms to the New Zealand public
service, much of which is now hived off into quasi-independent state
enterprises. Even senior officials in what remains of government departments
are now on individual short-term contracts.
'There are two broad propositions behind what we have done,' says Dr Don
Brash, the Reserve Bank's urbane but cautious governor. 'First, that central
banks independent of the government are better at achieving price stability,
and can achieve it at lower social and economic cost; but second, that
governments of any persuasion are going to be very reluctant to hand over
total control to a central bank.'
Dr Brash now possesses as much effective control of economic policy as Ms
Ruth Richardson, the finance minister, and his profile in the financial
world is higher than anyone's but hers.  Nonetheless, total control has not
been given to the Reserve Bank: the new regime has been carefully crafted to
retain a political long-stop should it be needed. In vision and detail it
owes much to Professor Charles Goodhart of the London School of Economics.
Thus the Reserve Bank Act is a part of New Zealand's ordinary law: it has no
special constitutional status, and could be repealed by a simple majority in
parliament tomorrow. Even without repeal, a government could quickly
undermine it - by using its statutory power to issue instructions to the
bank, or by seeking to rewrite the inflation targets set out in the written
agreement between the finance minister and the governor. And since the
governor is, in effect, appointed by the minister, a determined government
could secure a compliant governor before long.
The independence of the Reserve Bank accordingly rests on two essential
pillars: its own reputation and credibility, which the 1989 act supports but
does not guarantee; and the almost complete political consensus behind the
maintenance of price stability.
The 1989 act was passed by the Labour government, which had already
appointed Dr Brash, a former National party candidate, to the governorship.
But it was supported by Ms Richardson in opposition; and when she took
office at the end of 1990 only one target was changed: 0 to 2 per cent
inflation was to be achieved by 1993, not 1992, a change with which Dr Brash
was entirely happy, given the looming uncertainty of the Gulf War.
Dr Brash is very much a politicians' banker, preaching the message of price
stability at countless lunches and dinners with a slick PR machine in tow.
'If we don't carry broad public consent for what we are doing, the bank's
independence will come under acute strain - whatever the legislation says,'
he says. The bank's half-yearly monetary policy statement, issued earlier
this month - just before the budget, to warn of the dangers of loosening up
on fiscal policy - concentrates on refuting claims that throttling inflation
is slowing recovery. Not all are convinced, but voices like that of Mr Len
Baylis, a consultant who argues that the single-minded assault on inflation
has deepened the recession, are surprisingly few.
Given the political wind behind him, Dr Brash's job is largely to act as the
politicians' conscience. In its last budget before the 1990 election, Labour
increased spending and added significantly to borrowing: the bank responded
with a hike in interest rates. 'The great virtue of the new system is
transparency,' says Dr Brash, recalling that shortly after, the New Zealand
Herald ran a leader arguing that New Zealanders now realised that
governments could not win elections by unjustified loosening of fiscal
policy, since the Reserve Bank would simply send them the bill in higher
interest rates.
Dr Brash's term comes up for renewal just before next year's elections. He
is too much of a politician to speculate on the future. But he is an easy
target if recovery does not materialise; and a prize exhibit if it does.

SHROUDED IN an eerie darkness broken only by the occasional street lamp and
headlight, Wellington at night is reminiscent of East European cities before
the collapse of the Berlin wall. The lights are off this winter because of
an acute hydro-power shortage brought on by drought, and New Zealanders are
reacting with remarkable feats of conservation to avoid black-outs and
short-time working.
The energy crisis may strengthen the Kiwi spirit. But it could hardly be
worse timed, just as a decade of economic gloom appears to be lifting.
Optimism positively gushes from most of New Zealand's politicians and
economic forecasters. It is of recent origin. Barely six months ago despair
was ubiquitous, the country weighed down by a sense of embattled isolation
given added emotional intensity - to an extent unappreciated abroad - by
controversy with the US over nuclear warships visiting the country's ports.
'New Zealanders have been going through the hardest times most of them can
remember,' writes Mr Bryce Harland, until recently high commissioner in
London, in a trenchant study published this month*. He considers the price
of independence as 'continuing deprivation, at least disappointment', with
New Zealand 'more on its own than it has ever been before'.
The country, he concludes, 'has become what the poet R. A. K. Mason
described 70 years ago as a 'solitary hard-assaulted spot/ Fixed at the
friendless outer edge of space'.'
In Wellington, at any rate, such pessimism is already old hat. Last year New
Zealand recorded its first current account surplus in two decades, with a
strong export performance not just in primary agricultural products but also
in manufactured goods. East Asian markets are growing rapidly (25 years ago
the South Pacific and East Asia took a fifth of New Zealand's exports; soon
it will be two-thirds). Tourism, now the country's biggest business, is
booming. The three months to March saw GDP growth of 1.1 per cent, the third
successive quarterly rise. This followed news that inflation rose by only 1
per cent in the year to June, the lowest rate of all 24 countries in the
OECD.
Ms Ruth Richardson, finance minister in Mr Jim Bolger's National
(right-of-centre) government, is jubilant. 'We now know we can succeed. The
positive signs are here; they are unmistakable; and they are all around us.'
Even old friends are coming back. President Bush's decision to remove
tactical nuclear weapons from US warships may open the way to a resumption
of security ties. Mr Bolger, whose party was compelled by public opinion to
accept its Labour predecessor's anti-nuclear policy before the last
election, is trying to bury the hatchet as quickly as possible.
All that said, New Zealand is convalescing, not recovered. Its growth
projections are impressive only compared to its recent past. Investment is
weak. The country's export base remains comparatively narrow; and prospects
for sustained improvement in its agricultural exports depend largely on a
successful outcome to the Uruguay Round. Not that Wellington is beyond
reproach when it comes to tariffs: last month Mr Philip Burdon, the trade
and industry minister, handed down a raft of 'anti-dumping' levies on
imported footwear, clothing and cars.
New Zealand has played an effective part in the Cairns Group, and Mr Tim
Groser, its chief Gatt negotiator, is in constant orbit. But as one trade
official puts it: 'There's still a lot of goodwill from Britain, but who
thinks Bush and Mitterrand give a damn about us?'
Above all, it will take more than a year or two of growth to overcome the
legacy of the 1980s, New Zealand's most traumatic decade this century.
Economic stagnation scarred a people who only 20 years before had enjoyed
one of the highest standards of living in the world. The causes were simple
enough: a collapse in prices and markets for New Zealand's narrow range of
agricultural exports and a rapid deterioration in the debt and fiscal
situations with dire implications for the majority of the workforce - in
manufacturing and the public sector - dependent on government largesse,
variously provided through subsidies, salaries, export incentives and state
investment.
Sir Robert Muldoon's National government vainly pretended that nothing had
happened in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It has one great achievement to
its name: the 1982 Closer Economic Relations agreement with Australia, which
began a rapid progress towards free trade between the two countries, from
which New Zealand has been the principal gainer. The present government sees
it as a model for agreements with other Asian countries.
For the rest, Sir Robert paid dearly to stave off the inevitable. It was his
defeat by Labour in 1984 which heralded the New Age, as most New Zealanders
see it. Dubbed 'Rogernomics' after Sir Roger Douglas, the Labour finance
minister who masterminded the first bout of reform, it saw market regulation
swept aside, the subsidy regime axed, the public sector rationalised and its
organisation turned upside down, the tax system overhauled (with a sales tax
introduced and the top rate of income tax halved to 33 per cent), and a
melt-down of the entire structure of import licensing and export incentives.
It was little short of a revolution, justified to a sceptical Labour party
and electorate as the price of recovery. When recovery failed to
materialise, bitter recrimination started. Civil war erupted in the Labour
party with first Sir Roger, then Mr David Lange, the prime minister, forced
to quit. And in 1990 the voters took their revenge, returning National under
Mr Bolger with a landslide majority.
Mr Bolger, a relaxed and reassuring North Island farmer, appeared to offer
an end to upheaval. But once in office, his government only intensified it.
Within months Ms Richardson, an avowed admirer of Sir Roger, had taken
Rogernomics into health and welfare in a self-styled 'mother of all
budgets', and the Employment Contracts Act, enacted at the same time,
extended it to industrial relations.
A year on, the storm which greeted those two measures has largely abated,
calmed by a succession of strategic retreats. But the experience has only
deepened popular disillusion with the politicians. It is not just resentment
about promises flagrantly broken: it is one manifestation of the acute
anxiety felt by most New Zealanders about their personal prospects after a
decade of stagnation and restructuring. Says Mr Lange, now a columnist: 'The
fact of it is divisions in society were papered over with money from
guaranteed export sales, then with borrowed money. Now these divisions are
raw and sore to the point where increasing numbers of people are impatient
with an existing order they see as unfair.'
It is not helped by the fact that New Zealand's politicians seem to be
forever campaigning. With only a three-year parliamentary term, governments
are barely installed before they are fighting for their lives. The knuckles
are already bare for the autumn 1993 contest. Labour - led by Mr Michael
Moore, briefly prime minister at the tail-end of the last Labour government
(1984-90) - is ahead in the polls. But National is narrowing the gap, buoyed
by a by-election victory earlier this year in a seat widely expected to fall
to the newly-formed Alliance, an electoral coalition of minor parties
(Labour came a poor third).
The hot money is backing Mr Bolger to renew his lease on the top-floor suite
of the Beehive, the tower housing Wellington's entire cabinet. Not that much
would change were he to lose. Ms Richardson's reforms have been hotly
contested by Labour, but it accepts virtually all the constraints driving
current policy.
'Raising the tax burden simply isn't an option', says Dr Michael Cullen,
Labour's finance spokesman, mindful of the conventional wisdom that Labour's
2.5 percentage point increase in general sales tax in its last budget before
the 1990 election killed the nascent recovery stone dead.
However, whatever its outcome, next autumn's election is arguably of less
importance to the future of New Zealand politics than the possible fall-out
from a more immediate test: a national referendum on proportional
representation to be held on September 19. A decision by the electorate to
shift from the current first-past-the-post system to a form of PR could
destroy the existing two-party system and lead to unstable, shifting
coalitions. PR is expected to win in September, but it will take another
referendum next year before it is introduced; and even then it will not take
effect until the election after next (due in 1996).
'PR in New Zealand is Public Revulsion,' says Labour's Mr Moore. Maybe
prosperity will come soon enough to reconcile Kiwis to their politicians. If
it doesn't, New Zealand is in for social unrest and a period of acute
constitutional turbulence.

Any government em-broiled in two political scandals, a constitutional row
and a severe economic slowdown might expect a drubbing at the polls. But
Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party got off lightly in yesterday's
national elections to the Diet's (parliament's) upper house.
The party lost far fewer seats than it had expected. It will now be
well-placed in the next election in 1995 to win back control of the upper
house, which it lost during the 1989 Recruit scandal, and re-establish its
longstanding monopoly of legislative power.
The Recruit stocks-for-favours affair now seems nothing more than a painful
memory for the LDP. This year's two financial scandals, involving Kyowa, a
building materials group, and Sagawa Kyubin, a truck delivery company,
hardly surfaced in the election.
Nor did the voters pay much attention to the controversy over the recent
bill to permit the despatch of Japanese troops overseas to serve in UN
peace-keeping forces. The LDP and rival parties were prepared for a tough
fight over whether the bill infringes Japan's pacifist constitution. The
ruling party published posters showing a Japanese as a member of an
international baseball team. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, waxed
eloquent about international contributions. But in the event the voters were
not interested.
As for the economy, the global slowdown may be bad news for US President
George Bush, but it has done no harm to Mr Miyazawa. In the boom of the
1980s, the Japanese flirted with opposition parties. But the collapse of the
financial bubble has sent voters scurrying back to the well-tried haven of
the LDP.
This is gratifying for Mr Miyazawa, whose chances of a second year in office
when his term expires in the autumn grow better by the day. However, the
surge in popular support could dissuade the LDP from tackling underlying
political and economic problems, including electoral corruption.
In many constituencies money still dominates election campaigns.
Particularly in the countryside, the heartland of LPD support, the voters
want to know which candidate will bring their district the biggest share of
government spending.
There is nothing uniquely Japanese about this. Politicians everywhere are
familiar with electoral bribery. But what is worrying about Japan is the
extent to which the pork-barrel dominates politics. This did not matter to
the outside world when Japan was preoccupied with rebuilding its economy
after the second world war, but now that it is an economic superpower it is
of international concern.
Japan's electoral system forces politicians into a debilitating dependence
on money. Multi-member constituencies account for most seats in the Diet's
lower house and for many in the upper house. Because politicians from the
same party have to compete against each other, party discipline and ideology
are weak. Electoral success is built largely on personal appeals to voters -
appeals which are greatly enhanced by pledges of money. The biggest amount
of cash circulates around elections to the Diet's lower house, the centre of
legislative power. But even an upper house poll, like yesterday's, costs
money.
Funds circulate from companies to politicians to constituents. In return the
companies are rewarded with public orders, especially building contracts.
Not for nothing is the job of minister of construction regarded in some LDP
circles as more important than the prime minister's. And not for nothing is
the construction market particularly difficult for foreign companies to
enter.
As the party which has held power since the 1950s, the LDP has little
incentive to change this system. However, it has acknowledged in voluminous
reports what is needed, including controls on fund-raising, single-member
constituencies and a redistribution of seats from the countryside to the
cities. The last is most important: in the Diet's lower house, it takes more
than three times as many votes to elect a member in the most populous
districts as in the least populous.
The implications run far beyond Nagatacho, Tokyo's political district. The
current political system was forged at a time when the nation was largely
united in its aims: governments put the priority on economic growth and
smoothing the frictions this generated at home and abroad without veering
from their course. Bureaucrats, not politicians, took the important
decisions.
Having risen to economic pre-eminence, Japan must now define an appropriate
role for itself in international affairs. It must tackle sensitive issues
such as reform of an archaic tax system, the overhaul of land regulations,
restrictions on foreign workers, and the ban on rice imports.
The Japanese acknowledge the urgency of these arguments. But, until now,
they have tolerated some political corruption because the LDP has ruled over
unprecedented peace and prosperity. As long as the perpetrators of the most
flagrant breaches of anti-corruption laws are punished, the Japanese have
accepted that politicians will bend the rules.
If the past is any guide, the Japanese will resist fundamental change until
they are hit by a shock. Then change will come quickly. The hope is that
this time such a shock will be unnecessary. But it would be unwise to rely
on it.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Monday Interview: Love in the laboratory: Professor William
Stewart, chief scientific adviser to the Cabinet Office, talks to Clive
Cookson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scientists have changed their minds about the UK government more
comprehensively than has any other group in British society since the
general election. During the election campaign many senior scientists called
for a new government that would end years of neglect and underfunding of
research; not one spoke up for the Conservatives.
Three months later, the loathing in the laboratories is turning into
something approaching love. Pressure groups such as Save British Science
have stopped moaning and are now singing a chorus of praise for the
government.
The man they credit with responsibility for this revival of scientific
morale is Professor William Stewart, a 57-year-old Scottish botanist, whose
official job title is chief scientific adviser, Cabinet Office.
Prof Stewart came to London in 1988 to run the Agricultural and Food
Research Council. Lady Thatcher (then Mrs Thatcher) appointed him to succeed
Sir John Fairclough as the government's chief scientist shortly before she
resigned as prime minister in 1990. But he made little impact until last
April.
Then, in the reshuffle after the election, Mr Major unexpectedly gave the
laboratory lobbyists what they had been clamouring for, and Labour had
promised: cabinet status for science for the first time since 1964.
The Pounds 1.1bn-a-year budget for basic research was detached from the
Department of Education and Science, and transferred to a new Office of
Science and Technology (OST) under a senior cabinet minister, Mr William
Waldegrave. He is also responsible for co-ordinating science and technology
policy across other government departments, including defence and industry.
Although Mr Waldegrave's remit as chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster also
includes the Citizen's Charter initiative for improving public services, he
has made it clear that science will be a priority.
Prof Stewart drew up the OST blueprint before the election, as an option for
the incoming government whatever its political complexion. As a loyal civil
servant, he declines to take the credit. But its creation leaves him, as
head of OST, much better placed to fight for science and technology in
government. He is potentially the most powerful chief scientist since Sir
Solly Zuckerman (another biologist) teamed up with Mr Harold Wilson in 1964.
The fundamental reason for the reorganisation, Prof Stewart says, 'is that
the prime minister had a conviction that science and technology would be
important to us if we were going to continue as a strong Group of Seven
nation. Japan sees science and technology as the dynamo of the economy; the
US sees a world economy transformed by developments in science and
technology.'
A subsidiary reason was to give the UK government someone with enough
international status to negotiate effectively with such powerful research
ministers as Germany's Mr Heinz Riesenhuber and France's Mr Hubert Curien.
Junior ministers in the DES were no match for them, but Mr Waldegrave is -
both through his close relations with Mr Major and through his formidable
intellect.
Mr Waldegrave may be a classicist by academic background, but Prof Stewart
says he is already making his mark as chairman of the EC research council.
On the chief scientist's advice, Mr Waldegrave is pushing the EC to devote
more resources to 'generic technologies which have a broad range of
applications across many industrial sectors' and less to 'the old policy of
industrial R&amp;D subsidy'. In practice this might mean, for example,
supporting the development of a 'clean engine', which would have application
in an aircraft, a car or a lawnmower, rather than a 'clean car', which would
amount to a disguised subsidy to European motor manufacturers.
The creation of the OST instantly raised the profile of science in
Parliament. The Commons set up a Science and Technology Committee for the
first time, chaired by Sir Giles Shaw. And from next year the two houses
will jointly fund a Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology, to
provide technical assessments for MPs and peers on issues ranging from
global warming to disposing of nuclear weapons and patenting new forms of
life.
But the OST could be the first step in a more radical reorganisation of
research in the UK. Prof Stewart is inviting scientists to put forward
suggestions for a white paper on science and technology, which the
government will issue early next year. It will cover every aspect of the way
the UK organises, funds and exploits its science.
Mr Waldegrave and Prof Stewart say they have open minds about what direction
to take; they are willing to consider changes that would be - at least in UK
terms - quite revolutionary. One possibility is to draw up for the first
time a national plan for science, setting priorities and targets for funding
in different areas. 'Do we need some broad objective-setting as the
Japanese, US, Germans, French and others are doing, or do we leave it all to
a bottom-up approach?' Prof Stewart asks.
For most laboratory scientists, however, the biggest issue is not how
research is organised but how much money is available for it. 'In general
our funding levels compare reasonably well with our G7 competitors,' Prof
Stewart claims. 'But before we get complacent, it is important to note that
UK expenditure on R&amp;D as a percentage of GDP has been slipping significantly
over the last decade in both civil and defence areas. Because the
international trend on R&amp;D expenditure as a percentage of GDP has been
generally upwards, the downward trend in the UK causes concern.'
Last year Prof Stewart worked with the Treasury during the annual public
expenditure survey to make sure science and technology spending in all
departments was assessed as a whole - the first time the government's chief
scientist had been involved in the process. The exercise produced real
growth in civil R&amp;D this year and plans for further modest growth up to
1994-95.
But that was in the run-up to an election. The real test of Prof Stewart's
new clout in the Treasury will come during this year's public expenditure
negotiations. 'The OST could not have been set up at a worse time as far as
public expenditure is concerned,' he says. He will fight to protect the
planned growth, both because research needs more money and because 'the
system needs stability so that the science and technology community can look
ahead without the episodic changes in funding which caused problems in
bygone years'.
Ironically, the non-graduate Mr Major is turning out to be far more
sympathetic to science than Mrs Thatcher, who started began her career in
chemistry research. Because he believes science is important - socially,
culturally, economically and environmentally - but has no scientific
background, he is in some ways an ideal prime minister from the point of
view of an adviser.
Prof Stewart keeps in touch with feelings at the laboratory bench by
inviting a group of half a dozen researchers, including young scientists, to
his room in the ancient Palace of Whitehall every fortnight or so. Sitting
in the deep, red-leather armchairs, they talk 'really frankly' about the
issues in their field.
The office looks typical of a senior civil servant of the old school, apart
from a computer beside the desk, but its occupant sounds quite different.
Prof Stewart retains his childhood accent from the whisky isle of Islay, off
the west coast of Scotland, where he grew up - pepped up with a dash of
Glasgow (where he did both undergraduate and postgraduate studies) and
Dundee (where he built up the biology department over a period of 20 years
from virtually nothing into one of the strongest in the UK). Now he retreats
when he can to somewhere even more remote from London: a croft inherited
from his wife's family on the island of Barra in the Outer Hebrides.
The last prominent person in government who portrayed himself as a Scottish
crofter was Mr Harold Macmillan. The difference is that in Prof Stewart's
case the claim is genuine. And whereas the Macmillan era 30 years ago can be
seen in retrospect as the start of a decline in the international position
of British science and technology, the Stewart years just might herald a
revival.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Personal View: Collusion for confrontation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM ALLISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the global canvas of international politics today, what is the most
striking anomaly? Of all the leading powers, two alone remain mired in a
cold-war confrontation, without a peace treaty to conclude the second world
war that ended 47 years ago, without normal relations.
The contrast between Russia's new relationship with its main European
adversary in the second world war, and its relationship with Japan, is
instructive. Only on the Asian front, and most singularly in
Russian-Japanese relations, is the cold war essentially frozen in time.
Oddest of all is the obstacle to full normalisation of Russia-Japan
relations: the issue is one of four, small, disputed islands which remain as
second world war relics and cold war symbols.
In the past year, a group of independent scholars from the US, Russia and
Japan have collaborated in an effort to view this old dispute impartially
and with fresh eyes. In reviewing the entire record of the dispute in all
three languages, we have juxtaposed official documents from the three
governments and unearthed new materials. What we discovered is a
'collaboration for confrontation'. The evidence reveals a pattern by all
three governments that set Russia and Japan in fierce enmity.
The culprit in this drama was Stalin. By seizing and holding four small
islands of no military or economic significance, he provided powerful
incentives for Japan to become the closest ally of the US in confronting the
Soviet Union in Asia. In 1951, Stalin compounded his error by refusing to
sign the San Francisco Peace Treaty concluding the second world war. By not
signing, Stalin not only missed an opportunity to stake claim to the
disputed four islands. He also left clouded in international law the Soviet
Union's claim to 18 undisputed Kuril Islands and southern Sakhalin. Today,
Russia occupies them, but without established sovereignty in international
law.
Stalin's mistakes were aided and abetted by US President Franklin Roosevelt.
But conspiracy theorists who seek to give Roosevelt credit, or blame, for
tricking Stalin into these moves exaggerate. Stalin sought territorial
concessions. As the price for enlisting Russia in the Asian war against
Japan, Roosevelt was prepared to concede.
John Foster Dulles, secretary of state, was more deliberate. In the period
leading to the 1956 Joint Declaration between Japan and Russia, the Japanese
contemplated sacrificing two larger disputed islands to secure control of
the two smaller islands and sign a peace treaty. At several crucial
junctures, Dulles frustrated such a resolution. As the state department's
memorandum of the conversation between Dulles and Japanese foreign minister
Shigemitsu in August 1956 shows clearly: Dulles warned the Japanese
government that, if it relinquished its claim to the larger islands to
normalise relations with Russia, it would jeopardise its claim to Okinawa,
occupied by US troops. As the state department cable records, Dulles's
warning stated: 'No Japanese government could survive.'
In preparation of the 1960 Mutual Security Treaty between the US and Japan,
US diplomacy solidified Japan's position as the pillar of Asian
confrontation with the Soviet Union. In recognising Japan's 'residual
sovereignty' over Okinawa in 1961, and returning Okinawa to Japan in 1971,
the US bolstered Japan's position as a partner by accenting the contrast
with the Soviet Union's recalcitrance.
The conclusion of the cold war now presents the challenge: can the western
allies, in partnership with a new Russia, win the peace?
Our American-Russian-Japanese trilateral report sketches 66 scenarios for
resolution. Our preferred resolution calls for the US to become active as
catalyst, honest broker and guarantor. A comprehensive agreement defining
new trilateral relations in security, economic and political dimensions
could provide important net advantages for both Russia and Japan. The
essential terms in this multi-dimensional compromise are these. Russia would
reaffirm the 1956 Joint Declaration agreeing to return to Japan the two
smaller islands at the signing of a peace treaty; recognise Japan's
'residual sovereignty' over the two larger islands; and begin negotiations,
terms and timing of their phased return. Japan would agree to demilitarise
the islands permanently; guarantee that Russia suffers no material loss in
rights to fish or export other resources and accept the role of lead donor
and the substantially enlarged, decade-long G7 programme of economic
assistance for Russia's economic reform.
The question today is whether Messrs Yeltsin, Miyazawa and Bush can overcome
the legacy of Stalin, Roosevelt, Dulles and Shigemitsu.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: Whither the dollar?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite the concerted central bank intervention to keep the dollar above its
all-time low, investors remain uncertain about what the US currency will do
next, writes James Blitz.
The upside for the dollar could be strong. The currency was boosted at the
end of last week by figures for durable goods sales, which rose 2.3 per cent
in June after a revised fall of 2.2 per cent in May. The central bank
intervention also made clear that the Federal Reserve is unwilling to see
the currency dip below the all-time low against the D-Mark of DM1.4430.
The dollar should get additional strength from this week's German cost of
living figure, which is likely to show a fall in annualised inflation by 1
per cent to about 3.3 per cent. That could underline the case of those in
the Bundesbank who do not want to see another Lombard rate rise.
The reasons to be bearish about dollar/D-Mark remain strong, however. They
are the huge differential in German and US short term interest rates and the
overshooting of the Bundesbank's M3 money supply target.
The preliminary estimate for second quarter growth in the US, due out on
Thursday, will give some indication of whether the Federal Reserve is still
justified to forecast US economic growth next year at 2 1/2 per cent. The
conference board's consumer confidence index, due tomorrow, will also be
watched by the markets.
But with few important indicators due in either the US or the UK in the next
two weeks, the exact outlook for the dollar and sterling is uncertain. As
one London dealer says: 'I have very little by way of positions and little
certainty of where things are moving. We could be in for one of those lazy
summer seasons.'

FT  27 JUL 92 / International Bonds: Crisis of confidence rips heart out of
Ecu sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WAS it the triumph of hope
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
and hype - over reality? The Ecu bond market, long touted as the future face
of European capital markets, ground to a halt last week as the pent up
pressures within the exchange rate mechanism finally took their toll.
Traders returning to their desks this morning face an unenviable task. How
do they convince investors that the market is still open for business when
on Friday they had sent the clearest possible message that it is not? Banks
which act as market makers in Ecu bonds were relieved of their normal
obligations to trade with each other at quoted prices - though only for one
day.
Traders claimed that this did not stop investors dealing - as, in fact, many
were said to have done on Friday. But if the heart of the market's mechanism
has been ripped out, how much of a market can truly be said to remain? And
is the concern that spread through the investment community on Friday likely
to ease quickly?
The tension in the Ecu market had been clear since early June, when Danish
voters gave their damning verdict on the Maastricht plans for economic and
monetary union. It took the German Bundesbank to finish the job. Its move a
week and a half ago to raise the German discount rate by  3/4 point gave the
latest nudge to a market which already seemed to be tottering on the edge of
an abyss. Ecu bonds duly fell off.
The yield on the 10-year benchmark, the French government's 8.5 per cent OAT
due March 2002, had risen by the end of the week to just under 9.5 per cent,
up around 25 basis points on the week and more than 50 basis points in the
last month.
Perhaps a more significant indicator is that Ecu bonds are now thought to be
worth less than the sum of their parts. As optimism over monetary union
gathered momentum last year, yields on Ecu bonds fell to less than the
theoretical yield of a basket of bonds made up of the component currencies -
a sign that investors were prepared to pay a premium to invest in the
prospect of monetary union.
One result was a rapid increase in the amount of bonds being issued in the
international markets. As the graph indicates, borrowers turned away from
issuing Ecu instruments in their domestic markets to rely more heavily on
international investors last year.
After the Danish vote, though, the premium on Ecus vanished. Although it
returned briefly, the discount disappeared again last week, as 10-year
yields climbed to as much as 40 basis points over the 'theoretical' level
for Ecus.
Many banks were said to have been running long positions in the Ecu for some
time. Last week, as more investors moved to unload their own stock, the
one-way tide of paper finally forced the market makers to call it a day.
As the week wore on, there were already complaints that market makers were
not answering their telephones or were otherwise making themselves
unavailable. The International Securities Market Association, which oversees
the market, took no immediate action.
'ISMA has to police this better,' one Ecu trader complained. ISMA's
sub-committee overseeing the Ecu market duly decided on Friday that enough
was enough, and rather than try to force market makers back to their phones,
it imposed a one-day 'time out' to allow traders to recover from their
battering.
Market makers argued that it was impossible to run a market when conditions
had deteriorated so fast. 'We are the messengers rather than the cause of
the problem,' complained Mr David Ovenden, head of the ISMA sub-committee.
Why should things be any better today than they were last Friday? With the
French referendum on Maastricht nearly two months away, there seems little
prospect of confidence returning to the Ecu market. And the current overhang
of paper will persist for some time.
It seems that a core of market makers will regroup and re-establish the
semblance of a market. Although there have officially been 44 market makers
in Ecus, around three quarters of them in London, the real market has
concentrated in perhaps 10 or a dozen banks, among them Paribas, Goldman
Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, CCF and Indosuez. Enough of these core
banks indicated on Friday that they would start making markets again today
to suggest that the market will return.
Also, the maximum spreads market makers are allowed to quote have been
widened to help protect them against a renewed round of selling. For most
bonds, maximum spreads from today will have doubled.
It may also take official intervention to bring some confidence back to the
market. The Bank of England and the French Treasury were in contact with
market makers on Friday, concerned about the fate of their Ecu-denominated
securities.
The message they were given: they should be prepared to intervene themselves
to put a floor under Ecu bond prices. 'I wouldn't be surprised, if the
markets stayed volatile, to see some sort of action from the central banks,'
said Mr Ovenden.
Such assurances may help to shore up the market for now. But it is still
likely to be a long and bumpy ride to the French referendum on September 20.

FT  27 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: A pfennig for your thoughts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THESE are hard times for contrarians. All the gloom in the world in the
markets, yet prices keep falling. What can it be that they have failed to
discount?
One thing is governments. Ever since President Hoover tried to talk the US
economy up during the 1929 crash, markets have taken official reassurance
with a pinch of arsenic; but they still try to do it. Tokyo provided a
textbook example on Friday, when a ministerial meeting designed to reassure
the markets knocked more than 500 points off equities.
Our own embattled Mr Norman Lamont may have done it again yesterday, with
yet another stonewalling defence of the present strategy and worse, another
forecast of recovery. One might have hoped that he would have learned from
the sterling wobbles a week earlier, when every statement from Downing
Street of unyielding commitment to the present D-Mark target for sterling
drove the currency a bit lower.
Especially, perhaps, the announcement that if the D-Mark did revalue, we
would go up too. Like Matilda's aunt when faced with lies, the market stared
and stretched its eyes.
It is all meant to sound resolute, but what it actually arouses is memories
stretching back, according to age, to Sir Stafford Cripps, or Mr Callaghan,
or the umpteen devaluations between the first French proclamation of the
franc fort and the actual achievement of a strong franc.
It is interesting to contrast these humiliations with the continued
willingness of Wall Street to support implausible multiples in the face of
complaints from the White House about the recovery's sluggishness - though
at least they do have a recovery of sorts.
These reactions are in fact perfectly logical. Faced with disappointments,
the markets do not like to be told that they are fussing about nothing. They
prefer to learn that the authorities are disappointed too; that preserves
the hope of remedial action.
Defensiveness, by contrast, breeds uncertainty: is the government really
bent on punitive deflation, or stupid, or hiding something? The best policy
in hard times appears to be frankness; failing that, silence.
Meanwhile, uncertainty is increasing from causes quite beyond government
control. The confrontation with Iraq would be bad enough, without the
appearance of a credible electoral challenge in the US, the disquiet on the
government's back benches in London, and the grim implications for banking
of any marked worsening in the worldwide recession.
The bond markets might be expected to provide the good news in bad times;
but they are sulking too. In nearly all the main markets they can see enough
fiscal problems stretching into the far future to preserve a more or less
indefinite buyers' market - a sadly familiar picture in the London gilts
market until a decade or so ago. In this respect the long-term prospect is
in fact much better in New York and London than in markets which are
traditionally better respected.
The demographic problems facing Britain and the US are a fleabite compared
with those of Japan or of most continental European countries, and could be
tackled with a moderate tax increase; but markets cannot be expected to
adjust to such a change in their perceptions overnight. This is where
authoritative government statements might be helpful rather than suggesting
panic.
But if the markets are, in fact, slowly awakening to the emergence of
deep-seated problems of government finance, the recent movement of prices
makes a lot of sense. Permanent fiscal problems suggest a very durable rise
in real long-term interest rates; and that in turn explains the closing gap
between bond and equity yields.
In real terms it has been closed from the bond side. This has an especially
strong message for London, since in most low-inflation countries the
investment institutions have always preferred a far higher bond proportion
in their portfolios than has been seen in London for more than 30 years. So
the cult of the equity may indeed be over, failing a new burst of inflation.
And on inflation, ministers are credible.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Canadian Funding: Enthusiastic reception shows appeal of
provincial issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA's 10 provinces have a hearty appetite for funds and investors seem
eager to satisfy it. The provinces and their utilities, such as Ontario
Hydro and Hydro-Quebec, have tapped the domestic and international bond
markets for about CDollars 24bn so far this year. Last week alone British
Columbia, Alberta, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia raised more than CDollars
1.5bn in Canadian and US dollar-denominated bonds.
The appeal of Canadian provincial paper is reflected in a sharp narrowing of
spreads over the past six months. Alberta's latest CDollars 750m, five-year
issue was priced to yield 7.07 per cent, or 30 basis points above comparable
Canadian government bonds, whereas the spread was 54 basis points earlier
this year.
While spreads may tighten a little further, investors are banking on further
capital gains as Canadian interest rates continue to fall. The Canadian
yield curve has never been steeper.
Three-month Treasury bills were yielding 5.25 per cent at the end of last
week, down from a peak of almost 13.7 per cent in mid-1990. By contrast,
long-term Canadian government bond yields have fallen from 11.5 per cent to
8.5 per cent in the same period. Mr Barry Calhoun, chief fixed-income dealer
at Toronto Dominion Bank, predicts that long-term bond yields could slide 2
to 3 percentage points.
Investors increasingly view Canadian provincial issues as an alternative to
US bonds, offering a higher yield without significantly greater risk. The
spate of issues this year has greatly improved the liquidity of the
provincial market.
Ontario's budget last April was a milestone in improving the climate for
provincial bond issues.
The market had expected Ontario's 1992-93 deficit to soar from the original
forecast of CDollars 8.9bn to as high as CDollars 14bn: instead the
province's social democratic government announced a CDollars 9.9bn shortfall
for the coming year. The Bank of Canada's performance in beating back
inflation has also been bullish for bonds and the currency risk appears
small.
Cautious players would argue that the best of the provincial and Canadian
bond market may be over. With Canada's economy still bumping along at the
bottom of the cycle, several provinces may have difficulty meeting their
budget deficit targets. Inflation is more likely to go up than down and
negotiations over Quebec's future are entering a crucial phase.
But the enthusiastic response to the recent spate of provincial issues
indicates that many investors believe either that Canadian bond prices still
have some steam left, or that Alberta or Nova Scotia are safer havens for
their money at present than some of the alternatives, especially in Europe.

FT  27 JUL 92 / UK Gilts: Cool response to new regime for public spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'At the heart of the medium-term strategy is the need to return to a
sensible level of public spending and to see taxes and government borrowing
reduced . . . This review is crucial to the strategy, crucial to success in
reducing the public sector borrowing requirement, lowering interest rates
and bringing down inflation - and crucial if we are to find room for
lightening the tax burden and so provide scope and encouragement for
enterprise and initiative.'
These were the phrases used by Sir Geoffrey Howe, the former UK chancellor,
in his Budget speech in March 1980 - the event which led to a strategic
rethink of UK public spending. With similarly ringing words, Mr Norman
Lamont, the current chancellor, might last week have introduced his own
reforms to the way Britain organises this part of the economy.
In fact, Mr Lamont said nothing in public. The new regime for public
spending - which seeks to impose tough disciplines with a view to reining
back increases in the public sector borrowing requirement - was introduced
not in parliament but in off-the-record briefings to journalists.
The gilt market - to which the question of future rises in public spending
is crucial - was not greatly excited by the changes.
While gilts investors might have been expected to be impressed by the new
approach - which is likely to lead to spending cuts of some Pounds 13bn in
1994-95 and 1995-96 - they focused last week mainly on other factors.
Since many of these are negative for gilts, the market as a whole behaved
nervously. Prices were little changed for most classes of gilts although
yields in the five to 10-year area rose by around 10 basis points due to a
mild sell-off in this part of the yield curve.
Under the Treasury's new system for limiting public spending, in future
years totals will be set using a 'top down' approach involving the whole
cabinet. The regime is designed to reduce the pace at which total government
spending has risen in recent years. But the gilt market last week was every
bit as worried about how much tax revenues - the other side of the PSBR
equation - are likely to be depressed as a result of the weak growth
probable over the next few years.
That concerns gilt investors on the basis that the more the PSBR goes up,
the more gilts have to be issued and the greater the chances of a fall in
prices due to a glut in supply.
According to estimates by Mr Michael Saunders of Salomon Brothers, revenues
over the next few years are likely to be much less than the Treasury's
projections in March. He reckons the shortfall will be Pounds 9.4bn in
1993-94, Pounds 17.4bn in 1994-95, Pounds 20.9bn in 1995-96 and Pounds 27bn
in 1996-97. As a result, he is pencilling in much bigger PSBR numbers than
the Treasury is predicting.
Over the weekend the Treasury came close to admitting that Mr Saunders'
calculations are along the right lines by indicating that corporation tax
revenues are likely to be lower than expected.
With other worries for the market also dominating last week - including the
weak pound and the concern over whether the Maastricht agreement on monetary
union might unravel - many gilt investors were in no mood to respond
enthusiastically to any words from Mr Lamont, even had he uttered any.

FT  27 JUL 92 / US Money and Credit: Three-way tug-of-war takes up the
strain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE stage is set for a complex tug-of-war in the US credit markets between
political opinion polls, currency markets and economic statistics.
The three were neatly on display last week as central banks intervened to
support the ailing dollar; as Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve
chairman, gave his twice yearly Humphrey Hawkins testimony to Congress; and
as Mr Bill Clinton, Democratic presidential candidate, continued his surge
in the polls.
It is slowly dawning on Wall Street that Mr Clinton could well be the next
president. The Bush campaign is in such disarray, and the Clinton/Gore
ticket seems to be so successfully tapping into an underlying desire for
change, that Mr Clinton must have a reasonably good chance of winning.
If Mr Clinton sustains his momentum, Wall Street will grow increasingly
jittery and the bond market particularly so. The Democrats, with their 'tax
and spend' history, are seen as the party of inflation, and Mr Clinton has
yet to explain convincingly how he will fund his national investment
programme.
Wall Street remains relatively sanguine, but the first twinges of anxiety
are being felt in the foreign currency market, which is additionally
concerned about Clintonian tax policies which could hurt foreign investment
flows.
Political uncertainty, further signs of tardy American GDP growth and the
huge interest rate differentials between the US and Germany, have meant a
sharp fall in the dollar recently.
Last Monday, however, the US ended its long-standing benign neglect of the
dollar's value and the world's central banks intervened to support it. The
move stabilised not only the dollar but US bonds.
Yet the dollar could fall further if European rates stay high and if the
Democrats sustain their advantage. And dollar weakness would be bearish for
the bonds market.
However, pulling against these potentially adverse factors is the reality of
a very weak US recovery, and low domestic inflation. Further evidence of
economic sluggishness last week helped push the yield on long bonds down to
the lowest level since January, with the yield touching 7.53 per cent on
Thursday before ending the week at 7.56.
Mr Greenspan's testimony provided no surprises for the credit market. His
faintly upbeat forecast that economic expansion would gain momentum soon
concurred with the Wall Street consensus. He also said the Fed was leaning
towards cutting money supply growth targets, as the relationship that
existed between money supply and economic growth was not as strong as
before. The implication is that this year's slow M2 growth, - well below the
Fed's target - may not be so bad after all.
The upshot was to leave the market expecting little change in Fed policy,
apart from a possible 25 basis points off the Fed funds rate if economic
statistics turn grimmer.
Nevertheless, many analysts expect long bonds to continue rallying as
inflationary concerns subside. But that may be to place too little emphasis
on political risk, the Treasury's heavy funding needs, and the influence of
foreign markets.

CEDRIC Investments, a Greek shipping group, has agreed to buy Neorion
Shipyards, a state-owned yard on the Aegean island of Syros, for Dollars 17m
in cash.
The group, led by two Athens-based owners, Mr Panayotis Tsakos and Mr
Dimitrios Manios, undertook to retain the yard's 750-member workforce and to
invest Dollars 20m in new equipment.
Two other Greek groups and one US shipping company made bids for Neorion,
one of four loss-making Greek yards being sold off this year under the
government's privatisation programme.
The sale was arranged by the state-owned Hellenic Industrial Development
Bank (ETVA), the yard's main creditor. ETVA preferred to take an immediate
cash payment rather than accept Mr Tsakos's alternative offer of Dr6bn
(Dollars 31m) payable in instalments over 10 years.
Neorion, which specialises in repairs and conversions, reported losses of
Dr509m on turnover of Dr5.36bn in 1990, the most recent figures available.
The yard has accumulated debts of Dr16.3bn, mostly to state-owned banks.

NESTLE, the Swiss multinational food group which has just won permission
from the European Commission to take over France's Perrier mineral water
company, has reported a 13.4 per cent rise in salesin the first half to
SFr26.3bn (Dollars 19.8bn) and forecast a 'healthy net profit' for the full
year.
The group said sales volume grew 3.3 per cent, with the remainder of the
turnover growth coming from price increases and currency conversions. Volume
increased in virtually all product groups and geographical areas, especially
in Asia and north America, but it fell in Brazil.
The group said it expected volume to grow 'perhaps even at a faster rate' in
the second half, and foresaw increases in consolidated sales and net profit,
provided that European currencies maintain their exchange rates with respect
to the Swiss franc and the US dollar does not suffer 'an even more marked
plunge'.

takeover bids

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONSOB, Italy's stock market and companies watchdog, has released its
long-awaited rules governing takeover bids, in a further step to reform the
country's stock market.
The rules, governing the levels of share ownership which trigger a full bid,
have been drawn up under bourse regulations which came into effect at the
start of this year.
Unlike other countries' rules, Consob has not defined a single, uniform,
level of share ownership obliging a raider to launch a full bid for a quoted
company, with identical terms for all investors.
In the past, the absence of such rules in Italy has allowed control of
leading corporations to change hands via deals between big shareholders,
without the same terms being offered to small investors.
Consob has examined the ownership structure of all Italy's big quoted
companies, and defined different levels for what it considers to be the
'controlling' shareholding. In each case, an attempt to buy more than that
proportion of the equity is defined as being sufficient to require a full
bid.
The quota is sometimes surprisingly low. In the case of Generali, Italy's
biggest insurance company and its best example of a widely held public
company, Consob has taken the 5.96 per cent holding of merchant bank
Mediobanca, the biggest single shareholder, above which a bid is triggered.
Consob's second category covers companies in which there is a single
dominant investor, like Fiat, Ferruzzi Finanziaria or Pirelli, but which
does not own an absolute majority of the shares. In this case, the trigger
level is more than that held by the dominant shareholder.
These rules have been eagerly awaited by bankers for their effect on
shareholders' pacts, which are commonly used to control big quoted Italian
companies, where no single shareholder has an outright majority.
In the case of such pacts the watchdog has defined the 'controlling level',
above which a bid is triggered as the sum of the various stakes held by the
pact's members.

   SINGAPORE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SINGAPORE Airlines (SIA), the flag carrier, proposed a one-for-one bonus
issue at its annual meeting on Saturday, Reuter reports from Singapore.
The airline hopes the move will help its shares climb out of the narrow
range of SDollars 12 to SDollars 13 each, which they have traded at since
the end of the Gulf war in February 1991.
SIA's shareholding structure restricts trading: about 100 shareholders
control 91.6 per cent of the airline. Local analysts said a bonus issue
would make SIA shares more liquid. With more shares available for trading,
prices could be expected to rise.
With a market capitalisation of SDollars 9.13bn (USDollars 5.6bn), SIA is
Singapore's biggest listed company. It is also among the world's most
profitable airlines.
However, analysts said the move was unlikely to make much difference to the
price of foreign held shares. Trading in these is restricted by a ceiling on
foreign ownership and the annual meeting made no decision to raise this
limit. Foreign shareholders account for 27.1 per cent of SIA's capital.
SIA's management had earlier opposed the bonus issue, saying it was not in
the best interests of long-term investors. It reversed its stand on Saturday
after the annual meeting unanimously passed a resolution proposing the
issue.

NATIONWIDE Building Society plans to issue D-Mark denominated notes as part
of its Euro medium-term note (MTN) programme, following the Bundesbank's
recent decision to relax the guidelines concerning the issuance of D-Mark
paper by non-German borrowers.
Nationwide can issue up to Dollars 750m under its Euro MTN programme. The

building society's wholesale funding programme.
Mr Paul Barratt, treasurer (risk management) at the building society, said
it would be looking at opportunities for issuing D-Mark notes over the next
few days: 'We will be looking at the pricing and if an opportunity arises we
will take it,' he said.
The new Bundesbank guidelines on issuing D-Mark paper were announced earlier
this month and come into force on August 1. Nationwide has appointed Merrill
Lynch as its German arranger, and is appointing Westdeutsche Landesbank
Girozentrale as a dealer under its existing Euro medium-term note programme.

<TEXT>
ASARCO, the US integrated mining company, reported second quarter net
earnings of Dollars 4.9m, or 12 cents per share, a sharp decline from the
Dollars 15.4m, or 37 cents per share, in the same period last year.
Lower metals prices and slack production at several key mines cut into
results. Sales were Dollars 487.2m for the second quarter, compared with
Dollars 458.9m last year.
Copper production at the company's Ray mine in Arizona was impeded by heavy
rains and at its Mission mine, also in Arizona, by lower grade and harder
ores. Lead and zinc production fell at its Missouri mines because of lower
ore grades.
In the three months ended June 30, the company's average realised price for
copper declined 2 cents to Dollars 1.03 a pound, 10 cents for silver to
Dollars 4.11 an ounce, and Dollars 29 for gold to Dollars 364 per ounce. The
average realised price for lead remained flat at 26 cents a pound, while
zinc rose rose 10 cents to 62 cents per pound.
Some of these adverse price and production effects were offset by a second
quarter Dollars 2.1m dividend from the Southern Peru Copper Corporation and
a credit of Dollars 3.4m from a settlement with Canadian tax authorities.
The 1991 second quarter had benefited from a Dollars 5.1m gain from the sale
of Asarco's shares in Highland Gold and a credit for capitalised interest
worth Dollars 2.1m more than in the 1992 period.
For the first six months, Asarco had net earnings of Dollars 11.8m, or 29
cents per share, on sales of Dollars 945m. For the same period last year,
net earnings were Dollars 23.4m, or 57 cents per share, on sales of Dollars
924.1m.

FT  27 JUL 92 / International Company News: Aer Lingus cuts value of GPA
stake by IPounds 22m

<TEXT>
AER LINGUS has reduced the value of its stake in GPA Group, the aircraft
leasing group, by IPounds 21.9m (Pounds 20.6m) in its accounts for the year
to March 31.
Its 8.76 per cent stake is valued at about IPounds 113m, based on exchange
rates ruling at March 31.
This implies a price of Dollars 18.50 for each GPA share at March 31,
compared to the range of Dollars 20-Dollars 25 a share (before a two-for-one
split) which GPA set for its failed international public offering last
month.
GPA said the price of Dollars 18.50 a share was in line with its estimates
of current value, though there has been no trading in GPA shares since the
offer was cancelled.
Aer Lingus's carrying value has been adjusted to take account of the
airline's legal and administrative costs relating to the stake.
The airline owns 9.94m shares in GPA, which would have doubled following the
proposed split. It hoped to sell a minimum of 4.64m shares in the offering,
which was cancelled at the last minute on June 18.
Mr Larry Stanley, chief executive of Aer Lingus Commercial Holdings, said
the value had been reduced for 'reasons of prudence,' prior to the
cancellation in line with the indicated price range.
Aer Lingus, one of the founding shareholders in GPA, was one of those most
anxious to see the offer proceed. It had planned to use the funds to reduce
gearing.
It has been released from the 'lock-in' arrangements agreed between GPA and
its main shareholders before the offer and is believed to be keen to
establish GPA's intentions on seeking a quotation.
Mr Stanley said Aer Lingus was adopting a wait and see approach and has had

'We were very disappointed with the failure of the international public
offering,' he said. 'It was an opportunity for us to get liquid. But we
wanted to wait until we have a clearer idea of what GPA intends to do before
making any decision. We have no pressing need for funds.'

FT  27 JUL 92 / International Company News: Counting the cost of a less than
easy route into Spain / A look at the complexities that Bibby faced over its
hostile Pounds 86m takeover of Finanzauto
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
J BIBBY &amp; Sons, the UK industrial and agricultural group, has broken new
ground as the first wholly-owned foreign corporation to acquire a Spanish
company in a hostile takeover.
Establishing the precedent proved more nerve-wracking and costlier than had
been originally envisaged.
Mr Richard Mansell-Jones, chairman of Bibby, says he has 'no regrets' about
the company's acquisition last week of Finanzauto, Spain's leading supplier
of earthmoving equipment. 'There was nothing that happened which made us
feel 'gosh, we should never have gone in'.'
On paper it had looked like a pushover purchase. Bibby is 79 per cent-owned
by Barlow Rand of South Africa, which has longstanding ties with Caterpillar
of the US. Caterpillar backed the takeover and Finanzauto is the sole
distributor of Caterpillar equipment in Spain.
Finanzauto, moreover, looked ripe for a friendly takeover. Its consolidated
profits plummeted by 68 per cent to Pounds 4.8m last year. It faced the
bleak prospect of a worsening domestic construction slump exacerbated by
delayed government payments to contractors.
But instead of welcoming Bibby's overtures, Finanzauto resisted them.
The Spanish company's response was, in part, a knee jerk reaction against a
foreign bidder that had taken a cheap acquisition for granted. The
controversial six-month long struggle to take over Finanzauto was
nonetheless more complex than that and it produced valuable lessons for all
concerned.
A sample of opinions over the acquisition process includes the following:
Mr William Connelly, of Barings, Bibby's advisers, learnt that Class One
purchases, a denomination which included the Bibby bid and which requires
shareholder approval under UK company law, are inherently risky in Spain:
'We were faced with two basically different company legislations which were
in conflict and contradictory.'
Mr Santiago Eguidazu, of Madrid brokers Asesores Bursatiles who advised
Finanzauto, discovered that a very diluted equity - nearly 80 per cent of
Finanzauto's stock was held by 14,000-odd small shareholders - does not mean
a trouble free bid, even when the market is as exceptionally depressed as
Spain's is. 'A very efficient defence can be mounted for very little money
and the board, representing the shareholders, will insist on a good price.'
A senior analyst at a top Madrid valuation firm believed that Finanzauto
could be partly faulted because it initially failed to put a proper price on
its company. 'It should have put in place a reputable investment bank in
order to get a reputable valuation.' Lack of such a valuation left the
impression that Bibby paid a moderate price.
A senior corporate finance manager at a London-based accountancy firm
reckoned Bibby partly brought problems upon itself. 'Lesson one is get
yourself an adviser with a good knowledge of the Spanish markets and lesson
two is don't underestimate the Spaniards.'
The implication was that Bibby bought over the odds.
As the divergent views indicate, Bibby had anything but an easy ride. It
initially approached Finanzauto, via Barings, in February. But then over the
past three months Bibby clashed openly with the Spanish company's board over
pricing, scorned the way it had managed its business, had its original
takeover bid rejected by Madrid's stock exchange commission and finished up
paying Pounds 86.2m, for Finanzauto, Pounds 11m more than it had originally
intended.
At the core of the UK company's tension-fraught acquisition was the Class
One category of its bid. Because Bibby's original offer of Pounds 75m for
Finanzauto made a significant impact on its own market capitalisation and
because, by consolidating Finanzauto's debt it exceeded its own borrowing
limitations, Bibby was obliged, under UK company law, to issue a Class One
circular to its shareholders and to request them to waiver the limitations
at an extraordinary general meeting.
The delay for shareholder approval eliminates the surprise factor of a bid
and allows the target company to kill it either through introducing home
grown defensive mechanisms or by invit-ing in counter offers.
Madrid's stock exchange commission automatically suspended trading in
Finanzauto shares when Bibby informed it of its bid on account of the price
sensitive nature of the information. But when Bibby was unable to
simultaneously deliver an egm vote of shareholder support, the commission
lifted the suspension as soon as it was satisfied that the market was aware
of the development.
Mr Mansell-Jones says Bibby made it clear to the commission that Barlow
Rand, Bibby's majority owners, backed the acquisition. To his chagrin the
market regulators chose however a 'legalistic' interpretation and insisted
on a shareholder vote at the egm.
The commission offered a different interpretation. Bibby knew perfectly well
that its shareholder support documentation was not in order but it put in
its bid anyway in the hope of scaring off any counterbidders.
'Bibby should have acted quickly and delivered the price sensitive
information and the shareholder support at the same time', said a commission
spokesman.'
The upshot was that over a 14 day period last month Finanzauto resumed
trading on the Madrid stock exchange; and Bibby, which was awaiting its egm,
could only watch Finanzauto's share price rise and worry about rival bids.
Additionally, Bibby discovered what Mr Mansell-Jones calls a 'critical
difference' between the London and Madrid market practices. As the offer
period came to a close, the UK company found itself unable to count the
acceptances and thereby decide whether to walk away, maintain the offer or
revise it.
'We were operating in the dark, we couldn't take the temperature,' Bibby's
chairman says. The UK company believed that its offer of Pta1,300 (Pounds 7)
per share had a 'sporting chance' but offered no certainties. It therefore
unilaterally chose to increase the bid to Pta1,500.
Bibby's predicament was increased by the highly aggressive defence mounted
by Asesores Bursatiles, Finanzauto's advisers. It included a wide-ranging
press campaign, letters to individual shareholders and detailed
presentations to the institutions.
'Our strategy was to convince everyone that Finanzauto was worth more than
what Bibby was saying,' said Mr Eguidazu of Asesores.
By last week when more than 80 per cent of Finanzauto's shareholders
accepted the increased price, there were neither winners nor losers.

FT  27 JUL 92 / International Company News: Magnetic agrees second TT bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TT GROUP, the rapidly-expanding conglomerate run by Mr John Newman, former
acquisitions manager at Hanson, has launched an agreed Pounds 11.8m bid for
Magnetic Materials, the Slough-based manufacturer of magnetic components.
Last year MMG fought off a hostile bid by TT.
The offer is three new TT shares for every 10 MMG, with a partial cash
alternative which allows accepting shareholders to receive approximately 50
per cent of their consideration in cash.
At last Friday's closing price of 215p per TT share, the bid values MMG
group shares at 64.5p, compared with the closing price of 54p.
TT already speaks for just short of 40 per cent of MMG's shares, as a result
of its unsuccessful bid in 1991 which was worth Pounds 9.9m.
Mr Brian Morris, chairman of MMG, said because of TT's resources 'MMG will
be better placed to exploit the growing worldwide markets for our products.'
TT also revealed that it had held preliminary talks with the board of AB
Electronics, the electronics group in which it recently bought a 7.41 per
cent stake. TT described the talks as 'constructive' but said discussions
regarding its proposed merger are at an early stage.
In March TT bought a 7.5 per cent in ML Holdings, another electronics
components manufacturer.

Arrow profit fall
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FULL effects of recession were felt by Black Arrow Group in the year
ended March 31 1992, resulting in a reduction in pre-tax profit from Pounds
1.87m to Pounds 1.26m.
However, earnings per share rose to 3.5p (3.01p) after a tax charge of only
Pounds 384,000 (Pounds 1.07m) and minorities reduced to Pounds 14,000
(Pounds 55,000). The final dividend is 1.6p for an unchanged total of 2.1p.
Turnover in the office furniture manufacturing division fell 30 per cent to
Pounds 15.1m, and profit by a commensurate amount. However, margins were
sustained by a reduction in overall costs.
In leasing and instalment finance turnover dropped 11.5 per cent to Pounds
1.45m.
The profit included an exceptional Pounds 308,000 on the sale of a
subsidiary's trading freehold.
The group's financial condition was healthy and borrowings had been
virtually eliminated.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICANS and Canadians of Ukrainian descent are hoping to emulate the
success of State of Israel bonds by raising money for their homeland through
a series of interest-bearing Ukraine bonds.
Mr Dan Bilak, a Ukrainian-Canadian lawyer in Toronto, said the central bank
in Kiev had approved three annual Ukraine bond issues totalling USDollars
100m (Pounds 52.3m).
The first Dollars 30m issue, due in December, will carry a 7 per cent
coupon. 'We want to have a coupon so that Ukraine is seen to be making
interest payments,' Mr Bilak said.
Mr Bilak and Mudge Rose, a New York law firm specialising in the securities
market, are setting up a distribution network for the bonds. The plan is to
sell the bonds in Canada through the half-dozen or so credit unions catering
to the Ukrainian community, and in the US through a retail-oriented
securities dealer.
About 3m people of Ukrainian descent live in Canada and the US.
Mr Bilak said the bonds were primarily designed as 'a confidence builder for
the Ukrainians.'
No decision has been made on how proceeds of the bond issue will be used. Mr
Bilak said the community 'is wary of throwing money into a consolidated
revenue fund. We'd like to have a special purpose'.
Money raised will probably be held in bank accounts in north America and
Europe to be drawn on as needed by the Ukrainian authorities.

FT  27 JUL 92 / WPP steps up pressure on investors to support rescue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WPP, the UK marketing srevices group which is asking shareholders to approve
a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 530m) refinancing at a special meeting on August 5,
will this week write to its investors telling them that if the proposals are
not passed there will be little alternative but to appoint a receiver.
Receivership would leave nothing for shareholders, and would force banks to
write off a proportion of their loans.
A receiver has been lined up and has been working on a plan which would
involve selling the assets and undertakings of WPP to a new company, wholly
owned by the banks. This would leave shareholders with a stake in a company
with nothing but debts.
If WPP's reconstruction failed there could be widespread implications for
other companies in trouble. A director of Samuel Montagu, the group's
merchant bank, said that if WPP went into receivership after bankers had
spent eight months working on a refinancing, 'banks will not bother to work
on reconstructions in future. They will put in a receiver on day one.'
He was optimistic, however, that the shareholders would pass the special
resolutions to be put to them at the meeting. He said the deal was a better
one for shareholders than investors in other troubled companies had been
offered.
The resolutions need to be approved by 75 per cent of those voting in each
class of share. Investors will be urged to complete proxy cards if they
cannot attend the meeting.
The outcome could depend largely on Fidelity, the large US investment group,
which last week bought a further 3m preference shares, giving it 10 per cent
of that class. Fidelity has told shareholders and analysts it plans to vote
against the resolutions. WPP's bankers are puzzled about the institution's
motives.
The WPP share price has fallen since final terms of the refinancing were
fixed on July 1, when the offer to preference shareholders was sweetened,
and Fidelity first announced its intention to vote against. From 50p at the
start of the month, the shares slid to 37p at Friday's close.
Some think the shares will recover if the votes are passed, and that
Fidelity is buying for that reason. Others believe Fidelity is trying to
force a further improvement in the terms.

FT  27 JUL 92 / US Sprint poised to win UK international telecoms licence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is close to granting a licence to a US telecoms carrier,
which would break the duopoly of British Telecom and Mercury in UK
international telephone traffic.
Insiders at the department of trade and industry say that Mr Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, is 'on the brink' of giving the
licence to privately-owned US Sprint, the third-largest long-distance
telecoms carrier in the US. A decision may come within two weeks.
Sprint applied for an international facilities licence in January, but the
application was delayed by April's general election. The move to open up the
system follows last year's telecoms white paper which provided for domestic
network competition but was vague on international communications, where BT
and Mercury achieve their highest rates of profitability.
The intention was to bring 're-sale' into the international market, where
the country at the other end had an equally open telecommunications market.
If granted a licence, Sprint could lease international cable and satellite
capacity in bulk from BT or Mercury and then seek to sell usage to customers
at lower rates.
There is considerable pressure to grant Sprint's application, as ministers
believe that the international network is the market sector where prices are
most out of line with costs. The Conservatives' election manifesto promised
that 'the work of liberalising markets which were once monopolised goes on'.
But ministers are concerned that if the UK market is alone in opening itself
up to competition, British companies could be at a disadvantage, and that
foreign telephone companies could abuse their power in overseas markets to
distort competition in the UK.
The DTI regards most foreign telecommunications regimes as 'pretty much
closed' to international competition, and is even slightly sceptical about
the liberal nature of the US system. One official commented that although
the US system is apparently open to competition, in reality the way the
regulatory system works makes it difficult for foreign operators to work
effectively.
The Americans have said they will make some changes, but even those would
leave the market more regulated than in the UK.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Letter: Sterling revaluation suggested by Bank's choice of
funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr P A AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, On July 21 the Bank of England raised Ecu50m in three-year Treasury
notes at a yield of 10.04 per cent. At close of business on that day the
benchmark three-year gilt (Exchequer 10 1/4 per cent July 21 1995) was
yielding 9.64 per cent on an annual basis.
Might I ask why the UK monetary authorities see fit to fund in a foreign
currency, at an extra cost to the taxpayer of 0.4 per cent per annum, at a
time of great concern about the public sector deficit? Perhaps the Bank of
England is planning an upwards revaluation of sterling, which is the only
scenario under which this funding method makes sense?

Sir, Your leader on the Jubilee Line extension ('Transport in Docklands',

whether the taxpayer should commit any money at all to building a tube

The Central London Rail Study recommended 'East/West Crossrail' as a first
priority to meet present needs. If the taxpayer is to spend mega-money on
railways, Crossrail should be the chosen project.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Letter: Disputing an age-old fallacy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr HARRY A SHEARRING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Sir Sigmund Sternberg (Letters, July 15) belongs to an enlightened
minority. Unfortunately, many UK employers have yet to recognise that, in
Sir Sigmund's words, 'age need not be a barrier to success'. Instead, they
operate 'too old at X policies' - X being almost any random number over 22.
There is research evidence supporting the 'too old at' paradigm, just as
there is research evidence that the earth is flat and that this planet is
the centre of the universe. But the evidence is flawed. In fact, older
adults can be as successful as their juniors, and they can be just as
creative.
Some of the evidence is set out in my recent article, 'Creativity and older
adults' (Leadership and Organization Development Journal 13/2). There are a
few caveats, but the general position is that, if he wants to be, the
90-year-old can be as mentally alert as the 19-year-old, provided he has
resisted flat-earthers' efforts to brain-shrink him into behaving in the
self-restricting and self-degrading ways which match their negative
paradigm.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Letter: Borrowing requirement and money supply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MIKE HIGGINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, John Plender's excellent article ('Uncertainty in a stable world', July
22) regarding strains in the housing market referred to Greenwell Montagu's
strong view that the government's 'full funding' rule, whereby the PSBR is
fully offset by net sales of gilts outside the banking and building society
sectors, should be amended in the current economic climate. It seems to us
odd, to say the least, that under this rule the effect of the PSBR on the
money supply is more or less exactly neutralised whether the economy is in
boom or slump.
Surely it would be better to overfund in economic boom times and underfund
at times of recession like now. Underfunding would have several beneficial
effects.
Broad money supply growth would be pushed up by approximately the amount of
underfunding.
Yields on long-dated gilt stocks would fall as the supply of new stock
became smaller.
The investing institutions would have more money to invest in other assets
such as equities and property, giving a much needed boost to the price
levels of those markets.
Mr Plender is not correct, however, in concluding that underfunding would
lead to higher short-term interest rates. He presumably comes to this
conclusion by arguing that, if the government sells fewer gilts and more
Treasury bills, this would push Treasury bill rates higher. In practice, the
government decides the overall level of money interest rates and the effect
of small or large bill issues is almost negligible.
This is probably most easily explained by considering the effect on the
banking system of, say, Pounds 10bn underfunding. This would increase bank
deposits (ie, money supply) by Pounds 10bn and would be available to buy
Pounds 10bn of Treasury bills or short-dated gilts. There is thus no
significant imbalance to put pressure on interest rates one way or the
other.
It is difficult to see why the government has not already embraced the idea
of underfunding when virtually all other options of stimulating the economy
are closed by ERM constraints. It is possible to argue about the extent of
the beneficial effects set out above, but I have heard no one argue that the
effect would not be in the right directon.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER SPENCER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Anthony Harris ('A new twist to ease the slump', July 20) suggests
that under-funding the public sector borrowing requirement would cause a
large rise in the M4 monetary aggregate and goes on to describe this as an
'arithmetic certainty'.
We have surely learned that there is no such thing as a mathematical
certainty, at least when it comes to the economy. But economic theory, for
what it is worth, states that the impact upon M4 would be precisely zero: in
an open economy such as the UK within a credible fixed exchange rate system
such as the ERM the money stock is determined by public demand and cannot be
influenced by funding or other financial devices.
Actually, M4 might rise if exchange or interest rates fell, stimulating
economic growth and the demand for money. But there is little if any scope
for such reductions at the moment. Changes in gilt issuance would in this
situation be offset largely in external capital flows, most obviously
overseas purchases of gilts.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Letter: Commitment to information centre needed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr M RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I find it confusing, to say the least, that with the extensive
publicity surrounding the UK presidency of the Council of Ministers of the
European Community, the future of the Centre for European Business
Information in London should still be a matter of debate and discussion.
Surely it would be embarrassing that such a centre, part of a network of
more than 200 European information centres operated in partnership with the
European Commission throughout the Community and one of only a small number
funded directly by a government agency in the EC, should be threatened with
closure at such a time, with the single market close at hand.
Perhaps continued financial support for such organisations would better
convince people of the government's commitment to the development of closer
business links between UK companies and their counterparts in the rest of
the Community, than press statements and glossy leaflets by the Foreign and
Commonwealth Office or the Department of Trade and Industry.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Letter: Means exist to maintain discipline in the City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHRISTOPHER SHARPLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Those who are calling for an alternative to massively expensive and in
the final analysis often futile court cases concerning alleged wrong-doing
in London's Square Mile should not overlook the potential of the existing
disciplinary powers available under the Financial Services Act.
Regulatory bodies such as the Securities and Futures Authority (SFA) are
empowered to carry out disciplinary actions against firms and/or
individuals. Penalties that can be imposed on those found to be in breach of
its rules include very substantial fines, compensation to clients,
restrictions on individuals' activities in the future, the closing down of
firms, and the prohibition of individuals from returning to the industry
either for a period or perhaps for ever.
The process used by SFA to decide on the culpability of an alleged offender
is fair yet expeditious. Its tribunals are chaired by eminent lawyers with
assistance from practitioners and independent members of SFA's board and
others. Legal argument, and hence costs, are kept to a manageable level and
there is no charge to the taxpayer as the cost of the process is met by
those regulated. The level of proof is much less onerous than in a criminal
trial and the standard by which the defendant is judged owes as much to the
spirit of the intention of the rules as to the detail of the rules
themselves. The overriding requirement of behaviour in accordance with best
market practice and the placing of client interests first are examples of
the key principles involved.
Custodial sentences can certainly be justified in cases where there has been
outright fraud or theft of client assets, but when the alleged offences are
more akin to breaches of City codes of conduct, then the use of criminal
prosecutions through the courts is inappropriate. Far better to use the
alternative that is already available and has already proved itself, but
whose process is blocked once criminal proceedings are begun.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Letter: Press for pensions accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CLIVE NATHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Having read the letters in your journal concerning the failures of the
professionals involved in the pensions industry, together with the many
suggestions for solutions, perhaps I could offer yet another.
Government reviews take a long time and during this period of delay little
will change unless members of existing pensions funds take up the
initiative.
The 'wealth' of some pension funds is often more than the value of the
company that has appointed the trustees, who are often the owners in control
both of the company and their employees' future .
All companies with a pension fund should volunteer to make available an
audited copy of their pension fund accounts. Any company that does not
should be pressed by the pension scheme members to provide this information
to which they are entitled by existing law. Perhaps if this programme
gathered momentum those concerned would suffer less.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Arts: Cleveland Orchestra - London Promenade Concerts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The airborne whooping of horns and trail of trumpets soaring aloft like
rockets set this pair of Promenade concerts off to a flying start. There was
little substance to Herbert Willi's Concerto for Orchestra, but it served
the double purpose of providing a token sample of new music and showing off
what a great orchestra can do.
Not that showing off is really part of the Clevelanders' nature. In the
parade of American orchestras at the Proms, which has been one of the
consistent pleasures of recent years, the Cleveland is unquestionably one of
the leaders - not glossy like Chicago or Philadelphia, but a workmanlike
orchestra, ready to take on the toughest musical material. Even in Ravel's
La Valse, the supremely well-played encore to Saturday's concert, there was
far more than just surface glitter.
All this is part of the Cleveland tradition. Long years with George Szell,
the orchestra's music director from 1946 to 1970, trained the players
rigorously in the demands of the classical repertoire and the present holder
of the post, Christoph von Dohnanyi, is able to draw on that deeply
ingrained sense of style.
Dohnanyi himself is in any case a conductor who knows his chosen music
inside out. There were two German symphonies on the Saturday programme,
Schumann's Fourth and Beethoven's Fifth, and he has mastered the workings of
the nuts and bolts that drive along the symphonic engines of each. In both
symphonies the exposition of the argument was remarkable. Every element
could be clearly heard and its import weighed, even if the Beethoven was in
the last degree too businesslike to become exciting.
The clarity was phenomenal again in Berlioz's Symphonie fantastique (the
wind could always be heard even when they were playing in unison with the
strings). But Dohnanyi needs to let himself go more. This is a symphony
which is about stretching the imagination and assailing the ear with strange
and wild sounds. The wailing clarinet and House-of-Dracula tolling bells in
the Witches' Sabbath had the right idea, but in the rest the disciplinarian
in Dohnanyi kept too sober a grip on the music.
There were two solo vocal contributions. On Saturday Jose van Dam was the
baritone soloist in Mahler's Ruckert Lieder, ideally placed in a diaphanous
orchestral cloak by Dohnanyi and bringing an effortless gravity of
expression to the five songs.
The treat of the two concerts, however, came the night before when Anja
Silja joined the orchestra for a razor-sharp performance of Kurt Weill's
Seven Deadly Sins. Supported by a fine male quartet, she declaimed Brecht's
moral tale of a journey through the evils of capitalism with immense
authority and dramatic soprano strength. Unlike some interpreters of this
piece, she and Dohnanyi never sought to cheapen the music. And that, indeed,
could be the watchword of everything that we heard in these two evenings.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Arts: The Elephant - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Hampstead, the young Wave Theatre Company have inaugurated what they hope
will be a continuing series of modern Japanese plays in translation. Their
first choice is Betsuyaku Minoru's The Elephant, a piece written 30 years
ago about people who survived the Hiroshima blast, only to succumb long
afterward to radiation sickness. Most of it is set in a hospital, which
makes the little theatre in the New End Hospital a specially suitable venue.
On the face of it, the English version by David G. Goodman sounds plausible
enough - but the manners of the play remain desperately obscure. Perhaps the
English is too plausible, for the cast treat their roles as familiar British
types: Jonathan Coyne plays the dying uncle, the 'Invalid', like a broad
Jewish comic, and one bizarre scene of casual murder comes out of
undergraduate revue. It becomes impossible to guess which of Minoru's
fancies are intended to be surrealist, and which other puzzles are the
results of severe cultural dislocation.
Nothing in the play seems to explain its title - unless the 'elephant' is
the uncle himself, weirdly proud of the 'keloid' on his back, a carapace of
scar tissue. The dialogue is full of sub-Ionesco repetitions: is that a
device, or just Japanese naturalism?
The theme of The Elephant is plain enough, a confrontation between the
indomitable (and indomitably foolish) Invalid and his nephew 'Man' (Alex
Harland), who prefers to suffer quietly and passively. Until the last
half-hour or so, at least: then, an endlessly recycled screaming-match
between them becomes actively unpleasant. Tim Keenan's production looks
smooth enough, and the young actors playing older roles do their best; but
this is a case of East meeting West with a dull thud.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Arts: A master of the material world - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THE BASIS of engineering is the knowledge of the materials being used:
knowledge of what they are made of, how they are made, how they are shaped,
how they stand up to stress, how they break, how they catch fire, how they
react to all the agencies of ruin which are perpetually nibbling at them,
how in due course they fall down. This is the true basis of engineering.'
These words of a famous engineer, A. J. Harris, were written in a paper
called, 'Architectural Misconceptions of Engineering'. He went on to explain
why he thought that engineering was an art and not a science. He might have
been writing about the philosophy behind the work of Peter Rice, a very
distinguished engineer who has won this year's Royal Gold Medal for
Architecture.
It is very unusual but not inappropriate for an engineer to win this premier
award; of all the great practising engineers Peter Rice certainly deserves
it because a great deal of contemporary architecture would not exist without
him. There is an opportunity to see his work in London at the moment at an
exhibition at the Royal Institute of British Architects at 66, Portland
Place, London W1, which is on view during the dog days of summer until
August 25.
He has called his show 'Exploring Materials'. It is no dull display of
technical ephemera, but rather an insight into the creative processes of
engineering that lie behind many important new buildings. The Opera House in
Sydney, Australia; Lloyd's of London; the De Menil Collection in Houston,
Texas; La Villette and La Defense in Paris; the Pavilion of the Future in
Seville, Spain, and many more. Each one of these remarkable buildings
demonstrates that the process of conceiving a structure is in itself an art.
I think that this is true because the whole process of structural
engineering is not simply the product of deductive reasoning but is also the
response to an inspiration or an intuition. The question of whether it is
the architect or the engineer who is the true artist is more difficult to
settle. Did the inspiration for the dramatic concrete sails of the Sydney
Opera House come from Jorn Utzon, the architect, or from Peter Rice, the
engineer? When you look at the daring spans of bridges in the Alps by the
Swiss engineer Maillart, or the drama of engineering works by Isambard
Kingdom Brunel or Thomas Telford, there is no doubt that they are works of
artistic and scientific genius.
But the artistic inspiration is also a manifestation of the engineer's
search for truth. By examining materials for their reaction to torsion,
compression, tension or bending, man is engaged in the search for truth.
There is a diagram that can be drawn that explains the links between art,
science and technology in the conception, creation and building of a form.
Peter Rice's exhibition, and indeed his life's work, makes this process
clear to the layman.
Perhaps engineers do not receive the credit they deserve because they are so
often seen as collaborators, rather than creators. This is unfair because
there is no doubt that engineers play a fundamentally creative role in the
creation of original architecture. The reason for the dim public perception
of engineering is because there are so many easily visible new buildings
that are the result of neither architecture nor engineering - they are the
product of the catalogue of the international building industry. It is the
standardised mediocrity of so many building components that is the bane of
the life of any good and innovative engineer or architect. Why else do we
look at the Palm House in Kew Gardens or the glories of the roof of London's
Paddington Station and wonder why we seldom do things so well today?
Speed has a lot to answer for. Time is money, as we are always being told,
and that attitude takes its toll on the quality of both design and building.
What the experimental nature of the work of someone like Peter Rice shows is
that, in the excitement of analysing new ways of designing structures, he
has succeeded in breaking out of industrial monotony. His design efforts at
the Sydney Opera House, for instance, have resulted in a building that is as
innovative as an early Gothic cathedral. By breaking the moulds of
structural predictability Peter Rice is on the path of art.
One of the architects that is especially known for his collaborations with
Peter Rice is Renzo Piano, the Italian architect. He was responsible, with
Rice, for the brilliant design of the De Menil Art Gallery in Houston which
used revolutionary materials - ferro-cement and ductile iron - in a
revolutionary way.
There are two more Piano/Rice collaborations on the way. The great new
airport in Japan, the Kansai International Airport, which looks like a giant
bird or aircraft landing on a new artificial island, promises to be one of
the great new buildings of the world. In a very different vein, a church
dedicated to the stigmata saint Padre Pio in Puglia, in Italy, will be built
of stone and will probably be a great domed basilica that can withstand
earthquakes. There is a rare opportunity in the RIBA exhibition to see work
in progress at a very early stage.
Peter Rice's work demonstrates that engineering, art and architecture form a
unity and that contemporary building of any quality demands an understanding
of all three activities. He is the enemy of standardisation and on the side
of true creation.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Arts: Hail and farewell at Glyndebourne - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Well, that's that,' said Sir George Christie, appearing on stage last
Thursday after the final curtain calls of the 1992 Glyndebourne Festival's
final performance. He was in his best dry, throwaway vein, and proceeded to
give a model demonstration of the uses of English understatement in
end-of-term speeches of the kind. For 'that', after all, was not just an
incandescent account of Tchaikovsky's Queen of Spades - one of this season's
two new stagings, and one of the outstanding events in festival history -
but the last full-scale performance in a theatre on the point of being
knocked down and totally re-built.
In fact, that was even then not quite that for the theatre itself. The
following evening it fired into action one last time, for a gala audience
(aptly thanked by Sir George for paying 'extortionate prices') and a stage
full of Glyndebourne opera stars past and present: Montserrat Caballe,
Frederica von Stade, Ruggero Raimondi and Felicity Lott among the singers,
Janet Baker, Elisabeth Soderstrom and Geraint Evans in speaking,
memory-recalling roles, and the LPO and Glyndebourne Chorus conducted by the
current and former Glyndebourne music directors, Andrew Davis and Bernard
Haitink.
The early-evening concert, which is said to have earned the re-building fund
a cool Pounds 700,000, was given a delayed transmission on BBC2 - so that
those of us watching and listening at home had the splendid post-prandial
firework display as visual accompaniment to the closing item of the
programme, the Figaro overture. On May 28 1934, that opera launched
activities in the old theatre; if all goes according to plan, it will do the
same in the new, exactly 60 years later.
The choice, like most of the others on the gala programme, was cunningly
devised to reflect peaks of achievement over the 58-year span of
Glyndebourne's existence. Choruses from Idomeneo, Macbeth and The Rake's
Progress, the final scenes of Monteverdi's Ulisse and Strauss's Capriccio,
and diverse items from Don Giovanni, Il barbiere di Siviglia, Porgy and Bess
and Peter Grimes (the other new production of the 1992 season) made up a
tapestry skilfully woven out of specially significant and colourful
Glyndebourne artistic threads.
It was, as gala concerts go, a decent affair - not exactly scintillating
(but then galas seldom are), not managing to infuse authentic Glyndebourne
magic into the various operatic highlights (except during Cynthia Haymon's
ravishing Gershwin 'Summertime'), but unfolded with dignity and tact.
In another way, indeed, it afforded the wider world a truthful glimpse into
the heart of the extraordinary Glyndebourne enigma: the enterprise,
unsubsidised by state money and wholly dependent on the top end of the
paying public, that has preserved consistently - and, increasingly in the
modern world, incomparably - high, serious standards of opera-performance.
However much glitz and conspicuous consumption there may be on the picnic
lawns, in the theatre the rule has been productions long-rehearsed and
musically responsible, and above all a telling closeness of contact between
singers, players and audiences.
With the years, and particularly with the various attempts at enlargement of
the 1950s, that intimacy was bought at a price: as Christie puts it in his
foreword to the 1992 programme book, 'with middle age (the theatre) has
increasingly looked like Tom Kitten. We all have great affection for it, but
the waistcoat buttons are fit to burst.' In truth it has never been a
comfortable theatre either for performers or audiences (who on hot summer
evenings have particularly felt the pinch of their too-tight dinner-jackets
and trousers while squeezing into narrow rows and cramped seats).
Glyndebourne regulars treasure their long list of unforgettable moments in
spite of many of the theatre's features rather than because of them.
The new house will add 300 seats to the old total of 850 (and make a welcome
provision for standing places at the back of the second circle). There will
be an enlarged pit, not to enable Glyndebourne to contemplate the
orchestrally super-sized operas - according to Anthony Whitworth-Jones,
festival general director, recent rumours of a Glyndebourne Tristan und
Isolde in prospect are without foundation - but to give air to the
instrumental sounds and physical relief to the cramped human beings
producing them. (When occupied by 'period' bands, the front platform of the
pit will rise to a suitable height at the touch of button.)
There will also be a much-needed expansion of wing space, and improvements
of various technical and lighting facilities, though the last word in
state-of-the-art stage machinery has never been considered affordable or,
more important, artistically imperative. But the proscenium arch will grow
by only a few feet in all directions; for this reason, no existent
production is likely to be denied a showing in the new house on grounds of
size-suitability alone.
Whitworth-Jones insists that it is to be a 'bigger house, not a big one. We
said to the architects that we must preserve an intimate atmosphere in the
auditorium: this was the first and last requirement. The fact of size is not
going to alter repertory policy. Of course that's going to develop, but
within the context of the policy which we've actually pursued for decades -
which is basically making up an ensemble-type repertory, not
huge-voice-league, star-based opera.'
He speaks enticingly of future prospects for Handel (of all the operas and
oratorios only Jephtha has previously been mounted, in an appallingly
inauthentic edition), for a renewal of the 1950s Rossini re-discovery, for
the new opera promised by Harrison Birtwistle for the Glyndebourne Touring
Opera's 1994 schedule (to be taken on by the festival proper the following
year). Next June, to assuage summer withdrawal pangs, there will be nine
Festival Hall concert performances, three each of The Merry Widow conducted
by the LPO chief, Franz Welser-Most, Fidelio conducted by Klaus Tennstedt,
and Beatrice and Benedict conducted by Andrew Davis.
The 1992 festival, with a flawed but heartfelt and deeply considered new
Grimes, an utterly enthralling new Queen of Spades, and distinguished
revivals of Cosi, Jenufa and Death in Venice, closed the old theatre in
grandest Glyndebourne style. I wondered whether, at the end of it all,
Whitworth-Jones wanted to rush out to the demolition teams already in action
and shout 'Stop, this madness can go no further]'. His smile, tired but
contented, was the only answer needed.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Management: Legend behind the cash cow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few people have had as much impact on international business in the second
half of the 20th Century as the founder of the Boston Consulting Group,
Bruce Henderson, who died last week aged 77 in the city where he was born,
Nashville, Tennessee.
Though this might be disputed by US General Electric and BCG's top
consultancy rivals at the longer-established McKinsey &amp; Co, Henderson's
greatest claim was to have put the concept of competitive strategy on the
map. Until he founded BCG in the early 1960s, the competitive element of
strategy was conspicuous in most corporate analyses by its absence.
Henderson was the father of two analytical tools for which BCG had become
famous - even notorious - by the late 1970s: the 'experience curve' and the
portfolio 'growth share matrix'. These, in turn, launched BCG's gospel about
the all-importance of high market share. They also gave rise to such graphic
expressions as 'cash cows' (businesses which can be milked for cash) and
'dogs' (those which should be sold or eliminated).
By the time he retired in 1985, his empire had grown to 500 employees and
nine offices. In the last seven years, its size more than doubled, to 1,300
employees in 19 offices around the world. That growth rate spells manifest
success with clients. Yet, many executives who have never used BCG's
services still view the firm critically, as an arch-exponent of the
discredited pedalling of packaged solutions.
This is an unfair allegation - witness, BCG's recent sophisticated work on
quality and 'time-based management'. But it is one which several former
colleagues felt Henderson brought on himself, by being such an
arch-simplifier and salesman of his own and his firm's ideas.
Henderson belonged to that sizeable branch of the strategy world whose first
degree was engineering, rather than arts, social science or economics.
Hence, his deep interest in complex systems - a field which is only now
having an impact on business through the concept of 'organisational
learning.' He had little time for economists, arguing - with much
justification - that 'Darwin is probably a better guide to business
competition than economists are.'

EDMUND NUTTALL has secured a contract worth about Pounds 3m to build a quay
wall at the Albert Johnson Quay in Portsmouth. The client is Portsmouth City
Council, whose engineers have designed the works and will supervise the
contract.
The latest project will consist of deepening the Albert Johnson Quay
dockside and strengthening the quay to accommodate larger general cargo and
reefer vessels. Although overall duration of the contract is 40 weeks, 100
metres of new working quay has to be completed and operational by
mid-December.
Not only does the project involve dredging for the new approach channel and
berth, but also the construction of about 200 metres of quay wall in front
of the existing quay. This will comprise steel sheet piles, raking steel
bearing piles and a reinforced concrete anchor beam to support a reinforced
concrete relieving slab on to which crane beams will be constructed for
dockside luffing cranes to travel.
Further works include the construction of foundations and associated
services for a cold storage shed behind the quay for soft fruit storage.

The chairmen of Manganese Bronze, maker of London's famous black taxi cabs,
have a tendency to die in harness. Hence the company has decided to pick a
relatively youthful Hugh Lang (above), the former chairman of management
consultants P-E International, to fill the chair which has been vacant since
Rocky Stone died in April.
Lang, 59, trained as a metallurgist, but joined P-E as a management
consultant in 1961. In 1980 he was made executive chairman and brought the
company to market in 1986. Before he stepped down last month, he had been
specialising in the fields of board structure, top organisation and business
development. His skills in this last area could come in useful at Manganese
Bronze, which has been hit hard by the recession.
Although Manganese Bronze is capitalised at just Pounds 13m on the stock
market, it always seems to have been able to recruit high profile figures as
chairman.
Lang's predecessor, 77-year-old Rocky Stone was a leading light in the
Industrial &amp; Commercial Finance Corporation and sat on the boards of Smith
New Court and Babcock International. Meanwhile Stone's predecessor, Dennis
Poore, headed the company for 21 years, and was a driving force in trying to
save Britain's motor cycle industry. He was 70 when he died in office.

FT  27 JUL 92 / People: Swanson finds a home at Tay
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Swanson, who was forced to resign as chairman and chief executive of
Barratt Developments 12 months ago, is back building houses. He has been
appointed managing director operations of Tay Homes, the Leeds-based
housebuilder which seems to be weathering the recession better than many of
its rivals.
There is a certain irony about Swanson's arrival at Tay Homes. Not only is
the company in a much healthier condition than Barratt, but its two founders
 -chairman Trevor Spencer and chief executive Norman Stubbs - started Tay
after Barratt took over their old company, Bracken Construction, in the
early 1970s.
'Trevor and I were against the takeover,' says the 50-year-old Stubbs. So
they decided to set up on their own when Barratt took over. They still own
27 per cent of Tay which went public in 1983. Although the 1,000 houses a
year that Tay builds is small by comparison with Barratt's 5,000, Tay has
avoided paying too dearly for land. Swanson, 45, was ousted from the Barratt
boardroom last year following a Pounds 106m loss, most of which resulted
from the need to write down the value of the company's land bank.
Stubbs says that Swanson was a 'victim of circumstances'. He had kept in
contact over the years and took him on as a consultant after he left
Barratt. 'We needed some more help and John was the ideal chap,' says
Stubbs. Swanson will be in charge of day-to-day operations and, in
particular, will be concerned with the development of the subsidiary
companies in Glasgow, Leeds, Cheshire, Leighton Buzzard and Plymouth.
The arrival of Swanson means that Stubbs, and the 60-year-old Spencer, will
be able to spend more time formulating group policy.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Construction Contracts: New Bangladeshi bridge design study
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RENDEL PALMER &amp; TRIT TON and its fellow consultants on the proposed Pounds
310m Jamuna Bridge in Bangladesh have been commissioned to integrate the
bridge end design with the land use master plan drawn up by another British
consultant, GHK/MRM International.
It is recognised that the World Bank-funded bridge will provide considerable
development potential at the bridge ends and that it is vital to adapt and
integrate the master plan with the engineering design and tender documents.
RPT, its engineering partners NEDECO of Holland and the locally-based
Bangladesh Consultants, will consider a number of factors. These range from
distribution of landfill and integration of re-settlement sites to assessing
the general layout of bridge end facilities, including roads and railway
land allocation.
As far as the bridge is concerned, RPT is in the process of completing the
new programme of contractor prequalification called for by the bank.
Tender documents are expected to relate to a bridge designed for road, but
with the potential to be adapted to road plus rail at a future date and at
minimum incremental cost.
The bridge will be the first fixed transport link across the Jamuna River,
which forms a 15km barrier separating the fertile north-west zone from the
commercial centre, Dhaka and the country's primary port, Chittagong.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Management: Sharper skills and bigger pay cheques - Are MBAs
still useful to ambitious business people?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Decrying the value of an MBA is all the rage, but some consumers still seem
to think it is value for money. So say two very different surveys of
graduates from British business schools - published, you should be warned,
by the institutions themselves.
The first, a survey of graduates from Cranfield School of Management's
full-time MBA programme between 1970 and 19901, shows all but 3 per cent of
alumni 'highly satisfied' and nearly 90 per cent avowing it as 'important'
to their career progression.
However, the main reason for taking the MBA had changed. In 1970 the top
reason was 'to change career'; since 1975 the top slot has been 'to acquire
new skills'. Despite that, the number of company-sponsored students has
dropped from nearly a quarter in 1970 to 4 per cent in 1990. Cranfield's
part-time MBA seems to have taken most company-sponsored students.
On the pre-MBA background of students, in the first 10 years of the
programme there was a shift away from large companies (turnover in excess of
Pounds 100m a year) to small companies (turnover up to Pounds 10m a year).
Since 1985 this shift has slowed, and the last year surveyed (1990) saw a
move back to medium-sized and large companies, possibly as a result of the
recession.
Some things remain fairly constant. The salary differentials pre/post MBA
stayed typically in the order of 30/40 per cent. Similarly, graduates from
all four of the years surveyed regarded finance and accounting, followed by
marketing, as the most valuable programmes.
The second survey is of students on the part-time MBA at London's City
University Business School 2, which runs one of the UK's largest evening MBA
courses. The course, begun in 1983 for City workers, takes nearly 100
students a year.
The average age of students surveyed was 30, 82 per cent of them men. Around
half had their fees paid by their company, with another quarter
part-sponsored. Graduates produce the usual list of benefits ('thinking
strategically', 'wider understanding of business'), but a surprisingly high
number volunteered 'credibility' as a benefit. And guess the average salary
increase? Yes, another 30 per cent. 'It is not possible to say whether this
was a result of the MBA,' says the report modestly.
The effect of sponsorship is not straightforward. Whereas sponsored
employees are more likely to stay with their employers, the unsponsored are
less likely to change employer than the part-sponsored. 'Possibly this is
because an employee who has undertaken such a commitment does so because it
is the only way they can see to change function or achieve promotion.'

developments
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TAYLOR WOODROW GROUP companies have picked up two retail fitting-out
contracts, together worth nearly Pounds 5m.
The first was awarded to Taylor Woodrow Construction Southern, Southall, for
the Safeway store at Thomas More Square adjacent to St Katharine by the
Tower in London. Worth Pounds 2.6m, this follows a Pounds 3.7m contract by
Taylor Woodrow earlier this year to build the store.
The second, a Pounds 2.1m contract at Watford for BhS - formerly British
Homes Stores and now part of the Storehouse Group - has been awarded to
Myton, another subsidiary of the Taylor Woodrow Group and based in Hayes,
Middlesex.
It involves extensions at both the ground and first-floor levels into the
Harlequin shopping mall, together with refurbishment of the sales areas and
a 100-seat restaurant. Both contracts are due for completion this autumn.

BOVIS PROGRAM MANAG EMENT has been appointed project manager of an Pounds
11m contract to build an accident and emergency department for the North
Middlesex Hospital (NHS Trust) in Haringey. This contract is the first phase
of a four phase redevelopment scheme valued in excess of Pounds 60m.
Bovis Program Management started work on the design of the development in
April. The building, which will provide 37,500 sq ft of medical facilities,
will be built on the site of a car park which will be relocated elsewhere in
the hospital grounds.
Construction of the building, which will feature two new orthopaedic wards,
two operating theatres, an accident and emergency department with a
specialist fracture clinic and X- ray department, will begin in July 1993.
The project is scheduled for completion in January 1995.
Bovis Construction, another P&amp;0 company, has been awarded two contracts,
together valued at more than Pounds 12m, to design and build regional
centres for Marks &amp; Spencer in Birmingham and Manchester.
In Birmingham, work will start in September to design and construct a 23,000
sq ft sales floor at the second floor level of Marks &amp; Spencer's main city
store.
An enlarged 14,000 sq ft food hall will be installed in the basement and
completely new staff quarters and office accommodation will be provided at
the third floor level.
In Manchester, Bovis will start work in September to enlarge the city's
principal Marks &amp; Spencer store. By converting a stockroom, the ground floor
sales area will be enlarged by 18,000 sq ft.
An enlarged 14,000 sq ft foodhall will be installed in the basement, whilst
a take-away food shop will be created within the ground floor sales area.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Management: A light bite and a heavy sell - Business Lunches
/- Michael Cassell begins a series on expense account eating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF lunch is 'for wimps', to quote Gordon Gekko, the Wall Street financier
who preferred to dine off other people's misfortunes, then the streets of
London are well populated with weaklings.
For in spite of the longest recession for 60 years, the business lunch is
still on the day's agenda across the Square Mile and throughout the West
End.
It may be quicker, almost certainly cheaper and possibly healthier, but the
working lunch remains big business in the capital, where restaurants are
trying harder than ever to make their cash in two hours, five times weekly.
The excesses of the 1980s have gone, with customers increasingly going for
the 'menu rapide' instead of the 1980s-style blow-out, when champagne stocks
ran out and the bills ran up.
But many people still make time for a bite to eat with the contact who would
otherwise remain a disembodied voice on the telephone.
'Lunch today is a more modest affair but it still counts. It's usually one
or two courses, a glass of wine, a bucket full of gossip and, with some
luck, the chance of a deal. That's good value for Pounds 50,' according to
Jamie Dunn, a futures market man buying lunch at Le Cafe du Marche, a former
warehouse close to the Barbican and now one of the most popular business
venues.
'Lunch is not a perk. Good times or bad, it always helps if you can look
someone in the eye when you need to,' says Neill Moran, an investment banker
indulging his guest in one of 36 varieties of champagne available at The
City Flogger.
'I would refute the idea that hard times have wrecked the business lunch.
Try turning up at any good restaurant in the City without booking and you
run the risk of embarrassing yourself in front of your client,' according to
Mark de Wesselow, publisher of Square Meal, the City and West End guides to
eating out. He adds: 'The fact that, even in a recession, the Square Mile
alone can support well over 225 restaurants is the greatest testimony of all
to the role of the business lunch in the 1990s.'
Even so, many big employers in London have cut back their entertainment
budgets - Pounds 25-Pounds 30 per head for lunch seems about average -
although there is always the tricky question of not appearing either too
cheap or too extravagant.
'If it's cheap and nasty, you know they're having a hard time. If it's
over-the-top, you can draw the same conclusion,' says Murray Jacobs, a
commodities broker who has crossed the Thames to lunch by Tower Bridge at
Sir Terence Conran's Le Pont de la Tour, one of the current places to be
seen. Do not use it, or the Stephen Bull bistro near Smithfield market, if
you want to keep your business liaisons secret.
Increasingly, large companies are trying to make lunch an in-house affair,
where the duration and the cost can be better controlled.
Goldman Sachs, the US investment house, was once regarded as one of the more
generous lunch-time entertainers around the City but it now boasts a
stylish, 10th-floor restaurant in its modern, Fleet Street headquarters.
Christopher Brown, the managing director of Corney and Barrow, which has
seven city restaurants, confirms that people want better value out of lunch.
This year average expenditure is down by nearly 20 per cent, although the
number of transactions is up 30 per cent.
'It is a question of talking six to the dozen about business in the time
available.' To compete for clientele, Corney and Barrow offers little extras
such as a 'host button', enabling the host to surreptitiously summon service
without interrupting the flow of conversation.
Although companies like Legal and General, National Westminster, Gestetner,
Shell and Imperial Chemical Industries have removed alcohol from their
premises, the capital's wine and champagne bars are bearing up. Pimms or
champagne still top the summer pops.
London can also claim to offer a more interesting range of food than was the
case a few years ago. The French cuisine which first ousted the 'nursery'
food beloved of British businessmen has been joined by tastes from around
the world.
Oriental restaurants such as Tatsuso - the Japanese restaurant in Broadgate
Circle - thought to be the first in Britain with a Michelin star - are
increasingly popular.
But old eating habits still die hard. Simpsons in Cornhill, purveyors since
1757 of steak and kidney pud and plum duff and custard, has its loyal fans.
Places like Sweetings, the most hectic fish restaurant in town, and Bubbs, a
maroon-panelled oasis alongside Smithfield market, also rarely lack
customers.
Some of the most popular restaurants for a business lunch, however, remain
well over the Square Mile's western boundary. The Savoy Grill, where
favourite tables are annoyingly reserved for captains of industry or the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, still ranks among the most popular lunch-time
venues.
Others include the Connaught, where quail's eggs in pastry boats offer a
tasty insight into what can follow, Wiltons, the Jermyn Street fish
restaurant favoured by property men and former prime ministers, and Le
Gavroche, a shrine to the Roux brothers.
Many of them will effortlessly deduct well over Pounds 100 a head from any
expense account, though the bill will be less indigestible at some of the
newer, trendier West End eating spots, such as Orso in Covent Garden, used
by younger executives out to impress.
Similarly, sassy places to talk business include the Greenhouse off Park
Lane and Le Caprice - sister restaurant to the wildly popular Ivy  - behind
the Ritz, itself offering one of London's grandest dining-rooms and dubbed
the 'Trafalgar House canteen' in deference to the hotel's owners.
Conran fans away from the City head for the light and spacious Bibendum
restaurant in the Fulham Road's Michelin building while the set lunch at La
Tante Claire in Royal Hospital Road provides an opportunity to marvel at
Pierre Coffmann dishes which can cost a bomb in the evening.
But if your expenses cannot stand it, try a fresh approach. Whisk your guest
up Bow Lane and usher him into Sorella for a tasty triple-decker honey
roast, Jarlsberg cheese and turkey sandwich on ciabatta bread. The cost? A
mere Pounds 2-75 - unless the chauffeur gets a ticket.

FT  27 JUL 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Barcelona - a city transformed / A
look at Catalonia and its radically altered infrastructure stemming from the
staging of the Games
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I SPENT most of last week watching and worrying about the grass.
Other visitors to Barcelona may have had other preoccupations. Newly arrived
athletes from around the world unpacked their Reeboks and frolicked in the
Olympic village. VIPs jetted in from distant corporate HQs and wined and
dined the nights away aboard luxury liners. Crowds of foreign press and
hordes of Japanese cameramen swamped the streets looking for copy and
filming anything that moved.
As the Games' extravagant Saturday opening ceremony at Montjuic - the
hilltop Olympic site in the middle of the city - approached, Olympic fever,
a spreading virus, struck everywhere. All Barcelona ate, drank, danced and
dreamed Olympics.
I did not dream Olympics. Through the airless wee hours of the night I lay
sleepless, listening to the sounds of adolescent motorcycle hooligans
buzzing around the periphery of the Press village - and worrying about the
grass. It was not growing fast enough.
Throughout the week, Spanish contractors had been working at breakneck pace
to complete the city's vast and grandiose Olympic plans on time. On
Montjuic, mobile cranes lifted ornamental stone pediments into place.
Excavating machines dug trenches for power and communication cables.
Scaffolding was thrown up to put the finishing touches to building facades.
Hammers rang, drills whined, trucks ground in low gear. In their frantic
haste, no one seemed concerned about the decorative lawns they were bashing,
bruising and ripping up in the process.
From the Placa d'Espana, the imposing entry point into the Olympic area, to
the great stadium showcase at the top of Montjuic, everything looked
magnificent - the broad processional avenue festooned with fluttering
Olympic banners; the tiered fountains and cascading watercourses on the
hillside; the art nouveau lamp standards; statues of nudes and buildings of
baroque ornateness.
Everything was perfect, but for the grass. Wide swathes of ground lay bare,
fallow and ugly.
To me, the entire Olympic project and all it involves - 11,000 athletes from
172 countries, 15,000 journalists, 10,000 paramilitary security men, six
years of preparation, Dollars 4.6bn worth of investment, the hopes, dreams
and financial prospects of sprinters, politicians and advertising agencies -
seemed threatened.
How could the opening ceremony, I wondered, be shot against a background of
bare, black dirt? Forget about the 60,000 punters paying Dollars 400 a
ticket to attend the opening ceremony personally. But what about NBC paying
huge sums to broadcast it publicly? What about 3.5bn TV viewers around the
globe. No amount of banners and bunting could hide the eyesore.
'We have fertilised, we have seeded, we have watered,' a city gardener told
me with a wave of his hand. 'It will grow. Manana.' But with a week to go,
broad expanses of ground around Montjuic, Barcelona's pride and joy, were as
naked as an ancient Greek Olympian.
Life, however, works mysteriously under the Spanish sun. What began eight
days ago as tiny tendrils poking out of the soil had become a faint blush
seven days ago. By Tuesday, the blush had become a pale, electric green. The
days went by. The young grass strengthened and grew by centimetres. By
Saturday morning, when I rose early to check it one last time, it had
become, if not a fully fledged English-style bowling green, an acceptable
backdrop to the promised five-ringed spectacle.
I was astounded. City gardeners, on the other hand, seemed to take it for
granted. Perhaps, like most Catalans, they have become entirely used to
rapid growth and startling results.
For most of us, the Barcelona Olympics are a two-week entertainment, a
spectacle of youthful athleticism. For Catalans the event is something far
more besides. As Lluis Arnet, municipal councillor in charge of city
planning, has put it, the Olympics 'have provided us with an extraordinary
pretext for mobilising resources with which to transform the city.'
And transformed it they have. For Barcelona this is an unequalled
opportunity to present an image of a city and a region that is modern,
dynamic and ready to take on the coming challenges of the single European
market.
In a sustained burst of energy and spending, Barcelona has not only rebuilt
Montjuic but constructed more than 40 other Olympic venues. A redesigned
port, a vast new waterfront suburb, rejuvenated suburban peripheries, a new
airport, an extensive new highway system, new hotels, skyscrapers,
communications towers and 150 new parks and urban spaces have all radically
altered Barcelona's infrastructure.
The city's growth reflects Catalonia's growth. Catalonia has always been
Spain's most industrialised, richest area. While Spain can claim only 72 per
cent of average EC national per capita income, in the last five years
Catalonia's income has risen slightly above the EC average; it is now richer
than Britain.
But economics are not the only factor that have made the Olympics vital to
Catalonia's future. No equation in Catalonia - economic, cultural, political
 -can be complete without taking into account the region's fiery
nationalism.
A people with a separate language, history and outlook on life - they were
primarily urban and industrialised when the rest of Spain was still rural
and agricultural - the Catalans have always been at odds with Castillian
Spain. What was seen as imperial invasion and oppression in earlier
centuries gave way to even harsher and more discriminatory treatment under
Franco's fascist rule.
The result has been the growth, through the post-Franco period, of various
strains of Catalan nationalism ranging from the modestly cultural to the
stridently separatist. These days, Catalonia's semi-autonomous government
hands out tracts to visiting Olympic journalists which call the region 'a
nation without a state of its own,' but its leaders have ruled out the
declaration of an independent state. Other political organisations call for
more radical steps.
The Olympics, however, have had a miraculous effect on the volatile world of
Catalan politics. Catalonia's great hope for a leap into the future, they
have moderated and drawn together all strains of political sentiment.
For the sake of the Olympics, industrialists, socialists, Spanish
federalists and hard-core Catalan nationalists have all, so far, made
consensus and pragmatism the order of the day.
When 60,000 spectators made their way up the Montjuic hillside to watch
Saturday's spectacular opening ceremony, the first national anthem they
heard in the Olympic stadium was not Spain's, but Catalonia's. Els Segadors
is its battle hymn and rallying cry. 'Triumphant, Catalonia will once again
be rich and full]' run the words. 'Let us swing the sickle] Let us swing the
sickle, defenders of our land]'
By the time these Games are over, Catalonia may well be triumphant, rich and
full. Certainly the grass lawns around Montjuic will be ready for a good
swing of that sickle.

RESULTS DUE
Imperial Chemical Industries reports its second-quarter results on Thursday,
when it is expected to produce pre-tax profits of Pounds 200m-Pounds 240m,
down from Pounds 309m for the same quarter last year. One analyst said that
a cut in the dividend would have a cataclysmic effect on the market.
Results on the pharmaceuticals side will be watched closely. Analysts are
keen to quantify the fall in Tenormin sales in the US since the expiry of
its patents. The extent to which the new drugs, Zestril, Zoladex and
Diprivan, have made up Tenormin's decline will also be of interest.
Otherwise, agrochemicals are likely to be disappointing, and analysts will
be watching the state of the basic chemicals market to see if there has been
any sign of an upturn. The chairman's statement about future prospects will
be closely examined.
Midland Bank becomes the first of the Big Four banks to announce its
half-year results on Thursday.
The results are largely of historical interest since Midland was taken over
last month by Hongkong and Shanghai Bank and will not pay a dividend to its
former shareholders.
Last time round a poor performance on its UK banking operations drove
Midland into a loss of Pounds 71m. This year it should be back in the black.
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew are predicting pre-tax profits of Pounds 120m, but a
possible write-back of sovereign debt could make the figure even higher.
Lloyds Bank will report on Friday interim pre-tax profits of around Pounds
355m against Pounds 331m a year earlier. It is likely to increase its
interim dividend by about 15 per cent to 6.29 net. The result will underline
its performance as the best of the clearing banks.

FT  27 JUL 92 / The Week Ahead - Economics: CBI data threaten more gloom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH few sensitive figures out in the UK, this week could see some reprieve
from last week's financial jitters. But the Confederation of British
Industry's quarterly industrial trends survey is likely to add to mounting
gloom over the economy. The last survey was optimistic about prospects for
manufacturers later this year, with business optimism showing its biggest
jump in four years. Another jump would be a welcome signal but movements in
the optimism index have been jagged over the past few months and seasonal
factors could adversely affect the latest results.
Most of the activity this week is in the US. On Thursday, GDP figures are
expected to show that the US recovery struggled to keep going in the second
quarter. The forecast is for growth of 1.7 per cent, almost a full
percentage point lower than growth in the first quarter. Consumer confidence
is also expected to have declined this month, in spite of the Federal
Reserve's discount rate cut three weeks ago. Since the beginning of the
year, the consumer confidence index has jumped from 50.2 per cent to 71.1
per cent in June. Most of the increase was between January and April, since
when it has shown little change.
Here are some of the other economic highlights. The figures in brackets,
from MMS International, are the median of economists' forecasts.
Today: US, June existing home sales, housing vacancies for the second
quarter; Japan, June retail sales (down 0.7 per cent on the year).
Tomorrow: UK, CBI quarterly industrial trends survey; US, employment cost
index second quarter (up 0.8 per cent on quarter), July consumer confidence
(70 per cent); Japan, June industrial production (up 1 per cent), service
price index second quarter.
Wednesday: Australia, consumer prices second quarter (flat on previous
quarter, up 1.5 per cent on year), Canada, June industrial production price
index (up 0.1 per cent).
Thursday: US, advance GDP second quarter (up 1.8 per cent), advance GDP
deflator (up 3 per cent), initial unemployment claims for w/e July 18
(410,000), June new home sales (522,000), export price index, import price
index, money supply data for w/e July 20; Australia, June building
appropriations (up 3 per cent), June current account (ADollars 1bn loss
seasonally adjusted).
Friday: US, June personal income (flat), personal consumption expenditure
(up 0.4 per cent), June factory goods orders (up 0.8 per cent), July Chicago
national association of purchasing managers index, July Michigan sentiment
index, July agricultural prices; Japan, July Tokyo consumer prices index (up
2.2 per cent on year) excluding perishables (up 2.4 per cent), June CPI
Nation (up 2.3 per cent on year) excluding perishables (up 2.5 per cent),
June construction orders, housing starts (up 1.7 per cent on year) and
construction starts; Canada, May real GDP at factor cost (up 0.1 per cent),
May building permits (down 1.3 per cent).
During the week: Germany, July cost of living (up 0.2 per cent on month, up
3.5 per cent on year), June import prices (down 0.2 per cent on month, down
2.8 per cent on year); France, June unemployment rate (10 per cent); Japan,
June trade balance, current account and foreign bond investment.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Abta warns on travel safeguards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT proposals for regulating package travel will not prevent further
incidents like the collapse last Friday of Land Travel, Mr John Dunscombe,
chief executive of the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta), said
yesterday. The failure of the Bath-based coach company resulted in 50,000
people losing money on holiday bookings.
Mr Dunscombe said that several aspects of the government's proposals were
welcome, but they would not prevent customers from losing money in future
travel company collapses.
His comments came as 2,500 Land Travel customers continued to make their way
back from the Continent, and the Foreign Office said their repatriation had
gone relatively smoothly. A driver had refused to bring 42 Land Travel
customers back from Czechoslovakia, but the travellers had returned on
another coach.
The government has proposed a central reserve fund to compensate
package-holiday customers travelling by land or sea. Companies selling
charter flight packages are already required to obtain a licence from the
Civil Aviation Authority and to arrange a bond to compensate customers in
case of collapse.
Many providers of land and sea packages already have bonds arranged through
Abta or other trade bodies. Mr Dunscombe welcomed the creation of a fund for
surface travel as Abta would not then have to rely on its own emergency
financial arrangements if a bond proved inadequate. Abta is disappointed,
however, that the government does not plan to insist that all companies
taking holidaymakers abroad subscribe to the reserve fund.
Package-tour providers outside the central fund will still have to obtain
insurance or open a designated account to ensure the return of pre-payments
and the repatriation of holidaymakers.
But this will be monitored by local trading-standards officers and Mr
Dunscombe questioned whether they would have the time or experience to
evaluate the effectiveness of these arrangements.
Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer affairs spokesman, said he would seek
a meeting with Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, today to
ask why the Department of Trade and Industry took no action against Land
Travel when the company's difficulties had been known in the travel trade
for eight weeks.
Mr Griffiths added that the government's new proposals on package travel,
announced last week, would allow unscrupulous operators to escape the
regulatory net.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Seoul seeks to break deadlock with N Korea: The thinking
behind Seoul's offer of aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH Korean officials are hoping that offers of economic aid made last week
will persuade North Korea to break the stalemate on the issue of nuclear
inspections.
North and South Korea signed reconciliation agreements last December,
including a ban on nuclear weapons. But talks on implemention of the pacts
have become bogged down.
Pyongyang is refusing to allow South Korean counterparts in Seoul to conduct
checks of suspected nuclear research facilities, which would complement
scheduled inspections already being made by the International Atomic Energy
Agency. In response, South Korea has frozen planned investments in North
Korea.
But with a presidential election in December, Seoul wants to find a
settlement by the autumn. The country's big business groups, some of which
are strong supporters of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party, are growing
impatient at the delay in entering North Korea. By inviting Mr Kim Dal-hyon,
the North Korean deputy prime minister, to tour industrial facilities in
South Korea last week, Seoul wanted to underscore to Pyongyang that it has
much to gain economically if it makes a concession on the nuclear issue.
Mr Kim is believed to be one of few senior North Korean officials receptive
to Seoul's offer. His position as trade minister and chairman of the
External Economic Committee has led to his support for opening the country
to foreign investment and expanding trade to bolster the troubled North
Korean economy. He is also a nephew of Kim Il-sung, the North Korean leader.
Talks on economic co-operation will continue. Mr Choi Gak-kyu, head of the
Economic Planning Board, the most powerful economic agency in Seoul, is
expected to travel soon to North Korea. Seoul will also send a study team,
consisting of representatives from leading Korean companies, to examine the
location of a proposed industrial complex in the port city of Nampo,
south-west of Pyongyang.
South Korean companies are interested in investing in North Korea because of
its skilled, but cheap, labour and its raw materials, including minerals
such as zinc. At present there is no South Korean investment in North Korea.
Daewoo has taken the lead in building contacts with the north over the Nampo
complex and Mr Kim Woo Choong, the Daewoo chairman, recently met Mr Kim in
Moscow to discuss construction of a natural gas pipeline from Russia Korea.
Samsung and Lucky-Goldstar have trade relations with North Korea and import
textiles and raw materials.
Hyundai's interest in North Korea has cooled following an aborted attempt to
forge economic ties in 1989 when Mr Chung Ju-yung, the Hyundai chairman,
visited Pyongyang. Plans for Hyundai to develop a holiday resort area and a
ship repair yard floundered after objections by Seoul. Hyundai also angered
North Korea by seeking timber concessions in the Russian Far East, also
sought by Pyongyang.
Despite the recent freeze on economic relations trade links between the two
countries, which were formalised in April 1991, increased by 31 per cent to
Dollars 106.9m (Pounds 55.9m) during the first half of 1992. All but Dollars
8.8m consisted of North Korean exports, largely fisheries products and raw
materials, such as minerals.
If the deadlock is resolved, the next likely goal will be the conclusion of
talks on double taxation and investment guarantees by North Korea.

FT  27 JUL 92 / Hurd to discuss China dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S foreign secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, arrived in Hong Kong yesterday
for a two-day visit expected to be dominated by a dispute between Britain
and China about how to finance a big new airport, and local demands for more
democracy.
On his arrival Mr Hurd said the dispute over the HKDollars 175.3bn (Pounds
11.6bn) airport would be solved within the framework agreed between Mr John
Major, the UK prime minister, and Mr Li Peng, his Chinese counterpart, in
Beijing last September.
That agreement was regarded at the time as a successful conclusion to two
years of often bitter talks. Mr Hurd said he did not know how long the
latest round of talks would take.
China has castigated the Hong Kong government for disclosing details of the
negotiations. It is concerned about the cost of the project and the
financial support which the government plans to make available to public
sector corporations constructing key projects.
But Hong Kong officials believe China's stated concerns are a cloak for
larger worries about the pace of democratic development in the colony. They
are also perturbed by the plans of Mr Chris Patten, the new governor, to
take his time and consult locally about political matters before he makes
any decisions.
Mr Patten seems determined not to be pushed into early decisions. He plans
to reshape his cabinet at about the time he opens the autumn session of the
local legislature on October 7. Last week he politely turned down an
invitation to visit Beijing and is not expected to go there until
mid-October.
Mr Hurd will meet representatives of the colony's political establishment
over the next two days. He is expected to face pressure over both the
airport and democracy.

Albanians went to the polls yesterday in the first local elections since the
anti-communist Democrats swept to power in national elections in March,
Reuter reports from Tirana. The mood in the Tirana was quiet despite a
heated pre-election campaign in which the key forces were the Democratic
party, which is the biggest anti-communist force, and the Socialist party,
the renamed communists.

ARAB states and Israel are expected to resume peace negotiations in asis
gton early next month after a meeting in Damascus of Arab foreign ministers
endorsed an early resumption, writes Tony Walker in Cairo.
Mr Farouk al-Shara, Syrian foreign minister, said Arabs were ready to resume
bilateral talks 'as soon as possible'. In Jerusalem, officials at Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin's office said they had not received any formal
invitation and expressed reservations about meeting at such an early date.
However, they indicated they would accept Washington as the venue for talks.
Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, had suggested talks should re-convene
on August 10.

FT  25 JUL 92 / UK Company News: In search of a more fruitful direction -
The reasons for the departure of the man who built Albert Fisher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Stephen Walls, the new non-executive chairman at Albert Fisher, calls it
a victory for corporate governance.
Mr Tony Millar, chairman and chief executive since he started to build the
fruit and vegetable producer in 1982, was not ousted on Thursday in a board
room coup by non-executive directors.
His departure had been agreed by the board to be in the best interests of
smooth transition to a new strategic direction.
But, however Mr Walls, himself ousted in May as chief executive of Arjo
Wiggins Appleton, the Franco-British papermaker, might choose to present the
departure of Mr Millar, Albert Fisher is still in deep trouble.
The company that grew through 50 acquisitions to be worth Pounds 784m at its
peak in March last year has joined a group of 1980s wonder stocks struggling
to prove they can cut the mustard in the altogether tougher 1990s.
Judging by Albert Fisher's share price, the jury is still out and not just
because Mr Millar's resignation was accompanied by no clearer idea about the
security of the dividend payment for the year to August 31.
Mr Walls was at pains yesterday to point out that while fresh produce prices
in Europe and North America had recently gone soggy, as indicated by the
company's profits warning earlier this month, there were no black holes in
the company and its overall trading remained in line with expectations.
At a much broader level, however, Albert Fisher is embarking on a
reassessment of its strategic direction under the board led by Mr Walls in a
non-executive capacity. But there are no clear ideas where it should or will
go.
Mr Walls insisted that with the appointment of new chief executives for the
European and North American operations, there was no immediate need for a
new chief executive until the board had taken a measured look at what to do
next.
The emphasis on management structure and long consideration before decisions
are taken is a break from Albert Fisher's explosive 1980s history.
Mr Millar came to Albert Fisher and fresh produce from the stable of Mr
Michael Ashcroft, the sometimes controversial and always colourful chairman
of ADT, the car auction and security group.
After three years under the Ashcroft wing and a six months search, Mr Millar
homed in on Albert Fisher, a company traded on the Liverpool and London
stock exchanges with sales of Pounds 7m, as a vehicle for his ambit-ions.
The fruit and vegetable industry, he realised, was fragmented among family
businesses which enjoyed neither economies of scale nor centralised
purchasing.
Through frequent issues of new shares - which many institutions now bleating
about the recent share performance were then perfectly happy to take up - Mr
Millar began to consolidate the industry. Having moved a long way along that
path in the UK, he started in 1985 to expand in Europe, based around the
Rotterdam markets, and then into the US.
Consolidation of the fragmented industry was followed by moves into frozen
food and food processing. In the peak of this heady growth, Albert Fisher
produced pre-tax profits of Pounds 89m last year on sales of over Pounds 1bn
but, gripped by its first real recession, the doubts were beginning to set
in about the quality of the acquisition-derived earnings.
After years of 20 per cent profits growth, Albert Fisher lost its following
and forecasts began to be scaled back. From Pounds 97m at the end of last
year, market expectations fell to Pounds 77m in April.
Then in early July, as the extent of the slump in fresh produce markets in
Europe and North America became apparent, forecasts slipped to Pounds 60m
following a profits warning that was accompanied by the statement that it
was 'inappropriate' to make any comment about the dividend.
Albert Fisher is not in as bad a shape as some of the other debt-financed
acquisitive growth companies of the 1980s. Thanks to the rump of an Pounds
180m rights issue in 1990 the group has a strong balance sheet and net cash
of Pounds 60m.
It leaves Mr Walls, at least, sanguine about the rethink and comfortable
with Mr Millar's departure. 'Companies change, markets evolve, opportunities
change,' he said. 'We have assessed the situation relative to external and
internal confidence (in Mr Millar) and decided that the best thing is to
have a change of management.'

FT  25 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Albert Fisher chief quits after 'pressure'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TONY MILLAR, who built Albert Fisher into an international fresh fruit
and vegetable company worth over Pounds 780m at its peak, yesterday resigned
as executive chairman following pressure from non-executive directors.
His departure, just more than 10 years after his acquisition of a small
Blackburn-based fruit and vegetable supplier, ends an era at one of the
acquisition-driven growth stocks of the 1980s.
Over the past year, the City has increasingly questioned Mr Millar's ability
to manage growth at a time of tough market conditions even before a profits
warning earlier this month.
Mr Stephen Walls, currently a non-executive director, will become
non-executive chairman while the board reviews the group's strategic
direction.
Mr Walls said that the management changes had been decided by the board,
including Mr Millar, after the non-executive directors had acted as
'catalysts' for the discussions.
The board had invited Mr Millar to become Honorary President as a tribute to
his 'vision and performance in creating the group'.
Albert Fisher's share price has fallen from a peak of 133p in March last
year to a low of 36 1/2 p earlier this week before recovering to 39p, where
it closed yesterday.
The profits warning was issued after June sales demonstrated that the price
of fresh produce in Europe and North America had collapsed due to a glut in
the market.
By that time analysts had already grown wary that the rapid 1980s growth
that was fuelled by a string of small acquisitions of family businesses, was
not sustainable in markets hit by recession.
Mr Walls yesterday repeated a reassurance that trading, though hit by low
fresh produce prices, remained in line with expectations and the balance
sheet placed the group in a strong position to take advantage of future
growth opportunities.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Travel group collapse hits 50,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT 50,000 people who booked holidays with coach tour operator Land Travel
have no prospect of recovering their money after the Bath-based company went
into liquidation yesterday and two of its top executives were arrested.
Last night, Avon and Somerset police said Mr Valere Tjolle, company
chairman, and Ms Theresa McDermott, company secretary, had been released on
bail without charge after helping with inquiries 'into allegations of
fraud'.
Another 2,500 people, already on holiday on the Continent, were last night
struggling to get back home in the wake of the collapse as it emerged that
Land Travel was not a member of the Association of British Travel Agents
(Abta) or of the Bus and Coach Council.
Customers, as a result, were not covered by any guarantee that they would
receive refunds or be brought back.
Liquidator Grant Thornton said it was already apparent that customers and
other creditors would not receive any payment from the company.
The Foreign Office said 106 coaches carrying Land Travel customers were
returning to the UK from Czechoslovakia, Austria, France, Germany, Spain,
Italy and the Netherlands. It said there was little likelihood of
holidaymakers being stranded.
However, British consulates on the Continent have been told to be ready to
deal with any tourists unable to return home.
The ferry companies P&amp;O and Sealink said they would ensure that all Land
Travel customers were able to cross the Channel to the UK even if they did
not have valid tickets.
Grant Thornton said that 140 full-time Land Travel employees and 200
part-time staff were made redundant yesterday.
The collapse of Land Travel follows warnings by tourist industry executives
that heavy discounting could lead to company failures during the summer.
Grant Thornton said that in one instance the company had offered a six-day
holiday in luxury accommodation in Paris for Pounds 59.
In a statement issued through the liquidator, Mr Tjolle said price-cutting
had been responsible for the company's collapse. 'Operating in a very
difficult market, we tried an ambitious price discounting strategy. Although
customers were delighted with the service and outstanding value for money
they were enjoying, unfortunately the dramatic increase in demand
over-extended our resources,' he said.
Travel industry officials said rumours about Land Travel's financial
stability had been circulating for months. Abta said it had been receiving
complaints for several weeks from customers whose holidays had been
cancelled shortly before departure. Abta told the customers it could take no
action as the company was not one of its members.
P&amp;O said it stopped taking Land Travel bookings more than six weeks ago.
Sealink began refusing bookings 10 days ago. The Advertising Standards
Authority said it first received complaints about Land Travel in 1988.
The collapse comes only three days after the government announced proposals
to protect buyers of land and sea-based package holidays.
Although all air charter passengers are protected by a bonding scheme
administered by the Civil Aviation Authority, many surface-based holidays
offer no money-back guarantee.
The government has proposed establishing a central reserve fund to ensure
that non-charter package tourists are protected.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Markets: First falls at the first hurdle - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
WHERE does National Savings go now that FIRST's interest rate is back among
equals? NS is not used to the harsh glare of political examination and it is
plain that its role needs to be reassessed.
Opinions vary on the reasons for this week's dramatic cut in the rate on
offer on the new FIRST Option bond from 7.75 per cent to 7.25 per cent net.
These can be divided into two camps - 'conspiracy' theorists and 'cock-up'
theorists.
Both are partly right.
The former would claim that the building societies conspired to blackmail
the government with their threats of raising mortgages. They had complained
loudly in advance. This might have been more from a wish to maintain profit
margins rather than the fear of outright losses.
Against this, the very large demand for the FIRST bond must have taken a
significant chunk out of the building societies' accounts.
Those who believe it was only a 'cock-up' by National Savings also have
plenty of ammunition. The official comment made at the FIRST launch that its
rate was competitive but 'not the best' proved to be wrong - no building
society product could match it, fixed over one year, for such a small
minimum investment.
And then there is the appalling way in which the interest rate was cut.
National Savings was within its rights to cut its rates with almost
immediate effect. But to do so with such unseemly haste on a Monday night,
while advertisements glowingly promoting the bond were only just off the
weekend presses, was an insult to investors.
Applicants whose forms were posted on Monday, but which did not arrive
before midday on Tuesday, must feel betrayed - even though they are not
obliged to take the lower rate now on offer, their hopes had been raised
cruelly.
Regular readers of these pages will know that National Savings has been
offering excellent products for some years. From the consumer's point of
view, it is impossible to object to this. National Savings must continue to
offer competitive rates of interest as the least risky investment for the
small saver.
But the government's savings department must show itself to be better
organised than it was this week if it is to avoid losing the confidence of
investors. And, following the cut in FIRST's interest rate, it also must
find another way of attracting funds.
To do this, it could overhaul another outpost of the National Savings empire
 -premium bonds. Established by Harold MacMillan in 1957, this odd lottery,
in which 6.5 per cent tax-free interest is distributed randomly, is now
creaking with age. Ernie - the Electronic Random Number Indicator Equipment
which picks the winning bond numbers - seems accident-prone.
Last month, we printed in the Briefcase column a letter from a reader who
had held the maximum Pounds 10,000 worth of bonds for two years - and had
not won a single prize.
We also printed National Savings' response: that he had been incredibly
unlucky, as he had 10 chances in 11 of winning a prize of some size each
month. NS went on to say that Ernie was still random.
This provoked a flood of letters from fellow disappointed bondholders, and
from statisticians explaining why this result proved either that Ernie was
not random or that there had been a human error within National Savings.
One reader said: 'Imagine the entire surface of the earth, including the
oceans, covered in sand to a depth of three inches. Every grain will win you
a prize, except one solitary grain. Your unfortunate correspondent seems to
have picked this one up.'
The case for replacing Ernie with a more up-to-date computer system is
strong.
The system for distributing prizes creaks similarly. At present, Pounds 9.5m
in premium bond prizes remain unclaimed. Admittedly this figure covers the
entire period of premium bonds' existence, which spreads back to 1957, but
it does not reflect well either on public enthusiasm for premium bonds or on
the effectiveness of those who run Ernie in getting prizes to their winners.
Plenty of premium bonds now lie mouldering under beds.
Ernie might need to retire - particularly as he will by 1994 face
competition from the national lottery, which could be a formidable rival.
More attractively, he could undergo a total facelift.
At the moment, premium bonds offer the chance of small prizes which barely
set the heart alight. Even the biggest prizes, one of Pounds 250,000 each
month and four of Pounds 100,000 weekly, barely compete with the football
pools. It might be better to continue to offer relatively poor interest
rates, (compared with the rest of the NS range), but make the system more of
a gamble by offering bigger single prizes.
There are strong arguments why premium bonds should offer more of a gamble
as they do not compete as investments. Children would be better off with
children's bonus bonds, while both the index-linked and fixed-interest
five-year issues offer far more security. Premium bonds can play a part in
the National Savings range only by offering the (slim) chance of winning
millions.
People who did not win a prize would have far less reason to feel aggrieved
than the people who posted their FIRST applications on Monday night.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Markets: No covering up the gloom - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEVER mind the occasional actress. Ministers would surely like a privacy law
which enabled them sometimes to draw a discreet veil over the state of the
British economy - and the stock market, when it gets into bearish mood.
Domestic unease about recovery, fuelled by falling overseas markets,
produced a grim week in the City.
Joining the ERM was meant to banish the term 'U-turn' from the lexicon of
economic policy. So, there was something both impressive and disquieting
about the speed with which the government backed down from its confrontation
with the building societies.
Cutting the interest rate offered by the new National Savings bond was
sufficient to prevent a rise in home loan rates - at least for the time
being - but the societies insisted that the government's growing appetite
for retail savings was keeping them under severe pressure.
The societies saw a net outflow of Pounds 314m from their savings deposits
in June, the worst monthly figure for six years.
A rise in mortgage rates would have dealt a blow to consumer confidence, on
which so many hopes of domestic recovery are now pinned. That could not be
contemplated, given that retail sales were on Wednesday revealed to have
fallen 0.2 per cent last month.
The government looks increasingly boxed-in. The longer recovery is delayed,
the more demands are made on public spending, with lower tax income and
higher unemployment costs.
Concern about the ballooning public deficit also puts pressure on the pound.
Such fears could be eased by increasing interest rates, but that itself
would further postpone any recovery.
The government sought on Wednesday to reassure the financial markets by
announcing a new policy which will keep the increase in public spending
below the expected level of economic growth.
Domestic concerns were not the whole story, however. Turmoil on the world's
currency markets started the ball rolling downwards on Monday, with the
European bourses showing their biggest one-day fall since the Moscow coup in
1991.
The chart shows that the FTSE-100 index has lost all its gains since the
election of April 9, but it also illustrates that London is by no means the
worst-performing market over that period.
A pattern of sorts emerged in the week, with 28-point falls in the FTSE-100
on Monday and Wednesday being redressed partly by bounces of just under 12
points on Tuesday and Thursday. But sentiment on Friday remained gloomy,
with the market closing down 22.3 points - a fall of 54.7 points on the week
as a whole.
Official intervention in global currency markets sought to check the rise of
the D-Mark and slide of the dollar, a battle which kept sterling mainly on
the sidelines. But Spain's increase of its interest rates on Thursday left
the UK as one of the few European countries which has not tightened monetary
policy in response to last week's rise in German interest rates.
That takes us back to the London market and its fear that the next move in
UK interest rates might be upwards, choking off any domestic recovery.
Messages on the recessionary front remain mixed, with gloom from retailers
and the Engineering Employers' Federation being offset by cautious optimism
from the British Chambers of Commerce.
Whenever recovery does come, it will be too late to save parts of Britain's
troubled machine tools industry. Matrix Churchill, a Midlands-based group,
went into receivership only days after Beaver Engineering Group, the
Norwich-based machine tool-maker.
Companies reporting this week were quizzed carefully over how they were
dealing with tough trading conditions. Reuters, a stock market star of the
1980s, was marked down savagely after the international informational and
news group accompanied a 10 per cent increase in profits with a cautious
statement on its outlook for revenue growth. The shares closed yesterday at
1011pp, down 153p on the week.
On the other hand, shares in Boots rose after the diversified retailing
group told its AGM that it was 'bucking the trend' and had increased sales
by 11 per cent since April.
SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-US drugs and consumer products group, once
again demonstrated the defensive strengths of pharmaceuticals by reporting a
10 per cent rise in pre-tax profits. That could bode well for Wellcome
Trust, the charity which is selling about half of its 73.5 per cent stake in
Wellcome, the drugs group. The strike price and allocation will be announced
on Monday.
The largest deal of the week came from British Airways which is paying
Dollars 750m for a stake in USAir, the sixth-biggest US airline, in a move
that will create the world's biggest airline alliance. BA, which was
privatised in 1987, has long sought a foothold in the lucrative North
American market.
The biggest concern for the market - and the government - is that economic
recovery, even when it comes, is likely to be very gradual. There is
certainly unlikely to be any marked turning point in the looming dog days of
August when low trading volumes and empty City offices can make for a
skittish trading climate.
On Monday, the prime minister repeated his commitment to staying in the ERM,
describing advocates of sterling's devaluation as 'pessimist and
defeatists.' This 'steady-as-she-goes' course might eventually steer the
economy into the safe haven of resumed growth with low inflation. But this
week's scrape with National Savings and unsettled international markets
demonstrate that reefs abound.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Smith unveils new-look team: Brown named shadow chancellor
as Blair takes home affairs portfolio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH unveiled his new-look shadow cabinet yesterday, leaving only
one member - Mr John Prescott - at his old post of transport at his own
request.
As expected, the younger generation has come to the fore with the
'modernisers' - the university-educated products of the post-war baby-boom -
finally coming of age at the expense of old-fashioned, blue-collar
Labourism.
The leader's two youthful heirs apparent - Mr Gordon Brown and Mr Tony Blair
 -topped the list, winning the shadow chancellorship and the home affairs
portfolio respectively.
One of the few remaining veterans, Mr Jack Cunningham, replaces Mr Gerald
Kaufman at foreign affairs. Mr Robin Cook, the leader's campaign manager,
moves up from health to shadow Mr Michael Heseltine at trade and industry.
Key jobs were also given to two of the five newcomers, with Ms Harriet
Harman taking over from deputy leader Mrs Margaret Beckett as shadow chief
secretary to the Treasury and Mr David Blunkett taking health.
Mrs Beckett succeeds Mr Cunningham as leader of the House and campaigns
co-ordinator.
Other women have also gained important appointments. Ms Marjorie Mowlam
joins the frontbench team with responsibility to track Mr William
Waldegrave's Citizen's Charter activities as well as covering Labour's
women's issues portfolio. Ms Ann Taylor takes education.
Mr Smith's opponent in the leadership race, Mr Bryan Gould, was appointed as
shadow to Mr David Mellor at the National Heritage department, the job he is
said to have sought.
Mr Frank Dobson, highly placed in the shadow cabinet poll, will attack the
government on employment.
In an unexpected move, the new leader has also split the functions of the
environment department, giving Mr Jack Straw the top job covering such
questions as local government and housing. Newcomer Mr Chris Smith takes on
the green issues of environmental protection.
Mr Tom Clarke, the last of the new faces, has surprised some by replacing Mr
Donald Dewar, who moves after nine years from Scottish affairs to social
security.
Analysts believe the most disappointed of the 18 elected will be Ms Ann
Clwyd and Mr Michael Meacher. Ms Clwyd, at Wales, was said to be hoping for
a high-profile department. Mr Meacher, until now social security, is charged
with overseas aid - covered by the government from the Lords by Baroness
Chalker.
Mr David Clark, until now agriculture, is to take on defence. Non-elected
shadow cabinet appointments are Mr Ron Davies at food, agriculture and rural
affairs, and Mr Kevin McNamara, who stays at Northern Ireland.
Junior appointments will be made early next week with the full shadow
cabinet due to meet for the first time on Wednesday.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Daimler Benz agrees Fokker deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE HAGUE, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DAIMLER BENZ, Germany's largest industrial group, is to take control of
Fokker, the Dutch aircraft maker, in a deal that could trigger a
restructuring of Europe's regional aircraft industry.
The successful end to four months of talks is likely to put pressure on
other manufacturers such as British Aerospace and Saab of Sweden to
accelerate their efforts to find partners. At least nine manufacturers are
chasing customers in an industry dogged by overcapacity.
The total value of the deal was not revealed yesterday, but Deutsche
Aerospace (Dasa), a Daimler Benz subsidiary, has previously said it
envisaged paying up to Fl 1bn (Pounds 312m) for the 51 per cent stake.
Dasa will take its stake in Fokker through a new holding company which will
buy the Dutch state's 32 per cent holding plus Fl 500m of new Fokker shares.
A 22 per cent stake in the holding company will be sold back to the Dutch
state, which will keep it for a maximum of three years.
The holding company will own 51 per cent of Fokker, with the remainder
continuing to be held by private and institutional shareholders.
Dasa is also expected to sell stakes in the holding company to its partners
in the Euroliner consortium, Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy.
Mr Koos Andriessen, the Dutch economic affairs minister, agreed the deal
yesterday evening after an emergency parliamentary committee meeting which
followed a marathon 20-hour negotiating session with the two companies'
chairmen.
The last obstacle was cleared when the Dutch government backed down over its
demand to remain a shareholder in the company until the turn of the century.
It will be entitled to appoint one member of Fokker's nine-member
supervisory board for the next eight years.
It also won guarantees that final assembly of aircraft will continue to take
place in the Netherlands.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Canadian helicopter order secures jobs for Westland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE SURVIVAL OF Westland, the UK's only helicopter maker, was secured beyond
the year 2000 yesterday with part of a CDollars 4.4bn (Pounds 1.94bn) order
from Canada for 50 marine helicopters.
Westland said last night that the jobs of its 6,000 workforce were safe as a
result of the deal. It would not, however, be recruiting new staff.
The deal will also boost the fortunes of Westland's Italian state-owned
partner, Agusta. The contract is worth about Pounds 500m to the two
companies over the next 13 years.
Weapons and other equipment will be supplied by a consortium led by Paramax,
a Canadian subsidiary of the US computer company Unisys. That contract is
worth USDollars 1.5bn (Pounds 780m).
Mr Alan Jones, Westland chief executive, said yesterday: 'This is the first
export order for the EH101. The Anglo-Italian partnership has been
strengthened by the Canadian involvement and it increases the prospects of
the EH101 becoming the standard aircraft across Nato.'
Other suppliers include: Canadian Marconi, a GEC subsidiary (logistics
support, analysis and electronic equipment); CAE Industries of Toronto
(simulators and electronics), Litton Industries (radar), and Lockheed
(electronic support equipment).
The Canadian department of national defence said yesterday that details of
the order were still under discussion and that it was not yet sure when a
firm contract would be signed.
It is only the second large order for the EH101.
The size of the order was a victory for the defence lobby in Ottawa. The
Canadian government's political opponents have argued that the purchase of
the military helicopters, originally required to hunt Soviet submarines, was
no longer necessary.
The deal is a blow to Boeing of the US, which had tried to persuade the
Canadian defence department to modernise its existing fleet of
search-and-rescue helicopters.
Westland said construction of the first helicopters should start in 1994,
with delivery to the north American companies for fitting out starting in
1996 and the aircraft going into service a year later.
The Westland-Agusta partnership is now hoping for 25 more orders from the
RAF and a similar sized order from the Netherlands.
The timing of the deal adds to its importance for the security of Agusta,
controlled by Efim, the Italian state industrial holding in the process of
voluntary liquidation.
It comes only a week after the Italian government decided to wind up Efim.
Last year Agusta had consolidated turnover of L672bn, debts of L2,000bn and
carried stocks of L1,700bn.

FT  25 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow ignores rare good news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stock markets ended a difficult week on a negative note yesterday, with
share prices finishing slightly lower in spite of some rare positive
economic news, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 4.33 at 3,285.71. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended a touch lower, down 0.48
at 411.60, while the Amex composite closed 0.03 higher at 382.53 and the
Nasdaq composite 0.38 firmer at 565.62. Turnover on the NYSE was 165m
shares.
Overnight losses on foreign markets, notably Tokyo and London, set the tone
for a downbeat opening in New York. Concern that the US might have to lead
the UN in military action against Iraq added to the market's gloom.
The only bright spot on the horizon was the announcement from the Commerce
department that factory orders for durable goods rose by 2.3 per cent in
June, a bigger than expected increase.
On their own, however, the durable goods figures (which some analysts
believe volatile and unreliable as economic indicators) were unable to give
the market much of a boost, and share prices struggled to make any gains
amid quiet trading.
Among individual stocks, profit-taking was the order of the day in the banks
sector, despite the strong performance registered by most of the country's
banks in the second quar ter. Chemical, which said yesterday that it was on
target to reduce payrolls by 6,200 over the coming year, did best, rising
Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 34 1/4 .
In contrast, Citicorp dropped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 19 3/4 , Chase
Manhattan fell Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 25, BankAmerica lost Dollars 7/8 to
Dollars 43 3/4 and Wells Fargo gave up Dollars 1 at Dollars 68 5/8 .
Frank B Hall plunged Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 2 7/8 after the company agreed
to sell much of its operating assets to Aon for Dollars 475m in cash and
stock. The news left Aon Dollars 3 lower Dollars 45 1/2 .
Great Lakes Chemical firmed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 62 1/8 after the
company said its Octel Associates subsidiary was implementing price
increases on its line of alkyl-based fuel additives.
W R Grace firmed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 35 7/8 after Salomon Brothers, the
Wall Street securities house, raised its rating of the stock from a 'hold'
to a 'buy' and predicted that the shares would benefit from the recovery in
quarterly earnings from a disappointing opening three months.
McDonald's rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 43 7/8 in heavy trading as bargain
buyers moved into the stock after Thursday's earnings-inspired losses.
Canada
TORONTO stocks coasted to a lower close as traders abandoned the market
early.
Weakness overseas and poor second-quarter earnings in Canada sent shares
lower in the opening minutes, but the market quickly settled into a tight
range. The TSE 300 closed down 11.37 at 3,400.87. Declines led advances 293
to 232 on very slow volume of 20.0 million shares.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Cocoa market in better
heart
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COCOA market ended the week in good heart after negotiations on a new
international market agreement ended in Geneva yesterday with delegates
expressing mild optimism about the prospects for accord between producing
and consuming members being reached at the next round of talks in November.
No attempt was made to disguise the paucity of concrete progress at the
three-week session of the International Cocoa Organisation, which was
meeting under the auspices of the UN Committee on Trade and Development. At
the final session, producer and consumer delegates highlighted differences
over price support targets, limits on amounts withheld from the market and
financing.
But there appeared to be a feeling that the way had been prepared for more
positive progress. 'In the next round of talks on November 2-13, it should
be possible to complete our work and have an agreement which is acceptable
to both producers and consumers,' said Mr Jan van Sluisveld, the consumer
spokesman.
Market reaction to such limited progress was understandably muted - the
September delivery cocoa price at the London Futures and Options Exchange
rose Pounds 13 yesterday to Pounds 612 a tonne. But that was up Pounds 13 on
the week and Pounds 57 above Tuesday's low in a continuation of last week's
setback.
The rally had initially owed more to the absence of producer selling than to
buying interest, and it was fed by the triggering of stop-loss selling
orders. In the background, however, was concern over a strike by Ghanaian
cocoa workers and dry weather in Cote d'Ivoire, the biggest producer.
At the London Metal Exchange, all base metals contracts were ahead on the
week until most suffered setbacks yesterday. But aluminium defied a further
large rise in exchange warehouse stocks to move on to a 3 1/2 -month high
with an Dollars 11.50 rise to Dollars 1,337.50 in the cash position, up
Dollars 28 on the week.
Dealers said yesterday's rise resulted mainly from speculative activity,
fuelled by the operation of stop-loss buying orders.
Zinc had a volatile week after being unsettled by Monday's announcement that
the London Metal Exchange was again monitoring the market closely because of
concern about a developing technical supply squeeze. The cash price
fluctuated in a Dollars 40 range a tonne before closing yesterday at Dollars
1,340.50 a tonne, down Dollars 9 on the day and up Dollars 2 on the week.
The mid-week rise to Dollars 1,362.50 a tonne led to increased pressure for
the LME take action to head off the squeeze, as it did in similar
circumstances last month. On that occasion it set a limit on the one-day
'backwardation' (cash premium) but so far the renewed squeeze has not moved
the market out of the normal 'contango' situation, where the cash price is
at a discount to forward positions. The present squeeze, like the last, has
been attributed to producer support operations, which some traders allege
are 'concerted'.
Signs of a developing supply squeeze also lifted prices on the lead market,
where the cash position reached a 12-month peak of Pounds 348.50 a tonne.
This was linked to nervousness about the expiry of the labour contract at
Cominco's Trail smelter in Canada at the end of September. Reports of
Chinese buying were also supporting the lead market in mid-week. By
yesterday's close the cash price had retreated to Pounds 342 a tonne, but
that was still Pounds 17.50 up on the week.
Last week's sell-off in the tin market continued on Monday, when the cash
price dipped to Dollars 6,710 a tonne, as reports from Kuala Lumpur that the
Chinese had sold as much as 5,000 tonnes following the preceding run up
continued to affect sentiment. But later talk of Chinese shipment delay's
contributed to a strong rally that left the cash position Dollars 197.50 up
on the week at Dollars 7,015 a tonne, despite being trimmed by Dollars 105 a
tonne yesterday.
The platinum market ended a hectic week little changed. Concern over the
South African situation pushed it up to Dollars 390.75 a troy ounce at one
stage, but that faded in mid-week and the downward reaction was accelerated
by the announcement of the invention of another palladium-based car exhaust
catalyst, although the threat to platinum's dominant share of the catalyst
market was played down. The price dipped to Dollars 377.25 an ounce but at
yesterday's fixing was back to Dollars 38035 an ounce, down Dollars 3.15 on
the week.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Money Markets: Calm end to week
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Calm returned to both the sterling cash and futures markets yesterday after
the pound consolidated its position on the foreign exchanges and the Bank of
England was accomodating with a large shortage.
After a turbulent week in the cash markets, dominated by fears of an
imminent rise in Germany's Lombard rate, money market operators had a
relaxed day. Several of the German states released sharply reduced inflation
figures, suggesting that next week's German cost-of-living figure for July
will be down 1 per cent to 3.3 per cent. That eased fears of an interest
rate increase when the Bundesbank council meets on August 6.
Sterling also firmed on the foreign exchanges, rising more than 1 1/2
pfennigs. The Bank of England added to the cheer by being very accomodating
in its money market intervention, forecasting a shortage of Pounds 1.55bn
but inviting offers in the early round and having most of the shortage taken
out at that stage.
Period rates in the cash market, if not bullish, were at least a bit softer.
At the end of the day, 1 month money was offered  1/8 per cent cheaper from
its previous close, at 10 1/8 per cent. Three-month money was  1/16 per cent
softer at 10 5/16 per cent. There was also a slight softening at the long
end of the yield curve, with 1-year money dropping back to 10 1/4 per cent
from 10 3/8 per cent the night before.
Futures trading was easier. The September contract closed up 4 basis points
from its previous finish at 89.76. However, this was far from bullish,
bearing in mind that the September contract has been up at 90.25 since base
rates dropped to 10 per cent.
Both the futures and cash rates are still pricing in a  1/4 per cent rise in
base rate, and the mood in the market remains tense. But the feeling is
widespread that sterling may have a respite for the next few weeks.
In early operations, the Bank purchased Pounds 136m of Band 1 treasury
bills, Pounds 423m of Band 1 bank bills and Pounds 344m of Band 2 bank bills
at 9 7/8 per cent, and Pounds 400m in a repo repayable on 11 and 12 August
at 9 15/16 per cent. The shortage was later revised to Pounds 1.5bn. In the
afternoon, the Bank purchased Pounds 30m of Band 1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per
cent and provided late assistance of Pounds 90m.

FT  25 JUL 92 / International Company News: Jefferson Smurfitt US interests
in refinancing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US interests of Jefferson Smurfit, which were the subject of a complex
Dollars 2.9bn leveraged buy-out in 1989, are being refinanced via a Dollars
400m equity investment.
Jefferson, the large Irish paper and packaging group, combined its main US
paper and paperboard interests in a highly leveraged deal three years ago.
This deal involved the acquisition of Container Corporation of America
(CCA), a paperboard company Jefferson had bought in the mid-1980s, and
Jefferson Smurfit Corporation (JSC), its St Louis-based subsidiary, by a
leveraged buy-out vehicle called SIBV/MS Holdings.
SIBV/MS Holdings, in turn, was - and is - 50 per cent cent-owned by
Jefferson Smurfit, and 50 per cent by an investor group led by Morgan
Stanley, the US investment bank. The LBO deal netted Jefferson Smurfit some
Dollars 1bn in cash, and transformed its balance sheet.
According to yesterday's announcement, 'certain' existing shareholders in
JSC and CCA have agreed on the principal terms of new Dollars 400m equity
investment in the US operation. The investment will be made partly in cash,
and partly via the conversion next year of JSC's outstanding preferred
stock.
About Dollars 200m of JSC's subordinated debt will be bought back at a
premium, and new Dollars 400m bank facility, underwritten by Chemical Bank
and Bankers Trust, will be provided. Proceeds of that facility will be used
to prepay part of the US operations' present bank facility.
JSC confirmed that Jefferson Smurfit will put up its full Dollars 200m share
of the equity investment. However, because it owns all the outstanding
preferred stock which will convert, its cash commitment will be only
approximately Dollars 35m.
Completion of the deal is subject to the negotiation of a definitive
agreement.

FT  25 JUL 92 / A desperate call to order: As Clinton surges ahead in the
polls, Jurek Martin looks at the collapse of morale in the Bush camp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What a difference a week can make in politics. Seven days ago, a successful
Democratic party convention in New York could not dispel the prevalent sense
that this presidential election was still as much George Bush's to lose as
it was Bill Clinton's to win. Now the feeling is that the governor of
Arkansas is going to have to screw things up very badly (or be screwed by a
ruthless negative campaign) not to end up in the White House.
Three factors lie behind the changed perception. First, the polls put Mr
Clinton 20-30 points ahead of Mr Bush nationally, the biggest convention
'bounce' in history. They show that supporters of Ross Perot, the defunct
independent candidate, much prefer Mr Clinton's newly refined semi-populist
message of change. Some state surveys now find Mr Bush weaker than
anticipated west of the Mississippi, where he stood to gain most from Mr
Perot's withdrawal.
Second, Mr Clinton and Senator Al Gore, his running mate, embarked on a
1,000-mile bus odyssey through small towns from New York to St Louis that
drew fabulous crowds and rave political reviews. The ticket looked sharp,
impressive in its youthful energy, consistent in its themes.
Comparisons were drawn with Harry Truman's 'whistle stop' train tours of
1948 by those not old enough to remember them.
But finally, and potentially far exceeding any ephemeral qualities in the
first two, Bush had a truly terrible week, unsure of himself and looking
ratty and his age. The return of James Baker from the State Department to
run the White House and the campaign next month was suddenly seen not merely
as desirable but as the last, perhaps only, hope of salvaging re-election.
As pundit after pundit pontificated, the problem was no longer
Vice-President Dan Quayle (though he is not an asset when matched against Mr
Gore), no longer the faltering economy (though, as Alan Greenspan, the Fed's
chairman, implied, it is unlikely to come good enough to benefit Mr Bush
greatly by November), no longer the defiance of Saddam Hussein or the
tragedy of what was Yugoslavia (though both undermine the president's record
in foreign policy). The problem, put simply, is George Bush himself.
He did campaign this week, contrary to his promise to keep his powder dry
until the convention in Houston next month. Two excursions were disastrous.
In New Jersey, he got plain wrong his own education grant proposal for the
less well-off; in a Washington suburb he was impaled, in front of the
cameras, by a local teacher complaining of his distortions of traditional
family values.
He had a crack at Mr Clinton's economic policies, which should have been
fruitful because it is not clear how his opponent would simultaneously
finance his investment programme and reduce the budget deficit. But Mr Bush
could only warn yet again of the dangers of 'liberal' and 'tax and spend'
Democrats running the country.
That worked in the Reagan campaigns and still had mileage in 1988. But the
economy is now Mr Bush's responsibility and sloughing the blame for its
plight on congressional Democrats does not suggest a way out of the impasse.
Ross Perot is not the only American to believe it would help to have the
president and the Congress working together for a change - and it is a stone
cold certainty that the Democrats will still be running Capitol Hill after
November.
Other atmospherics around the president were also depressed. The White House
had to fight off endless rumours that Mr Bush was unwell (or that Barbara
Bush or Marilyn Quayle were ailing.) Some Republicans in Congress, led by
the acerbic Senator Alan Simpson of Wyoming, said they might not even go to
Houston. Jack Kemp, the housing secretary and once again, with the Los
Angeles riots a fading memory, semi-detached from the government, let it be
known that he was proposing to be in Colorado since no speaking slot had
been assigned to him.
The 'dump Quayle' movement, possibly artfully stoked from a distance by Mr
Baker, gathered such force that Mr Bush was obliged to state that his
vice-president's future was 'certain,' whatever that meant, and Mr Quayle to
declare that he would step aside if he thought he was hurting his president.
He may have then done precisely that by getting into a public disagreement
with his wife over what to advise their daughter if she were unmarried and
pregnant. Mr Quayle, sounding like a father and not an anti-abortion zealot,
said he would support any decision she took; Mrs Quayle, who has strong
opinions on many things, stated flatly any baby would be carried to term.
Even Mr Clinton sounded sorry for the vice-president.
But to dispose of him for anyone other than General Colin Powell, chairman
of the joint chiefs and, never forget, a black, would smack of desperation.
Other good candidates exist - Dick Cheney, the secretary of defence, Senator
Phil Gramm of Texas, Governor Pete Wilson of California, even, improbably,
Mr Kemp - but all are potential rivals of Mr Baker, whose own longer-term
ambitions can probably best be served by the return of Mr Bush and Mr Quayle
in tandem, unless he runs the campaign himself from second slot on the
ticket. But this would make Mr Bush too obviously a puppet and is probably
too crude a ploy for a man of Mr Baker's sophistication.
Foreign policy offered no relief, apart from Mr Baker's satisfactory
sessions in Israel. Saddam Hussein presents Mr Bush with a very real
dilemma. Military action against Iraq might be seen as too transparent an
attempt to boost domestic political popularity, whereas failure to do so
could be taken as a further abdication of US leadership. The fear of
Americans coming home in body bags or civilian targets bombed in error is
also real.
Mr Clinton's own warning to Saddam Hussein was both statesmanlike and
designed to minimise any advantages accruing to Mr Bush should air strikes
be launched. He was also quick to insert the knife with his comment that the
imminent transfer of Mr Baker ('the best we've got') showed that Mr Bush
cared less about foreign policy than about re-election.
Mr Baker is also not inheriting the best campaign team in the business. Lee
Atwater, the hard-nosed tactical foil to his own strategic sense in 1988, is
dead. Sam Skinner is considered to be out of his political depth as White
House chief of staff: Rich Bond, Republican party chairman, compares poorly
with Ron Brown, his Democratic counterpart; Clayton Yuetter, domestic policy
adviser, still has his heart more in trade and agriculture; Robert Teeter,
nominal co-chairman with Mr Skinner, is perhaps too easy with Bush.
It goes beyond mere personalities. The Quayle team of conservatives is never
averse to leaking its disaffected thoughts to the media, while others in the
Republican party are pursuing separate agendas, including their own
re-elections. The calls this week for Mr Bush to ditch his economic policy
team - Nicholas Brady, the treasury secretary, and Richard Darman, the
budget director - came from one, or both, of these quarters.
Thus Mr Baker has to impose order where it is lacking. But mostly he somehow
has to take Mr Bush in hand and give shape and purpose to his re-election
effort. The way things went this week, he will find the Middle East a
cakewalk in comparison.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Unit trust funds drop to Pounds 57bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FUNDS under management in unit trusts dropped last month to Pounds 57bn
after breaking the Pounds 60bn barrier in May.
This was in spite of an increase in net sales of unit trust personal equity
plans (Peps) to Pounds 336.4m in the second quarter, pushing the value of
unit trust Pep funds over the Pounds 2bn mark to Pounds 2.4bn.
But unit trusts last month experienced their first outflow since February,
with sales exceeding purchases by Pounds 23.5m. Total sales last month were
Pounds 617.4m, a big drop on the previous month and on the Pounds 1bn
achieved in April.
However, net inflows in the second quarter of the year, at Pounds 463.8m,
far exceeded the Pounds 255.8m achieved in the first quarter and represented
one of the highest quarterly sales since 1989.
Inflows into unit trust Peps were aided in the second quarter by the change
to Pep rules in the Budget. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, announced that
Pounds 6,000 could be invested in a unit or investment trust Pep from the
start of the 1992-93 tax year. The previous limit had been Pounds 3,000.
Mr Philip Warland, director-general of the Unit Trust Association said: 'The
sales of Peps are a quite remarkable achievement in a personal savings
market which saw outflows from building societies and the great attraction
of National Savings.'

FT  25 JUL 92 / Minister signals survival of education authorities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CLEAR signal that the government does not intend to announce the demise of
elected local education authorities (LEAs) in next week's education white
paper was given yesterday by Baroness Blatch, the schools minister.
Instead, it seems that councils are to be allowed to survive as education
authorities so long as they are responsive to local demands. However, the
government still hopes to increase the number of schools opting out of local
authority control, resulting in many authorities losing their direct
managerial function.
The abolition of LEAs is known to have been one of the options considered by
the government, and councils will greet the news with relief.
'If they are to remain players, local authorities will need increasingly to
recognise the position of schools and parents as consumers,' Baroness Blatch
said at the Council of Local Education Authorities' conference in Blackpool.
She singled out the new regime for inspecting schools as one in which local
education authorities could play a constructive role.
'LEAs will be able to play a part if they are willing to meet the necessary
standards of inspection,' she said. 'I expect many will do so. There is
clear evidence that at least some authorities are recognising the
imperatives of greater competition and are implementing changes to the way
they deliver services.'
She also highlighted the monitoring of assessment standards in primary
schools. 'If LEAs are to retain this role, they will need to demonstrated
that they are committed and competent.'
Mr Jack Straw, the outgoing shadow education secretary, told the conference:
'If local education authorities did not exist, they would have to be
reinvented, even if the model used was a far less accountable one.'
Baroness Blatch implicitly rejected plans put forward by the teachers' pay
review body last week for performance pay based on bonuses for staff in
high-achieving schools.
She said: 'Incentives should be there not only for the successful teacher,
but also for the teacher who is striving to maintain standards in a school
which overall is just ticking over or even failing.'

FT  25 JUL 92 / Tax demand work may go to tender
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government is considering contracting out computer processing work on
taxpayers' confidential files as part of a drive to transfer as much Civil
Service work as possible to the private sector.
The Inland Revenue said yesterday it was exploring 'the feasibility of a
contractual partnership with one or possibly two major private sector
computer organisations' to process tax demands.
'No decisions will be taken unless it can be demonstrated that the highest
quality service and the best value for money is provided,' the Revenue said.
It stressed that the organisation would remain responsible for preserving
data secrecy.
IBM, ICL, Computer Sciences Corporation, Digital Equipment Corporation and
Electronic Data Systems have been approached, and discussions should be
concluded in the autumn.
The move brought immediate condemnation from the Inland Revenue Staff
Federation on the grounds that it could endanger the confidentiality of
taxpayers.
Mr Clive Brooke, federation general secretary, appealed for 'this dangerous

The contracting out of public sector jobsis part of a drive to put Civil
Service work out to competitive tender. Departments have been asked to list
activities that could be included in the initiative, known as market
testing.
A white paper suggested that market testing could save as much as 25 per
cent of the Pounds 20bn total of central government annual costs.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Police probe firm censured by regulator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLICE are investigating the affairs of Lovell, a private client
stockbroking firm based in Newcastle upon Tyne which dealt in securities and
traded options, it was disclosed yesterday.
The move follows an inquiry into the firm by the Securities and Futures
Association which yesterday announced it was finally expelling Lovell from
its membership on the grounds it was no longer fit and proper to carry out
investment business.
The inquiries by the Northumbria police fraud squad are focusing on the
withdrawal of funds from the clients' bank account to buy a financial
services company.
Two directors of the firm, Mr Thomas Lovell, the chairman, and Mr John
Hickey, the compliance and finance director, have already been severely
reprimanded by the SFA over the withdrawals, which abused its Client Money
Regulations.
Earlier this month, the SFA reprimanded Mr Lovell and Mr Hickey, along with
Mr Robert Foster-Moore, the traded options director, and Mr Richard Hexton,
an options dealer, for dealing in traded option contracts for clients
without having reasonable cause to believe the contracts were suitable.
The SFA also found that Mr Hexton, Mr Hickey and Mr Foster-Moore had issued
a misleading advertisement to induce prospective clients to invest.
Lovell was wound up in the High Court in October 1990 after being suspended
by The Securities Association for failing to meet capital adequacy
requirements.
Since then investors have been paid more than Pounds 650,000 from the
Investors Compensation Scheme.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Judge blocks Lonrho action
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ACTION for damages in the High Court by Lonrho, the international trading
group, and Mr Tiny Rowland, its chief executive, was yesterday ordered to be
struck out. The action alleged a 'dirty tricks' campaign by the Fayed
brothers during the row over the ownership of Harrods, the London department
store,
'I fail to see why such a public, unpleasant and vitriolic vendetta should
be allowed to be aired in court,' Mr Justice Macpherson said. He described
the action, launched last year, as another round in the 'prolonged public
warfare with no holds barred' over the Fayeds' acquisition of the House of
Fraser stores group.
If the action were allowed to go ahead it would inevitably involve raking
over the whole dispute with 'mud slung in all directions', the judge added.
Lonrho and Mr Rowland were ordered to pay the costs of House of Fraser's
application to have the action struck out. Lonrho was refused leave to
appeal but its lawyers said later there were good grounds for appeal and
that further moves would be considered.
The action sought damages and an injunction in respect of an alleged
conspiracy by brothers Mr Mohammed and Mr Ali Fayed to injure Lonrho and Mr
Rowland.
The judge said that, over the past six years, Lonrho and Mr Rowland had been
intent on discrediting the Fayeds and had spared no expense. But the Fayeds
themselves were not 'lily white' and were prepared to 'descend to the depths
of vulgarity'.
The judge said he was 'sceptical' of Lonrho's claim for damages and 'even
more sceptical' of its claim for an injunction. Neither remedy was likely to
be available to the company.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Rivals mourn loss of Beaver: It did all the right things but
still went under
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LITTLE more than 11 weeks ago, Mr Tony Balding was greeting visitors to the
Beaver Engineering stand at Birmingham's Mach'92 machine-tool show with a
smile, a cup of coffee, and an enthusiasm for his products that is typical
of the devoted family businessman.
This week the devotion was still there but it was a little harder to smile.
On Wednesday Mr Balding signed on at Norwich Jobcentre, a week after being
declared redundant by administrative receivers.
Mr Balding is now the ex-managing director of Beaver, one of the most
innovative of Britain's machine-tool companies, and is wondering what to do
with himself.
It has been a grim fortnight for the machine-tool industry. The Beaver
receivership was followed on Thursday by news that Matrix Churchill, the
Midlands-based producer, had called in receivers.
The fears expressed by industry leaders - that some companies are being kept
afloat only by the goodwill of their banks - are proving correct. The
problem is that the support is now being withdrawn.
Something about the Beaver receivership seems to have touched a chord in an
industry that is becoming exasperated by its failure to get the message
about its importance across to the government. 'It's terrible news,' says
one machine-tool builder. 'Beaver has done all the right things, but the
orders weren't there.'
Those outside the industry might wonder about the fuss over the receivership
of a company whose workforce never reached 300, and whose peak annual sales
were just Pounds 11.5m.
The simple answer is that in the 41 years since it was founded by Mr
Balding's father Victor Beaver,it has become a beacon of excellence that
even its rivals say deserves to stay alight.
But there is a more complex answer. Beaver may be small but its collapse
raises some big issues - the future of small-scale entrepreneurialism in
competitive global markets, the attitude of banks and the government to
industry, the decline of Britain's manufacturing base - and, ultimately, the
UK's future as a serous participant in the world machine-tool industry.
Beaver produced its first machine tool in 1954 and is no stranger to
challenges. In 1978 when Mr Balding visited a Chicago show with his father,
they discovered the Japanese were selling 'bed-type' machines - heavier,
more rigid and more accurate than Beaver's 'knee-type' range  - and for the
same price. 'We recognised the implications,' Mr Balding recalls. 'We either
had to accept the challenge or get out.' Beaver took the plunge, introducing
models just as the UK went into the 1980-81 recession. The initiative saved
the company as other UK machine-tool makers - notably the former world
leader Alfred Herbert - went under.
In the 1980s, Beaver did all that the Thatcher government was urging
industry to do, raising quality, boosting exports and developing new
products. But, says Mr Balding: 'We did all this because it was the obvious
thing to do, not because they told us to.'
In the boom of the mid-1980s the company expanded, opening factories in
Peterborough and Halesworth, Suffolk. By mid-1989 it had 289 employees and a
respected range of computer numerically controlled lathes and machining
centres.
Then everything went wrong. Orders dried up and the new factories had to be
closed. But it has been a very different recession this time, says Mr
Balding. The UK customer base has contracted by a third in 15 years, yet
foreign competition in the UK market has intensified.
For Mr Balding, the support that foreign competitors have received to carry
them through the recession has given them a crucial advantage. 'One way or
another, funds are being made available. Many large Japanese companies have
more than 1,000 machines in stock and one questions whether they are all
funded from their own resources.
'When we went into receivership we had 10 machines in stock. If the funds
had been made available to produce 60 machines for stock, we would have been
able to run that business at break-even for at least the next 12 months.'
However, Beaver's bank facility expired on July 3, and National Westminster
Bank refused to renew it. Beaver did not have enough cash to carry it
through the lean summer months, and after a last frantic search to find a
partner, Mr Balding had no option but to ask for administrative receivers to
be appointed.
With the benefit of hindsight, he says he might have done things
differently. The company probably stayed too long in family ownership and
probably spent too much time and money developing its range when it should
have been looking for an additional business leg or finding a new owner.
Ideally, he says, Beaver should have become part of a larger group while
simultaneously preserving its entrepreneurialism. Failing that, only a big
boost to UK demand could have preserved Beaver in Balding family ownership.
Looking back over the past few weeks, Mr Balding says: 'I have no reason to
feel bitter, but I feel terribly empty, and a great sense of loss.'
He does not blame NatWest - the banks have a job to do, he says, which is to
make sure their money is safe - but believes neither the banks nor the
government understand the industry.
He criticises the government both for cutting back on the support for
research and development that helped Beaver fend off the Japanese 10 years
ago, and for the high interest-rate policy of 1989 and 1990 which sucked the
working capital out of the company, leaving it unable to afford a
restructuring plan.
Ironically, the plan that was vetoed by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the bank's
supervising accountant, is being used by its Cork Gully insolvency arm. It
is a painful strategy, involving ending parts and components manufacturing,
and concentrating on design, development and service and assembly.
A total of 80 jobs have already gone, but the plan might be the only chance
to preserve something from the debacle. Yesterday, Mr Mark Shires, a
principal at Cork Gully in Norwich, said an advertisement in Tuesday's
Financial Times had prompted a number of inquiries, and Beaver had also
secured new orders in the past week.
Mr Balding naturally hopes the company will survive - and not simply because
the family are the main creditors. 'It would be nice to see the business
continue in some form, with a new owner to carry it forward.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRICES paid for plasterboard, one of the most basic building materials, are
expected to rise by nearly 10 per cent following a restructuring of list
prices and discounts by BPB Industries, which supplies about 65 per cent of
plasterboard sold in Britain.
This marks the end of a three-way price war between BPB, Lafarge Coppee of
France and Knauf of Germany. BPB says a decline in list prices will be more
than offset by reductions in discounts.
Sales prices, after allowing for lower discounts, are expected to rise on
average by nearly 10 per cent. This follows a price rise of about 4 per
cent, after discounts announced earlier this year by Knauf.
BPB's share price rose 9p to 144p after it announced the price changes.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Major insists Mellor will stay
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRIME minister yes-terday reaffirmed his support for Mr David Mellor,
the national heritage secretary, insisting that he would remain at his post.
Mr John Major said: 'David Mellor is very well qualified to deal with that
job. He is doing it extremely well. He is going to go on doing it.'
It was the first endorsement in public by Mr Major of the heritage secretary
since newspaper revelations last Sunday of Mr Mellor's alleged relationship
with a 31-year-old actress.
Mr Mellor yesterday won the backing of Mr Rocco Forte, chief executive of
the Forte hotels and restaurants group. Mr Forte, who is also president of
the British Hospitality Association, which represents hoteliers,
restaurateurs and caterers, said: 'It would be a tragedy for the country to
lose his services at this time'. Mr Mellor had already proved himself an
affective advocate of the tourist industry.
Mr Bryan Gould, appointed yesterday as shadow heritage secretary, said: 'The
current furore about ministers' sex lives should not let the British press
off the hook.
'Ownership is too concentrated, the tabloid press is heavily slanted to the
right and ordinary people are too often the victims of sensationalist
reporting.'

FT  25 JUL 92 / Halt is called in Ecu bond market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MARKET in Ecu bonds, one of Europe's fastest-growing financial markets,
virtually seized up yesterday as the latest victim of the stresses within
the exchange rate mechanism, Richard Waters writes.
An official halt was called as banks that deal in the market were excused
the obligation to quote buy and sell bond prices to each other. The Bank of
England and the French Treasury, both of which have raised substantial sums
by issuing Ecu bonds, called meetings with marketmakers to try to restore
some confidence.
The suspension of normal trading demonstrates how little confidence
financial markets now have that European economic and monetary union will be
achieved. There has been heavy selling of Ecu bonds since the Danes voted to
reject the Maastricht treaty with selling intensifying after Germany raised
its discount rate a week ago.
ISMA, the body which oversees the international bond markets, said it
believed marketmaking would resume on Monday. Dealers reported that
investors were still able to deal with marketmakers yesterday.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Anger flares on rundown urban estates: The background to the
summer riots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NO police officer has been injured in Hillfields, Coventry, in the past
week. No police vehicle has been damaged. Such forebearance from the more
aggressive residents is unusual.
Outwardly this inner-city district with its high-rise flats and small
council houses is calm. Certainly policemen are out on the beat as normal,
but there are suggestions of in-fighting among the district's drug barons
and there is fear among the peaceable. 'I wouldn't go out on the streets at
night on my own,' says Ms Pauline Jacques, who chairs The Chantries Tenants
and Residents Association.
Hillfields, just north of the city centre, was one of the two Coventry
districts where youths clashed with police in May in a series of
disturbances which proved to be the start of a summer season of unrest in
British cities from Bristol in the south to Stockton-on-Tees in the north.
The districts have in common unemployment and deprivation. Hillfields,
together with its northern neighbour, Foles-hill, were the subject of
Coventry's abortive bid for extra government funding through City Challenge,
the scheme run by the Department of Environment to encourage towns and
cities to compete for finance for urban redevelopment and regeneration
projects.
The two districts have the highest unemployment in Coventry. The rate in St
Michaels, a ward of Hillfields, is 28.3 per cent while in Foleshill it is
24.7 per cent. Male unemployment is respectively 34.9 and 29.3 per cent and
rising. Recession is trapping the skilled and unskilled alike in districts
where housing is poor, crime is high and the industrial infrastructure is
crumbling.
Local resources to combat the rise in unemployment are running out. Mr
Davinder Panesar, training and development manager at the Indian Community
Centre in Foleshill, says: 'Every day we will have several dozen people who
are made redundant and have basic skills. The training provision is full.
Even middle management is being made redundant. There is no hope of a job
unless you buck up your skills and go into something new.'
Ms Jacques, who herself is unemployed, adds: 'I don't honestly know where
people would start in finding jobs. There isn't anything.'
For the black population of Hillfields and Foleshill, the situation is more
complicated than simply being the result of the recession. Coventry's City
Challenge document noted that 'nearly half the population of the area are
black. They have particular needs and experience problems of discrimination
and racism.'
Employment prospects among ethnic minorities are being undermined by racism,
says Ms Julia Sudbury, co-ordinator of the Osaba Women's Centre, an
Afro-Caribbean group. 'There is racism in training and education, there is
discrimination at the point of recruitment.' Poverty exacerbates communal
unease.
Cahan, a local group set up to combat racial harassment, said it had
received five complaints of harassment on Friday last week alone.
Mr Panesar observes that many in the Asian community of Foleshill had 'a
rural background in Pakistan', had been in unskilled work and had not needed
to know English.
She says: 'Their skills are not relevant to the UK and its culture.' Such
disadvantages mean that 'for them to be in the mainstream, they have to have
something extra'.
The City Challenge bid for Pounds 37.5m over five years was a means of
providing that 'something extra'. Based on four flagship projects, it sought
to create jobs and provide the training so that those jobs could be filled
by Hillfields and Foleshill residents while, in the background, smaller
grassroots schemes would tackle other problems.
The government's refusal last week to support the bid left Coventry City
Council angry. The reasons for refusal, Mr Brian Clack, the leader, told the
environment department, were 'spurious'. He said the reasons were an attempt
to justify 'what is clearly a decision to favour other authorities on party
political grounds'. But it also left the council with a serious financial
problem.
Its sources of funding for Hillfields and Foleshill are narrowing. Mr John
Fletcher, deputy leader of the city council, says that the government's
decision this week to rein in public spending means, that 'we're in for a
really hard time'.
The authority made its own budget cuts for this year to avoid capping. Next
year it will have to cut at least a further Pounds 3m from its overall
spending. Its capital spending is in any case constrained.
But it is also receiving less from the government's Urban Programme, which
provides regeneration funds for 57 local authorities. Funding this year of
Pounds 4.6m, most of which was spent on Hillfields and Fole-shill, was down
10 per cent on 1990-91. Next year's spending is likely to be in the region
of Pounds 4m. The more the government spends on City Challenge, the less it
has for other Urban Programme activities.
Since 1987, the government's Task Force, a series of inter-departmental
teams helping to revive local economies, has spent Pounds 13.1m - Pounds
6.4m from its own budget with the rest coming from other sources  - in
Hillfields and Foleshill.
But the Task Force is being withdrawn next March. Although it leaves a
legacy of training programmes and an enterprise fund which in five years has
helped 190 young businesses and created about 460 jobs, community leaders
are bitter about its departure.
Mr Fletcher says he wonders why aid is leaving when the problems have not.
MORE THAN 60 people were arrested during a further night of disturbances in
three northern towns on Thursday.
In a second evening of trouble in Blackburn, Lancashire, 40 people were
arrested after rival groups of youths turned against the police. About 3,000
youths had been on the streets at one time, police said, and 51 petrol bombs
had been found.
In Burnley, Lancashire, 22 people were arrested in a fifth night of
disturbances on the Stoops estate. Police said that fewer than 50 youths
were now thought to be responsible for the continuing violence.
In Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, police officers were pelted with stones and
petrol bombs on the Brackenhall estate in the early hours of yesterday.
Firefighters were also pelted with bottles and stones during the unrest,
which lasted for 3 1/2 hours in spite of pleas from community leaders for
peace on the estate. A police officer was treated in hospital but there were
no arrests.
There has been unrest in eight towns since the early summer.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Treasury fears tax fall-off will push up PSBR
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAGGING tax receipts from company profits are likely to push government
borrowing above official forecasts over the next few years, the Treasury has
indicated.
The admission comes in an article published today in the Treasury Bulletin.
It says corporation tax revenues will be depressed by special factors as
economic activity eventually picks up.
Since recovery has failed to occur in the way expected by the Treasury in
its latest published forecasts, the article adds up to a warning that the
Treasury's projections for the public sector borrowing requirement will
almost certainly be exceeded.
The warning about company taxes - which grew strongly in the late 1980s and
last year accounted for 11 per cent of all tax receipts - comes in the same
week as the Treasury announced tough controls on government spending in
order to rein in rises in the PSBR.
But even with the benefit of cuts in government programmes - likely to total
some Pounds 13bn between 1994 and 1996 - the PSBR is expected to climb above
forecast levels because of revenue shortfalls linked to the recession.
In the March Budget, the Treasury forecast a borrowing requirement of Pounds
28bn this year and Pounds 32bn in 1993-94. Some City economists estimate the
figures at Pounds 32bn and Pounds 41bn respectively.
The Treasury says in the bulletin that once the economy recovers from
recession 'the cyclical rise in receipts (from corporation taxes) will be
less vigorous than that seen in the period up to 1989-90'.
Special factors which the Treasury reckons will dampen growth in these taxes
once the economy recovers include the historically low rate of corporation
tax because of recent fiscal changes.
Companies will also be able to cut tax payments by claiming relief in areas
such debt payments, capital spending and previous financial losses.
Corporation tax receipts, which fell from Pounds 20.5bn in 1990-91 to Pounds
18.3bn last year, are now projected by the Treasury to total Pounds 15.9bn
in 1992-93. This figure is Pounds 0.9bn lower than the corresponding
forecast in the March Budget.
The Treasury's last published forecast in March projects a 'real rate of
return' for companies - a measure of profitability - of about 7 per cent
this year after 6 per cent last year.
But with the economy growing more slowly than the Treasury predicted, the
profits growth may be reined back, eating into the tax take.
Protectionist trade policies add up to a tax on consumers which cost Pounds
12bn in 1990, or Pounds 16 a week for a family of four, according to another
article in the bulletin.
The article says a successful conclusion to the Uruguay round of world trade
talks could bring these costs down.
Treasury Bulletin, Summer 1992. Published three times a year, Pounds 6.80,
available from HMSO.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Debate by Labour to focus on structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN a third of the 459 resolutions tabled for Labour's annual
conference focus on the party's organisation and administration, it emerged
yesterday.
The concentration on internal affairs, taking up 154 resolutions, is a
direct consequence of the post mortem now under way on why the party
suffered such a heavy defeat in the general election. Policy issues are less
heavily discussed.
But the resolution document, published yesterday, also shows evidence of the
predominance of advocates of party modernisation and their determination to
push ahead with further changes.
As promised, the AEEU, the union formed by the merger of the EETPU
electricians' union with the AEU engineering union, has tabled a motion
demanding the immediate introduction of a one-member, one-vote system for
the selection of party candidates.
Other features of the document are a newly emphatic stress on the importance
of 'green' issues and a lengthy section on the media, with many resolutions
urging the party to adopt new techniques such as telephone canvassing aimed
at 'bypassing' Conservative-dominated newspapers.
While there are still many clearly leftwing motions, there are also several
suggesting that Labour must move further towards the Conservatives, with one
suggesting that opposition to compulsory competitive tendering must be
dropped.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Customers and staff stranded: Holidaymakers come to terms
with Land Travel collapse - ASA issued five reports over 12 months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM LAWRENCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SPECTACULAR collapse of Land Travel has stranded employees and
holidaymakers alike.
Inside the company's Churchill House offices in Dorchester Street, Bath, 130
staff - some dressed in black ties after being warned of the impending doom
 -were told they no longer had jobs.
Outside the offices a crowd of holidaymakers was left to consider that they
not only had no holidays but also little chance of getting their money back.
Meanwhile the collapse prompted a flood of horror stories from disgruntled
customers, while abroad others were coming to terms with finding themselves
stranded, or at the mercy of coach and ferry operators.
Among the luckier ones were seven coachloads of Land Travel customers who
arrived at the Euro Disney resort outside Paris yesterday morning. They were
allowed in even though they did not all have valid entry tickets. Euro
Disney reported that the coaches were still waiting at the gates for them
late yesterday evening.
About 80 Land Travel customers had arrived at the park two weeks ago without
valid tickets, according to Euro Disney. On that occasion Euro Disney gave
complimentary entry tickets to about 20 of the customers.
Mrs Phyllis Pratt, of Corsham, Wilts, was one Land Travel customer enticed
by the cut-price holidays. She booked a four-day coach trip to Holland
costing Pounds 100, including travel and hotel accommodation.
She said that she was let down on two separate occasions at short notice.
Land Travel had cited coach problems as the cause for the cancellations.
Mrs Pratt added: 'They treated me extremely shabbily. I always got the
impression they were holding something back. It was such a disappointment
because I was looking forward to a holiday to help me get over losing my
husband.'
Among the anxious customers waiting at the company's offices after doors
were locked at 9.45 am yesterday was Mr Alex Fleming, a social club
organiser from Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, who had booked a Pounds 4,960
seven-day trip to Spain for himself and 21 family and friends, which was
cancelled on Thursday.
He said: 'We are absolutely sick. I was hoping that by coming down here this
morning I could get some sort of reimbursement so that I could arrange
another holiday. But I've been told we've lost everything.'
Mr Judah Duiker and Mrs Meikie Duiker travelled 250 miles from York to claim
money for a holiday to Rome which was cancelled at the last minute on
Thursday. The couple left empty handed.
Mr Duiker said: 'We have been in Britain for two years and we wanted to see
as much of Europe as possible. We have lost money in terms of paying almost
Pounds 100 for visas to enter France and Italy and Pounds 176 on the
holiday.'
Before the police and liquidators moved in Land Travel offered a range of
cut-price European holidays, including three nights in Paris or Brussels at
Pounds 49, 10 days in Poland at Pounds 159 and tours to the Austrian lakes,
Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, Prague and the Black Forest for less than
Pounds 150. A week in Costa Brava at Christmas cost Pounds 150 and a week in
Rome over the new year was priced at Pounds 104.
Avon and Somerset police said they had received a number of complaints over
a period regarding Land Travel.
Company records reveal that Land Travel has been in financial trouble for
some time.
Mr Don Foster, MP for Bath, demanded an inquiry into Land Travel and called
for new laws to make tour operators produce evidence of confirmed bookings.
He said: 'There ought to be government health warnings on package holidays
that are not covered by the Association of British Travel Agents.'
Mr Foster added: 'In spite of everything the message has not been getting
through. Of course you are free to make your own choice, but if you do not
go with an Abta company, you must beware of the consequences.' He said he
would investigate claims that Land Travel holiday packages were insured. 'It
is unclear who was covering them and what the back up was.'

FT  25 JUL 92 / Complaints made about adverts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Advertising Standards Authority said yesterday that it started receiving
complaints from the public about Land Travel in 1988. Most of the complaints
concerned advertisements in the regional press and in brochures in travel
agencies.
Ms Caroline Crawford of the authority said: 'There have not been a massive
amount of complaints but over the last 12 months we have published five
reports on Land Travel, upholding complaints - which is above average for a
travel company.'
The authority has one complaint against Land Travel still under
consideration. All complaints against the company to the authority have been
upheld.
The main complaints concerned the company's alleged failure to abide by
stated tour itineraries. For instance, one trip to Czechoslovakia and
Austria allegedly listed visits to Prague, Krakow and mountain castles but
did not go to any of those places.
Another trip, a coach tour to the Rhineland, said 'go and see Cologne's
beautiful cathedral' but the coach allegedly drove straight through Cologne
without stopping.
Ms Crawford said: 'We found that Land Travel did in fact amend
advertisements when we asked them but they were perhaps not careful enough
that, at the time of going to press, their advertised itineraries were
accurate.'
The authority can issue warnings to the media which go to all advertising
sales departments, requesting the media to seek its advice before accepting
advertisements from troublesome companies.
However, the authority does not disclose whether or not it takes such action
against particular companies.
A further sanction which the authority can invoke is a referral to the
Office of Fair Trading - however there was no such referral in the case of
Land Travel.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Iranians to be deported as 'national security' threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN yesterday announced it was deporting three Iranians, two of them
locally engaged embassy officials, for reasons of 'national security' in a
move that marks a further deterioration in relations between London and
Tehran.
The deportation order for the three men follows the announcement by the
Iranian government earlier this week that it was expelling Mr Geoffrey
Brammer, a British diplomat, for 'acts violating diplomatic norms'.
The Foreign Office said last night that yesterday's deportation order
followed 'painstaking investigations' into the activities of the three
Iranians which predated Iran's move against Mr Brammer.
The investigations, believed to have involved the Special Branch and MI5,
focused on the alleged intelligence activities of the three Iranians among
the political dissident community. At least one of the Iranians is thought
to have been involving in tracking Mr Salman Rushdie, who is under an
Iranian death threat because of his book The Satanic Verses.
UK officials played down reports that the three Iranians had got as far as
plotting to assassinate Mr Rushdie, and there was no confirmation that one
of the Iranians had been spotted at one of the author's public engagements.
But friends of the author on the Rushdie Defence Committee said that
yesterday's move was a 'further indication of the close connection between
planned terrorist acts and the Iranian government', and showed that the
death threat was still hanging over Mr Rushdie.
One of the Iranians is Mr Mehdi Sayed Sadeghi, who worked in the embassy's
passport section. Another is Mr Mahmoud Medhi Soltani, who was in the
embassy's public-relations department.
Neither was accredited as a diplomat, and Mr Sadeghi is believed to have
been working without necessary immigration papers.
Officials in the UK could provide few details about the third Iranian, Mr
Gassem Vakhshiteh, who had been living in Britain as a student.
Last night an Iranian embassy official, who refused to identify himself,
accused Britain of taking 'tit-for-tat action'. He described the allegations
against two members of the embassy staff as 'absolute nonsense'. He said
that the student had arrived in the UK last autumn, but that the embassy had
had no contact with him.
Until recently UK officials hoped that relations with Iran were improving,
particularly after Tehran helped in securing the release of British hostages
held in Beirut.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN emergency meeting convened by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister,
yesterday failed to bolster the Tokyo stock market, which plunged 3.4 per
cent to 15,497.79, a six-year low, and appeared likely to fall further next
week.
Reports of the unprecedented meeting had encouraged the market on Thursday,
but prices fell yesterday after it became clear that the government would
simply restate the intention to stimulate the economy later this year with a
supplementary budget.
Mr Miyazawa's statement appeared to confirm earlier comments by finance
ministry officials that the government would not actively intervene in the
market in spite of widespread fears of further falls in the Nikkei stock
average in coming days.
After the meeting, Mr Miyazawa announced that an official large-scale
supplementary budget would be decided by mid-September. As for support for
the market, the meeting failed to come up with specific measures, and the
cabinet and leaders of the ruling Liberal Democratic agreed to meet again
next Tuesday.
Most investors consider the government's move as a 'gesture' indicating
concern before tomorrow's upper house elections. Other market participants
pointed out that it would take more than lip service to help share prices.
'The market is in a worse condition than the government probably assesses,'
said Mr Hiromichi Ishikawa, managing director at Yamaichi Securities.
'Measures which require the market to wait for the effects are not good
enough,' he added.
Bearishness over the economy in the past week has been cited for the
faltering stock market. The Bank of Japan indicated that the recovery it had
forecast for the autumn would be delayed and that the economy was still in a
'severe adjustment phase'.
The central bank's assessment was supported yesterday by the release of June
chain store sales figures showing the first decline in five years, with a
1.1 per cent year-on-year fall. Department store figures for June saw a
fourth consecutive decline, falling 3.7 per cent from the previous year.

THE UNITED Nations secretary general, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, last night
proposed a greatly expanded international peacemaking and relief role in
Somalia, where famine and civil war have claimed thousands of lives, writes
Michael Littlejohns, UN Correspondent in New York.
His written recommendations to the Security Council followed remarks in
which he contrasted its preoccupation with Yugoslavia against minimal UN
involvement in Somalia, although casualties in both places were comparable.
He proposed a consolidated UN operation in four zones for humanitarian
relief, ceasefire monitoring, security, demobilisation and disarmament and
the promotion of national reconciliation.

A ROW between the United Nations Security Council and Mr Boutros Boutros
Ghali, the secretary-general, over peacekeeping in Bosnia-Hercegovina was
resolved last night after long private consultations.
Having decided a week ago that the UN should supervise the collection of
heavy weapons from each side in the Bosnian conflict, the council accepted
Mr Boutros Ghali's objections that conditions did not yet exist for the
operation.
The council invited him to contact all member states, particularly in
Europe, to get personnel, equipment and logistic support for such an
operation. He could then undertake 'the further preparatory work needed' for
the supervision.
The EC has also been invited to co-operate more closely with the
secretary-general in an effort to resolve the Yugoslav conflict. In a report
to the council on Wednesday he said the supervision plan approved in the
recent London agreement had been adopted without consulting him and that, in
effect, the EC tail was trying to wag the UN dog.
The Community has been asked to consider broadening and intensifying the
conference on Yugoslavia to help the search for peace.
A UN recovery team yesterday reached a UN relief convoy which was stranded
for 24 hours in a Bosnian minefield and both were on the move to safety,
officials told Reuter in Sarajevo.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FORMER French junior health minister, Mr Edmond Herve, told a Paris court
yesterday he knew in June 1985 that blood stocks being used in transfusions
were contaminated with the Aids virus.
He said, however, that he had followed the unanimous advice of experts in
allowing blood stocks to be used for a transitional period before blood
Aids activists are pictured left outside the court brandishing red-daubed
portraits of Fabius and Mitterrand
disinfected by heating became available.
Mr Herve appeared as a witness in the trial of four former senior health
officials charged with allowing blood to be used for transfusions which they
knew to be infected with the Aids virus.
Mr Laurent Fabius, first secretary of the socialist party and prime minister
at the time the victims were given their transfusions, told the court he
'was never made aware of heat treatments'. At the time he had seen the need
to act rapidly on Aids. 'As soon as the scientific elements were gathered, I
decided for obligatory testing,' he said. 'It was my function as prime
minister.'
It is not yet known exactly how many people contracted the Aids virus in
France after receiving contaminated blood. At least 1,200 haemophiliacs have
already had the virus and more than 250 have died.
The lawyers representing the victims claim that the final tally of sufferers
will run to several thousand.
The four health officials on trial have been accused of using the blood even
though they were aware that disinfection techniques were available and that
Aids-free supplies were available from other countries.

FRANCE slipped into a trading deficit of FFr951m (Pounds 97m) last month
after five months of trade surpluses, writes Alice Rawsthorn. So far this
year French companies have benefited from buoyant exports which have helped
to shelter them from the sluggish state of the domestic market.
The value of French exports rose to FFr106.4bn last month from FFr103.4bn in
May. However imports rose at a faster rate to FFr107.4bn in June from
FFr99.3bn in the preceding month thereby pushing the trade account into the
red.
Despite last month's deficit, France recorded a healthy trading surplus of
FFr16.6bn in the first half of this year.

ARAB foreign ministers meeting in Damascus have described as 'ambiguous'
moves by the new Israeli government to curb settlement activity in the
occupied territories. But officials at the meeting, convened by Syria to
plan tactics for the next round of Middle East talks, were expected to agree
to the session going ahead, perhaps as soon as next month in Washington.
Briefing reporters after discussions involving representatives of Lebanon,
Syria and a joint Jordanian-Palestinian team, Mr Farouk al-Shara, the Syrian
foreign minister, said steps taken by the new government of Mr Yitzhak Rabin
had not provided the 'minimum level required to push forward the peace
process'.
Israel's Arab neighbours, including the Palestinians, are demanding that it
freeze all settlement activity, and reaffirm its commitment to negotiate
within a framework of United Nations resolutions that call for withdrawal
from land occupied in the 1967 war.
Arab and Israeli participants in the US-sponsored peace negotiations
launched in Madrid last October will decide soon whether to bring forward
the sixth round of peace talks, originally scheduled to be held in Rome in
September.
Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, who concluded a Middle East tour in
Saudi Arabia yesterday, pressed the Arabs and Israel to resume talking
quickly to capitalise on improved prospects for peace following the defeat
of the hardline Shamir government.
In Damascus yesterday, Palestinian delegates from the occupied territories,
led by Dr Haider Abdel-Shafi, joined Palestine Liberation Organisation
officials in the discussions. The previous Israeli government had banned
contacts between Palestinians in the territories and the PLO. Mr Rabin has
indicated greater flexibility.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US-Canadian beer war came to a head yesterday when the two countries
slapped a 50 per cent duty on some imports of each other's beer.
The US accounted for the first round by imposing the duty on imports of beer
brewed or bottled in Ontario in retaliation for alleged 'discriminatory'
practices against American beer.
It is the first time the US has imposed sanctions against an individual
state or province in a trade dispute. Molson and Labatt, two large Ontario
brewers, are expected to suffer the most severe damage.
Not to be left lagging, Canada quickly responded with its own 50 per cent
tax on imports of some American beers into Ontario.
The US has already twice taken its complaints on beer to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) and won panel rulings.
Canada has its own complaints against the US, but US officials estimate the
damages incurred by American brewers at Dollars 80m compared with Dollars 5m
in damages inflicted by US practices.
Deadlines set in US trade law forced the US to act now - even though it is
the eve of sensitive trade talks.
Senior officials of the US, Canada and Mexico are to get together in Mexico
City today to try to wrap up final details in the formation of the proposed
North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta).
Clearly US officials hope to contain damage to the Nafta talks by limiting
sanctions to Ontario.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Iraq military sites 'poor target'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEMOLITION of Iraq's military sites since the end of the Gulf war has
been so great that they are not worthwhile targets for any military action
by the United Nations, according to Mr David Kay, former head of one of the
UN inspection teams in Iraq.
Mr Kay said last night that almost all the installations in Iraq's huge
secret nuclear weapons programme had been demolished by UN teams. Last
September, in an episode that foreshadowed this month's impasse outside the
Agriculture Ministry, his team camped for five days in the car park of the
Baghdad Defence Ministry until they were allowed to take away documents.
Al-Tuwaitha, the main nuclear research centre south of Baghdad 'has been
taken to bits' and al-Atheer, the main weapons design and testing centre,
'has now completely gone', he said.
Al-Shakat and Tarmiya, two sites north of Baghdad used to produce enriched
uranium, necessary for nuclear weapons, had also been demolished, and there
was one building left at al-Farat, which had produced enrichment equipment.
UN inspectors, who were astonished at the scale of the nuclear research
programme they uncovered, concluded that Iraq could have been within a year
of producing a weapon when the war started. There is no evidence that it had
yet built a workable weapon.
Mr Kay, who is now director-general of the Uranium Institute in London, said
he did not believe the UN would target chemical weapons sites around Mosul
in the north of the country in any strike as they were due to be dismantled
anyway in September.
'The weapons there are already leaking, there is already a risk to the
inspectors, and if they bombed those sites no-one could go near them.'
However, he said that industrial and military installations around Tikrit,
President Saddam Hussein's home town north-west of Baghdad, might still be
considered a target, and that there was still a large military base around
Falluja, west of Baghdad.

<TEXT>
A WRANGLE broke out yesterday between Citibank and Standard Chartered in the
latest twist in Bombay's Rs35bn (Pounds 625m) financial scandal.
Standard Chartered has sent a written demand through its solicitors to
Citibank in Bombay, claiming that the American bank owes it more than Rs900m
over two securities transactions. Informal talks between the two banks have
failed to resolve the issue.
Citibank claimed yesterday it 'did not owe Standard Chartered anything' and
was not the only bank to have received such letters from Standard Chartered.
A Citibank vice-president in Bombay said it had proof that it had cleared
all dues pertaining to the two transactions cited in the letter  - one
relating to the sale of bonds issued by the government-owned Indian Railway
Finance Corporation, the other to government bonds.
A Standard Chartered spokesman said 'there were numerous grey areas' between
the banks. However, he insisted 'there has been a warm sense of co-operation
between the foreign banks' since the financial scandal broke, and said that
'no court case had yet been initiated' on any transaction.
The scandal, which emanated from the market for bankers' receipts, has
proved a serious embarrassment to the Indian government.
India's leading foreign banks were thrust to the forefront of the affair
earlier this month when a central bank report claimed that controversial
securities market trading had been concentrated in their hands and in those
of four brokers now under arrest.
The central bank ordered a special audit of Citibank, Standard Chartered,
Bank of America and ANZ Grindlays.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Russians say still more nuclear arms can be cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER cuts in strategic nuclear missiles are possible beyond those already
agreed between the US and Russia, but future negotiations must include the
UK, France and China, General Pavel Grachev, Russian defence minister, said
yesterday.
He was speaking at the Royal United Services Institute at the end of a
four-day visit to London. He said Russian scientists had estimated that cuts
below the 3,000-3,500 on each side agreed between the US and Russia this
year were possible, on condition that the anti-ballistic missile treaty of
1972, which laid down strict guidelines on the deployment of defences
against offensive nuclear missiles, was observed.
If such cuts were to become a reality, however, Gen Grachev said weapons
outside the US and Russia, would have to be considered.
'In our view, subsequent reduction of strategic offensive weapons should be
considered as a multilateral process, and should consider the
inter-relationship between cuts already made by the US and Russia, and
weapons in Great Britain, France and China,' he said.
Without the participation of these countries, Gen Grachev suggested,
'further reduction of nuclear weapons will become a destabilising factor not
only for Russia, but for the whole world.'
Gen Grachev said that Russia, which decided in May to set up its own
national armed forces, no longer regarded any state in the world as its
enemy.
Russia has agreed to become a founding member of a consortium to build a
pipeline to transport oil from the Caspian sea region to world markets,
joining Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, and the Sultanate of Oman. Oman will arrange
financing for the project, expected to cost between Dollars 700m and Pounds
1.5bn depending on choice of routes.

indeed fall at the onset of the world recession, but recently the market has
shown surprising resilience.
The turnover of the Paris couture houses remained stable at Pounds 32m last
year, according to the Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne. This
compares with an overall decline of 10 per cent in sales of French designer
fashion during 1991.
The nouveau riche customers who treated themselves to couture in the
mid-1980s - on the back of success in the stock and property markets -
stopped spending when those markets collapsed in the late 1980s. But the
Paris houses have been left with a small, solid base of loyal customers
armed with old money.
Despite this resilience, couture is still a loss-making venture, governed by
arcane rules. The Chambre Syndicale regulates the number of styles each
house must show and the seamstresses they should employ under rules dating
back to the late 1940s.
The Paris houses continue with their loss-making couture businesses because
of the publicity they attract for the perfume, sunglasses and cheaper
fashion lines with which they really make money. There will be 750
journalists and 400 photographers covering the current couture collections.
Such an enormous media presence has encouraged other designers, who do not
show under the auspices of the Chambre Syndicale, to stage events in Paris
at the same time as the official collections. The first couture show this
weekend will be that of Gianni Versace, the flamboyant Milan designer who is
not a Chambre Syndicale member.
Such unofficial events, combined with the financial problems of some smaller
couture houses, have prompted the French government to review the Chambre
Syndicale's rules. The review should be completed by the end of this year.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Bush heckled as Indochina adds to woes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday morning rounded off a difficult political
week by finding himself in a public shouting match with families of
Americans taken prisoner or missing in action in Indochina.
He was confronted by hecklers yelling 'release all files' and 'tell the
truth,' and was forced to break off prepared remarks designed to follow up
his order to the Pentagon to make public documents relating to the fate of
the 2,266 Americans still unaccounted for in the Vietnam war.
After five minutes, during which he exchanged heated remarks with an
organisers of the meeting, Mr Bush returned to the microphone to defend his
record. At one stage he was again interrupted and angrily shouted back:
'Will you please shut up and sit down.' It was 'simply, totally unfair' to
suggest he had suppressed information on missing servicemen.
Mr Bush also denied he had been party to the alleged scheme by the
Reagan-Bush campaign in 1980 to delay release of the US hostages in Iran
until after the election. 'What kind of allegation is that to make against a
patriot?' he declared.
The Iran connection also reared its potentially embarrassing head with the
opening prosecution statement yesterday in the trial of Mr Clair George, the
senior Central Intelligence Agency official charged with complicity in the
Iran-Contra affair.
Mr Craig Gillen, prosecuting attorney, said he would prove there was a
'massive cover-up' involving the CIA and other organs of government to
conceal Lt Col Oliver North's operation, run from the White House, to
resupply Nicaraguan rebels with proceeds of clandestine arms sales to Iran.
Mr Caspar Weinberger, former defence secretary, has been indicted on
separate Iran-Contra charges. Mr Gillen previously said he expected other
prosecutions of members of the Reagan administration, in which Mr Bush, a
former CIA chief, served as vice president.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Iraq may yield to UN probe: Military strike threatened
unless Baghdad allows weapons inspection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IRAQ made a conciliatory gesture in its tussle with the United Nations over
weapons inspections last night, as the US, Britain and France were on the
verge of giving Baghdad an ultimatum threatening military action.
Iraq's UN ambassador said he 'got the impression' Baghdad would give a 'very
positive' response today to compromise proposals from the UN on how to carry
out the inspections.
The apparent climb-down came as the western powers prepared a formal
ultimatum, warning that Iraq faces a military strike unless it allows UN
inspectors access to its weapons of mass destruction programme.
Baghdad has been refusing to let an inspection team into an agriculture
ministry building which the UN believes has documents about Iraq's nuclear
programme and possibly about chemical weapons.
As the crisis neared a climax, President George Bush yesterday cancelled
plans to be away from Washington at the weekend. He had planned to stay at
his holiday home in Kennebunkport, Maine. But instead he will meet top
national security advisers today at the presidential retreat of Camp David,
near Washington.
US officials earlier confirmed that the ultimatum - possibly issued in the
name of the UN secretary-general or Security Council but open to others to
join - might come this weekend and could require Iraqi compliance within a
matter of days.
Though confirming moves to draw up an ultimatum, British officials in London
warned against assuming that military action was a foregone conclusion. They
felt there was a reasonable chance President Saddam Hussein would 'blink'
once he understood the western powers were serious in threatening force.
Mr Rolf Ekeus, head of the UN inspection commission, appeared hopeful last
night the crisis might be resolved without military measures, following two
rounds of talks in New York with Dr Abdul Amir al-Anbari, the Iraqi delegate
to the UN.
Apparently signalling a shift in attitudes, Mr al-Anbari said: 'My feeling
is that the crisis will be solved in a satisfactory way - to the
satisfaction of the UN and the Iraqi government.' After speaking by
telephone to an unnamed minister in Baghdad, he said he would have Iraq's
response by today to proposals put by Mr Ekeus. 'I got the impression that
will be very positive,' he said.
Military contingency plans are a close secret, but it is assumed US, British
and French aircraft would lead any renewed bombing of Iraqi targets. The
Pentagon said there were 21,000 US servicemen in the Gulf area, mostly
aboard 17 warships.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Wellcome worldwide share issue set to meet target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WELLCOME TRUST, the UK medical charity, last night appeared to have met its
target of selling more than half of its 73.5 per cent stake in Wellcome, the
drugs group.
The issue, concluded in spite of adverse market conditions, would be the
largest non-privatisation secondary offer ever achieved.
Robert Fleming, the merchant bank handling the global share sale, is
understood to have received offers for more than 360m shares at a price
above 800p. The trust has indicated it wanted to sell about 330m shares.
Wellcome's shares fell 4p to 826p. The shares are likely to be offered at a
small discount close to the 800p floor set by the trust.
Demand in the UK and the US is understood to have strengthened considerably
in the past few days and to have exceeded targets. In the UK, applications
for about 200m shares may have been received against a target of 150m. US
applications are thought to total 80m-100m against a target of 80m.
The Japanese syndicate, led by Nikko Securities and Nomura Securities, is
expected to have received applications for nearly 20m shares against a
target of 25m. The poor state of the Japanese equity market has made it
difficult to release funds.
Demand from continental Europe has been poor, while Canada has been
particularly disappointing. The UK retail offer received applications about
Pounds 100m of stock, less than the Pounds 180m set aside, representing 15m
shares against a target of 20m. The scale of the offer and the strike price
will be decided by Mr Roger Gibbs, trust chairman. A decision will be made
by Sunday when allocations will be made.
The seven non-UK regional syndicates will fly to London for meetings with
Fleming today. Allocations will be decided by the level of bids and their
timing as well as their quality. The trust and company are anxious for an
orderly after-market and will allocate shares to those appearing most
willing to keep them.
Fleming is also understood to be anxious to punish those who drove the
company's share price down in the weeks before the offer by refusing them
shares.
The trust and its advisers have maintained a 'green-shoe' option which
allows Fleming to buy back shares for the trust from the market if it
considers there has been over-allocation.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Weekend Interview: The man who paints like Michelangelo -
Gianluigi Colalucci is tackling the art world's greatest challenge:
restoring the Sistine Chapel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOETHE claimed that only by seeing the Sistine Chapel with Michelangelo's
frescos could one have a complete understanding of what a single man can
achieve.
Few have a greater understanding of the achievements of this man than
Professor Gianluigi Colalucci. He has been in charge of the painstaking task
of restoring these frescos in the Vatican from the moment the first
experiments were carried out on an area the size of a postage stamp 12 years
ago.
The complexity and sheer scale of dealing with Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel
ceiling and the wall, with the gigantic composition of the 'Last Judgement',
has made it one of the most remarkable acts of modern restoration.
Ironically, the work of cleaning and restoration, together with pauses to
assess progress, has taken longer than the combined time Michelangelo took
to paint the frescos. The ceiling with the famous central depiction of the
creation was painted from 1508-12; while the turbulent 'Last Judgement' was
begun 22 years later and completed in 1541.
Restoration is in its final phase and the magnificently fresh colours - Prof
Colalucci's critics say too fresh - of the ceiling can be seen by all. On a
scaffold behind a white net at the far end of the chapel, the team is now
working on the surface of 'The Last Judgement'.
'I deliberately left this until the end as it the most complex part of the
whole restoration', says Colalucci. Pope Paul IV dismissed 'The Last
Judgement' as a 'stew of nudes' and outrage over the nudity of the figures
led breeches and loincloths to be painted over some of the figures. At one
stage the entire fresco was nearly white-washed.
Working so close to Michelangelo, does he feel the presence of the genius?
'Ah, yes' he sighs deeply.
He is familiar with every brush stroke. 'I've known him for so long . . .
even before I started this project, when I first came to work at the Vatican
(in 1960) I was given the task every year of dusting the Judgement. Even
then I was taking photographs, trying to understand his extraordinary
technique.'
In his office in the bowels of the Vatican museum he has a blow-up
photograph of the 'Judgement' as he calls it affectionately. Covered with
coloured stickers and numbers indicating the work schedule, it looks like
one of those German Christmas cards with windows to open for each day until
Christmas.
Colalucci puts in at least four hours a day on his 'Judgement'. Mindful of
the physical ravages wrought on Michelangelo producing this masterpiece, was
this not a gruelling project for a man of 62? 'Last year I began to feel a
few aches in the back for the first time. But I have been helped a lot
through keeping fit because I go to a gym.'
He chuckles quietly over the casual way he entered his chosen career. 'I
don't come from a family of artists.' His father was a famous sports
journalist. He himself was an indifferent student and entered the world of
art restoration through a chance meeting with a leading restorer. However,
he says he realised that being brought up in Rome surrounded by a vast
accumulation of ancient monuments imbued him with a natural sense of
culture. 'It is part of my character to enter into the past.'
He is a great believer that Culture cannot only be acquired through learning
and books. 'There is also an intuitive element which comes from deep inside
you. This makes you feel the work of art closer, and treat it in a familiar,
not a reverential, way.'
When he decided to enter the Rome Restoration Institute in 1949 he was one
of only five students - 'Now there are queues waiting to get in.'
His first job was a one-month stint in Sicily which turned into an
unexpected stay of seven years during which developed an expertise restoring
early paintings on wood. Parts of Sicily then were like a return to the 18th
century. He recalls driving round the island in a Fiat 500, coming across
priceless paintings which sacristans had sought to embellish with olive oil,
others retouched by enthusiastic amateurs.
When the Vatican was looking for new blood in 1960, he was recruited for his
skills with wood. He eventually moved on to fresco work by virtue of the
Vatican possessing 90 per cent of its painting in the form. This becomes
obvious as one walks with him through the endless painted corridors, halls
and rooms to the Sistine Chapel. (From the museum entrance to the Chapel it
is nearly a kilometre).
What is the secret of a good restorer?
'For me the important thing is not necessarily the iconography of a work of
art but to understand how it is painted, the choice of colours, the movement
of mass . . . it is like understanding the structure of a piece of music.'
It is the natural approach of a craftsman and he does not wish to be
distracted by academic debate over, say, the identity of a saint. He talks
often of restoring paintings to the original 'text for a proper reading'.
Modern restoration, he says, is in essence based on 'a great respect for the
original and minimum interference. Everything done to present the work,
providing the damage is not too visible, is carried out in such a way so
that you can see the original. In the past there was a lot of retouching and
too much reconstruction of what was missing and damaged.' He feels that
attitudes in Italy differ towards restoration because there is little money
and so much to restore, whereas many rich countries have little to restore.
Is one not intimidated by approaching something so immense and so well known
as the Sistine Chapel?
'My experience on wood, which is a much more delicate medium, has helped
enormously in my work on the Sistine chapel. The mentality of a restorer of
paintings on wood is very special - the work does not permit experiment, you
cannot take short cuts: you need to be very clear-headed . . . You cannot
make mistakes. Frescos, on the other hand, were often done by large numbers
of people and are executed generally on a grand scale on big spaces.
'However, restoring Michelangelo requires all the techniques used for
wood-based painting work because his painting is so refined, so delicate -
and so well known. You need the mentality of someone used to working on the
square centimetre.'
The restoration presented special problems because he says Michelangelo
changed techniques often. Technically it has been difficult both to remove
the glue varnish, which over time had left scales, and to return to the
original colours while all proper conservation procedures were observed.
Does one also need to jump the centuries and get inside the mentality of the
artist?
' As a man he left nothing, but one can see as an artist he was extremely
severe with himself and with others. And I understand him: if a person
possesses such talents he cannot get on with anyone else.'
For Colalucci, the most painful aspect of the restoration has been the
criticism directed against his work - because he is the first one to want to
get it right. Can he ever therefore relax and feel no that mistakes have
been made on a work which the world regards as one of its foremost art
treasures, and which thousands queue to see every day?
' I fear being overconfident. I found it positive that people challenged
what I was doing. The polemics could destroy me as a person and my work, but
they could also act as a stimulus to improve. I never undervalued any
criticism even when I thought it stupid, and this has enabled me to be
serene about all that's been said. I think I have been proved right.'
The criticism has so far referred to the ceiling. Though the arguments are
complex, one polemic was over the belief that Michelangelo had modified the
original fresco with extensive glazing and additions in secco after the
original work had dried. Others centred on the use of certain chemicals
which it was feared might affect future conservation. Yet another complained
that the restored colours simply looked too modern. One US critic even
called the restoration a 'disaster'.
Colalucci divides his critics into two categories. 'There are those who know
a work of art as if it belongs to them, something they have learned from
childhood, seen on a special trip or have studied - and they don't want it
to change.' Looking with him at pictures of the 'before' and 'after', it is
as though a fine grey veil has been peeled away from the ceiling. 'The main
critics have in fact been painters because they have studied Michelangelo in
a certain way, often from books - for them it is sacrosanct. I understand
this, even I can have problems with an excellent restoration by a colleague
in this way. But this is a sentimental reaction.'
On technical aspects, he claims 'the challenge has come from persons who
knew nothing about technique'. But he believes the polemic has subsided over
the past 18 months, especially as the lighting has been corrected. He adds:
'It is not as if this has been done in-house, we have had a team of 18
internationally recognised experts monitoring the project.'
But does he ever ask tourists what they think as he wanders around the
chapel? 'No. I just listen to the comments.'
These days many of the comments are in Japanese, as a sizeable proportion of
visitors are groups from Japan. Japanese television has also paid Dollars 4m
(about Pounds 2m) for the rights to film the whole process of restoration.
How does he imagine the Japanese confront western art and Michelangelo's
very personal interpretation of Christianity? 'I know well what it feels
like to look at another culture from the outside; but what the Japanese
think about this remains a mystery.'
Indeed crowds, and the conservation issues raised by mass tourism, are an
increasing problem for the Sistine Chapel. Often it is impossible to
contemplate the frescos in reasonable tranquillity. Should limits be placed
on the number of visitors? Should they be made to be content with replicas?
Colalucci wryly observes that the replica of Michelangelo's 'Pieta' in the
Vatican museum is usually treated with the same reverence and curiosity as
the original in St Peter's, which is more difficult to see as it is behind
glass. 'Works of art today are subject to stress but it's not just people in
museums but pollution in general. Why should you deny people the chance of
seeing these masterpieces? I think it would be impossible.'
Is this restoration like repainting the Forth Bridge - once finished, one
immediately begins again?
'No. This will last.'

or maybe it was the bladder  - of the BBC's Broadcasting House. I was taking
part in a studio discussion. Two topics came up. First, was Lady Thatcher
wrong to take up a post - as the press say she is - with the American
cigarette company Philip Morris.
Second, on the 25th anniversary of the British campaign to legalise
cannabis, should we now decriminalise that drug?
The first question was easy to answer: of course Lady Thatcher should feel
no pangs of conscience in taking up such an appointment. The smoking of
cigarettes I said, was a time-honoured and inoffensive habit, which gives
pleasure to millions. Cars kill people, I pontificated, but no-one would
complain if Lady T had taken up a directorship with Rover or General Motors.
On the question of Cannabis, I nervously suggested that legalisation might
not be a terrible thing. I then awaited what I thought would be a barrage of
calls from angry Radio 4 listeners, castigating me for daring to suggest
that hippy drugs should be made freely available.
There was a barrage of angry calls. So much so that while we were still on
air the producer of the programme urgently requested the presenter - I could
hear his headphones buzzing - to correct some of my remarks. But not one of
the irate complaints was about the dangers of cannabis. They were all
denouncing my toleration of the smoking of commercial cigarettes.
In 25 years the world has turned upside down. Even in the heart of England,
what was once mind blowing is now mainstream; what was once acceptable is
now anathema. The same is true in the US. If Ross Perot had a politician's
sensitivity to this sea change, he would still have his hat in the
presidential ring. But two weeks ago he referred to American blacks as 'you'
rather than 'we' and from that politically incorrect moment he did not stand
a chance.
A senior English politician recently marvelled to me at the speed which
received wisdom is turned topsy-turvy. His mailbag has been filled with
correspondence from constituents about the threatened closing of London Zoo.
Almost all of the letters are anti-Zoo, denouncing the whole business as
cruel and unnatural. The MP was amazed. Ten years ago he said, such views
were held only by the loony eco-fringe of the Liberal Party.
I had the same feeling of bewilderment when I picked up a remaindered book
in Bath the other day. It is called Pregnancy and it is written by Dr Gordon
Bourne, consultant gynaecologist to the Royal Masonic Hospital. This is what
Dr Bourne has to say on a rather sensitive matter: 'From a purely biological
aspect the masculine type of female and the effeminate type of male are not
good vehicles for reproduction and the procreation of the human race. Nature
caters for these phenomena by introducing female homosexuality, or
lesbianism, which is the association of woman with woman and is partly
confined to the masculine type of female.
'Male homosexuality is the association of man with man and is usually, but
not always, confined to the effeminate type of male. Associations of this
nature are, of course, reproductively sterile which is the obvious
biological solution to the problem in so far as it automatically eliminated
such particular human types from procreation.'
This passage, archaic yet convincingly logical, was written only 20 years
ago. At that time the book was reviewed favourably by The Guardian (and has
been widely respected for its medical counsel.) But what would Guardian
Woman say now about the good doctor Bourne's advice to women after giving
birth to 'put on some make-up and tidy your hair.'
Indeed, what would Guardian reviewers say about a book which damned
masculine women and effeminate men as biologically inferior? The biggest
mistake of all is to conclude that we must be right about everything now,
and were wrong about everything then. In another 20 years the next
generation will laugh at our fixed ideas. They may even have rediscovered
the toleration of smoking, the joy of zoos, and the wisdom of Dr Bourne.

<TEXT>
WHILE the British press sought last week to establish its freedom to define
what is the public interest and what is common prurience, the Russian media
was engaged in a more fundamental battle: to establish its right to an
independent existence of any kind.
As the anniversary of the August putsch approaches, it becomes clear that
the post-communist politicians, as well as the post-communist editors and
post-communist readers , have no settled view on what constitutes a proper
relationship between them.
At the heart of the struggle is the newspaper Izvestia, for nearly 75 years
the organ of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR and since the putsch a
self-declared independent publication.
Under Igor Golembiovsky, its chief editor, it has established itself as the
closest thing to a paper of record - as Golembiovsky puts it: 'The political
paper for the intelligent part of our society' - both for Russia and the
former Soviet republics. Its sympathies are pro-reform, broadly supportive
of Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president and the cabinet of Yegor Gaidar.
It cannot, however, escape its past, when it was an organ of the Supreme
Soviet. The takeover by the staff on August 23 1991 of the paper is now
being challenged by those who consider themselves the successor to the
Soviet - that is, the parliament of Russia.
In particular, Ruslan Khasbulatov, its leader, has made it his particular
mission to bring Izvestia back under parliamentary control and to force it
once again to be the 'Izvestia (news) of the Supreme Soviet of Russia' - a
kind of daily Hansard.
Last Friday, the parliament voted heavily to repossess the paper - a
decision which has sparked what could turn out to be a momentous clash
between the legislative power on the one hand and the presidential and
government powers on the other. On Wednesday, Mikhail Poltoranin, the
information minister, said with Yeltsin's backing, that he would defy
parliament.
Golembiovsky was called tothe parliament, where he argued that the editorial
staff had acted legally, had not appropriated state property and were merely
renting it. But the deputies were not mollified. An example:
Khasbulatov: 'How come you get the chance to take part in a discussion for
hours on TV about the problems of your paper, which is only of interest to
you and those who think like you?'
Golembiovsky: 'Ruslan Imranovich, you well know that I don't run the TV.
They asked me so I went.'
Khasbulatov: 'Well, that's clear. They asked you. And why did they ask you?
Why not some of the deputies who have been concerned with this for months?
Its clear why they asked you - because you've waged war on the Russian
government.'
Golembiovsky: 'That's not true . . .'
Another deputy complained: 'A group of us deputies from Kabardino-Balkaria
tried for three months to get you to publish our view of the inter-ethnic
relations in the Northern Caucasus. You refused: why?'
The debate clearly had elements of farce. But beyond the farce is a threat.
Hardly one of the Russian papers is actually free of the state: most -
including Izvestia - receive millions of roubles of state support each year:
even those which are supposedly independent must print on state-owned
presses and get state-allocated paper.
Yeltsin seems to have supported the new press, without demanding sycophancy
as his price: but there is little in the way of institutions, or of
tradition, to stop him changing his mind.
Golembiovsky says: 'The press is the only democratic institution in Russia
now, and it is weak. The traditions left to us by the Soviet period are
servile: we must reach back to the 19th century, when there were papers
which did express themselves freely'.
Nor is the state the only threat. Many of the 'business' papers are owned by
the new commercial institutions, especially the commodity and stock
exchanges: they are hardly to be expected to be critical of these
institutions, which is why the formerly Communist journals such as
Literaturnaya Gazeta do most to expose business corruption. But bribery of
journalists is widespread.
Russia's press, after its liberation from the Communist Party, has shown
diversity. Liberal papers like Nezavisimaya and Commersant jostle with the
still-Communist Pravda, the nationalistic Sovetskaya Rossiya and the
near-fascist Dyen. Indeed, it contrasts well with the press of other former
Soviet republics.
But it is fragile. Golembiovsky says he has been heavily criticised recently
for printing the Ukrainian or other republics' points of view when he should
be a Russian paper.
He says: 'There is going to be a huge struggle for power in the autumn; the
government will be under attack; there will be a fight over a new
constitution. The economic situation will be worse: there will be a real
threat of authoritarian rule. The press is in danger'.

I EXPECT you think I was wrong-footed by Ross Perot's withdrawal from the
race for the White House, but in that you would be wrong. For those who have
been visiting Mars, I was recruited, just last month, as the London-based
member of the Committee To Elect Ross Perot. I was exceedingly well paid.
Ross Perot liked me, asked me to fly to Dallas, was constantly amazed at the
richness of the data I faxed from London.
When Perot withdrew from the scramble for the presidency, I imagined my life
would return to normal. I went on holiday. I joined a luxury barge cruise on
the River Saone in Burgundy. But life is never simple. No sooner had Perot
withdrawn in ignominy than Bill Clinton phoned from New York to ask me to
join his campaign team. Wearily, I agreed.
'You were going great guns for Perot,' said Clinton soothingly, 'so why not
switch horses? The Democrats need you. Me and Al need you. We're going right
to the wire.'
'Are you offering money?' I asked the governor. 'Only I'm cruising on the
Napoleon. We've just left Macon. On a cruise like this the passengers play
Monopoly for bearer bonds.'
'We can pay you something,' said Clinton. 'But we're not Ross Perot. What we
want you to do is cover our backs in Europe and the Middle East. Feed us
data. Stuff about Nato. Where is Bosnia-Herzegovina. Is Italy going down the
plughole. Nothing you couldn't handle. And we want Big Ideas, Mike. Things
to crush Bushie with, especially ahead of the Republican convention. Do you
have Big Ideas?'
'Of course I do,' I mumbled.
'So lay one on me, Mike. Hit me with a big one. You're a baby boomer, too,
just like me and Al. I'm sure you're on our wavelength. Hit me with a
biggie.'
I thought furiously. 'Here's one,' I said. 'Back in April I visited the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena to research an article about Nasa's Seti
programme, its Search for Extraterrestial Intelligence, which starts on
October 1. The programme involves a systematic search of the microwave radio
spectrum for signals of intelligent origin.
'My article was snappily written. Mega-short sentences. Very Beverly Hills,
fast-paced and up-beat. But it was suffused, you might say, with my own
conviction that our galaxy pulses with intelligent life, and that the Seti
programme is an entirely admirable venture.'
There was silence from New York.
'Yet now I have changed my mind,' I said. 'I have changed my mind after
talking to my good friend Jared Diamond, author of The Rise and Fall of the
Third Chimpanzee. We're basically chimps, Mr Clinton. More than 98 per cent
of human genes are shared with two species of chimpanzee. In his book, Jared
explores the ways in which we are uniquely human yet still influenced by our
animal origins.
'Anyways. Jared is excessively worried by Nasa's Seti programme. He finds it
mind-boggling that the astronomers now eager to spend Dollars 100m on Seti
have never thought seriously about the most obvious question: what would
happen if we discovered extraterrestrials, or if they found us. 'Our own
experience on Earth offers useful guidance,' says Jared. 'We have already
discovered two species that are very intelligent but technically less
advanced than us - the common chimpanzee and pygmy chimpanzee. Has our
response been to sit down and try to communicate with them? Of course not.
Instead we shoot them, stuff them, dissect them, cut off their hands for
trophies, put them on exhibit in cages, inject them with Aids virus ..and
destroy or take over their habitat.'
'Mr Clinton,' I concluded. 'Jared says that for practical purposes we are
unique and alone in the universe. But he also says it is suicidal folly to
try and communicate with the very few civilisations that might exist. 'If
there really are any radio civilisations within listening distance of us,
then for heaven's sake let's turn off our own transmitters and try to escape
detection, or we are doomed,' says Jared.
'So there is your Big Idea. Tell the American people that Seti must be
halted; that Bushie, in his ignorance, is endangering the Earth. Tell the
people that only the Democrats stand between Earth and invading mobs from
other planets. What is your current poll lead, 20 points, 25? You could
double that, Mr Clinton. As easy as apple pie ..'
But the line had gone dead.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Arts: The Sun that never sets - Records
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST BEFORE Sun Ra and his Solar Myth Arkestra arrived at the Brecon Jazz
Festival, to no-one's surprise, a wizard occupied the centre aisle of the
market hall venue - crescents, goatee, aromatherapy tackle and all - to
await an old man who claims to be from Saturn.
Ra and his Arkestra, with imagery which combines Eygptology with pulp
sci-fi, has always attracted a jolly lunatic fringe. But his wide ranging
writing and arrangements, which mix big band grandeur with quirky and often
free improvisation, could command universal appeal.
A dearth of easily available recorded material has helped keep Sun Ra in the
cult category, however, and until recently his records, many of them
released in small numbers on his own Saturn label, were stricly for
aficionados or collectors. With Ra in the twilight of his career the
situation has been rectified with the release of a series of CDs from
Pennslyvania-based Evidence Music Inc and another from Black Saint, Mayan
Temples.
The five Evidence albums are cleaned up reissues of Ra's own creaky Saturn
recordings from the early Fifties into the Sixties, with original liner
illustration, good notes and pyschedelically embossed discs. Mayan Temples,
recorded only two years ago and covering more recent material, provides the
other bookend to a long career.
Although he denies it now, he started out as Sonny Blount, born sometime
around 1910 in Birmingham, Alabama. He worked his way north, via the
southern circuit, to Chicago where, at the Club DeLisa, he met big band
leader Fletcher Henderson. Usually cited as Ra's major influence, Fletcher
Henderson employed him as pianist and arranger for only two years (1947 -
49) before Ra's own writing and space age pre-occupations began to evolve,
first with a trio and eventually with 12 pieces. The Arkestra, often with
the same personnel for years on end, has been in colourful orbit ever since.
At an Arkestra show Ra's cosmic cadets fill the stage, a constellation of
brass, lurex and sequins. Old hands tenorist John Gilmore and altoist
Marshall Allen have blasted off alongside alumni such as Clifford Jarvis,
Julian Priester and Pharoah Sanders in their time. The leader, stately but
fragile after a stroke in 1990, is wrapped in tinsel and half carried to the
front of the stage by two acolytes. Between thoughtfully placed chunks of
chords he peers wistfully through watery eyes across synth and piano
keyboards as younger members of the ensemble turn cartwheels.
If the show is out of this world so is the music and the new Evidence discs
do it justice, covering a period when Ra's ideas and influences were
gelling. Sound Sun Pleasure (ECD 22013), for example, contains what are said
to be Ra's first ever seven sides, when the band was the Astro-Infinity
Arkestra, and they range from the Gershwins' 'S'Wonderful' to the corn of a
crooning 'Dreams Come True'.
Five cracking discs are available from Evidence, including Monorails and
Satellites, a solo outing for Ra at piano, and five more from the Saturn
catalogue are due in October.
Holiday for Soul Dance (ECD22011), Jazz In Silhouette (ECD 22012), Monorails
And Satellites (ECD22013), Sound Sun Pleasure (ECD 22014), Supersonic Jazz
(ECD 22015) are on the Evidence label. Mayan Temples (120121-2) is on Black
Saint. All are available from distributors Harmonia Mundi in London (Tel:
071-253-0863).

FT  25 JUL 92 / Arts: Shades of the past - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
OSCAR WILDE always knew better than he wrote. Now he has posthumously
pronounced on Sharman Macdonald's new play, Shades, at the Albery Theatre:
'All women become like their mothers. That is their tragedy. No man does.
That's his.' Shades is a tragicomedy about a woman, her son, and her mother.
It makes slow-paced, unusual drama, boldly conceived and well acted, but
strangely unaffecting.
Pearl (wonderfully played by Pauline Collins) is a 42-year-old widow,
trapped between her cossetted son and her stern mother. The action is set in
1950s Glasgow during a night out with her beau, Callum.
The play rests on the over-close relationship between Pearl and her
ten-year-old son (well played by Matthew Steer). She has ambitions for him
and has made sacrifices: 'We could have a better life if I didn't pay for
your education.' But she will not let him go. She looks elsewhere for
security. After dancing with Callum (James Cosmo), Pearl proposes marriage.
He rejects her. She returns home to her mother, a matter-of-fact
Presbyterian, and to her bedwetting son.
The action has an appropriate claustrophobia, aided by Christopher Morley's
gloomy design. Simon Callow's direction slows it to a flat sameness:
fastening a dress, putting on a jacket, folding a bow tie, are deliberate
significant acts.
The shades of the title refer to the dark interiors of Pearl's home and to
the ghost of her husband. A brighter elsewhere appears in memories of
Pearl's happily married past, of VJ Day: 'We went to bed, and for joy, we
made a baby.'
The play's weakness is that it gestures to the past instead of showing the
present. Shakespeare or Chekhov give sufficient information so that their
characters become explicable; rather than probing back in time, they show
the action advancing. The problem with Shades is its refusal to show rather
than tell.
The play's strength lies in its subject, ideal for Collins' talents: a woman
on the threshold of middle age trapped between an idyllic past and a
daunting future, holding on to a son who will move from one to the other in
leaving her. It would make a good short story in its present form. Growing
old alone is usually the literary province of men; Kafka said it best 80
years ago: 'It seems so dreadful to stay a bachelor . . . always having to
say good night at the front door, never to run up a stairway beside one's
wife, to have only side-doors in one's room leading into other people's
living-rooms.' Shades puts the woman's view.
For a limited season at The Albery Theatre (071-867-1115).

FT  25 JUL 92 / Arts: Macbeth, the king of heavy metal - Musicals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT THE last thing the world needs is another rock musical. Fortunately,
what the world gets is decided by impresarios, and these cautious, most
unimaginative of men have screwed their backers' money to the sticking point
and launched two more to keep us singing through the recession.
Both plod familiar ground. Imagine, at the Liverpool Playhouse, is this
year's Beatles musical, and just to make everyone feel at home the star is
that perennial Lennon look-a-like Mark McGann, who stands a good chance of
playing the role longer than John managed himself.
From a Jack to a King (at the Ambassadors in London) is even more of a
re-tread: writer Bob Carlton made such a success of converting Shakespeare's
The Tempest into the cult hit Return to the Forbidden Planet that he is
attempting to repeat history with a send-up of Macbeth.
The best way to judge rock musicals is by the aisle action. From a Jack to a
King wins hands down, with the audience on its feet well before the
compulsory jam session finale. It still seems irritatingly easy to adapt
some of Shakespeare's most famous lines to act as a loose prop for a
selection of classic rock songs from the 1960s, but the brio of the cast is
enough compensation. I was left totally unmoved by Forbidden Planet but I
joined in the fun this time round.
It helps that Macbeth has a strong and theatrical plot which works even when
King Duncan is transmogrified into a rock singer and Macbeth to a lowly
drummer, the most insignificant member of the court. Instead of a dagger the
murder weapon is a spanner, which loosens the nuts on Duncan/Elvis's
motorbike, (cue in 'Leader of the Pack'), enabling Thane Cawdor to do the
deed and top the Wembley gig.
It is real ensemble playing when Lady Macbeth - sorry, Queenie - powerfully
portrayed by Allison Harding, does her stint on the drums, or the sax, or
the guitar, and Matthew Devitt as Macbeth throws off guitar riffs like an
axe hero. Since Devitt also directs he gets the credit for the relentless
pace which disguises the more banal puns.
It would be expecting miracles for popular lightning to strike twice in this
genre, but since the cast so attractively pleaded for good word of mouth I
will recommend the Ambassadors Theatre for stag nights, hen parties and
silver wedding anniversaries.
'You know what happens next' says Mark McGann to the audience at the
Playhouse, two hours into this Lennon bio-play. Yes. You are going to get
shot; then there will be a black out; then you will sing 'Imagine'; and then
the audience will join in a chorus of 'Give peace a chance'. Unfortunately,
we also know what is going to happen the moment the curtain rises.
Imagine is little more than a run-through of the Beatles song book, with a
script which sounds more like programme notes than a work of creativity. A
stone-deaf Bulgarian could tick off the Cavern scene; the recording studio
scene; the US tour scene.
Until the interval this has been a fairly indifferent Beatles musical.
Things improve when Lennon finally falls into the clutches of Yoko Ono and
cuts loose from the group. Once again every familiar image is conjured up,
but at least there is a weirdness to it all. In fact the relationship
between Lennon and Ono is worth a serious study. All we get here is Ava de
Spouza looking advisedly inscrutable and McGann seizing the chance to behave
badly at last. Still, while the Beatles songs now sound trite, some of
Lennon's later work, 'Working class hero' and 'Jealous guy', seem to have
the stuff of the classic about them.
McGann remains the best thing in Imagine. By now Lennon's rasping voice and
prickly personality, to say nothing of his profile, have become second
nature and he holds the show together. The rest of the cast are just
cyphers. Imagine totally ducks the really interesting question - how big a
bastard was Lennon? In Ian Kellgren's production he is still the world's
great white hope.
There was also another musical opening unobtrusively at the King's Head in
London this week. Once again it is a pastiche; once again it milks popular
songs of the past. But Top of the Town deserves to be a smash, if only
because of its witty script.
Roy Smiles has gathered in every musical cliche about a 1940s off-Broadway
musical to produce an appealing bonbon. It would be an insult to include
songs like 'Long ago and far away', 'Try a little tenderness', and many more
tingly standards if the script was not equally urbane. It is also right that
the cast plays it dead straight, especially Smiles as the devious impresario
Harry Stein, keen to emulate that great musical 'The Fleet goes Ga-ga'. My
only caveat about the show is its limited horizons. The voices are too
small; the personalities of some of the cast too restrained for this to
bother the West End. At the King's Head it is ideal entertainment for a
summer's evening.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Arts: Sunk by the guns of commercialism - Richard Newbury
finds himself disappointed by an exhibition of British sea power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD NEWBURY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN THE Duke of Edinburgh officially opens the 20th Century Sea Power
gallery at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, London, later this
year (it opened to the public this week), it will be a moment of some
historical irony.
One hundred years ago, the Duke's great-great grandmother, Queen Victoria,
presided over the mightiest navy the world had seen. This awesome force was
a shield for the world's greatest merchant fleet. British maritime and
economic power were supreme. So spectacular has been the decline of this
power during the intervening century, that the very possibility of this new
gallery has depended on the sponsorship of a Taiwan-based shipping company.
It is therefore appropriate that a section of the 20th century gallery
should be devoted to trade, not merely because trade is chiefly seaborne,
but because it creates the wealth upon which naval power is founded.
Britain's mighty fleets in the early years of this century must be seen in
the context of her imperial interests and trading advantages. Equally, the
disintegration of the Empire and the loss of its valuable trade can be seen
to have contributed to Britannia's fall from world to merely European power.
However, instead of an analysis of this sort, the section devoted to trade
is largely taken up by a wall of video screens each showing the same film -
but out of synch with each other - of random images loosely connected with
trade. The effect is like looking through the window of a television shop,
and is about as instructive. This meaningless farrago is accompanied by loud
music. An adjacent board explains in a few lines that 90 per cent of our
trade is still seaborne, and that our merchant fleet is now ranked 16th in
the world. Is this an adequate summary of the subject? Does it explain
anything?
Again, the first section of the gallery aims to introduce the theme of sea
power but, far from providing a description of its various civil and
military manifestations, it presents the visitor with another wall of video
screens showing guns firing, ships exploding, aircraft landing, etc.,
without coherence, chronology or any apparent intellectual rationale. Only
the most hardened video-junkie could watch for more than a few seconds. The
sound of explosions on the sound track makes contemplation of the
surrounding displays difficult.
The promise of electronic gimmickry made in the gallery's press release is
amply fulfilled in the following 'interactive display area'. It is
legitimate that the technicalities of radar-links and missile systems be
given some coverage; after all, this is not an exhibition of portrait
miniatures but of technological science. However, to what extent actually
trying to work these systems oneself contributes to an understanding of the
subject as a whole must be open to argument. A large area given over to play
will displace more historically instructive material.
A single factual insight concerning technology itself can be far more
illuminating than any amount of button pressing. For example, next to the
Jutland display it would have been interesting to read that at the beginning
of the First World War the numerical superiority of the Royal Navy was
offset by the German technological lead in many crucial areas, such as
range-finding and torpedoes, and that this was partly due to the superiority
of the German educational system which produced more graduates from
technical colleges and universities.
Indeed, the standard of education attributed to the visitors to this gallery
is not flattering. There must be a patronising belief at directorial level
that museums must above all be entertaining, and that the public does not
want to read anything but only wants to watch video screens.
The next section deals with battle fleets. This is a large subject and needs
to be carefully introduced and developed. The approach here, however, is to
present the visitor with scattered paragraphs of information in which no one
aspect of the subject is thoroughly tackled. There is a sense of historical
progression, but it is not structured in any intelligible way. The battle of
Jutland is dealt with in some detail on an audiovisual loop tape, the sound
track of which, again, makes the study of neighbouring displays difficult.
Through this 'lowest common denominator' approach one can detect a strong
curatorial desire for something better. The selection of paintings is
excellent. Mostly the work of official war artists (including some German),
these paintings are of unique documentary as well as artistic value. The
pressure to produce propaganda seems to have been resisted, given that the
censors would not have allowed depictions of British disasters.
Some of the painters represented here produced their best work as war
artists. Stephen Bone, whose pedestrian vision is familiar in views of
Camden Town back gardens and kitchen sinks, conveys something of the
unheroic routine of ordinary men in extraordinary circumstances in his
paintings of life on an S-Class submarine.' Up The Conning Tower' of 1944 is
unquestionably one of his best compositions. In contrast, Charles Pears
cannot resist producing an epic effect, as in his painting 'An Arctic
Convoy'. These pictures are a reminder of the limitations of documentary
photography which, for all its value as a mechanical record, communicates no
trace of the witness's emotions.
A problem peculiar to a museum of maritime history is the impossibility of
displaying anything more than a few peripheral fragments of the ships
themselves. Credit is therefore due here to the designers, who have
imaginatively chosen to install the display areas in the reconstructed hull
of a ship, the bows of which confront the visitor at the entrance to the
gallery.
Again, the ship models are superb, particularly the King George V, made by
Vickers as a scale prototype for examination by the Admiralty. Over six feet
long, it is perhaps the star of the gallery.
Having felt excited about the opening of this gallery for a number of
months, it is a great disappointment to see so many momentous themes and
dramatic events chopped up into brief paragraphs that are assumed to suit
the concentration span of the public. If the subject is simply beyond the
scope of a single gallery, why waste precious space with needless electronic
entertainment? The subject demands more history and less 'whammy'.

JOHN TAVENER'S We shall see Him as He is is new to London, although it
opened the Chester Festival earlier this year, before Thursday's Prom
performance. It is one of his many devotional works since converting to
Eastern Orthodoxy 15 years ago. This is our contemporary Tavener, not the
English Renaissance 'heretic' John Taverner who later repented of his
'Popish ditties'] Yet in modern Western terms, the anti-Renaissance Tavener
is scarcely less of a heretic.
This time round, however, the heresy seems to be popular. The Albert Hall
was nearly full. That would be partly explained by the prospect of hearing
the redoubtable John Lill in Beethoven's 'Emperor' Concerto; but nearly
everybody stuck out Tavener's hour-plus 'Ikon of the Beloved' too (half of
the few who slipped away were lugging dazed children), and at the end there
was a vociferously warm ovation. For a piece of such wilful simplicity,
forgoing any development and any aural blandishments beyond shot-silk
string-backgrounds and a rare, rousing fortissimo, that was impressive. It
seemed to answer a felt need.
'Ikon of the Beloved' is Tavener's own subtitle, but more exactly We shall
see Him as He is comprises 11 musical 'ikons', each a meditation - and meant
as an occasion for meditating - upon a passage in St. John's Gospel (texts
arranged by Mother Thekla, a Greek Orthodox abbess). With the Albert Hall
organ, the BBC Welsh Orchestra under Richard Hickox supplied Tavener's plain
instrumental requirements: just a large string band, three trumpets (for the
fortissimi) and two timpanists (for pervasive sacred rumblings, from
subliminal to violent). The excellent outsize chorus was made up of the BBC
Welsh's own, the Chester Festival's and the professional Britten Singers.
With calculated parsimony, all the music is derived from Byzantine chant,
which has an effective exotic appeal that is not lost upon Tavener himself.
The central tenor role (taken scrupulously by John Mark Ainsley) prescribes
Eastern inflections. He bears only a surface-resemblance to the Evangelist
of a Bach Passion, for he has nothing to narrate; instead he introduces the
successive Ikons with long, rapt, melismatic 'I heard's' and 'I saw's',
before each meditation expands into the semi-chorus or the whole choral
throng. There is a great deal of serene repetition - notably of the initial
cello-melody.
In conventional analytic terms, this protracted music is barely interesting
at all. Tavener's ground-plan allows for broad contrasts and a sense of an
accumulating climax (in Ikon X), but no overt ingenuity in the composition.
Still, one should not underestimate the achievement of producing a work on
such a scale whilst being rigorously 'simple', and yet evading anything that
could fairly be called banal. More important, the fact that it gripped its
audience - or most of it - for so long and so successfully may suggest that
it taps something more interesting than being 'interesting'.

MARILYN: THE LAST TAKE by Pete Brown and Patte Barham Heinemann Pounds
17.50, 486 pages
'WHEN I first saw The Wizard of Oz', claims Salman Rushdie, 'it made a
writer of me.' Can he ever forgive it? To Dorothy, to Toto, to the Cowardly
Lion, he owes his exile from human society, from which he now sends a love
letter - or a castaway's note in a bottle - that sees print as one of four
pilot volumes in a new series of 'BFI Film Classics.'
Rushdie's 64-page essay on The Wizard of Oz joins Penelope Houston on Went
The Day Well, Edward Buscombe on Stagecoach and Richard Shickel on Double
Identity. Three great films and a British curio, Houston picking the Graham
Greene-based wartime thriller about Nazis infiltrating an English village.
The books are a splendid start to the series of 360 movie monographs
promised: part of a tie-in enterprise with the National Film Archive aimed
at celebrating a pantheon of world cinema. Fashioned on an
all-you-need-to-know principle - production history, critical analysis,
popular response - the style is flexible enough to allow each author to
write to his/her strength.
No doubt the volume quickest to be whittled down in the bookshops will be
Rushdie's. Such is the fame of the fatwa'd. His essay exists on a more
mystical plane. Instead of seeing one film in The Wizard of Oz, Rushdie sees
a dozen. A film about childhood, about Hollywood, about good and evil; a
film that embodies for him the West's answer to the garish Hindi musicals he
grew up with.
Rushdie likes fancy and surmise as much as provable fact. He perpetuates the
doubtful tales of munchkin actors running amok in Hollywood. At the end he
launches into a series of Wizard of Oz-inspired prose poems - if anyone
should have his poetic licence extended rather than endorsed, it is this
writer.
'A minor book full of fourth-rate imagery.' Thus George Cukor on The Wizard
of Oz, soon after he was hired and fired as one of its four directors. But
then a fairy tale like L. Frank Baum's was perhaps too close to home for
this film-maker. As biographer Patrick McGilligan explains in George Cukor:
A Double Life, Cukor was Hollywood's only major gay director and 'that
fairy' was a frequent casus belli comment prompting a bust-up with a star or
Cukor's exit from a movie. Most famously from Gone With The Wind, which he
left after Clark Gable objected to his spending more time fussing around
Vivien Leigh and her wardrobe than honouring the film's action and spectacle
elements.
But what would one expect from a man who made the best women's pictures in
Hollywood history? Garbo in Camille, Hepburn in The Philadelphia Stoy,
Garland in A Star Is Born: all excelled in the intelligently cosseting
conditions Cukor created on set.
McGilligan's only faults are that he overdoses us on the gay tittle tattle,
and like every Cukor apologist he overstates the case for A Star Is Born.
Less a masterpiece than a glamorous melodramatic sprawl, it embodies, even
as it claims to chastise, that uncontrolled cosmos known as the
entertainment industry.
One star flung way out of orbit by it was Marilyn Monroe. The Marilyn
factory is at it again on the 30th anniversary of her death. Is there any
conspiracy material left to find or invent? Yes indeed. Of the first two
books into the shops, Jane Ellen Wayne's Marilyn's Men: The Private Life of
Marilyn Monroe digs up an early husband and swears him in on the witness
stand. Book two, Marilyn: The Last Take, probes the poor girl's final weeks
in exhausting detail.
Wayne's book, written in tabloid prose, dubs Monroe 'tragedy's child' and
presents her as a victim of the casting couch who in her 'hunger for love'
became addicted to her own humiliation. But rather than exploring the
complexities of Monroe's personality, the book merely pastes up the old
scandals, along with new asides from the ex-spouse.
Pete Brown and Patte Barham have done more homework, but they too end up
with tunnel vision. They see government conspiracy everywhere, in an
unlikely alliance with 20th Century Fox. That studio abandoned the star's
last film, Something's Got To Give, when an already unreliable Monroe dashed
off to sing 'Happy Birthday' to JFK at Madison Square Garden. Fox was
already in trouble with Cleopatra, as the authors explain at excessive
length: sometimes the book reads like a Taylor biography.
Alas, poor Marilyn. Whether she killed herself or was murdered, she was
already well advanced on the road to destruction. My theory is that she was
a frail soul exposed too long to the stroboscopic life of the superstar:
that merciless alternation between mega-watt attention by day and lonely
self-confrontation by night. Few but those fortified by their own ambition
and narcissism can survive. Marilyn Monroe, to her credit, may have had too
little of either.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Books: Move over cyberpunk, here comes feminism - Science
Fiction / Martin Mulligan finds a fantasy classic that Arthur C Clarke would
have been proud of among a plethora of new releases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN MULLIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF ANY evidence of the genre's extraordinary vitality were needed, it was
supplied in spades by Arthur C. Clarke's recent birthday celebrations in
Somerset. The great man flew from Sri Lanka to fete his 75th anniversary at
his birthplace in Minehead. The week-long party attracted more luminaries of
science fiction than you could shake a zap gun at. The Minehead Space Age
Festival comprised a tribute to the man who foresaw the era of the
geostationary satellite.
What would the author of 2001: A Space Odyssey make of the season's new
offerings? One novel dominates the vista. Marge Piercy's Body of Glass
(Michael Joseph, 406 pages, Pounds 14.99) elevates its author to the
pantheon of haute SF alongside Doris Lessing and Ursula LeGuin. Body of
Glass is an outstanding novel in its own right.
The reviewer's reflex, confronted by a novel of this scope and size, is to
drone on about the Hobbesian vision of the future it depicts; how it
represents a tour de force of cyberpunk set pieces (such as the combat
inside the computer; the clash with the organ pirates) et cetera.
All this, in the case of Body of Glass, would be true, but Piercy's true
achievement is to have written a sensitive contemporary novel about a woman
assimilating the heartbreak of a failed marriage and scheming to recover
custody of her son, and to have done so within the framework of the
male-dominated sub-genre of cyberpunk. Now, that is extraordinary.
Body of Glass is a remarkable novel, chiefly because it represents a woman
invading the male turf of cyberpunk, the principal SF fashion of the 1980s,
and reshaping it to convey a post-feminist vision. Cyberpunk's universe, in
which computer hackers invade the booby-trapped databases of hostile
corporations, and software entertainments plugged directly into the brain
keep humanity satisfied and docile, will never be the same.
What gives this novel its edge is the depth of feeling and experience from
which characters and incidents spring. The novel's vision of a ruined earth
dominated by high tech multinationals is interwoven with a parallel
narrative about a rabbi sorcerer's creation of a golem to protect the Jewish
ghetto of Prague in 1600, when the Counter Reformation was in full swing.
That juxtaposition, oddly effective, sets up touching and thought-provoking
resonances.
The denouement of Body of Glass would bring a tear to even a cyborg's eye. I
have not read a more disturbing or moving novel about an artificial
intelligence since Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.
Anvil of Stars (Legend/Century, 442 pages, Pounds 8.99) consolidates Greg
Bear's reputation as a writer capable of audacious imaginative leaps. In The
Forge of God, he destroyed the Earth, but ensured that beneficent aliens
saved many of Earth's children. Anvil of Stars describes the odyssey of
revenge upon which 82 of those children embark to find and to annihilate the
advanced alien civilisation responsible.
Greg Bear has that rare gift: the ability to evoke the truly strange and
render it plausible. His aliens are truly alien: the Braids, for example,
are colony organisms resembling a mass of intelligent spaghetti, social
beings down to their constituent cords. They communicate by releasing a
range of odours. They are somehow extraordinarily likeable. At no point in
Anvil of Stars does the suspense flag or the characterisation lapse.
Colin Wilson's Spider World: The Magician (HarperCollins, 345 pages, Pounds
14.99) deserves mention for its curiosity value. Colin Wilson, the former
populariser of existentialist theory, who wrote The Outsider in 1956, now
writes science fiction for the mass market. Life is strange. So is the plot
line of this volume, which concerns the efforts of the human Niall to find
the murderers who jeopardise his peace treaty with the planet's dominant
race of giant spiders, the so-called arachnids. A friend perusing Spider
World shortly after the UK election deplored the absence of fuller details
about arachnid political relations (do the spiders perhaps inhabit a Cobweb
of Independent States?).
Elsewhere, the darker side of Romanticism makes a comeback. Two recent
manifestations of it are Greenmantle (Pan, 328 pages, Pounds 4.99) and
Yarrow (Pan, 244 pages, Pounds 7.99) by Charles de Lint. These sylvan
idylls-with-a-difference have a disquietingly sinister element. The
psychological premise of these novels about city dwellers being stalked,
possessed, even devoured by the pagan spirits of ancient forests is
straightforward. The more civilised, sophisticated, and pent up in the
metropolis our lives become, the more we yearn for imaginary pastoral and
rustic simplicity, and myth and folk tales acquire a special magnetism. Such
urban-rural tension can now be exploited as never before and takes strange
shapes on the mass market.
So far so good, but what spoils Charles de Lint's at first appealing fiction
is the gratuitously nasty erotic element. The writing seems paced so as to
caress the reader's sensibilities, then to shock, and finally to inebriate
with vagueness. The formula leaves an unpleasant aftertaste which put me in
mind of the words of the critic F. L. Lucas (in The Decline and Fall of the
Romantic Ideal): 'I loathe this view of literature as a shelf of bottles
each with a different brand of alcohol inside.'
The antidote, mercifully, is also close to hand. Terry Pratchett's Small
Gods (Gollancz, 272 pages, Pounds 14.99) extends his Discworld series even
further along its comic axis. Laugh? I nearly passed my cigars round. The
antics of Brutha, the Chosen One, and his temporarily embarrassed god, Om,
who is accidentally marooned in the body of a tortoise, make Charles de
Lint's leafy pagan fictions seem etiolated by comparison. If you are
unfamiliar with Pratchett's unique blend of philosophical badinage
interspersed with slapstick, you are on the threshold of a mind-expanding
opportunity. If you have already entered his Discworld, you have another
treat in store.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
FOR THOSE still able to get a laugh out of finance, Radio 4 has devised The
Board Game, Mondays, repeated late the following Sunday - a quiz like the
sports quizzes, where players are more likely to score with an able memory
than an ace service. Here are some sample questions.
To what financial figure would you ascribe this extract (actual) from a
speech? What is meant by red bits, me-too products, PIMS? How do you
interpret the body-language of applicants for jobs? How will you explain
your apparently disloyal behaviour? Neil Koenig, the producer, knows what he
is about, and the players are quick on the ball.
On Thursday Radio 4 gave us Blood Sports for Girls, about the games they
play at school. Girls between 12 and 16 were quite honest with reporter Sara
Parker about their uncharming acts, which were not to do with sex. Gangs
would pick on special victims and accuse them of some nasty, or silly,
quality, real or imaginary. Friendships or dislikes might be virtually
enforced. The object in every case was the frank wish for power.
The programme, cleverly produced by Tessa Watt, struck me as a nature
programme as much as a social comment. But on the previous day, the front
page of our local paper was given over to the case of a girl so badly
bullied at her school she had to be taken away. She had suffered blood
sports as beastly - worse even - as those in the programme. It is not for me
to comment on such things. I leave it to Esther Rantzen.
Does Radio 3 want to counter the weight of the Proms with extra light drama?
The last two weeks have been awfully trivial. I wrote last week about the
Sunday play, Burn the Aeneid. This week we had Antrobus and the Lion by
David Stafford, one of a pair of 'Unmade Movies' - another next week.
It is unmade because David Selznick, wanting a star writer to do his script
for Gone with the Wind, bets Sam Goldwyn he will get Bernard Shaw. What is
more, Hazel Antrobus, the cat-burglar caught in his house, will get him to
do it. So indeed she does, as a parody of Liza from Pygmalion, supported by
Loewe's music from My Fair Lady. It was well played, but even Jeremy Howe's
direction could not make it bearable.
The previous evening we had Two into Three, wrapped around the Prom. In the
first 20 minutes, Tudor,a fat retired policeman, goes to the Prom to pick up
a woman. Silly Pamela, who has had trouble arriving, sits by him and agrees
to have a drink in the interval (another 30 minutes). He tells her about
having accidentally arrested Sir Adrian Boult; she tells him about her
creative writing course and her preference for boxing over music. They hear
RVW's Sea Symphony and go to supper in a local restaurant (a final 40
minutes).
Their talk lapses increasingly into fantasy, often BBC-based, sometimes
sexual but not mutual. The writer is Peter Tinniswood, whose talent is to
invent amusing characters and find things for them to do. He has hung a load
of potential comedy on Tudor and Pamela (Richard Griffiths and Elizabeth
Spriggs) but given them nothing funny to say. John Tydeman directed.
The quarterly complaints bulletin from the Radio Authority is interesting.
Of 31 complaints against independent stations, only five were upheld, two of
them with reservation, and seven out of 18 complaints against advertisers.
Five listeners complained that Sunrise FM (Bradford) broadcast in Urdu, not
in other Indian dialects; 960 listeners signed an identical complaint.
Spectrum Radio (Greater London) had dropped a programme on Afro-Caribbean
matters, and appalled one listener with an 'occult' programme in Arabic. An
LBC presenter had imitated an Asian accent. Every ethnic community must have
its own station everywhere.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Arts: A festival that flourishes for the fully-funded Finns
 -Off the Wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS OBVIOUS, really: if you want to start a flourishing opera festival,
choose the most remote spot and avoid public funding. All the opera houses
in trouble seem to be heavily subsidised buildings in the midst of a vast
catchment area.
In the UK, Glyndebourne excels among the downland sheep of Sussex, and in
Finland the Savonlinna Festival, by the Russian border in dreamlike lake
country, is this month celebrating 25 successful years.
Savonlinna tries hardest. As you idle by the water in the attractive holiday
resort you are approached by one of a brigade of young lads selling tickets,
at up to Pounds 50, for that night's performance. There are 2,200 seats to
be filled, and with the Festival dependent on box office, and its marketing
activities, for almost 90 per cent of income, there is every incentive to
whip in an audience.
Most need little persuasion. Although eastern Finland is hardly on the music
lover's Grand Tour, Savonlinna has one unrivalled asset - its performances
take place in the grandest of Scandinavian castles. Olavinlinna was built in
the 15th century to keep out the Russians. It did not always succeed but it
managed to avoid a heavy pounding. Its courtyard, covered by an awning,
today seats an opera audience, while the singers perform against the wall of
the keep.
Without the castle there would be no opera in Savonlinna. Indeed, it was as
a symbol of Finnish resistance and independence that the first Festival was
held there in 1912, Finnish music, especially patriotic opera based on folk
lore, played a key role in developing the national consciousness which
secured independence from Russia in 1917 when the Government in St
Petersberg had other worries. In the five brief seasons before the Great War
the audience negotiated a perilous channel which separated the castle from
the mainland. Some opera lovers were swept to their deaths in their quest
for music. Today a bridge leads to the island.
Modern Savonlinna started in 1967 as a modest summer music school. Today it
is a power house of the opera world. It has helped promote the works of
Finnish composers like Kokkonen and Sallinen while developing an
international dimension. This month the Opera Ebony from New York presents
Porgy and Bess. Its large box office take enables Savonlinna to pay
composers well: it is a rewarding commission.
With such a location Savonlinna has a weakness for operas (and they are not
rare) with castellated settings. This season it has revived the classic
fortress opera Fidelio, but the popular favourite, brought back this July by
public demand, is The Magic Flute. This 20-year old production, directed by
August Everding and sung in Finnish, has come to epitomise opera, and the
Festival, for many. It is like an annual pantomime favourite: old timers
complain that the fixtures and fittings are not as glamorous; the costumes
not as brilliant; the thunder and lightening not so clamorous than in the
past, but on first view this is a light-hearted Flute, which speeds merrily
along.
There are idiosyncracies which cause some lip biting - the blacked-up Moors
seem out-dated and the three boy cupids are less than magical in jeans and
Red Indian head-dresses. But Jorma Hynninen, the artistic director of the
Festival, has wisely cast himself as Sarastro to provide a solid heart to
the opera.
As well as popularising Finnish composers Savonlinna, like Glyndbourne,
breaks unknown singers. This season's find must be Soile Isokoski, a
thrillingly-voiced Pamina. The Festival is also bolstered by the freak good
fortune of a superb acoustic and the fact that professional Finnish
musicians and singers are happy to take a working holiday in the orchestra
and the chorus.
Finnair offers a package from Helsinki which flies you to Savonlinna,
provides you with a ticket, a dinner in the castle, and a flight back for
Pounds 190 - just about the sum you will pay for (perhaps) seeing Pavarotti
at Covent Garden.
Isn't it time for an end to the baiting of Jeremy Isaacs, director of Covent
Garden? Talk of disquiet among his board, and the opposition of the UK's
Heritage Minister, David Mellor, has been overdone. In the last few months,
helped by a run of artistic successes, Isaac's position has strengthened.
He is prepared for another stint at the Opera House when his contract
expires in 18 months, seeing the House through to its 1997 closure for
re-building. Both Isaacs and Mellor are playing down any differences between
them. If Isaacs can persuade his staff to accept a wage freeze in 1993,
without precipitating a revenue-wrecking labour dispute, his position will
become even more secure.
Perhaps the problem with the art market is not reluctant buyers but
misguided gallery owners and artists? While some big galleries have failed
to sell a picture in two months, Deborah Gage of Bond Street had disposed of
46 out of the 50 works on offer in her summer show, which ends next
Saturday.
The artist on display is Joanthan Warrender, who paints bird's-eye views of
some of the grander British country estates. Warrender has revived a
tradition last popular in the late 17th century when the new rich liked
artists to capture every sheep, every servant, in their charge. He has
tapped a generation of estate owners willing to pay more than Pounds 30,000
for a minutely accurate pictorial audit of their holding. At Deborah Gage's
gallery are 17 such panoramas (not for sale) plus 50 preparatory sketches
which are on offer, mostly for under Pounds 1,000.
Among the houses immortalised are Stowell Park, the home of the Vestey
family, Courteenhal, where the Wakes have lived for centuries (the current
Sir Hereward is just glimpsed on the canvas exiting left, a tiny dot taking
his horse for a canter) and Cawdor castle in Nairn. Surprisingly, many of
Warrender's commissions come from old families. He spends summer months
familiarising himself with the properties, down to the sheep dogs and garden
parasols, and completes the scene in his studio in the winter. His latest
commission is municipal - in the gallery the town of Ayr is taking shape,
immortalised on a summer's day in 1992.
Obviously Warrender appeals to a conservative, ordered, view of art, a view
with a large following of collectors who keep the faith while patrons of
contemporary art lose confidence as the critics lead them on to yet another
spiritual dead end.

THE FIN-DE-SIECLE CULTURE OF ADOLESCENCE by John Neubauer Yale Pounds 18.50,
288 pages
FROM Sons and Lovers to Lolita, from the Beatles to Barbie dolls to pop art,
will our century be remembered as the age which glorified adolescence, just
as the Victorians idealised childhood?
Cyril Connolly, in his famous description of the 'permanent adolescents' who
emerged from Eton, claimed that the British public school produced a ruling
class 'adolescent, school-minded, self-conscious, cowardly, sentimental and
in the last analysis homosexual'.
John Neubauer, in this engaging account of how the idea of adolescence
entered western culture at the turn of the century, casts the net wider to
suggest that adolescence became an obsession in literature, painting,
psychology, sociology and pedagogy across fin-de-siecle Europe, inspiring
cultural icons in English, French and German.
This is first class, provocative cultural history. The term adolescence,
seldom used before the end of the 19th century, became trendy among
psychologists in the 1900s. Around the same time a bevy of bewildered and
narcissistic teenagers entered literature - in Thomas Mann's Tonio Kroger,
Robert Musil's The Confusions of Torless, Colette's Claudine a Paris,
Joyce's Portrait of the Artist, where Stephen Dedalus is caught, like most
of the others, in a conflict of the bourgeois versus the Bohemian.
The fragmented form of modernism, suggests Neubauer, is particularly suited
to representing the fluctuations and divisions of the adolescent mind; it is
also, like teenagers, self-conscious and often narcissistic in style. The
portrait of the emaciated girl with frightened eyes staring out of Munch's
Puberty (1895) is a landmark in the painterly treatment of adolescence. The
pain of transition, the embarrassed girl hiding her body, the dark shadow
behind her symbolising male sexuality, all the themes which Kirchner,
Kokoschka, Heckel and other expressionists developed are there.
Pechstein, who recruited teenage models to pose nude on a riverbank near
Dresden, was arrested while his subjects had to swim to an island to avoid
the local police. And Egon Schiele's drawings of pubescent girls, suspended
in a vacuum, unmitigated by Kokoschka's backgrounds or Klimt's decoration
and often homoerotic, got the artist thrown into jail. Yet the adolescent
identity crisis became almost a signature of fin-de-siecle Viennese art,
reflecting a doomed Habsburg heritage.
In England, meanwhile, the lush Edwardian summer was continuing with those
idylls of innocence, The Wind in the Willows and The Secret Garden. Neubauer
does not mention them, but explores how the garden, a symbol of childhood,
gives way to adolescent settings- the playing field or the room of one's
own, the crustacean defence of Tonio Kruger. The literature of adolescence
is about banishment from the garden - the lost domain of Alain-Fournier's
Grand Meaulne. Instead, sports field culture brings cliques and peer
pressure: boarding school stories, Kipling's Stalky &amp; Co, Gide's more
menacing gang in The Counterfeiters.
The imperialist answer was male bonding - Baden-Powell's Boy Scouts and the
German Wandervogel were just two of many adolescent groups founded around
1900. Much has been made of the Wandervogel as fodder for Hitler, but
Neubauer shows that both groups shared a balance between militarism and a
nature-loving interest in the outdoors. I would have liked a more anecdotal
approach in such places; Baden-Powell, the 'Boy Man' used to sneak round to
Charterhouse to watch naked youths being photographed, and saw Peter Pan on
successive nights because the eternal boy so moved him; did his continental
equivalents have similar habits?
There would also have been room here for some exploration beyond the
rigorously aesthetic which Neubauer does so well. The Edwardian cult of the
young man, for instance, almost certainly contributed to the enthusiastic
response to war in 1914. Rupert Brooke's famous sonnet welcoming the
outbreak of hostilities 'as swimmers into cleanness leaping' suggests that,
for the former public schoolboy in a culture which made a privilege of
youth, there was nowhere else to go but boyish martyrdom; were there
parallel cultural forces elsewhere in Europe? Such questions pay tribute to
Neubauer for opening up in this book a fascinating topic with impressive
range and an easy and lively erudition.

BRILLAT-SAVARIN: THE JUDGE AND HIS STOMACH by Giles MacDonogh John Murray
Pounds 25, 248 pages
IN ANY dispute over the founders of modern gastronomy, Jean-Anthelme
Brillat-Savarin would almost certainly be a party - thanks to a small volume
he wrote in 1825. Yet, as Giles MacDonogh's engaging if earnest portrait
shows, Brillat's contribution to the culinary arts was distinctly unlikely.
In essence, Brillat was a rather chubby provincial who happened to live in
interesting times. He came from an insignificant town called Belley, in the
department of Bourg-en-Bresse, to the south and east of Lyons. Compared to
other parts of France, this was a culinary as well as political backwater.
With the exception of fine poultry and the fresh-water crayfish which teemed
in local rivers and lakes, the area had little of gastronomic distinction to
offer.
Brillat was born in 1755 into a relatively prosperous bourgeois family. He
read law at the University of Dijon, but dabbled in other subjects, notably
medicine and chemistry. He then embarked on the life of a contented
provincial advocate. But for the Revolution, says MacDonogh, we might never
have heard his name. In 1789, Brillat trotted off to Paris as the elected
representative of the Third Estate to the Estates General. There followed a
turbulent and risk-strewn career, during which he survived constant changes
of regime.
All the while, he indulged his passion for food and wine. He also gained
from exposure to a range of culinary cultures. A period in exile sent him to
America. During the Empire, he mingled with Russians and other exotics. And,
doubtless, he read the earliest almanacs and books to explore the notion of
gastronomy.
Brillat's hugely influential La physiologie du gout was published a mere two
months before his death in 1825. It was a commercial success from the start.
MacDonogh is at his best describing the book's charms, its egotism, its
aphorisms and reminiscences which break up passages of otherwise
indigestible science. Brillat deserves his biography. He perhaps deserved a
saucier treatment.

Children's Book of the Month / A fruitful novel of imaginative tension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL GLOVER

<TEXT>
SO FAR FROM SKYE by Judith O'Neill Hamish Hamilton Pounds 8.99, 204 pages
THE GUYANESE poet John Agard once called the interior of his own country 'a
hinterland of wonder'. What he was trying to express by that evocative turn
of phrase was the imaginative implications of having been born in a place
that consists of a narrow coastal littoral, relatively easily and quickly
tamed by all the marvellous resources that human beings seem to have at
their disposal and, at its back, an untamed and inhospitable interior -
rainforest, mountains, impenetrable jungle.
Agard would argue that such contrasting physical features are an imaginative
resource whose value and importance to the writer are inestimable. All he or
she knows is that it is there, within and without, that other world at one's
back, just as surely as those forces of unreason that make war upon our own
sense of order and propriety, just as certainly as the id is locked in
perpetual combat with the superego.
Australia is such another place, a world where the sophisticated society of
Sydney rubs shoulders with a timeless Aboriginal heritage, and that friction
has helped to nurture a crop of remarkable children's novelists over the
past 30 years.
These include Ivan Southall, known for his compelling and often
intellectually demanding adventure stories set in the Australian outback;
Patricia Wrightson, whose books have included successful experiments in
science fiction and fantasy; and, among a younger generation of authors,
Judith O'Neill, whose novels for older readers have included Deepwater, the
story of a young girl growing up in a small, tightly-knit community that is
riven by jealousy.
All these writers show an awareness of that fruitful imaginative tension
between outback and coast; between the claims of the Aboriginal and the
often rapacious demands of the civilising settler.
In Judith O'Neill's case, the story is given an extra twist by the fact that
her great-great-grandfather, a shepherd and crofter, originally came from
the Isle of Skye, and emigrated with his family to the new Colony of
Victoria in 1852. This is the seed from which her new historical novel, So
Far From Skye, a fictional account of the dispossession of the hundreds of
Gaelic-speaking families that were obliged to emigrate to Australia in the
1850s, has grown.
To the people themselves, the terrible sequence of calamities in those years
must have seemed like a re-enactment of the Book of Job itself: the blight
(which destroyed the potato crop); famine; cholera; and then the Highland
clearances themselves.
The book centres on the fate of the crofter Donald MacDonald (the name of
Judith O'Neill's own relative) from Taliskar, an upright, God-fearing man of
the Free Church, and his young family, but we experience it mainly through
the eyes of Morag, his courageous and resourceful 13-year-old daughter.
First comes the terrible walk to Portree, with the father carrying his
beloved foot-plough and, at his waist, a pouch of black earth from his
native village as a talisman. The ship itself, the Georgiana, is to sail
from Greenock, and it is there that the family comes upon and adopts the
ailing baby of a long-lost cousin who is dying of consumption.
On board ship, they are presented with gifts from the Emigration Society - a
suit of warm clothes, a Gaelic song book and, most important of all, a large
pair of black scissors for shearing off waist-long beards and tangled mops
of filthy hair. The message is simple: the savages are to be humanised,
first by the crudest of physical means, and later by teaching them the
Queen's own English.
The three-month voyage is a terrible experience: days of unbearable sickness
in which the families lie curled in their cramped berths, gripped by the
twin miseries of leaving home and fear of the sea. The captain, a relatively
enlightened man, recommends dancing as a cure for melancholia. Towards the
journeys' end the mood is lightened by an all-night ceilidh in which the old
tales are retold and Alec Matheson rouses the party to a frenzy by scraping
on his fiddle.
Morag is astonished to arrive on a balmy October spring day, with the air
full of the scent of eucalyptus. This is not the soft, misty beauty of her
own beloved Skye but a starker beauty, all brilliant colours and strong
light. The final tragedy occurs when the families are divided up as if they
were the spoils of war, but at the novel's close the Donald MacDonalds are
beginning to refind a sense of themselves in their new home, and Morag
discovers in Kal-Kal an Aboriginal friend with whom she has much in common -
a strange language; old, compelling stories; and a terrible tale of
dispossession . . .
The historical novel, whether written for adults or children, has a poor
reputation for improbable dialogue, stuffed with ridiculously anachronistic
speech, inauthentic details, an unacceptable level of violence done to
historical truth. Judith O'Neill has made no attempt to reproduce the quaint
speech of her forebears. She has researched her material thoroughly and
shaped it into a plain, convincing narrative that all good readers of ten
and above will find both absorbing and highly enjoyable.

CURRICULUM VITAE by Muriel Spark Constable Pounds 14.95, 213 pages
MURIEL SPARK'S name was put on the map by The Seraph and the Zambesi. She
awoke one morning and found herself famous - at least among readers of The
Observer, whose short-story competition she had won out of 6,700 entries.
That was in 1951, and the story still seems memorable, containing the
mixture of themes, moods and tricks that has characterised her fiction ever
since.
With hindsight, even its title seems prophetic, the mystical and the exotic
being coupled as they are in her personality and in everything she writes.
For however much she may make literary use of the facts of her life -
people, situations, places - she is no realist: her strength lies in the
bizarre, the unexpected, the contrived, in the sheer quirkiness of her
vision, a sort of psychic squint that distorts, often beguilingly, the
everyday world and our boringly accepted expectations and emotions.
Which may explain the disappointing result when she recalls her life
straight, in an autobiography. For the Spark view to work its magic, as it
often does in her fiction, we need to know that there stands between her and
us an acerbic irony, that glinting, glittering eyesight that dazzles and
blurs, that combines the sacred and the profane, that shocks and delights
and never quite gives away where the author stands or what is expected of
the reader.
The first half of Curriculum Vitae deals with childhood and adolescence in
Edinburgh. It is hard to pigeon-hole the family socially: of modest means
and ambitions, it seems to have been happy and hospitable. That the
remarkably gifted daughter left school for dull secretarial jobs, without
university, seems to have worried no one, not even the daughter, born Muriel
Camberg. Her father and her maternal great-grandfather were Jewish, and her
son, as she puts it, 'decided to be a Jew.'
Her mother's family, with the exotically unpronounceable name of Uezzell,
kept a small general shop in Watford. The early years are recalled
affectionately, with attractive titbits of social history. Fans of Miss Jean
Brodie will relish the account of the schoolmistress on whom she was closely
based, Miss Kay, clearly a spellbinder, even if she pinned a picture of
Mussolini's marching Fascists up in the classroom.
But in all this there is nothing very remarkable. Anyone born in 1918 is
bound by now to have things of social interest to recall, and the
long-winded recollections of school are, apart from the specialised interest
of the Miss Brodie original, not all that different from Old Girls' accounts
of teachers and jolly japes in school magazines.
Then comes adult life, and here the inability to treat facts satisfactorily
is startling: all the more so when you have read how carefully (memory being
the weak and guileful thing it is) Spark treated her past and how determined
she was to use nothing unsupported by documentary evidence. On the one hand,
there is a reserve that suggests autobiography is impossible, a lack of
candour about almost everything important, certainly every close
relationship; on the other, a mass of detail, trivia, self-justification and
petty retrospective revenge.
A long section is devoted to Spark's editorship of the Poetry Review and her
stormy relations with the Poetry Society. Old scores are settled 45 years
on, old letters quoted at length, old battles refought, and an
often-embarrassing retrospective view of the author as wronged heroine
(young and pretty, as we are told in so many words) makes one wonder how
someone so obviously aware of others' reactions can play into her readers'
hands, raising hackles, arousing suspicion of motives and memories.
If they had been seen askew with the fictional Spark eyesight, that magical,
malicious blend of skulduggery, spirituality and exact detail, and without
personal, acknowledged involvement, these years might have made a dazzling
story: her picture of Marie Stopes, for instance, is Swiftian in its venom
but spoiled by complacent comparisons between the appalling old woman and
her own fresh and perky young self. Smugness, even at a distance, is never a
pretty sight.
Then there is the lack of exploration about almost everything. At 19, Muriel
Camberg became engaged to a man she met at a dance and knew little about,
with the fictional-sounding name of Sydney Oswald Spark, 'or SOS, as we
called him.' 'It was a disastrous choice,' she tells us. '. . . The poor man
had mental problems, not obvious at the time.' And that is more or less all.
Of the marriage, which soon crumpled, and the son it produced, we are told
almost nothing. When the child was five, he was left in the care of nuns in
Rhodesia, while his mother took off for wartime Britain: 'My plan was to
prepare for Robin to go and live with my parents, who were pining to have
him.' Eighteen months later, he arrived and his grandparents took him over.
Of what his mother felt in all this we are told nothing.
The writing itself is disappointing - names often repeated where a pronoun
is needed, punctuation inexact, a general air not so much of fluency as of
carelessness. Certain words pull one up: 'boyfriend,' for instance,
anachronistically and even confusingly used in the 1940s and 1950s.
Descriptions are often so vague as to be meaningless: 'a young, very pretty
and natural woman,' 'a fine couple from Mauritius,' 'a clever English
society woman.' Spark has said that she writes as if addressing a friend and
there is much in human terms to recommend this, for warmth, immediacy and
simplicity. But even letters to friends, however unpretentious, should
surely be stylistically a pleasure.
So, all in all, a case of hopes dashed, for the thought of an autobiography
from such a hand had raised them high. This is the first volume, taking us
just over halfway through the life, with Spark on the brink of fame and
fortune and expatriate life, rocketing into the curious world of
international celebrity. All this her novels have richly deserved: for wit
and originality, variety and inventiveness, they have no current equal.
Their world is conjured outside and beyond the humdrum one of facts and
events; on what merely happened in real life her gloriously eccentric
talents, it seems to me, are wasted.

WALL TO WALL: FROM BEIJING TO BERLIN BY RAIL by Mary Morris Hamish Hamilton
Pounds 14.99, 259 pages
THE DUKE OF PUDDLE DOCK by Nigel Barley Viking Pounds 16.99, 276 pages
IN VERY different but equally successful ways these four books disprove the
notion that there is nowhere fresh to travel for exploration and adventure.
Simply travelling up the Orinoco by dugout canoe is no longer enough - there
must be a point beyond casual adventurism. What is left to discover is a
sense of history, and an understanding of the self.
Douglas Kennedy prefers to explore a metaphorical rather than literal
jungle, tracking down the semi-wild beasts who inhabit the trading floors of
the London, New York, Budapest, Sydney, Casablanca and Singapore bourses.
As a man who admits to being regularly short of the readies, Kennedy is
fascinated by those who spend the bulk of their lives making fortunes
through the high-stress, high-fallout business of trading bonds, futures and
other securities. He discovers that the majority of his encounters are with
sad people who vaguely sense that they are missing out, though what it is
they are missing neither they nor Kennedy quite pins down.
Perhaps they would have been even more unhappy without their fabulous
wealth? In any case, although Kennedy chases mammon with vigour, the god's
secret mysteries entirely evade both him - and the reader.
The traveller who craves discomfort, difficulty and oddness is faced with an
ever-shrinking world. But in desperate times one can always head towards
Asuncion, Paraguay's steamy capital.
Ben Macintyre tracks down the squalid remains of the anti-semitic colony
established by Elisabeth Nietzsche (sister to Friedrich) and her suicidal
husband, Bernhard Forster in 1886, hundreds of kilometres north of Asuncion.
There, at a spot they called New Germany, the pathetic handful of social
misfit would-be colonists tried to eke out a living in a jungle which seemed
to permit only one crop - yerba, the leaves of which are infused to create a
mildly intoxicant tea. But an uncomfortable trip up the Paraguay river to
find the crumbs of a 100-year-old settlement of crazies would be thin stuff;
what gives the book the extra frisson is the Nazi claim that the philosopher
Nietzsche inspired the national socialist movement.
Friedrich Nietzsche's hatred of anti-semitism is well-documented by earlier
writers and Macintyre has no really new light to throw on that issue. But he
carefully tracks the steps of Elisabeth Nietzsche, a thoroughly sycophantic
charlatan and fraudster, and he writes with grace and humour. When he
finally arrives in New Germany he discovers a profound irony; despite once
having provided sanctuary for Hitler's eugenics expert, Josef Mengele, the
colony's determined in-breeding has produced drooling half-wits, hastening
its extinction.
In the course of travelling across the Soviet Union by train from Beijing in
1986 Mary Morris hears of the Chernobyl nuclear accident. Intent on tracking
down the spot near Kiev where her grandparents lived, Morris abandons that
when she realises she is pregnant. She then continues her train journey
through Poland and into a pre-united Berlin.
Suspicious readers might, from that sketch, imagine we are into the special
preserve of personal psychotherapy via Rough Guides to former socialism. But
that is unfair to what proves to be a memorably touching documentary of a
woman's brave decision to travel alone in very difficult places. Morris has
some ghosts to exorcise, and she does so with remarkably clean, polished
prose. Along the way there is a collection of useful reminders of the
infuriating bureaucratic pains - as well as rare pleasures - involved in
travelling off the beaten track.
Besides being assistant keeper for north and west Africa at London's Museum
of Mankind, Nigel Barley is clearly a humorist manque. His excuse for a romp
through Indonesia and Malaysia is to track the steps of Sir Stamford
Raffles, who added to his explorations of Java and Singapore the founding of
London Zoo - all before he died, aged 45, in 1826.
But like Morris, Barley is as concerned to explore current society and his
reactions to it as to delve into the past. His putative subject - Raffles -
is not something to be fixed in place like a dead moth, but wriggles and
twists beneath the probing pin, changing according to circumstances and
viewpoint. The pleasure of all four books is that they do not just record
history; they capture it moving beneath our feet.

FT  25 JUL 92 / How To Spend It: If you need a friend, lean on me - Henry
Edmunds whittles a new collection of blackthorn sticks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HENRY EDMUNDS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THROUGH AN accident, an old and treasured Irish blackthorn walking-stick
came to a sad end a few years ago. I set out to buy a replacement but had no
luck, in spite of a wide search.
As the sloe or blackthorn (Prunus spinosa) is widely distributed in local
hedges and thickets, I then decided that it would not be too difficult to
find, cut, cure and trim a suitable piece growing in the wild to form
another walking-stick, tailored exactly to fit my hand and length of leg.
Winter was obviously the best time, for only then could one see potentially
suitable pieces. However, I quickly ran into a prickly problem: while the
textbooks I had read faithfully recorded the existence of thorns on the
branches, they failed to mention their number, length or spear-like
sharpness, which easily penetrated ordinary clothing.
So very early experience indicated that protective clothing was a must,
starting with a stiff pair of leather gloves, a thick oilskin coat and
rubber boots. I began to understand why blackthorn sticks were so scarce,
compared with hazel, which can be cut with relative ease.
More often than not a good deal of preliminary clearing had to be done even
to reach a likely-looking piece. This meant secateurs and a small handsaw to
remove obstructing growth and, later, to trim the thorns once the stick had
been cut.
It soon became obvious that pieces of walking-stick potential were few and
far between. On the other hand, lengths for shorter thumb-sticks were more
numerous.
Railway embankments turned out to be relatively good areas. This does not
mean that sticks were plentiful, but an afternoon's search sometimes
resulted in one or two lengths, of about 50 in, with thumb-stick potential.
Other fruitful habitats were the overgrown gardens of derelict cottages, the
result of rural depopulation.
No difficulty existed on farmed land, especially in isolated thickets
distant from the farmhouse. The specie prefers the company of its own kind
and, if left undisturbed, eventually spreads to formidable dimensions.
This was the kind of place that produced shapes best suited for
walking-sticks of about 36 in length. Not only had the length and thickness
of the stem to be of the right dimensions, but it also had to be growing off
another branch - an angle of 90` provided the very best handgrip.
As thumb and walking-sticks are derived from natural growth no two were ever
exactly alike, for Nature abhors uniformity. Each required individual
treatment in the seasoning process.
Invariably, some degree of straightening was required, which was best done
before the sap had dried out. Most pieces responded to knee pressure which,
provided it was gently applied every two to three days over four to six
weeks or so, removed most of the bends. If left longer than this, the stems
cracked easily on surprisingly little pressure, especially stems for mature
walking-sticks.
During the drying out, all thorns were taken off. Blackthorn, properly
seasoned after about six months, is an extremely tough wood, so any
manicuring of the stems proved much easier in the early stages. They also
needed some sandpapering to smooth any rough edges before the final
treatment with three or four coats of clear varnish. Each took took about
six months on-off work from start to finish.
The choice of ferrule is a matter of individual taste. A metal one may look
neat, but it eventually wears out and is difficult to replace. Personally I
prefer a rubber piece, which gives a better road grip and is easily renewed.
Over the last five or six years I cut about 30 or so pieces, leaving me with
15 walking sticks and around 15 thumb sticks. I did not really need the
latter, most of which were sold to local gift shops for Pounds 5 or Pounds 6
each.
The thumb-stick is best suited to the young and energetic walker who wants
some help in covering stretches of rough country. It is for the hiker, the
long-distance man who thinks of miles per hour. The walking-stick, on the
other hand, is for those of mature age. It is a product of dense thickets,
often showing the scars, sometimes very deep, of its fight just to survive.
A glance at any stick will tell you immediately what sort of passage it has
had through life; the phase of smooth uninterrupted growth as well as the
friction inflicted by other vigorous stems in the upward drive for sunlight.
There is an understanding and mutual respect between a man and his stick.
Before long, it ceases to be a mere prop and becomes, instead, a true
companion.

FT  25 JUL 92 / How To Spend It: Suited to the high life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL OF France has been panic buying this month as the lorry drivers'
blockade led to fights in supermarkets and queues outside petrol stations.
But the well-shod shoppers on the rue Cambon in Paris have been fighting for
something else - Chanel suits.
We are not talking about summer suits for a sultry July day, but winter
suits, costing at least Pounds 1,200 each. Chanel's autumn collection
arrived at its flagship shop at rue Cambon a couple of weeks ago - and the
shop has been besieged ever since.
Before I moved to Paris I always wondered why no Chanel shop I visited had
the groovy jackets that I had swooned over in Vogue magazine. The answer is
that they sold out before they got to the shop.
Shopping at Chanel is not like ordinary shopping. First, you have to be rich
enough - or, like me, crazy enough - to spend Pounds 1,200 on a suit.
Second, you must go to 31 rue Cambon to spend it. Chanel owns 68 shops
worldwide, but these tend to sell its classic styles. The really good stuff
is only sold at rue Cambon.
Perhaps, like me, you expect to be able to saunter into rue Cambon for your
outfit early in the season - perhaps September for the autumn collection, or
February for spring - after you have flicked through the fashion magazines.
Forget it.
Chanel receives just one delivery of each style, each season. Once it sells
out, it cannot be re-ordered - and the best styles sell out immediately.
This is because the rue Cambon vendeuses tip off regular clients in advance,
and also send them a catalogue. If they spot anything they want, the clients
ask their vendeuse to reserve it. (They can cancel the order, but if they
cancel too often, the vendeuse might not be quite so helpful next season . .
.)
That is why the hottest lines - certainly those in standard size 38s and 40s
 -never get into the shop, and that is why rue Cambon will be virtually bare
by September.
You might think that this sort of behaviour went out of fashion at the end
of the boom-time 1980s or that, even in France, where Chanel is a national
institution, the recession would have dented demand for Pounds 1,200 suits.
Not so. Chanel deliberately cultivates an aura of exclusivity, and it is
house policy to under-produce the collection.
The policy works. I had coveted a black boucle Chanel suit with funky gold
zips ever since I saw it at the pret a porter show in April. As soon as
supermodel Linda Evangelista sashayed along the catwalk, I knew that I had
to have that suit - whatever it cost.
Chanel posted its catalogues three weeks ago. The collection arrived at rue
Cambon on the following Monday. I hit the shop at opening time on Tuesday -
and got my suit. It was the last one left in a 38 and, judging by the
squeals in the stockroom, my vendeuse had to fight another sales assistant
for it. She returned triumphant to tell me how lucky I was to have the
honour of spending most of my disposable income on it.
Another woman was almost in tears, having pointed to jacket after jacket
only to see the vendeuse shake her head and mutter the fatal word 'fini'.
Chanel, at 31 rue Cambon, had already sold most of its winter collection, in
July, after just one day on sale.

FT  25 JUL 92 / How To Spend It: Subtle checks for artful interiors
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lovers of Shaker furniture will probably like the new range of checks,
plaids and stripes that Sanderson, the furnishing fabric house, has brought
out to meet the new feeling for simpler, less elaborately furnished
interiors. These are not crisp, innocent or sunny checks but sophisticated,
subtle, subdued versions suitable for artfully simple interiors, where white
walls are perfect backdrops for good pictures and fine furniture. The fabric
is a tough, hard-wearing 54 per cent cotton and 46 per cent Modacrylic in a
variety of colour combinations - plain cream teamed with sage green, dusty
pink or dark blue or combinations of navy, beige and cream, dark green,
beige and cream, dark red, dark green and cream. At Pounds 23.95 a metre
simplicity does not come cheap these days. Checkmates, as the collection is
called, is widely available - call 071-636-7800 for your nearest stockist.

FT  25 JUL 92 / How To Spend It: Holiday wrinkles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU are packing your bags and heading for costa or plage then you will
not need to be told that too much sun is very demode these days. Not only
will too much sun age the skin as surely as it wrinkles the prune, but it is
dangerous to boot.
Now that we have got that out of the way, on to the good news - these days
there is a vast range of sophisticated products that cater for every niche
problem which the holiday in the sun or by the sea is likely to raise.
Tired of suntan oil getting in your hair, on your clothes and on to the
sandwiches? Estee Lauder's oil-free spray is the sun protection for you.
With an SPF (sun protection factor) of 8 (not high enough for very pale skin
or babies) it really is light and is quickly absorbed into the skin. (Pounds
12). For babies or very delicate skin go for a complete sun block - Lauder's
Baby Block, for instance, has a 20+ protection factor. (Pounds 15).
Lancaster is another good name to look for. This summer it has developed
three products with bio-Melanin that give increased protection from UVA
rays, such as Melanin Sun Wrinkle Cream (SPF 8) which can be worn under
make-up and costs Pounds 21 for 50 mls. Also useful are the Melanin Lip
Protector (SPF 12), Pounds 8.50 and a light, non-oily Sun Eye Treatment (SPF
8) aimed at the delicate eye area, Pounds 10.50.

FT  25 JUL 92 / How To Spend It: The high priest of frivolity - Look out
London, here comes Christian Lacroix
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNTIL NOW British fans of Christian Lacroix, the exuberant Parisian
designer, have had to cross the channel to see the full range of the
master's clothes and accessories. To be sure, they could see a small
selection of authentic Lacroix at Harrods and the Hans Crescent boutique A
La Mode, but to the true aficionado this was more like a teasing taster when
what they wanted was the full menu.
All this is set to change. From August 3 they will be able to trot along to
8a Sloane Street, London SW1, where a brand new Christian Lacroix shop (a
franchise owned by Roberto Devorik) will be selling the full Lacroix range.
From haute couture to pret-a-porter, from petits bijoux to chaussures, from
legwear by le Bourget to 'cravates pour l'homme', all the details that make
up the look will be on sale.
Lacroix, you may remember, is the most recent addition to the gilded circle
of haute couturiers with salons bearing their own name. After coming to
Paris from Arles he worked at Hermes and Jean Patou before Bernard Arnault,
whose conglomerate, Financiere Agache, also owns Dior, financed the opening
of the house of Lacroix just five years ago. From the beginning he attracted
headlines. His were not clothes like any others. The frock-fanciers and
fashion press divided into two camps - those who thought he was extreme,
over-the-top, unwearable, and those who thought he was the best thing to
happen to haute couture since fashion's high priest Yves St Laurent last
blew away the cobwebs.
For his visual repertoire Lacroix draws on his Provencal childhood - the
colourful symbolism of the corrida, the fiery Provencal fields and sunsets,
the folkloric dress, a rich ratatouille of cultural references that make his
designs instantly recognisable to the cognoscente.
He has been a marvellous complement to the perfect, tasteful, understated
approach to fashion which reaches its apogee in the work of the Italian
designer Giorgio Armani and which much of Paris aims to emulate.
Tastefulness is not one of the thing that Lacroix rates highly. He is on
record as saying 'bad taste is better than no taste,' and that for him
'vulgar is not pejorative, but ordinary is.'
His designs show what happens when a designer is released from the
constraint that taste imposes. He has huge fun with colour, with patterns,
with textures. His collections are alive with visual puns, with wit and - a
rare quality in the tres serieux world of haute couture - frivolity. What is
the point of fashion, he seems to say, if it is not fun, extravagant,
seductive, ephemeral?
His clothes are not for the shy or retiring. Beloved of showbiz stars, of
the International Herald Tribune's Suzy Menkes, of the East Coast and Texan
'Pay and Play Set', they are vibrant, colourful and above all highly
feminine.
The new shop will stock a small collection of haute couture numbers, as well
as a video and photographs, that customers can admire, gasp at, try on and
even order. Trying to get a clear idea of what a haute couture number really
costs is like trying to get a true picture of the state of the Mirror Group
pension fund - what I CAN tell you is that suits will start (start being the
operative word) at about Pounds 2,000.
The pret-a-porter collection is a little more affordable with suits starting
at Pounds 950, dresses at Pounds 657, skirts at Pounds 120. Then there are
the distinctive accessories which offer a little of the Lacroix glamour for
much, much less. You could buy earrings for Pounds 49, brooches for Pounds
39 upwards, gloves for Pounds 135 (not just any old gloves, these may well
be gauntlet or brilliantly coloured or highly embroidered), or shoes (again
embroidered) for Pounds 102. And even more affordable, roughly 20 per cent
less than the pret-a-porter prices, is the Pre-collection, offering
cruisewear in winter and less formal spring and autumn wear.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Property: Choppy waters for marina sales - The recession has
hit the market for homes with a berth, but David Hoppit finds grounds for
optimism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOPPIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THEY TOOK a swampland near Southampton, covered with silt, dug some ditches
through it and built some homes around them - and they called it Hythe
Marina Village.
That was back in 1984 and the idea of a home with a berth at the back door
was born. Suddenly, everyone wanted to build by the water: by 1989, there
were plans around the UK coast for 40 developments costing a total of Pounds
2bn.
Not everyone welcomed the revolution, though. Those not interested in boats,
notably the Worldwide Fund for Nature and the Royal Society for the
Protection of Birds, saw development of the nation's mud flats as a threat
to the environment.
Before the advent of the marina village, the UK's 3m 'boaties' and
'yachties' had to content themselves with a few overcrowded and expensive
marinas and estuaries. The concept of the marina village, though already
established in areas such as the south of France and Florida, seemed set to
revolutionise boat ownership in the UK. Depending upon one's definition of
'boat,' there are between 500,000 and 3m owners in the country.
Those unable to live permanently alongside the object of their desire, be it
dinghy, sailboard or 50 ft yacht, wanted to leave their London office at 5pm
on Friday and be with their vessel in good time for hot toddies and plat du
jour. That is one reason why Peter de Savary's marina development in
Falmouth, Cornwall, has been so slow to sell - it is too far from the
capital to travel for the weekend.
The cost of building the marina and infrastructure at Hythe was Pounds 20m.
The lock alone cost Pounds 1.5m, coping with double tides with a range of 18
ft.
Mooring fees would never repay the price (the pioneers at Brighton Marina
discovered that to their cost) and so, with the aid of expensive piling, the
houses and apartments were built beside the berths.
For a while, the properties sold well. Marina Developments itself
constructed four more marina villages to add to its scheme at Hythe. Then
the property market sailed into the doldrums - and we have been in recession
ever since.
In a bubbly market, no property has more froth than a marina home, but
prices have gone flat and boats, like houses, have sunk in value. Recessions
do not last forever, though, and marina homes could represent good value
today.
Peter Thompson, acknowledged guru of the marina village, is heading a
management buy-out of the housebuilding interests of Marina Developments as
the parent company, Yattendon, wants to focus on its core activity of marina
ownership and management.
'Sales of homes in genuine marina villages have, in fact, held up quite well
despite the recession, but there has been a serious realignment of prices.
The desire to own a property with adjacent berth is as strong as ever,' says
Thompson.
'At least 90 per cent of our buyers have no material borrowings. They buy
their second or retirement home by the water with inherited money or out of
personal savings.'
The Pounds 17.5m management buy out (or 'buy in' as Thompson prefers to call
it) will give the new company about 70 built and unsold properties in the
five villages, some 300 plots, plus certain commercial and retail interests.
The average price of homes in the next year or two is likely to be about
Pounds 200,000, only half that of the 336 flats and houses sold since 1986.
So, are marina homes a good buy? Martin Edgar, whose company, Waterside
Properties, specialises in (yes) waterside properties, believes they are.
'Environmental and planning restrictions mean that marina homes built today,
together with the last few still in the pipeline, represent a finite total
number that will be built along this stretch of coast,' he says.
Prices are down 35 per cent on two years ago and there might be a further
short-term fall back, but he feels there will be profits to be had in the
medium term. The temporary glut of property 'at astonishingly low prices' is
unlikely to reappear, he believes. (Waterside Properties: 081-542-9599).
At the shore of the huge Poole Harbour in Dorset, southern England, not far
from the town centre, 60,000 cubic metres of earth was excavated by
developer GEMSA to build Moriconium Quay. Now, 100 Mediterranean-style
houses and flats are being built there (the name was given to the area by
the Romans in AD 45).
Each house will have a wet berth. Flats will have a dry berth, operated by a
fork-lift truck and paid for out of the annual maintenance and security
charge of Pounds 1,550 a unit. Despite a rather unprepossessing approach,
these are excellent homes with generous room sizes.
Savills is selling the houses and apartments. The houses, from Pounds
285,000, have four bedrooms plus a ground floor yachting room. Smaller flats
will be built later; those available now are large (2,300 sq ft) and cost
Pounds 450,000. One great advantage of this marina, opened recently by
yachtswoman Clare Francis, is that the tides permit easy 24-hour access
without lock gates.
Many of the big house-building companies also have dipped their toes into
the marina business. Barratt is no exception, having recently completed 277
homes at the 110-berth St Peter's Marina Village in Newcastle, northern
England. This is the first purpose-built marina on the Tyne and is close to
the city centre. Houses and flats remaining are priced between Pounds 90,000
and Pounds 121,500.
Laing Homes is proud of the town houses at its West Quay Marina in Yeading,
near London; moorings are available for buyers and there is also a 100 per
cent part exchange scheme and a 9.5 per cent mortgage. Houses there cost
from just under Pounds 130,000; apartments from around Pounds 58,000.
Houses fit for most wallets are being built by Charles Church at Avonmere
Marina, in Trowbridge, Wiltshire, by the Kennet and Avon Canal. The first
phase of houses and flats costing between Pounds 50,000 and Pounds 150,000
has sold out; work is now progressing on the next phase.
The same builder has found a formula for beating recession in Richmond,
south-west London, where its waterside homes at Richmond Bridge have
attracted enormous interest - since Easter, 14 reservations have been made.
The 124 houses and flats in the first phase cost between Pounds 122,000 and
Pounds 675,000.
Hunting Gate Homes, which has an interesting marina development in London's
Limehouse Basin, also is selling homes to people with a passion for water
sports at St Lawrence Bay, in Essex. The houses and bungalows, some with
gardens sloping down to the River Blackwater, are close to the new Bradwell
Marina. Prices are between Pounds 72,950 and Pounds 115,450.
Not far away, at Burnham-on-Crouch, one of the country's top yachting
centres, is the new 350-berth Burnham Yacht Harbour with 42-year leases
starting in price at just under Pounds 20,000 for an eight-metre boat.
Nearby, there is a splendid development of houses and flats beside the river
at King's Wharf. Prices, through Savills with Bairstow Eves, range from
Pounds 60,000 to Pounds 245,000, so there is something for most pockets.
The market in marina property might be dormant at the moment but there are
plenty of people still dreaming of oiling the pintle and sailing into the
offing. A fair breeze might not be long coming.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Property: Eyes Wight - but few do - Mainland buyers stay
away
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HANSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ISLE of Wight is a curious place. Where else but Cowes would most of the
shops shut for lunch in the one week of the year when the town is thronged
with thousands of visitors wanting to spend money? And where else would it
be so difficult to get them to look at property?
The problem, of course, is the recession. And the Isle of Wight depends more
than most places on outsiders to invest in the top end of the property
market.
Last year, John Lelliott re-developed the four-acre site of the Victorian
railway station and a school in the centre of Cowes. But its first phase of
33 apartments at Admiral Gardens has attracted only five buyers at prices
from Pounds 52,500 to Pounds 250,000 (through Nationwide's local office;
telephone 0983-292-141).
Roger Easton, managing director of John Lelliott Residential, explains: 'We
have not dropped our prices because our problem is not the product. People
are very impressed with what they see but we are not getting enough people
from the mainland to come and see it.'
Yet, Lelliott is selling to local people at Mortonbrook, a re-development of
a former caravan park at Sandown where 37 of the first 40 new houses and
flats have been sold at prices from Pounds 38,000 to Pounds 49,500.
The Rotch Property Group also has had difficulty attracting buyers for the
Gloster, its redevelopment of the hotel that used to be the Royal Yacht
Squadron's waterfront home at Cowes. So far, eight of the 15 apartments have
been sold through Nationwide at prices from Pounds 85,000 to Pounds 165,000.
Things are little better elsewhere on the island. At Ventnor, the former
Heights Hotel has been demolished and the four-acre site, with planning
consent for 26 houses, is being offered for sale by Allsop &amp; Co.
(071-584-6106) on behalf of receivers for the the developers.
Since the Halland Hotel at Seaview Bay was redeveloped three years ago by
Westridge Horton Homes, its parent company, Leading Leisure, also has gone
into receivership. While all eight waterfront houses were sold at around
Pounds 225,000 each, only three of the 30 flats have been sold through
Nationwide, acting on behalf of the receivers, Price Waterhouse. But five
have been reserved since prices were cut (they now range from Pounds 62,500
to Pounds 145,000) and the last three of the 20 retirement flats that
Leading Leisure developed at Newport were sold last week.
That is encouraging news for Hewitts (Southern), which has redeveloped
Seaview's central bus station in a joint venture with local builder Caws &amp;
Hermans. Known as the Anchorage (although it does not have any moorings),
the project is just inland from the Seaview Yacht Club.
The 16 houses and flats at the Anchorage have just gone on the market at
prices from Pounds 69,000 to Pounds 159,000 through the local office of
Nationwide (0983-612-212) and the Bournemouth office of Savills
(0202-298-585).
Peter Hewitt, a former helicopter pilot turned builder who started Hewitts
(Southern) when he moved to the island two years ago from Cranleigh in
Surrey, is reluctantly selling his own property, Steyne House at Bembridge,
for which the local office of Nationwide (0983-872-141) and Savills at
Bournemouth want Pounds 650,000. Steyne is a handsome, late-Georgian
building in 21 acres of well-maintained grounds.
There are buyers around - that was shown by Humberts' sale of Barton Manor,
Edward VII's former home at East Cowes, and its 105 acres which were bought
for Pounds 1.1m by Robert Stigwood, the impresario.
Paul Jackson of Lymington (0590-674-411) hopes this augurs well for
Shalfleet Manor, a 17th century house near Yarmouth, which he is offering
with 420 acres of land for Pounds 1.5m.

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THREE new motoring books make a nice change from those of the 'Complete
history of the side-valve Ford V8' variety (does anyone ever read these bar
the author?).
In The Green Car Guide (Merlin Press, Pounds 7.99), co-authors Paul
Nieuwenhuis, Peter Cope and Janet Armstrong analyse minutely the
environmental impact of the motor car.
This is not in the least boring because a mass of facts is presented clearly
by a level-headed, apparently non-partisan trio.
Stuart Bladon's Observers Cars (Frederick Warne, Pounds 4.99) is not an A to
Z guide to everything car on the market but a summary of 181 vehicles cars
he feels are worth writing about.
Two dozen of them have 'the invaluable and often-appreciated asset' of a top
speed of more than over 150 mph (245 kph) and three are rated at 200 mph
(322 kph) plus.
Just what you need nowadays. Yet, an important newcomer like the Volvo 850
GLT is not mentioned.
Never mind; it is an entertaining if subjective little book.
If you like buying cheap petrol or sometimes find yourself down to the last
few litres late at night, Easy Driver (Seven Points Publications, PO Box
119, Chichester PO18 9LY, Pounds 3.99) should be in your car's glovebox.
It lists all supermarkets serving petrol, 24-hour filling stations, fast-fit
and car hire outlets and hospitals with major accident and emergency
departments. Also included are the best round-the-clock roadside and
recovery companies and much else to interest a thrifty, independent
motorist.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Diggers locate secrets of Xerxes' lost canal: Tales from the
earth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
XERXES was the king of ancient Persia who took the long road to Greece in
480 BC to punish the Greeks for supporting rebels and, when he got there,
lost the battles of Salamis and Plataea. Rather more recently, there have
been full houses for a superlative production of Handel's opera Xerxes at
the London Coliseum.
Played poignantly as an arrogant and capricious despot, we find him
infatuated with a tree as the curtain goes up. Then he has the mad idea of
linking Asia and Europe by a bridge over the Hellespont (Dardanelles), but a
storm puts paid to this icon of folie de grandeur. Nor does he get the girl
he fancies. It is an old story of futile pride. But a state-of-the-art
archaeological project in Greece this past autumn shows it is not just a
story. Xerxes really was a man who did things on the grand scale. Sub-soil
radar has found the great canal he dug across Mt Athos to bring his navy
down safely to southern Greece.
Long buried and forgotten, Dr BJ Isserlin and an Anglo-Greek team of
scientists have located it again with the radar, which looks into the ground
from a sledge. It emits radio waves, like conventional radar, and measures
those that bounce back when they hit an interruption - a hard task, as all
there is to detect underground is the change between the fill and the sides
of Xerxes's canal.
The lack of buried structures stretched the new technique to its limits. But
it found the line in 3-D beneath 7-8 metres of hill slide, and has plotted
it for 2,200 metres without the expense of digging. Its length is exactly
what the Greek historian Herodotus gives: 12 stades (or furlongs).
Handel's picture follows Herodotus, who paints Xerxes as a wayward tyrant
with whom brave little Greece battled (and beat) despite overwhelming odds.
But even Greeks thought his monuments in Persia staggering. If you go to
Iran, do not miss the palaces of Xerxes and his father, Darius, at
Persepolis. Huge columned halls stand on a great podium. The sculptures show
28 subject nations from the Ionians (the Greeks on the Aegean coast of
Turkey) in the West to the Indians in the East carrying tribute in
procession to the king.
When Darius died in 486 BC, Xerxes inherited Persepolis - and problems in
the empire. The Ionians had revolted in 499 and Athens supported them.
Darius went to punish them but lost the battle of Marathon in 490. He had to
be avenged.
Preparations for Xerxes Greek campaign of 480 were stupendous. The army was
so vast that it could drink a river dry, Herodotus says, and Xerxes numbered
it by corralling 10,000 men into a tight pen, releasing them, and then
marching the rest into the pen in turn. That gave a total of 1.7m troops, an
exaggeration probably by nine or 10 times. Even so, it was a huge number.
The Hellespont is a mile wide and flows fast as the Black Sea joins the
Aegean. Although nothing survives, and Byron did not bump into any bits when
he swam across, the bridge was a superb idea. But Xerxes could not control
the weather (Handel gives full vent to the storm) and the first bridge
broke. He was so angry that he ordered his men to give the Hellespont 300
strokes of the lash, saying: 'O bitter water, our master lays this
punishment on you as you have wronged him though he has never done you
wrong.' The engineers were executed. The new ones tied two lines of ships
together, stretched cables between them, and laid a road on top. Xerxes sat
on a marble throne to watch the army cross. It took two days.
The Athos peninsula was the next obstacle. Earlier, the Persians had lost
ships sailing round it. So, Xerxes ordered the canal through its narrow
isthmus and put men to dig it under the lash, in the style of the river Kwai
railway. The Greeks thought the scheme odd, as they were used to
island-hopping across the Aegean. But the Persians liked to keep their land
and sea armies in touch in alien territories, for security and flexibility.
Although Herodotus described this marvel of ancient engineering in detail,
there was no archaeological exploration until Isserlin came. 'Up to now, the
search has been better than my wildest dreams,' he says, certain that there
is a big ditch underneath and not a haulage-way for ships as at ancient
Corinth. Eventually, he hopes to dig trenches to see how it was constructed,
but with the accumulated debris and soft ground there is a risk the sides
may cave in. He might, however, be able to solve his final problem: who were
the surveyors? Greeks coerced to work for the king? If he finds that the
canal's dimensions fit Greek measuring systems, the likely answer is 'yes'.
After Athos, Xerxes marched on down Greece, forced his way at Thermpoylae
(where 300 brave Spartans resisted to the last man) and destroyed the
temples on the Athens Acropolis and in the country around, while the Greeks
prepared to hold the isthmus of Corinth. But he lost his navy at Salamis,
and the army lost at Plataea the following year. Greece triumphed. In 464,
Xerxes was murdered in a palace intrigue.
If Herodotus came back today, he would be delighted that his account of the
canal stands up so well to modern science - and that Handel saw Xerxes the
same way he did.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Motoring: Let's take a brake, dear - The British fondness
for estate cars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN BRITAIN, estate cars always have had overtones of broad acres, labradors
and well-cut tweeds. Even today, older motorists still call them shooting
brakes.
It was not like that on the continent where the estate was reckoned to be a
trade vehicle, halfway between a car and a van. (Curiously, the French, who
have always made some of the best estate cars, still speak of them as
'breaks.' No, I don't know why they spell it that way, either).
The first German maker to acknowledge that up-market buyers might want a
nicely-furnished estate car for carrying such things as saddles, not sacks
of cement, was Mercedes-Benz. For some years, its 200-300T range of estates
has been an industry benchmark. Audi (first with the slant-tailed 100/200
Avant, then the new 100 estate) and BMW (3-series and 5-series Touring) got
in on the act.
Now comes a new, more compact, dual-purpose Audi developed from the 80
saloon. On mainland Europe, it will be called the 80 Avant; in Britain -
where it will not be available until early 1993 - it will simply be the 80
estate.
A seven-model range goes on sale in Germany in October. Three have
four-cylinder engines (two-litre petrol developing 90 and 115 horsepower
plus a 1.9-litre, 90-horsepower, direct-injection turbo-diesel). All are
front-wheel driven.
There are front-wheel and four-wheel driven quattro versions of 80 Avants
with five-cylinder, 133-horsepower or 150-horsepower, 2.6-litre V6 engines.
Power steering and a five-speed manual gearbox are standard; automatic
transmission will be optional only on two front-wheel driven models, a
four-cylinder and a V6.
Like all Audis, the new 80 Avants have the Pro-Con Ten system that tightens
front-seat belts and retracts the steering wheel in a crash severe enough to
shift the engine backwards. ABS brakes are fitted to all 80 Avant quattro
models and on the front-wheel driven 2.6E, but are an optional extra on the
others.
Prices and the UK market specifications are still being discussed. In
Britain, though, Audi 100 estates are only Pounds 721 more than the
equivalent saloons. If the Audi 80 estates were available now, an educated
guess would price them from Pounds 14,500 for the entry two-litre model to
more than Pounds 22,000 for the V6-engined quattro. That would make the
least expensive 80 estate about Pounds 1,400 cheaper than a BMW 318i
Touring, which Audi clearly has in its sights.
In Germany earlier this month, I sampled three of the new estates: a V6, the
turbo-diesel and a five-cylinder quattro. The V6 was particularly refined
and still very quiet at an indicated 130 mph (209 kmh) even though its low
overall gearing put the rev. counter needle at close to 6,000.
The higher-geared turbo-diesel was almost as tranquil cruising at 100 mph
(161 kmh) on the autobahn although, naturally, it felt far less urgent.
Buyers may find some compensation in its claimed average 52.3 mpg (5.4 l/100
km) fuel consumption.
On dry and generally smooth roads, the advantages of the 2.2-litre,
five-cylinder quattro's expensive all-wheel drive transmission were not
obvious because the front-wheel driven cars gripped and handled so well.
It would, though, have been a different matter on the snowy mountain pass
where I so nearly got stuck in a Renault Safrane some weeks ago.
The rear seat back-rest and cushion fold to make a flat, fully-carpeted load
floor.
You have to remove the rear seat head-rests first. But - a thoughtful touch
 -Audi provides holes into which the head-rest supports can slot so they
will not get lost or dirty on the floor.

even in the world of fresh foods. First, there were stewing packs of diced
root vegetables; stir-fry packs of bean sprouts with batons of courgettes
and carrot; and whole cauliflowers stripped of their leaves and broken into
sprigs, plastic-filmed and on a tray ready for microwaving.
Now, it is hard to buy rocket on its own, although every supermarket offers
it as an ingredient in a ready-washed-and-mixed salad leaf pack. And vandals
seem set on destroying the sculptural beauty of pineapple which is sold
ready-peeled, cored and stamped into unenticing rings. Next? Probably
ready-peeled-and-pipped grapes, marketed as 'the ultimate gift for the
sick.'
In the face of all this hideous trimming, I am defiant. I buy vegetables in
bunches whenever I can. There is something reassuring about their earthy
exuberance. The billowing leaves and whiskery rootlets fighting to escape
the wasp-waist rubber bands that hold the stalks in check are a happy
reminder that real food still exists. Vegetables should be bursting with
life when they reach the cook.
In Mediterranean markets, leeks and milky-fresh garlic often are displayed
with their long flowing leaves intact. Tomatoes may be sold in long tresses
on the stalk. Herbs are tied in sweet-scented nosegays. Ruby and white
ribbed chards are offered in colourful bunches. So, too, are tiny green and
violet artichokes, as pretty as bouquets of flowers.
In Britain, peppery watercress and radishes traditionally are bunched. So
are baby turnips and young carrots the feathery foliage of which so
delighted the Stuarts that these royals pinned great green sweeps of it to
their hats). Then there are bunches of summer beetroots, a welcome sight in
the shops just now and stars of my recipe this week.
The aromatic sharpness of blackcurrant and the earthy sweetness of beetroot
team well, a glowing partnership that is particularly good with rich meats
such as duck.
BEETROOT AND BLACKCURRANT SALAD WITH DUCK
To serve 4-6 people, allow 1 x 5-6 oz boneless duck breast portion per
person. Fry them gently in a heavy-based pan, cooking them skin side down
for most of the time to avoid toughening the meat and to render most of the
fat. Pour off the fat as it runs from them.
Let the cooked duck rest and cool completely. Carve into thin slices for
serving and spread the cold jellied pan juices on lightly-toasted ciabatta
to eat with the meat.
The beetroots, like the duck, should be prepared several hours or a day
ahead. Snip the leaves off  3/4 -1 lb of them, taking care to cut well above
the bulbous roots or they will'bleed' profusely and lose colour in cooking.
Do not trim the whiskery rootlets. Save the leaves to use for another dish:
chop them, stew in butter and use for stuffing pork or an omelette.
Wash the roots gently and cook them in boiling water with a slice or two of
lemon for an hour or so until the skins feel loose (or bake them for twice
as long in a low oven). Cool completely (in the cooking liquid if boiled).
Strip  1/2 lb blackcurrants into a pan. Add 3-4 tablespoons water and 2
tablespoons sugar, or more to taste. Cover and cook until the fruit is warm
and tender and the juices begin to flow.
Keep the flame low and shake the pan occasionally to encourage even cooking.
Fierce heat and/or stirring risks overcooking and breaking up the fruit.
Let the cooked fruit cool a little while you skin and dice the beetroots.
Grind plenty of black pepper over them, then pour on the contents of the
blackcurrant pan. Mix gently, adding a splash of the beetroot cooking water
to thin the sauce if liked, and strew with a little chopped tarragon, dill
or mint.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Drink: A French defence against the world - The low-cost
country wines of France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDMUND PENNING-ROWSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOST imaginative innovation of the French wine authorities in the past
20 years was the initiation in 1973 of the category of Vin de Pays  - French
country wines.
After the reform of superior vineyard areas started in 1935, with the
Appellation d'Origine Controlee system (AOC), backed by the moderately
successful Vin Delimite de Qualite Superieure (VDQS) classification in 1951,
the industry was left with an enormous wine lake.
It exceeded half the country's annual production and used to be called Vin
de Consommation Courante, but now bears the EC title Vin de Table. This was
subject to almost no control beyond a minimum alcoholic strength of 8`.
The majority of Vin de Table came from the Midi, presenting a problem as
much social and political as vinous. To interpose a further control system
that did not insist on specific grapes local to a particular district, and
over-restrictive maximum yields on wines bound to sell at low prices
presented some difficulty.
But, after an enabling decree in 1968, production started in 1973 under
specified rules, followed in 1979 with detailed production practices and
minimum analysis standards.
A Vin de Pays is a table wine with a geographical origin. The grapes for
each must come from a recommended list in its department, the yields must
not exceed 90 hl per ha, and 80 for a few zonal or regional ones. The
minimum strength is 9` but 10` in the Mediterranean regions.
Yields must be declared and the relevant denomination - as there is often a
choice between zonal, departmental and local. Chemical analysis must
accompany the request for registration, including such items as alcoholic
strength, total acidity and sulphur dioxide content. This is followed by a
tasting by a panel including growers, merchants, and oenologists.
There are four regional denominations, 39 departmental and 98 local ones.
The names on the labels have been chosen with promotional care.
Who could resist Vin de Pays du Jardin de France (Loire) or Vallee du
Paradis (Aude)? And those who remember Alfonse Daudet's parish priest of
Cucignan may well be encouraged to sample its Vins de Pay, its 7,000 cases
of almost entirely red wine are largely made by the local co-op.
The greatest improvement in French wines today is taking place in the Midi,
and 85 per cent of the Vins de Pays are produced in Languedoc, Roussillon
and Provence. This has given the peasant growers something to aim for and
better, though still low, prices.
The figure are impressive. In the first authorised year of 1974, production
amounted to 6.2m hl, but was over 11m last year - half the total French Vin
de Table and more than 25 per cent of 1991's heavily reduced wine
production.
In the UK the Vins de Pays were launched in 1979, with the equivalent of
78,000 cases sold that year. Last year, the total was 427,000 cases. Now
they are to be found in every supermarket and on every wine merchant's list,
many of which include special selections for them (although these often
confusingly contain wines such as Bergerac or Cahors, which are Appellation
controlee and not Vins de Pays). Vins de Pays generally cost between Pounds
3.50 and just under Pounds 6 a bottle and provide almost embarrassingly wide
choice.
The most popular here is white Cotes de Gascogne, produced mainly from the
Ugni Blanc and Colombard grapes grown for armagnac. Some 20 years ago, this
was a very depressed area making otherwise very ordinary Vin Ordinaire. Now
it produces about 1.9m cases, with Germany and the UK the biggest importers.
The Vins de Pays are France's low-price-wine defence against the New World.
The Italians are preparing to launch a category lower than DOC - IGT
(Indicazioni Geografiche Tipiche), which very much resembles the Vins de
Pays system. While French wine exports have been generally falling, those of
the Vins de Pays are at least stable and may be still increasing.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Drink: Through an aperitif glass, darkly - A few
pre-prandial stimulants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITONS do not have much truck with aperitifs; they offer their guests 'a
drink' but this rarely has any relevance to the fact that everyone is about
to eat. White wine probably is the most popular; if you are lucky, you get
champagne. In old-fashioned houses, it is sherry, whisky or gin.
Aperitifs, however, are not to be despised. They serve a real purpose:
setting the gastric juices in motion and literally 'opening up' appetites
for dinner. As such, they deserve a deal more thought.
As I learn from Andre Domine's useful book Die Kunst des Aperitif
(Weingarten 1989) - which, being written in German, is unlikely to reach the
wide audience it deserves - aperitifs came into being at the close of the
18th century when, because of the upheaval caused by the French revolution,
restaurants were beginning to achieve importance.
Significantly enough it was the 'Father of the Table' Grimod de La Reyniere
who was the first to advocate le coup d'avant to excite the appetite before
a meal. Grimod also called for a coup du milieu: a glass of spirits used to
reactivate the appetite in the middle of a lengthy dinner or banquet. This
idea survives as the trou normand - a glass of calvados being brought to you
before the main course.
The first aperitifs were absinthe and vermouth of various sorts. Absinthe
was finally banned on health grounds in 1915. In the next two decades the
market was flooded with less lethal imitations such as Pernod and Ricard. It
was Ricard which created the Provencal myth around pastis by its advertising
which focussed on blue seas and southern landscapes. Ricard drinking in
Marseille - or anywhere else - is no older than the creation of the company:
1932.
Most of the flavoured wines we call vermouth were created in the second half
of the 19th century. Campari was founded in 1867, but opened its first
factory only in 1892. Lillet, the aperitif wine known to all who visit
Bordeaux, was created in 1887; Byrrh in 1890. Some like Picon were flavoured
with chinchona bark or quinine and were thought to be useful in combatting
malaria in the French African colonies. Picon was the French colonial
version of the British g and t.
A glass of pastis with water and ice still seems to me to be a perfect
summer aperitif; preferably accompanied by a bowl of green olives. Pastis is
particularly kind to the stomach, and, unlike a more alcoholic aperitif,
negronis spring to mind, it does not have that heaviness which ends up by
killing your appetite. Younger people in France do quite disgusting things
to pastis mixing it with Grenadine or peppermint cordial. This is not to be
recommended if you are about to sit down to lunch.
Once in a blue moon I quite enjoy a gin. Both Gordon's and Tanqueray I find
too overtly flavoured with juniper, which gives them an almost sickly smell.
Better are Beefeater or Bombay which have more complexity of aroma. The best
gin and tonics I ever drank were made by a veteran of the Sudan Political
Service who kept everything (even the glass) in the fridge. He insisted on
using oranges rather than lemons because they went better with the tonic
water.
An American-style dry martini would kill your appetite in the majority of
cases, but gin can be combined with vermouth in less powerful doses. I
recall an old headmaster offering me a vermouth in his holiday home in
Provence. He filled a tumbler three quarters full then from under the table
brought out a gin bottle and topped it up. 'I thought you were offering me
vermouth,' I quibbled. 'Without the gin it is undrinkable,' he replied.
In certain senior common rooms gin and French is still the favoured drink
prior to High Table. People used to drink 'gin and It' - gin with red, or
Italian, vermouth; or even gin and mixed - a combination of red and white.
It has been a long time since I have seen one of these.
Bitter drinks such as Campari tend to be effective when it comes to
stimulating appetite. In France the equivalent of the 'Camp sod' (as a
friend used to call his Campari and soda) is often a gentian-based aperitif
such as Suze. This is not for the faint-hearted: for many it is like taking
a swig from a scent-bottle.
One aperitif I rediscovered only the other day was a mint julep, made by
steeping Bourbon whiskey (sic) mint and sugar for ten minutes; adding more
whiskey and crushed ice, then stirring. Best Bourbons are Maker's Mark, Wild
Turkey and George Dickel.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Food: The priest and his busy nights with Carmen - A
restaurateur with a mission
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE SONSINO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CARMEN has opened in Seville. Not the opera, although this may feature in
Spanish celebrations this year, but a restaurant. It is the latest in the
empire of Luis Lezama, a businessman with an unusual mission: to provide
work for reformed juvenile delinquents.
This seems an unusual occupation for an astute restaurateur. But Lezama is
also a priest and if he sees any contradiction in his calling and running a
highly profitable chain of restaurants he does not show it.
'I am using the hotel trade to bring people new knowledge of themselves,' he
says with great satisfaction. He cites the fact that many of the former
'petty thieves' - he calls them his brothers now - are in demand worldwide,
to teach and train others in the Spanish cooking styles they have made their
own. His staff are exchanged with Hungarians, with Czechs from Prague and
even with Japanese.
When not in Seville, managing the opening of Carmen, Father Lezama can be
found at the headquarters of his restaurant chain, the Cafe de Oriente in
Madrid. Upstairs at this popular cafe-bar, across the square from the Royal
Palace, tourists and the Madrilenos, chat openly, sipping cocktails or the
numerous Mexican beers. But downstairs is more discreet. King Juan Carlos is
a regular guest in the Comedor del Rey, the King's Room.
The Comedor, once the 15th century cellar of a medieval convent, is panelled
off from the restaurant's 20 or so other diners by a trellis wall, inches
thick, lined with blood-red velvet. Eavesdroppers, intentional or not, are
foiled by music from the discreet but powerful loudspeaker outside the only
entrance to the salon.
Beneath the high arches of the brick-walled King's Room, the guests usually
remain anonymous. The maitre d' declines to tell diners whether it is the
king who lunches or whether the guests are high-ranking politicians or
judges. Whoever they are, the diners are treated to Michelin-star service by
Lezama's award-winning restaurant brigade.
Across the salon table, Lezama does not look like a man who has taken holy
orders. His suits are well cut, his glasses expensive. He does not sound
like a priest, either. His talk is of profits, of expanding his restaurant
group and of fine foods. But, in the early 1960s, he set himself to work
with young troublemakers in the village of Chinchon and then in the suburbs
of Madrid.
In 1974, with the permission of the church, he negotiated a loan from a
local bank and bought a small restaurant-bar, Taberna del Alaberdero, which
he staffed with former offenders. Profit paid the wages and the remainder
was reinvested in the restaurant.
Now, almost 20 years later, Lezama's interests have expanded, with the
express permission of the church, to include an outside catering company and
six restaurants in Spain, as well as a restaurant in the US, another Taberno
del Alaberdero, in Washington DC. What started as a simple idea, to create
work for young offenders, has become an empire embracing high quality
service in the restaurant and hotel business.
What Lezama calls his foundation today employs 370 people and has its own
board of directors. On the board sit many of the founder members of the
first Taberno del Alaberdero, including Francisco 'Paco' Moreno. 'Paco, my
Paco', says Lezama proudly, pointing to the man serving the meal, 'is now
maitre d' at the Cafe de Oriente.'
Paco deferentially ignores Lezama, and continues to present the meal,
announcing it as wild duck in a fine, crisp, puff pastry. Lezama in turn
explains how the pastry normally takes four to five hours to prepare in an
oakwood oven. However, he boasts, the head chef, Santos Garcia Munoz, a
long-serving member of 'the family', can do it in three.
Without anyone noticing, the table has been cleared, the cutlery changed by
the deft Paco, and the next course arrives: salmonetta, young salmon. The
dish is decorated with a fan of thinly sliced courgettes on a spicy pimento
sauce. To accompany the meal he offers tender, warm, onion bread.
Though Lezama does not take the fish course, he is for a moment distracted
by the succulent salmon. 'Madrid is the finest port in Spain, although far
from the sea. We buy the finest fish here for all our Madrid restaurants.'
It is the emphasis on excellence at the Cafe de Oriente that has earned it a
Michelin star, and enables it to charge prices ranging from Pounds 50-Pounds
60 a head. 'We expect mainly the business visitor,' says Lezama, as if to
apologise for the price. Upstairs at the cafe-bar, prices are also high,
usually Pounds 35-Pounds 45 a head.
In spite of the high prices business is good, reports Lezama. The
foundation's total turnover is about Pounds 2.75m (Pts500m), with a profit
margin of 9-10 per cent a year after tax.
Although the bulk of profits are reinvested in the foundation, he explains,
all the managers have shares in the business, which helps to explain their
long-term interest.
It would be possible to improve the turnover and the profit of the
restaurants still further, he says, but the company would lose any increase
in taxes. 'We prefer to invest the money in the resturants and create new
jobs.'
To prove his point Lezama explains that his empire is still expanding. Now
Carmen is open and, for the first time, hotel rooms have been added to the
foundation's assets, at the Taberno del Alaberdero restaurant, also in
Seville. With only ten suites, the five-star hotel was intended to be pricy:
from Pounds 200-Pounds 280 per person, per night, depending on the season.
However current rates range from about Pounds 140 per night night. Whether
Lezama's pricing strategy will attract the business he seeks, and whether
his newest restaurant is a success, remain to be seen. But he hopes this
latest production of Carmen will have a happy ending.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Fishing: A Mecca in the West - Good-value hotels for fishing
holidays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JONATHAN YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE ARE salmon. And there is fishing. And then there are the fortunes
sacrificed trying to connect the two.
Three seasons ago I saw a thigh-booted character off-loading fish from the
back of a Bentley. Five minutes and 28 fish later he told me that he was
'reasonably satisfied' with his haul, caught on the prawn on the Tay, in
Scotland. I remarked that his fishing must be expensive on such a great
river. He inhaled deeply and held up his cigarette. 'Stop for a fag and the
time'll cost you 12 quid.'
The Tay, Spey and Tweed are the holy trinity of salmon rivers, but the
lesser meccas for the fisherman lie in England's West Country. The rivers
babble through Exmoor, Dartmoor and Bodmin, jolly rather than grand,
surrendering their fish to those with luck and doggedness rather than
fist-thick wallets.
The river Barle clatters past within view of the Carnarvon Arms'
dining-room, hurrying those still at breakfast. The hotel, just outside
Dulverton, on the Devon-Somerset border, owns 5 1/2 miles of fishing on both
the Barle and its big sister, the Exe.
Shaun Blackmore is wine waiter at night, ghillie by day, able to advise on
both a burgundy and the hook size of a Mallard &amp; Claret. He oversees the
fishing-fly cabinet next to the reception desk, at the end of a hallway
lined with rod-rests and two sets of scales.
Utterly wild, scarlet-spotted, West Country trout eat frugally in the peaty
water and seldom weigh more than three to the pound. A pounder is a
specimen. A two-pounder has abandoned the meagre insect protein; he is a
cannibal. 'Of course, you could try for an early spring salmon,' suggests
Shaun, now in ghillie role.
Half-an-hour later, flicking a Silver Doctor over the Exebridge Pool, I am
joined by a dipper, which bobs briefly before disappearing underwater in
search of caddis-fly larvae. Good fishermen concentrate on fishing, not
birds. Gazing upwards, gathering in the line ready for the next cast, it
stops abruptly. The rod tip is jerked downwards - but sadly an algaed
branch, not a silver salmon, slides to the surface.
The chill of Exmoor water decanted down a slipping wader is sufficient
inducement to return to the hotel's drawing-room. There are three to choose
from in this most old-fashioned of hotels, each with apple-log fires and
soporific armchairs. The wine list is reasonable and packed lunches are
readied at an evening's notice. The hotel's seclusion makes it popular with
couples.
The Half Moon Inn is so secluded it could hide Elizabeth Taylor. Secreted in
Sheepwash, north Devon, it is known only to locals and fisherman, the latter
migrating there every April and May. This is a serious fishing inn. The two
Inniss brothers have run it since 1958, Benjie keeping the vast wine cellar
while Charles juggles cooking and fishing.
Charles is initially brusque: 'Everybody who's here this weekend is a
regular. Been coming for years. So we don't get the prats who whinge if they
don't catch a fish.' This event statistically becomes ever more commonplace.
Charles explains: 'When my parents bought this place 35 years ago there were
six fishing pubs on the Torridge and the 2 1/2 miles of river we had here at
Sheepwash would produce 80 salmon. Now we have to rent some of the best
beats on the Torridge to catch 30.'
The statistics do not unduly worry the many anglers huddled into the
fire-place end of the flagstoned bar, where they are outnumbered, two to
one, by the malt whiskies. Opposite the bar is a photo-montage of anglers
cradling salmon, as happy as if they were holding their first-born
(actually, they look happier). The faces around the bar match the pictures;
this is a fishing inn for the cognoscente.
Beginners would do better to book in at the Arundell Arms Hotel in Lifton,
two miles away from the Tamar, beyond which Cornwall begins and, so
Devonians maintain, England ends. The hotel is run by Anne Voss Bark, a
woman of poise and authority; she is also chairman of the local branch of
the National Rivers Authority.
Four rivers - the Thrushel, Wolf, Carey and Lyd - spill down from Dartmoor
to her fiefdom, where they merge with the Tamar. The Arundell Arms has the
fishing on 20 miles of them, with beats of between half-a-mile to 1 3/4
miles. Salmon run the Tamar and the Lyd, and at night both rivers will
surrender sea-trout, but only to anglers who can cast a fly with the
delicacy of a diplomat. Those who crack their fly rod like a Ben Hur
charioteer will find these wild fish unforgiving.
However, salvation is at hand. Anne Voss Bark's husband, Conrad, runs a
series of courses, ranging from a weekend's introduction for tyros to
advanced salmon-casting.
The salmon run to 10lb, though lurking leviathans are suggested by the
tubular brass-scale in the hallway, marked 'Salmon' and calibrated to 22lb.
Even more optimistic is the trout-scale, notching up the half-ounces to the
4lb mark.
Only Horace ever reached that weight. Embalmed in varnish, he stares
glassy-eyed over the instruments of his destruction lining the hotel
entrance - a brass Hardy reel; a bamboo fishing-pole; a collection of
battered fishing flies.
For years this tyrant trout was a finny friend of all who stayed at the
hotel, then under the command of Major Oscar Morris, who ran it for his
chums. All initiates to this charmed circle were invited to drop a fly over
Horace's nose. Disdain was the only reaction. One Commander Chilton knew
nothing of this when, in 1942, he broke off from war to spend some leave at
the hotel. He came. He cast. He caught Horace. Returning triumphant, the
Commander was met by disbelief, then horror. The stuffed fish remains, in
admonishment.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Gardening: New varieties are still the spice of life - Three
trial sweet peas from Unwins Seeds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A VISIT to the sweet pea trials of Unwins Seeds, in Cambridgeshire,
Britain's biggest producer of new sweet peas, revealed much about this
little-publicised side of the flower seed industry. The trials comprised
nearly 400 seedlings, but only three were selected as new varieties for next
year's market.
There are two types of sweet pea which are popular with the public and
produced for sale on a large scale. They are the Spencer type, which has
four blooms per stem, and the Multiflora, or Galaxy, type which has more.
Since it is almost impossible to get more than four flowers fully open and
fresh at the same time - and faded flowers, or unopened buds, are
unacceptable to those who exhibit sweet peas - the Spencer type is favoured
for show purposes. By contrast, Multiflora is popular with those who grow
sweet peas in the garden, or as cut flowers for the home. It makes a fine
show, unopened buds look attractive and faded flowers can be cut off.
Breeders are always looking for changes, such as in flower character or
colour, as happened nearly 90 years ago when the first Spencer sweet peas,
with their attractively-frilled petals, appeared among the old unruffled
Grandiflora type, which is still grown but not on a large scale.
Such large mutations are rare and, for the most part, only minor differences
in flower size, shape and colour are being obtained. For example, I saw
sweet peas with slightly hooded petals which gave the flowers a deeper look
and would certainly be worth following up. But this form is not yet ready.
The three newcomers which have been chosen for next year, and will be on
sale in a few weeks, are Her Majesty and Daphne, both Spencer-type sweet
peas, and Columbus, a Multiflora.
Her Majesty is ruby-rose, a striking colour which I like very much and
imagine will be immediately popular. Daphne is officially described as
lavender, although that suggests to me a cooler tone than that of this very
beautiful flower. Columbus is a very light blue with cream undertone,
certainly unusual and highly regarded by the Unwin specialists but not a
colour greatly to my liking. All three are sweetly scented - anyone who
doubts the perfume of the modern sweet pea should have been with me that
mild, rather humid morning when the air was full of sweetness.
A peculiarity of the sweet pea flower is that it is normally
self-fertilising. If one wants to make a cross between two different
varieties, one must do it by hand, first removing the anthers before they
have ripe pollen from the flowers that are to produce the seed, then
transferring ripe pollen from the other chosen parent to the ripe stigmas of
the emasculated flowers.
In their first generation, these hybrids may appear even in character, as
many F1 hybrids do, but in subsequent generations the characters of the two
parents will segregate, giving much wider variation from which to select.
The difficulty then is to re-create two breeding varieties of any particular
seedlings which may seem desirable. Sometimes, the professionals pass this
kind of work on to amateurs, who can have fun for a few years before selling
them back to the professionals.
For trial purposes, Unwins sow their sweet peas about October 10, ten seeds
in each five-inch pot, in John Innes No 2 soil-based compost. The seedlings
are over-wintered in frames and are planted outdoors at the end of March
where they are to flower. The seedlings are allowed to grow naturally
without removal of side-shoots and are widely spaced against wire-netting
supports. They are at their peak flowering by late June and are setting seed
by July.
Unwins has an arrangement with a relative living in New Zealand which makes
it possible to get a first seed crop by early the following year and so
hasten the process of getting the new varieties to market.
It is also possible to grow sweet peas from seed sown in February or March
in a temperature of from 10`C to 20`C, the higher temperature to be
preferred. These seedlings can be planted out in April or early May for
summer flowering. Seed can also be sown in the open ground in April but with
rather more risk of losses in germination.
Some varieties, especially among the blue and maroon colours, produce a
proportion of seeds with extra hard coats which absorb water with difficulty
and so may be slow to germinate. The traditional remedy for this is to chip
hard seeds with a penknife, taking care to do this on the side of the seed
away from the eye or germ. A quicker and safer way is to rub the seed (again
on the smooth side) on sandpaper to scarify the hard coat.
In contrast to this problem, some seeds, especially among the orange and
cream shades, are soft-coated. Sometimes the seed coats actually split,
making them unattractive in appearance. These soft seeds are more sensitive
than normal seeds to cold or wet and need a little extra care, such as
choosing a porous seed compost and maintaining a genial temperature.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Gardening: Plant of the week - Penstemon Schoenholzeri
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS IS one of the best bright, red hybrid penstemons. It also appears in
nursery catalogues as firebird
and ruby - attempts to give it a more acceptable name for the
English-speaking market - but Schoenholzeri is correct. It is an evergreen
perennial which may be damaged by cold in winter indeed, it can even be
killed - for which reason it is wise to root cuttings in August or September
and over-winter them in a light but frost-proof place before planting
outdoors in spring.
It grows about 3 ft high and has slender spikes of tubular flowers which are
produced successfully most of the summer, making it very useful both for
borders and for use as a bedding plant. It thrives in all fertile soils and
sunny places.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Gardening: Time for a flirt among the petals - Robin Lane
Fox is keen to improve the stamina of his roses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE first rose season has ended in a mass of sodden petals: after this
week's storms, what are the prospects for a second? Poor roses, we expect so
much of them. We want scent, colour, resistance to weather and flowers in at
least two seasons.
Second seasons are vastly better if you and I take trouble over them. We
have to prune, feed, water and do our own research. This weekend, we should
start by deadheading any rose which might flower for a second time.
Deadheading is a most therapeutic job, especially before breakfast or in the
half light of a warm evening.
Like any therapy, it needs to be done properly: it involves a small degree
of pruning. Do not cut off only the heads and leave bits of stem which
wastes energy before they die back to the nearest pair of leaves. Cut them
back to healthy leaves immediately and throw them away.
If possible, feed any second-season roses with diluted Phostrogen, sprayed
all over the leaves. Repeat this feeding every 10 days or so: specific rose
feeds might be even better, but I use Phostrogen because it suits every
other plant in the garden and is effective but vastly cheaper.
All the care in the world will not make a once-flowering rose flower twice.
Breeders have concentrated on the double season, except among ramblers. Many
of their modern varieties will flower twice, but many of us wish they did
not even flower once.
Older roses have more flowers, better colours and better scent. The choice
of long-flowering varieties is much more skilled. If you want an old rose
which flowers almost continuously, you should choose a pink China Rose and
learn to live with its slightly harsh colour. Alternatively, you can
convince yourself that you are one of the many gardeners who likes small
roses of purple fuschia-red. Here, one old-fashioned variety has a strong
scent and an admirable record for flowering twice.
It is called Rose de Rescht and will suit any small garden because it can be
kept to a height and width of 3ft. As it grows over, its potency fades. It
needs to be pruned hard each year if it is to perform twice from middle age
onwards. I have heard it said that a pot pourri of this rose's petals will
do similar wonders for the stamina of older owners, but I leave you to find
out.
Neither of these two easy roses ranks high on my list for colour. I much
prefer pale pinks, stripes and crimsons: here I continue to learn, helped by
the book of a great rose-grower, Peter Beales' Classic Roses. The original
1985 version has now been merged into a bigger dictionary called simply
Roses and costs Pounds 35.
Peter Beales distinguishes repeat-flowering roses (marked R) from continuous
flowerers (marked C). He would be the first to admit that repetition and
continuity depend on the season, soil and owner. Ever-suspicious, I have
been fishing round his C's, hoping at least for an element of R. Sometimes,
I have ended up with my own rating, BABS: it stands for, well, Bloody Awful
Black Spot. Sometimes, I have had only one flowering, but there are some
near-C's too and if they are C with me on a stony Cotswold soil, they will C
like mad for Essex girls on rose-rich clay.
Among climbers, the choice is pretty obvious. The most continuous is
Kathleen Harrop, the pale pink sport from the stronger rose-pink thornless
Zephirin Drouhin. On my soil, Kathleen scores high marks for BABS too, but
she certainly flowers for months and is easy to train on to wire or into a
low hedge because she has no thorns to catch you unawares.
Among bushes, try the button-pink Jacques Cartier, my No 1 R which is almost
C and certainly more C than its close relation, the fuller and more pink
Conte de Chambord.
Light pruning will keep Jacques Cartier about 3ft high and wide, making it a
marvellous old rose for small gardens. This Portland variety was bred in
1868, but is almost unobtainable, except from a few specialists. I have seen
it in France, growing with gusto near Aix-en-Provence. The leaves are tough
and the flowers will stand sun: perhaps it could be more widely marketed for
expatriate demand.
As for the striped roses, Beales gives a C to the pale Vick's Caprice and a
R to the darker Ferdinand Pichard which is flecked with white. I would give
Vick an R and Ferdinand a half-R if you feed him properly. Certainly, they
are the longest-flowering choices among old-fashioned forms with stripes and
splashes and they refute the people who dismiss these colours because they
last only for a fortnight. Among the oldies, they are good ones to choose,
but like other oldies, they cannot always keep up the act all summer.
What matters about an oldie is its quality and fashion, not its date of
birth. Gardeners can be more relaxed about these matters and I am pleased to
find that Beales gives the coveted C to many of the more recent varieties
with China Rose blood in their pedigrees.
I have never found that the pink Madame Butterfly is as continuous as he
implies, but this year, I have filled a gap in the spectrum by finding a
genuinely C dark red. Admittedly, Mme Louis Laperriere is even younger than
I am, having started life in 1951. However, she grows only 2ft high and
really does flower every fortnight, beginning with young flowers of a
splendid dark red. She is not strictly an old rose, but the height and
colour are most convenient. Every grower except Beales seems to have
forgotten her, but who could resist a true C in red with a name as elegant
as hers.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Travel: Burgundy, only the real thing will do - Film critic
Nigel Andrews, motoring aimlessly around French country lanes, finds more
delights than in all the guidebooks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SMALL silver-grey object hurtling through Burgundy once a year to or
from the Cannes film festival is a Honda Ballade. It belongs to this writer,
who, when let out of a cinema, is known to attach himself recklessly to a
steering wheel.
He is also known to be astounded on discovering a real world out there
beyond the movie screen: real people, real trees and, above all, in
Burgundy, real castles and cows.
Although the Cote d'Or is, strictly speaking, a smallish region to the north
of Nuits St George, it should be stretched to take in all those
buttercup-covered, cattle-thronged, history-haunted fields to the west - and
north-west and south-west - of Dijon.
Here is the most beautiful part of France. You may keep the Dordogne and the
villages of Provence. Keep, too, the Loire valley, with its hordes of
tourists. This region of Burgundy is what the world was truly like when it
resembled a medieval illuminated manuscript.
Consider first all those entrancing motorway signs. Not 'Beaune 52, Lyon
216' but those chestnut-and-white tourist information signs saying,
sometimes with illustration, 'Vezelay, colline eternelle,' or 'Paysage
Avallonais,' or 'Oiseaux migrateurs,' or 'Buses, rapaces, utiles.' This last
refers not to local transport facilities but to the heraldic-looking
buzzards that wheel rapaciously overhead.
Above all, there are cows and castles. The cows are white, the castles grey
to pinkish-brown. The cows are more beautiful than any others in Europe,
large dozy sirens with long eyelashes, quizzical muzzles and gleaming
alabaster hides. Their fastidious choice of a standing or recumbent position
is known to predict the weather better than any other of their kind east of
Dover.
And the castles, unlike the set-syllabus ones on the Loire, are charmingly
battered grandees with missing towers or sinking keeps. They seem to be
growing back into the landscape, repossessed by Nature. Once they were
watering holes for the famed Ducs de Bourgogne, a dynastic foursome that saw
Burgundy to the height of its power between 1364 and 1477. Now, scattered
widely around a line between Auxerre and Beaune, the castles testify to the
ivy-threatened ephemerality of power.
Rather than list them all, let me try you out on the poetry of their names -
Ancy-Le-Franc, Le Chastenay, Couches, Chateauneuf-en-Auxois - and home in on
two favourites. Bussy-Rabutin, near Flavigny, north-west of Dijon, is a
dinky-toy version of Chantilly. Four cream-coloured towers surround an
originally medieval house, the facade of which was revamped in the 17th
century by Roger de Rabutin.
Roger, a colourful fellow, was exiled there by Louis XIV after contributing
some scurrilous lyrics about the king's love life to an orgy that he, Roger,
attended. Once so sequestered, Roger wrote the salacious Amorous History of
the Gauls, available from the chateau bookshop, and had the walls painted
with allegorical tableaux.
Many of these were also salacious, but they were so deeply encoded in
symbols that few today can understand them, least of all a British film
critic trying to follow the fast French of a lady tour-guide. At least we
can wonder at their surreal oddity - here an exploding haystack, there a
giant onion sitting in a road, here a female nude, there a flailing red-eyed
monster of no known sex.
My other favourite among Burgundian chateaux is Commarin, north of Beaune.
Lost somewhere in time and an overgrown French village, it could be
auditioning as a location for Le Grand Meaulnes. 'Through two 18th century
gates one penetrates into the Court of Honour' (I translate from Henriette
de Ganay's useful Les Routes des de Ducs de Bourgogne, price FFr18). The
castle, never sold, has been lived in by the same family since the 14th
century. And the 16th century tapestries are dazzling: flaming globes,
mermaids, lions in every known heraldic position, and scrolls with teasingly
obscure legends (Tant le desir; Aigre et douce).
There is another modest centre of magic in Burgundy and one that nourishes
both cows and castle-dwellers - the source of the Seine. Tucked away near
the village of St Germain, this little-signposted enclosure of tree and
field and water belongs to the city of Paris. Paris is possessive about its
noble river, howsoever humbly it gushes forth from beneath a nude stone
Nereid presiding over a fake grotto in this undersung tourist site.
In truth, there are several other sources if you go walkabout in the region.
But this was deemed the principal one by Napoleon III who erected a plaque
to the grotto's left. In the harsh sunlight one can barely read the incised
legend, so why not turn to the more helpful English-language guidebook.
'Water courses uncompromising out cavern,' it says, 'beginning its mighty
arch through a land of forest to the grand burg.'
The grandest burg around here is Dijon, closely followed by Beaune. This
brings us to the subject of cooking. I have tried to put a tactful distance
between my last mention of Burgundian cows and my next topic, which is boeuf
a la Bourguignonne. As made in Burgundy, it is an indelible experience.
Using good meat marinaded for about six years, the dish sends flavours
rocketing around your mouth. Wine, onion, mustard, bacon, garlic, herbs  - a
hint of orange - and all this swilled down with a good bottle of St Emilion.
If you cannot bring yourself to eat the beautiful white cow of the Cote
d'Or, the other Burgundy special is jambon braise a la creme - succulent
slices of ham covered with a brandy and cream sauce and garnished with . . .
but that is enough. I am sitting in a London flat and Burgundy is too far
away.
There are few, if any, bad restaurants in this region. But my happiest
eating experiences have been in a little town called Arnay-Le-Duc, where
Chez Camille gets rosetted by Michelin and other cheaper dining-rooms are
barely less good. As for accommodation, its proximity to the motorway and
its modest prices make the Val Vert at Pouilly-en-Auxois a good bargain
(beware of the ants in Room 21). Dijon and Beaune are full of good
middle-price hostelries, many taken over by the voracious Mercure and Altea
chains.
There is one more thing worth saying about Burgundy. You should not go
simply to the places you are told to go to. Motoring aimlessly around
country lanes, one finds more delights than in all the guidebooks. At
Clomot, near Pouilly, there is a gorgeous view of a private chateau with a
long lilac-topped wall and a white horse grazing in a stream below. At
Pouilly itself there is a magically overgrown railway station, last in
active service when Claude Lelouch directed Jean-Louis Trintignant in some
French film whose shooting I stumbled on six years ago.
And at almost every turning in every road there is a view of lush green
hillsides studded with whiter-than-white cows. The sight makes one swear off
beef for life. Or at least until dinner-time, whichever comes sooner.

FT  25 JUL 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Power and the glory - but can it
continue? - Samaranch's triumph
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT a homecoming the Barcelona Olympics represents for Juan Antonio
Samaranch. The years of self-imposed exile surely will slip away as the
Spanish president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) enters the
stadium this afternoon wreathed in glory. Undoubtedly, these Games are a
triumph for him: no political boycotts, no cash worries, and all staged in
his home town.
Samaranch, 72, concedes that the death of Franco, the long-time Spanish
dictator, in 1975 left him with little future there. Already in late
middle-age, Samaranch was associated too closely with the regime to hope
that his public life as a diplomat could continue. But his time at the helm
of the Lausanne-based IOC has been a brilliant renaissance for this frugal,
driven individual.
Yet Barcelona could turn out to be a briefly-shining hour. Samaranch will be
at the heart of the fiercest politicking in town during the fortnight of the
Games. He will have served 12 years as president when his present term ends
next year. Will he stand again?
Until he announces his decision, his potential heirs will be lobbying and
vote-gathering in the corridors of the Princessa Sofia hotel. In this, they
will be as fiercely competitive as the athletes down on the track.
Students of the IOC constitution - and no organisation loves its protocol
and conventions more - are quick to tell you that 'His Excellency' is
entitled to stand again. Loyally, they add that he probably would not be
challenged should he do so. Among rank-and-file IOC members, merely
abstaining from voting on a motion approved by Samaranch is regarded as
spine-tinglingly rebellious.
Nevertheless, should the king of world sport die - or just fade away - there
must be a successor, and key candidates are already jostling for position.
Their names will be unknown to most sport fans, but one of them will become
the new leader of the 'Olympic family,' a nation-state without a country,
the secular equivalent of the Vatican.
Within the IOC, everyone's favourite for the race is Canadian lawyer Dick
Pound. He has been Samaranch's able lieutenant for a decade, acting
willingly as a stormtrooper where the president's role dictates a need for
public caution. Pound has played the blunt Anglo-Saxon to his boss's
silver-tongued Latin.
Aged only 50, the tall, granite-featured Pound has become the second most
powerful man within the IOC by virtue of heading the financial negotiations
with the world's TV networks for Olympic rights. That the IOC grossed
Dollars 1.9bn between 1989 and 1992 is due largely to Pound's commercial
acuity.
He also works as a lawyer for Adidas and is at the heart of the complex
commercial relationships that link the IOC to its commercial agent, ISL,
created by the late Horst Dassler. Pound is exceptionally close to
Samaranch.
As happened to Samaranch during his diplomatic career, though, Pound could
find himself associated too closely with the ancien regime. Commentators -
including the authors of a controversial recent book, Lords of the Rings,
who took a highly-critical view of Samaranch and the Olympic movement - have
begun to view its overt commercialism with pragmatic rather than
philosophical distaste.
Unlike a government or corporation, there is little in the way of checks or
balances to counteract the IOC's sweeping powers. Few within the
organisation seem to believe there can be too much Olympic money, or even
that it could be misdirected.
Outside, the perspective is different. Samaranch misjudged badly the world's
view of his fiefdom when he attempted to shield and defend Robert Helmick, a
lawyer caught lining his pockets in his capacity as a US member of the IOC.
Those who found their loyalties jolted by the sophistries that emerged from
Lausanne at that time may turn to a somewhat different sort of candidate for
president. Pound is, after all, a younger member of the old guard rather
than a new broom.
Kevan Gosper, an Australian member of the IOC for nearly 20 years and a
senior executive with Shell, based in London, is another leading contender.
A silver-medal runner at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics, he is more independent
than Pound within the IOC, but equally respected.
Gosper is due to retire next year from his job controlling the Pacific rim
for Shell and, at only 59, would have a full 15 years to devote to the
Olympic movement. He confirms that he would stand if Samaranch decides to go
but adds, firmly: 'He has told us he will make a decision after Barcelona
and, should he decide to stay on, he'll get my full support.'
Optimistic myopia is virtually a chronic condition within the narrow ranks
of the IOC - there are only 92 members - but Gosper seems curiously immune.
'In aggregate, I think there's an impression abroad that we've become less
Olympic and too pre-occupied with our administration and financial
structure.'
There has been recent criticism that TV companies (particularly US
networks), having paid millions for the rights to show the Games, have
influenced the content and scheduling of events, sometimes to the detriment
of competitors.
To this, Gosper says: 'We need television to broadcast the Games, but there
must be no question of them (the networks) deciding the content or timing of
the programmes. I think we need to find a better balance with
commercialism.'
Of course, it might be that the task of heading the IOC is becoming rather
like occupying the White House - an impossible job from which the most
suitable candidates shy away. Peter Tallberg, a respected Finnish IOC
member, has noted that the IOC presidency is now a position that brings
trouble to both the individual and his country. Perhaps Samaranch will go
quickly, at the zenith of his power and acclaim. On the other hand,
courtiers have never been too strong on advising monarchs about their state
of undress.

FT  25 JUL 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Fanatical Brit eyes hat-trick -
Rowing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROWING is said by physiologists to be the most demanding of sports. It makes
demands on heart, lungs and muscles that are at the limits of human physical
capacity. A member of the House of Lords once described it as something that
'the French reserved for convicts and the Romans for their slaves.'
These factors make the 1992 record of Steve Redgrave, Olympic gold medallist
in 1984 and 1988, quite remarkable. Redgrave and his partner, Mathew
Pinsent, were achieving world standards even if they were not winning
regattas. Then, last month, a team doctor suggested Redgrave have a check-up
following weight loss during a winter illness. Specialists diagnosed
colitis, sparked by salmonella contracted while training in South Africa.
Redgrave was enormously relieved, having nursed secret fears about his own
health for some months. But it was as an athlete that he reacted most
strongly. 'We're right up with the fastest crews at way below 100 per cent
fitness. Just think what we'll be able to do at Barcelona when I'm fit,' he
said as he headed off for treatment with diet and drugs.
At the Olympic rowing course in Banyoles, 130km from Barcelona, Redgrave
will be attempting to win his third consecutive gold medal, a feat achieved
only five times before in the sport. One of those greats was 'Diamond John'
Kelly, father of the late Princess Grace of Monaco. Pinsent, 21, will be at
his first Olympics, having not even taken up rowing when Redgrave won his
first medal at Los Angeles.
Those who attach importance to the well-preserved ruins of the English class
system might be amused by the Redgrave-Pinsent partnership in the coxless
pairs. Redgrave, son of a builder, left comprehensive school at 16 to pursue
full-time sport. Pinsent, son of a Hampshire clergyman, won a double Blue at
Oxford after an outstanding school career at Eton. He has twice rowed in
winning Boat Race crews.
This combination was unbeaten in the 1991 season. They twice defeated the
previous world champions, from Germany, and won at Lucerne by a nine-second
margin. At the world championships in Vienna, Redgrave-Pinsent stormed home
to a further gold medal.
Pinsent, who rows stroke, lists his recreations as 'golf and testing Steve
on time zones and gold medal-winners.' The latter is a good-humoured dig at
the degree of Redgrave's obsessiveness. Before the Tasmanian championships
in 1990, the pair had been training in Canada. Hoping to avoid the
body-clock problems of too many time changes, Redgrave decreed that they
would row their Henley training sessions at night.
Keeping up with Redgrave, physically and emotionally, is undoubtedly a
problem for his partners. He denies being obsessive about rowing, but
relatively few other people in a still-amateur sport train seven days a week
for 49 weeks of the year. Andy Holmes, with whom he won gold in 1988, chose
not to face four more years. Interim partner Simon Berrisford was sidelined
by injury in 1990.
It was that accident that led team managers to insert the available Pinsent
into the empty seat. Coincidentally, the arrival of new coach Jurgen Grobler
from the former East Germany also helped to re-energise Redgrave, who had
been dabbling the previous winter with bobsleighing and stood on the verge
of the national team.
Grobler's biggest single contribution in the early days was to suggest that
Pinsent rowed stroke. It was an audacious move, considering Redgrave's
seniority in the team. But it worked, and Redgrave-Pinsent regained the gold
medal at the following year's world championship.
Redgrave really is a man for all oars. He won his first Olympic gold in the
coxed four. But he regards his most satisfying achievement as the
Commonwealth gold in the single sculls at the 1986 games. Only because he
was achieving such success in the pairs did Redgrave fail to pursue his
lonely excellence.
It is an open secret inside sport that the administration of British rowing
has been a dog's breakfast for the past decade. One of the few sports at
which the country excels on the world stage has been virtually unable to
find major sponsors; and atheletes such as Redgrave, without question the
world's finest individual rower, earn a frugal living as sports consultants.
Had Redgrave turned his commitment and physical skills to tennis, he could
even now be ranked, say, 115th in the world and earning more than Dollars
100,000 a year for playing in a dozen tournaments.
Tough life for the wet bobs.

FT  25 JUL 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: The archer who will ignite the world
 -Peter Berlin previews the next fortnight's prospects for athletes,
television networks and couch potatoes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THIS EVENING, an archer will fire a flaming arrow in the air which will come
to earth who knows where. On its flight, it will ignite the Olympic flame.
The flame is a symbol of the Olympic ideal, a signal that competition may
start and that for 16 days the city of Barcelona has become the modern
Olympia. Unfortunately, the symbolic and the real are some way apart. The
great mishmash of sports that is the Olympic Games is beyond the scope of
even a city as cosmopolitan and spendthrift as Barcelona. The Games have
burst past the girdle of mountains that belts the city and spilled beyond
the Games' 16-day fortnight.
Competition started yesterday with four soccer games, including one 360km
away in Valencia, and a burst of Basque pelota. Tomorrow afternoon the Dream
Team, a gang of towering American millionaires, will sweep down from their
luxury rented villas and slam-dunk a basketball through the five hoops of
the Olympic ideal.
The basketball stars' experience of the Games will be in sharp contrast to
that of the true amateurs of the modern Olympics: the fans. Many spectators
will be taking time off and paying their own expenses to be there. For them,
the next 16 days will be a serious strain on energy, cash and the host
city's organising ability.
There is no substitute for being here in person - for sitting in the stadium
as the US team races to a world 400 metres relay record; as the Dream Team
peaks in the basketball final; as the world's best young soccer players
battle for gold; as the men's hockey tournament reaches its climax . . .
except that you cannot, because all these events are crammed together on the
evening of the orgiastic final Saturday and spread around the four corners
of Barcelona.
But then, no one should expect the Olympics to make sense from a sporting
point of view. Nor should spectators expect things to be easy. The Games are
no longer run for the benefit of spectators or athletes, but for the TV
companies. This is no bad thing. After all, the broadcasters are trying to
serve billions of fans around the world.
The biggest team here is not entered in the Games. It is made up of 1,300
employees of NBC (versus 925 for the entire US team), which is involved in
the altogether rougher, more serious competition for audience share in the
US. Thanks to the efforts of TV companies and the miracles of tape delay,
video recorders, cable, satellite and remote control channel changers, couch
potatoes around the world can see the finals of the 4x400m and the
basketball and the hockey and the soccer should they want to.
For dedicated sofa slugs, the Olympics represent a test of stamina and
flexibility. The important thing is to pace yourself. In this respect, the
TV companies and the Olympic schedulers have co-operated to create a
viewer-friendly timetable. On many days, there is enough sport for 72,
sometimes 96, hours of non-stop live action. But unless their own country is
about to win a medal, the broadcasters will simply ignore many sports -
particularly non-telegenic events such as archery, shooting and fencing.
For sports which do interest the broadcasters, timetables have been tailored
to deliver the biggest audiences. The action is conveniently concentrated in
the evenings - to suit European and North American viewers - and during the
Olympic fortnight's three weekends.
In the basketball tournament, the US team will play the bulk of its games at
8.30pm or 10.30pm local time, while the final is scheduled for 10pm on the
last Saturday - prime time in the US. The two biggest medal sports,
athletics (43 golds) and swimming (31) helpfully get all the qualifying
nonsense out of the way in the early mornings and save their finals for the
evenings.
So far as broadcasters are concerned, swimming is the only game in town
during the first week. In the periods between Olympic Games, few
broadcasters would dream of transmitting swimming in prime time, but the
Olympics lend it status. Its central place at the Games is consecrated by
tradition. Swimming was in the first modern Games in Athens in 1896.
Swimming will award one in every eight gold medals in Barcelona.
While swimming is dull - swimmers race in straight lines at steady speeds,
so it is generally clear after 200m who will win the 1,500m freestyle - it
is also easily intelligible compared with wrestling. Viewers do not need to
understand the nuances of the tumble turn to understand who is leading.
As a matter of fact, the winner's rostrum at pool-side will provide an early
answer to one of the most intriguing questions at Barcelona. In Seoul four
years ago, the East German women won 10 of the 15 swimming events, seven in
world or Olympic record times. They collected 22 medals in all, and now join
forces with the West Germans (who won a silver in Seoul). But only two
members of that all-conquering team even reached the finals in the world
championships in Perth last year, and the unified German squad failed to win
a single women's gold.
If this happens again, and if the women's races also are slower than in
1988, it could be a sign that socialism really does produce better athletes.
Or it could be a sign (the IOC hopes, piously) that everyone is taking fewer
drugs. Socialism is the more likely bet. In this alone, the IOC and the TV
companies are at odds. The latter hope there will be loads of world records
to fuss over; the IOC hopes there are none.
The swimming winds up with its usual spray of relays next Friday night,
leaving the airwaves free for the other aquatic sports and for the one sport
guaranteed to draw women viewers: gymnastics.
The most glamorous TV event, athletics, starts quietly next Friday, too,
with the finals of the 20km walk and the shot put. The first significant
finals are the next day: the 100m sprints and the women's marathon, which
feature in Saturday's prime time. This irritates the marathoners, who would
rather start in the traditional cool of early morning rather than in hot
late afternoon.
After that, apart from the rest day on August 4, athletics keeps the pot
boiling with a steady stream of finals. Meanwhile, sports which know their
place, such as archery, kayaking and table tennis, sort out their medals
quietly at unobtrusive times, and the majority of the team ball games
(except baseball) as well as two viewer favourites, boxing and tennis, also
build toward their climaxes on that frenzied final weekend.
After the 29-medal blitz of the final Saturday, armchair athletes can make a
gentle start to the last Sunday. They can see six boxing finals in the
morning, watch the male marathoners tormented by the heat and the killer
hill - and then tune-in to the closing ceremony and the dousing of the flame
lit by the Spanish William Tell 16 days previously. By then, the Atlanta
organising committee will be at work on plans to offer viewers an even more
exhausting spectacle in four years' time. Given inflation, I doubt that
Atlanta will bother with a bow and arrow. Perhaps it will use an
inter-galactic laser to make its opening ceremony go with a bang.

FT  25 JUL 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Who gets what from the great
carve-up - How sponsorship has changed dramatically the way the modern Games
are funded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TODAY, the world will switch on its television sets to watch the start of
the biggest marketing event ever. By and large, viewers will be unaware of
the commercial overtones of the Olympics. What they want to see are sporting
glories.
But they will be part of a commercial event that has generated Dollars 1.9bn
worth of international sponsorship and television licencing deals involving
just one important brand logo: the five interlocked rings of the Olympic
Games. The NBC television network alone has paid Dollars 401m for exclusive
rights to broadcast the Games in the US.
Some members of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) are sensitive to
criticism that the Games are being undermined by sponsorship deals, drug
abuse, and the professional status of many athletes. But those criticisms
ignore history, according to Michael Payne, the IOC's marketing director.
He says the modern-day role played by big business in the Olympics is not
new and points out: 'There has always been commercial involvement, at times
far more excessive than now. There used to be in-stadium advertising in 1928
(now forbidden by the IOC). In Montreal (the 1976 summer Olympics), there
were 620 sponsors and suppliers. The Olympic rings were on everything,
including such inappropriate products as ladies' underwear and bananas, with
no control.'
What has happened since the financially disastrous Montreal Games is that
the IOC has come gradually to see the commercial value of the Olympics. It
has sold sponsorship and broadcasting rights in order to make profits to
plough back into international sport - and into itself.
The first thorough-going attempt to make money from the Games for the IOC
and its affiliated national members came with the 1988 summer Olympics in
Seoul, South Korea. In Seoul, though, the IOC was only beginning to discover
the extent to which multinational companies were prepared to pay fortunes
simply for the right to use the five-ringed logo. Thus, Barcelona 1992 is
held to be the first really determined example of a highly-organised and
centrally-planned commercial exploitation of the Olympics.
The central sponsorship deal for this year's winter and summer Games is
called The Olympic Programme, or TOP. Each TOP programme runs for four
years. In the present one, now ending, the IOC has attracted Dollars 175m
(part of the Dollars 1.9bn overall figure) from the 12 TOP sponsors. They
are Visa International, Coca-Cola, Mars, 3m, Time and its sister publication
Sports Illustrated, Bausch and Lomb, Ricoh, Matsushita, Brother, Eastman
Kodak, the US Postal Service, and Philips International.
Their contracts with the IOC forbid them revealing how much they paid
individually but Payne says the individual entry fee for the next TOP
programme - which will cover the Lillehammer winter Games next year and the
Atlanta summer Games in 1996 - is Dollars 40m. The European TV rights for
Atlanta have just been sold to the European Broadcast Union for Dollars
250m, against Dollars 90m for Barcelona.
Visa, the present lead sponsor, is thought to have paid about Dollars 20m
and the others about Dollars 14m each, either in cash or services and
back-up technology. Like all other TOP sponsors, Bausch and Lomb is using
its Olympic connections for other marketing purposes. It calculates that its
TOP contribution is 'probably doubled or near tripled' when other planned
promotional programmes, which are given an Olympic twist this year, are
taken into account.
Even those not sponsoring the Games directly through TOP regard the event as
a crucial TV advertising vehicle. According to the US trade magazine Adweek,
General Motors has bought Dollars 40m worth of television advertising time
in the US over the next fortnight, effectively blocking out some of its main
competitors. Adweek calculated that Honda and Isuzu were each buying Dollars
10m worth of prime-time TV minutes, with BMW and Volkswagen spending Dollars
4m each.
Sponsorship ensures that the Barcelona Games are unlikely to make a loss.
Perhaps the only sensitive topic left is the slicing-up of the cake. Of the
Dollars 1.9bn for the present TOP period, 75 per cent goes to the local
organising committees in Albertville and Barcelona, as well as to the IOC
itself.
The remainder goes to the national organising committees. Of the 170-odd
countries competing in Barcelona, 40 will take the lion's share since they
are deemed to have the largest markets. The Olympic committees of the
smaller nations - arguably, those with the greatest need for cash - will get
about Dollars 15,000 plus Dollars 400 per athlete sent to Barcelona.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Jugglers who balance the books,
too - How to profit from digital dexterity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE company chairman was showing off. He strode into the workshop, picked up
three of his best-selling products and started juggling.
Charlie Fairbairn, the 28-year-old co-founder of More Balls Than Most -
Britain's leading supplier of juggling equipment - has a right to clown
around. From start-up two years ago, his company has grown rapidly and now
commands 55 per cent of the UK market in circus-related products.
It is difficult to imagine a successful enterprise operating from the
company's cluttered headquarters. Housed in London's old Leather Exchange,
the premises look as though a three-ring circus has just decamped, leaving
its equipment behind.
Every surface is littered with brightly-coloured juggling balls; rows of
unicycles hang from overhead racks; there are spinning plates, devil sticks,
clubs and flaming torches by the caseload. A large sign suspended from the
ceiling reads simply: 'Are you ready?'
Fairbairn and his partner, Adam Gardner, think they are ready to expand and
recently have signed distribution rights in Sweden, Norway, the US and
Belgium. They decided to move into overseas markets following record sales
in their 10 UK outlets and through franchised retailers including Harrods,
where the juggling balls were the best-selling 'adult game' last year.
The two jugglers, who set up the company in 1990 using a Pounds 15,000
NatWest overdraft and a loan from the London Enterprise Agency, claim the
secret of their success lies in the feel-good factor. 'We make the world's
sexiest juggling ball - made from polymeric casing and filled with millet to
create a softer, more tactile ball,' says Gardner.
'It has an oooh factor which people find appealing,' his partner adds.
Since its launch, More Balls Than Most has grown from a four-person outfit
into an enterprise capable of producing 30,000 balls a week with 35
full-time staff and a further 30 casual workers who hand-sew the final
stitching on every ball. Turnover this year is expected to exceed Pounds
1.5m and Fairbairn hopes to see a profit of Pounds 250,000 on sales of more
than 750,000 balls.
From its humble beginnings on a market stall in London's trendy Covent
Garden, the company is now looking at ways of using new technology to
increase production. Already, engineering graduates at the South Bank
Polytechnic have helped to boost output by designing a unique 'ball-filling'
machine - one of those hypnotic pieces of equipment which you can watch for
hours. It uses suction to hold the balls in place while the correct amount
of bird seed is pumped in.
Although most of the company's sales are to individuals who want to learn a
new skill, Fairbairn sees corporate demand as the biggest growth market. A
number of groups such as Virgin and Paramount International have ordered
tailor-made juggling balls embossed with their logos. As an alternative
corporate gift, they are said to be more popular than diaries or umbrellas.
The juggling theme also is used as a promotional gadget. One computer group,
Peterborough Software, has balls carrying the slogan: 'You're safe in our
hands.'
They come packaged in a box extolling Peterborough's virtues. The motto on
the outside says: 'A company that knows what the left hand and right hand
are doing.'
The men behind More Balls than Most, both former computer salesmen, say
juggling should not be dismissed as a pastime but recognised as an important
antidote to executive stress.
Gardner and Fairbairn offer stress relief seminars to their corporate
clients, involving a crash course in circus skills. Juggling transcends age
and sex barriers and can ease desk-bound ailments such as repetitive strain
injury, says Fairbairn, who adds that it is prescribed by some US doctors as
an exercise to relieve arthritis.
The company hopes such uses will boost demand overseas. Exports represent
only a small part of their business at present, but the imminent launch of a
US mail order catalogue - to be delivered to 36m households - is expected to
attract more orders.
The optimism, however, is tinged with concern at the tough attitude of
lenders to small businesses. Export sales are desirable in order to ease the
company's cash flow problems.
'The fact we're turning over large sums of money sometimes sounds alarm
bells to banks,' says Fairbairn. 'If you are a company which is vulnerable
and trying to grow, then the banks can be very difficult.'
Like many other young companies with innovative products, the initial
success has to be measured against its borrowing. More Balls Than Most pays
3 per cent over base for its overdraft of Pounds 40,000 and has a factoring
of 2.75 per cent through Lombard NatWest.
Fairbairn refuses, however, to put finance at the top of his list of
priorities. He talks of 'a vision' rather than a business plan, and the
balls come with a booklet entitled A Short Course In Life Enhancement rather
than a guarantee.
'We're not just salesmen,' he says. 'We're teachers. Since we've been in
business, more than 150,000 people have learned to juggle. That's success.'

FT  25 JUL 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Hard tale in Bronte country -
Nick Garnett visits two beginners in the restaurant trade who have found the
going tough but rewarding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK GARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN the bank manager asked Muriel Jordan what things she would have done
differently with her tiny business, she replied: 'Everything.'
Well, it is not quite true, but running her Bronte Birthplace restaurant has
proved a chilling eye-opener. 'It has been tough. Hundreds of people
wouldn't have done it. If we'd had experience of running a restaurant, we
might not have tried it, either.'
Muriel was (and still is) a full-time nursing officer when she and her
husband, Malcolm, decided to buy a single 'lot' of derelict properties in
the hilly village district of Thornton, a few miles from the centre of
Bradford, West Yorkshire. It included two small, single-storey cottages, a
larger house that was once Thornton parsonage and, nestling behind, a
courtyard inhabited by a large, crumbling stone barn.
The original idea, four years ago, was a spot of property speculation. The
whole lot cost Pounds 90,000 to buy. Both cottages were then converted and
sold. The Jordans then decided to transform the old parsonage into a
restaurant. This was opened a year ago.
The Bronte family lived at the parsonage for five years early in the 1800s
and Charlotte, Emily, Anne and Branwell all were born there. It is,
therefore, a structure with historic pulling power and for which the former
kitchen and front parlour provide extremely pretty and interesting eating
rooms.
The third phase of the project is the conversion of the barn, for which
planning permission has been obtained for a house. An application to convert
it to a six-bedroom guest house is in the pipeline.
Developing this cluster of buildings probably is giving the Jordans some
long-term capital growth. But it is not generating income. So far, in fact,
the project is being kept alive partly through tapping into Muriel's salary
and Malcolm's income as a joiner.
Selling the two cottages for about Pounds 45,000 each failed to cover
renovation costs. The buildings were in a more gruesome condition than the
Jordans thought.
'Apart from that, the actual costs charged by the builders exceeded their
quotations by 25 per cent,' Muriel says.
On one occasion, a builder who, at the request of the Jordans, mounted a
second inspection of the roof of one building, withdrew his quotation and
submitted another one three times higher.
The Jordans will not proceed with the barn conversion until the restaurant
starts making a profit. At the moment, it does not. It deserves to, though,
in an area not over-burdened with recommendable eating places. A
three-course Sunday lunch, including dishes such as home-made pate, chicken
in pastry and bread-and-butter pudding, costs a fixed Pounds 8.
'It does not sound much but that's all the area will probably stand on
prices,' says Muriel.
A more expensive week-day a la carte menu incorporates braised ox-tail in
Yorkshire Bitter with dumplings, roast duck in home-made plum confit, and
rabbit pie with cider sauce.
The wine list is long and the bar cosy. Staff don Victorian clothing and
Good Old Days once a month form part of a range of special evenings.
Customers can visit the room the Brontes used as a nursery and a collection
of Victorian shoes is being added.
In spite of all this, the restaurant is not making money. It can cater for
40 at once with a break-even at 25 per cent full but it is failing to
achieve that. 'The accountant told us not to expect to make money in the
first two years."
The Jordans are learning some tough lessons about catering. They possessed
no experience of this kind of business. Because they are locked into other
permanent jobs, problems of staffing and cost control are even more
difficult than they would be normally.
One restaurant manager lasted just three weeks and Muriel then decided to do
without one, saving the Pounds 12,000 salary. She thinks this was a mistake.
'What I could probably do with now is a younger, go-getting manager who can
help with marketing and look for business.'
Retaining chefs has also proved difficult. The restaurant usually employs a
head chef and a commis chef but is now seeking a new head chef. The last one
departed to set up his own restaurant. 'We've been advertising for two
months. An advert in the Yorkshire Post brought just three replies.'
This underlines the crucial issue of location which probably cramps the
Bronte Birthplace's ability to attract professional staff. The restaurant is
10 miles from Haworth, the centre of the Bronte tourist trade. Tourists come
to Thornton but hardly in droves. The restaurant's mid-week trade is largely
made up of businessmen but Bradford, like so many industrial cities, no
longer possesses the depth of industry it did. 'We have had a dilemma about
whether we principally cater for tourists or for locals, says Muriel.'
The venture was funded initially by selling two houses the Jordans owned
(they now live in the same building as the restaurant) and by a bank loan.
The loan has been reduced - but would still be large enough to cover the
cost of a detached house in the Yorkshire city.
On the other hand, the Jordans say the restaurant building is valued at
Pounds 150,000 and the venture is giving them some enjoyment. 'One of the
nicest things is that you are responsible for people enjoying themselves.
You feel responsible if something goes wrong, but you get pleasure when it
goes right.'
The Bronte Birthplace Restaurant, 74 Market Street, Thornton, Bradford, West
Yorkshire. Tel: 0274-830-515.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Warships of the world keep an old
salt afloat - Keith Wheatley meets a sailor who turned to publishing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIFE comes through the letterbox when you are in the mail-order business.
'We've got customers in the House of Lords and quite a few in prison. The
latter always seem to pay cash, which endears them to me,' says Mike
Critchley, a former minesweeper captain who now skippers Maritime Books. It
is the only specialist postal source for books on warships, especially the
Royal Navy.
To the non-specialist eye, Critchley's list appears to have been written by
Spike Milligan. Is there really a market for Minesweepers of the Royal
Canadian Navy 1938-45? Or Lloyd's Losses (WWII) Vol 2 at Pounds 75? The
rising Pounds 250,000 annual turnover of Maritime Books suggests there is.
The key to the business is a database of 18,000 customers built up since
Critchley's launch in 1979. He sends them regular mail-shots with special
offers, and nearly a quarter pay a further Pounds 12 a year for Warship
World, a newsletter run by Maritime Books and featuring its new lines.
'I stole the idea from Habitat years ago,' Critchley admits. 'I was furious
that my wife had paid Pounds 1.50 for a catalogue which was largely their
advertising. But it works.'
Aged 46, with a light beard and a quick wit, he could have inherited Jack
Hawkins' role on the bridge of any warship if the British film industry
hadn't sunk. He left the RN in 1978 after a conventional and successful
career. A year later, he surfaced as the harbourmaster at Looe, a small port
in east Cornwall.
To help pass the time, he compiled a small, soft-back picture book called
British Warships and Auxiliaries 1979. It was aimed at trippers, yachtsmen
and small boys - anyone, in fact, who would not want to pay Pounds 50 for
Janes Fighting Ships. 'Of course, no one wanted to publish it, so vanity led
me to do it myself,' says Critchley. 'We sold 18,000 copies at Pounds 1.20
which didn't seem too bad, so I left Looe and decided to go into books.'
He still lives only 10 miles from Looe, just outside the small market town
of Liskeard. The business is based in the grounds of his home where an
extended small bungalow houses more than 100,000 volumes. Every title on
offer is in stock and there is no middleman between customer and publisher.
'Most of them would take three weeks to get it to you. I don't know how
they're still in business,' snorts Critchley. 'If the customer phones you
with his Access or Visa number, he wants the book there in a couple of days
 -maximum.'
For most booksellers, stock is a nightmare, with inventories worth many
thousands of pounds tied up month after month on the shelves. Having no bank
or other debt - a matter of policy since day one - Critchley says he has no
clear idea what his stock is worth. 'It's a conversation I have every year
with my accountant. What's the value of eight tons of the 1990 edition of
Janes Fighting Ships? Probably zero, if I give up or go out of business.'
Nevertheless, he says that in 13 years he has never had to dump a book,
although some take longer to sell than others. He admits, though, that he
makes many of his buying decisions by 'seat of the pants instinct' rather
than analysis.
At present, Maritime Books has 30 titles in print. Some have been hugely
successful, but the naval sector is declining. Critchley finds great
creative satisfaction in commissioning and creating a book but explains:
'We're down to two or three a year now. We're getting enough offers to buy
Pounds 20 books for 70p that it's so much easier to market those than have
all the grief and heartache of publishing your own.'
The high median price of these specialist titles means that the average
spend is probably in excess of Pounds 30 a transaction, far more than the
average high street bookshop. 'The marketing is what it's all about,'
Critchley emphasises. 'Once you've got a customer on the database, you can
sell him something every six months.'
The company has a full-time sales manager, Roger May, and two part-time
workers helping with packing and despatch. Salaries (including Critchley's)
total around Pounds 60,000 a year. 'I'm sorry it's so imprecise but, if
there's anything left, we buy more books,' he says. Postage is the next
biggest item, costing more than Pounds 15,000 a year.
Critchley's favourite customers are overseas, nearly a thousand of them.
'They spend more because, if you're in Bulawayo, you can't exactly pop down
to Dillons, can you?' One entire corner shelf of Maritime's office is
stacked with books for which the Japanese owner has paid but does not want
posted. He has been threatening for years to collect them; Critchley is
itching to meet him.
His own foibles extend to 'owning' a frigate and a submarine. As project
director of the Warship Preservation Trust - comprising HMS Plymouth and the
submarine Onyx, both lying at Birkenhead and open to the public - Critchley
has found himself running his business from the motorway linking Merseyside
with the West Country.
'Somehow,' he reflects, 'I've also bought a lightship.' The intention
originally was to house a retail outlet for Maritime Books in the former
Trinity House vessel. 'It's proved very difficult to find the right berth,'
Critchley explains.
There is only one cloud on view from the bridge of Maritime Books. 'Our only
real problem is that there were a hell of a lot of people went into the RN
during the War and they're now dying off. That customer base is shrinking.'
Besides which: 'Peace is breaking out all over the world and warships are
not a sexy subject. More people now serve in Boots the chemist than the
Royal Navy.'

<TEXT>
NAMES AT Lloyd's of London insurance market are not the only people who stay
awake at night worrying about unlimited liability.
Increasingly lawyers, solicitors, accountants, architects and other
professionals who are liable for all the losses their companies make have
cause for concern.
Professionals are coming under fire from their clients when things go wrong.
Housebuyers who lose out through over-optimistic surveys, hospital patients
who suffer from doctors' mistakes, and shareholders whose companies go under
because of sloppy accounting - all are much more likely to turn to the law
for redress.
And, following the well-established North American trend, courts are more
prone to hand out big awards to compensate for losses due to professional
negligence.
Broker Alexander Howden and insurance company Sun Alliance International
have now launched a product which could help to relieve some of the stress.
The product is called the Catastrophic Asset Protection Scheme (CAPS). In
essence, it is an insurance policy which protects family assets against the
risk of being called on to meet the costs of a successful professional
negligence claim.
CAPS is based on the legal premise that a spouse has an insurable interest
in the family home. According to Peter Hornsby, of Alexander Howden: 'The
policy is bought by the spouse and they must pay the premium because the
policy has nothing to do with the partner.'
It is also designed to supplement the professional indemnity (or PI)
insurance which offers a limited amount of protection against some of the
cost of legal awards.
Hornsby says more people are feeling nervous about claims exceeding the
limits of their PI policies.
Premiums depend on the level of PI insurance in place and the value of the
assets being protected.
The spouse of a solicitor with professional indemnity cover of Pounds 10m
would pay Pounds 125 to cover assets of Pounds 100,000 and Pounds 270 to
cover assets of Pounds 1m.
But if the PI limit is only Pounds 1m, then the premium rises to Pounds 250
for the Pounds 100,000 of cover.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Directors' Transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS MACDONALD, Directus Ltd
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GLOOM surrounding the stock market continues to cast its shadow over
directors' activity.
BM Group, the construction equipment company, was highlighted a couple of
weeks ago when Roger Shute, the resigning chairman, bought shares. A
statement issued by the company on July 3 revealed that the board was
concerned about the price drop from 398p at the beginning of June to 85p at
the beginning of July.
It was claimed that neither the group's trading nor financial position
justified the scale of the fall, and a review of the management accounts
suggested there would be continued growth in profitibility. Seven directors
 -including Matthew Thorne, the new chairman, and Howard Sutton, the
managing director - bought 83,500 shares at 96p.
Directors at Microgen, the computer bureau services group, have also been
buying. Douglas Lee, the chairman, GE Liddle, the finance director, and
another executive director bought a total of 104,500 shares at 160p. Mr
Allison, one of the non-executive directors, bought 2,000 shares at 168p.
Final results at Birse Group, in the contracting and construction sector,
reflect the impact of a bad debtor. Nevertheless, when recovery dawns it
should be in this sector, and director buying should mean good news. Four
directors - including the chairman and chief executive, Peter Birse, and the
finance director, David Swales - bought a total of 830,275 shares at prices
between 19 and 24p.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): The benefit of a bond
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AM I correct in thinking that, were I to assign the benefit of a single
premium insurance bond to my wife, a chargeable event would not result - ie
it would be a gift inter vivos and so free of all tax?
If that is so, on subsequent encashment of the bond by my wife, is the
assessment of capital gain based on the original single premium paid to me
nearly 20 years ago, or on the value of the bond (determined by the
published price of the underlying units) on assignment to her? If the latter
is the case, can top slicing relief be applied over this period?
As assignment by way of gift of the rights conferred by a single-premium
life assurance policy is, as you say, not a chargeable event within section
540 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. (However, the reason which
you suggest, after 'ie', is not correct).
Your wife's income tax liability on her subsequent surrender of the policy
would indeed be based upon the excess of the surrender proceeds over the
original premium. Top slicing relief would indeed be available to mitigate
any liability to excess liability (currently 15 per cent) - and to CGT on
other assets (under section 102(3) of the Finance Act 1988) - but not any
liability to age surcharge (currently 12 1/4 per cent).

FT  25 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): CGT bill on property
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I OWN a freehold upper floor maisonette in Tooting, London, which was
bequeathed to me by my mother 20 years ago. If I sold this property - which
I have rented out, off and on, but which is now empty - would I be exempt
from capital gains tax and inheritance tax? Alternatively, if I made a gift
of it to my daughters, would they be liable for capital gains tax should
they decide to sell it?
If you move into the maisonette before contracting to sell it, and give the
appropriate main-residence notices under section 101(5)(a) of the Capital
Gains Tax Act 1979 (or the corresponding provision section 222(5)(a) of the
taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992), you should significantly reduce the
prospective CGT bill - subject to any anti-avoidance legislation in the
Finance (No 2) Act 1992, of course.
If you give the maisonette to your daughter, you will have the same CGT bill
as if you had sold it to her at its current market value (although you could
pay the CGT by instalments, with interest).
The term 'heritage property' refers to property which forms part of the
national heritage - not simply to property which has been inherited.
Your best plan is to consult a solicitor who is competent in the tax law and
practice relating to domestic property transactions. As a first step, you
could ask your tax office for the free pamphlets CGT4 (Owner-occupied
houses) and CGT14 (Capital gains tax: an introduction).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I OWN some Marsh and McLennan shares and I enclose a copy of the dividend
paid on May 15. I would be grateful if you could explain how I mark out how
much 'Tax Credit' I should show on my next tax return in respect of this
dividend.
The expression 'tax credit' (as distinct from 'foreign tax credit' etc) is
only applicable to dividends of UK companies, which are paid without
deduction of income tax. Your US dividends should be entered in the section
of your tax return headed 'Other dividends . . . already taxed' not in the
section headed 'Dividends from UK companies and tax credits'.
You should enter the gross amount and add a note that the dividend has
suffered 15 per cent US tax as well as 10 per cent UK tax.
If you are exempt from tax, the tax refund will be only Pounds 6.79.* If you
are a 40 per cent taxpayer, you will have an extra Pounds 10.19 to pay.
* If you are exempt from tax on the dividend by reason of a trading loss,
for example, you can elect to forgo foreign tax credit and therefore treat
the dividend as reduced by the US tax to Pounds 57.73, which will leave you
with an additional Pounds 10.19 loss relief available elsewhere.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Stocks need time to settle - Investing
in . . . China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA has opened the gates to foreign investment at last and money is
pouring in. The potential for growth on an unprecedented scale is plain.
China has the largest population on earth and a cheap workforce. Most
Chinese share the work ethic of other Asian economic success stories such as
Japan and Hong Kong.
Senior leader Deng Xiaoping's 'open door' policy of economic liberalisation
has included the establishment of two new stock exchanges, trading in shares
which have an ingenious capital structure to ease the difficulties for
foreign fund managers. But European investors still need the answers to two
questions:
Is the economy vulnerable to political change?
The enlightened technocratic liberalisation being applied to the economy
sits awkwardly with the brutish massacre of students in Tiananmen Square,
Beijing, in 1989. There is understandable reluctance to put funds at the
mercy of a regime led by a man of 87 which has shown it will not baulk at
authoritarian measures reminiscent of Stalin.
Some observers are, however, confident that economic reform is there to
stay. Deng is trying to ensure a succession committed to economic
liberalisation. Over the past six months he has moved several members of the
liberal faction into key posts, and is expected to consolidate power at the
14th party congress scheduled for November.
The communists also appear to have realised that some form of liberalisation
and market discipline will be necessary to deliver an adequate standard of
living. Experience of Europe's former eastern bloc shows what can happen to
political regimes if living standards are poor. In any case, though, Deng's
initiatives have already attracted enough foreign investment to make U-turns
difficult.
The economic data are astounding. China managed real gross national product
growth of 7.0 per cent in 1991, and industrial growth of 12.9 per cent. The
five-year plan for 1991-95 has already raised its target for GNP growth from
6 per cent a year to 9 per cent. Meanwhile the people are thrifty but have
little on which to spend their money. This has led to a savings ratio
calculated by Barclays de Zoete Wedd (BZW) at around 30 per cent, suggesting
healthy prospects for any company which can produce something they want to
buy.
Is the Chinese market the best place to buy exposure to the Chinese economy?
China now has two stock exchanges, in Shenzhen and Shanghai. The authorities
have gone to elaborate lengths to make life easy for foreign investors. Each
company issues two classes of share. 'A' shares may be bought only by
locals, while 'B' shares are reserved for foreign investors.
John Kelly, of BZW Investment Management, is enthusiastic. 'The system is
marvellously well organised. In China, there are authorised brokers and
dealing is electronic. They've got rigorous controls on how companies can be
listed and they use international accounting standards.'
This does not mean the market is immune to problems. Shanghai's 'B' share
market now has a total capitalisation of USDollars 151m, while Shenzhen's is
Dollars 685.2m. These tiny figures may illustrate the potential for growth,
but they also show the tightness of the market. It is not easy to spread
risk if you invest only in 'B' shares.
Many claim that investors' enthusiasm to take advantage of these new
opportunities has left the market overheated and overvalued. The high
Chinese savings ratio has led many locals to try to buy 'B' shares,
constricting supply for foreigners.
In Shenzhen, a typical 'B' share trades off a price-earning multiple of 30,
while 'A' shares are on multiples of 37 to 40. Many fund managers have,
therefore, decided to avoid 'B' shares and buy their exposure to China
elsewhere in the Far East - particularly Hong Kong.
According to Kenneth King of Kleinwort Benson Investment Management: 'China
is the most exciting investment area in the world at the moment. But going
from there to setting up a fund to buy a very small number of 'B' shares
which are grossly overpriced is quite a leap. It's perfectly obvious that
the market is grossly overheated.'
Tim Williams, of Schroders Asia, takes a similar view: 'Almost inevitably,
gravity will assert itself and then there will be a major fall. And that's
when I plan to buy.'
There are differences between China's two markets. While Shenzhen, just
across the water from Hong Kong, is the larger, most of its quoted companies
are joint ventures with the colony. This makes it all the easier to buy
Chinese exposure with a Hong Kong fund. Shanghai was the largest market in
Asia before it was shut down forcibly by the communists in 1949. The
companies planning to come to the market there in the next few months are a
different proposition from Shenzhen as they are mostly in heavy industries,
like Shanghai Chlor-Alkali and Shanghai Tyre and Rubber.
Most previously were state-owned monopolies. This offers the kind of direct
exposure to Chinese growth which is difficult to buy in Hong Kong or Taiwan.
So how should a private UK investor get involved? There are five authorised
unit trusts investing in Hong Kong and many more investing in a range of
Pacific rim countries. None of these is a 'widows and orphans' investment
but they offer some diversification.
China is not an authorised market, so onshore unit trusts cannot be bought.
But several offshore funds have been launched this year to buy 'B' shares.
These include Barclays China (based on Jersey); the GT Shenzhen and China
fund, which is registered as a unit trust in Hong Kong and listed on the
Hong Kong stock exchange; and Hafnia Prolific's China Opportunities fund,
which is listed on the Dublin stock exchange.
Of these, only GT is restricted exclusively to 'B' shares; it is now 65 per
cent invested. The others have scope to invest in Hong Kong and other local
markets, and Hafnia Prolific, which is a fully-authorised fund, has only a
maximum of 10 per cent in 'B' shares.
Minimum investments are not prohibitive compared with unit trusts. Companies
more sceptical about 'B' shares, such as Schroders and Kleinwort Benson,
offer large 'emerging market' funds. These spread risk across several
markets.
China offers rewarding prospects for those prepared to take a risk. But it
could be best to limit that risk via a broad fund for the time being until
the country's well-organised stock markets have had the time to mature.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Employers sweeten pensions - Measures
being taken to keep workers loyal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PENSION often is described as the most valuable but least-valued benefit
that employers provide. Such a contradiction has been a source of increasing
concern to employers who, with their pension costs spiralling upwards, watch
with increasing frustration as their staff opt out of handsome benefits
packages for personal pension plans that are patently less attractive.
Now, pension consultants say, employers are examining ways to restructure
their packages to make them more attractive to a broader mix of employees.
Kevin Spring, director at the Wyatt Company, a firm of consulting actuaries,
says the advent of personal pensions has made employers aware that the
generous provisions they are making for their workers' retirement are not
fully appreciated. Furthermore, they are often not the most attractive for
younger or part-time workers who will not stay long enough to enjoy the
benefits fully.
Spring says the challenge is for employers to provide for workers'
retirement in a way that most will appreciate. And because workforces are
diverse, the classic final salary scheme awarded after 30 years of
continuous employment is attractive to only some of the employees.
Under such a scheme, a full pension allows a retiring worker to receive
two-thirds of his final salary for as long as he lives, with the likely
guarantee of periodic inflation adjustments besides. But while such benefits
are enough to guarantee the loyalty of older workers, younger transient
workforces are often unimpressed.
'Personal pensions are simple to understand, flexible, provide investment
choice and are perceived to be portable,' Spring says.
'All of this makes them extremely attractive for younger people, even though
these perceptions often prove to be invalid in practice.'
According to Paul Greenwood, research actuary at consulting actuary Mercer
Fraser and Co: 'What has changed things has been the availability of
voluntary scheme membership and the growth of personal pensions.
Employers are spending 10 to 15 per cent of total payrolls on pension
benefits and they want to get better value for money out of it.'
The fact that this spending is not necessarily appreciated by workers has
prompted the redesign of pension benefits. But while this issue is deeply
troubling to the pensions industry, a relatively small proportion has tried
to address it so far.
Mike Brown, director of communications for the National Association of
Pension Funds, the industry trade association, says: 'Flexibility is one of
those things which everyone is in favour of but which can give you lots of
trouble.' He pointed out that in a survey of members, only five per cent had
moved to introduce some element of flexibility.
For those which have, a number of options are available. Spring outlined
several which employers are building into their schemes. One, a so-called
'nursery scheme,' allowed employees under the age of say, 35, to join only a
so-called money purchase scheme which would give them a portable lump sum.
At the trigger age, the employee was then allowed either to stay with the
money purchase scheme or opt into the final salary scheme most attractive to
older workers.
Another option would be to give all employees the choice of taking part
either in a defined contribution plan, where they paid in an agreed portion
of their salary, or a defined benefit scheme where the final return was
known.
The defined contribution scheme would not be as attractive as the package
received by those in the defined benefit scheme after a full working career.
But people who stayed in for a shorter period of time - say, five years -
would receive proportionate benefits which would certainly be better than
the benefits received by those who had elected a defined benefit scheme.
Greenwood says some employers have offered the option of accruing a smaller
portion of a final salary scheme in any given year in exchange for either a
lower annual employee contribution or the availability of some other
inducement, such as a company car. While employees typically accrue 1/60th
of their final pension each year, some have opted to accrue only 1/80th.
Flexibility has its attractions but cost savings are not one of them,
Greenwood says. Overall, flexibility increases costs slightly by making
administration more expensive. 'But the trade-off is a greater appreciation
of benefits.'
Thus, spending on pensions engenders employee loyalty rather than producing
a yawn - precisely the view that prompted companies to offer pensions in the
first place.

<TEXT>
Imperial Chemical Industries reports its second quarter results on Thursday,
when it is expected to produce pre-tax profits of Pounds 200m-Pounds 240m,
down from Pounds 309m for the same quarter last year.
One analyst said that if the company cuts the dividend, the results on the
market would be cataclysmic.
The main points of interest will include the results of the pharmaceuticals
division. Analysts will be looking at the extent of the decline in Tenormin
sales in the US since the expiry of its patents.
The extent to which the new drugs, Zestril, Zoladex and Diprivan, have made
up Tenormin's decline will also be key.
Otherwise, agrochemicals are likely to be disappointing, and analysts will
be watching the state of the basic chemicals market to see if there has been
any sign of an upturn.
The chairman's statement about future prospects will be closely examined.
Midland Bank becomes the first of the Big Four banks to announce its its
half-year results on Thursday.
The results are largely of historical interest since Midland was taken over
last month by Hongkong and Shanghai Bank and will not pay a dividend to its
former shareholders. Last time round a poor performance on its UK banking
operations drove Midland into a loss of Pounds 71m.
This year it should be back in the black. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew are predicting
pre-tax profits of Pounds 120m, but a possible write-back of sovereign debt
could make the figure even higher.
Lloyds Bank will report on Friday interim pre-tax profits or around Pounds
355m against Pounds 331m a year earlier.
It is likely to increase its interim dividend by about 15 per cent to 6.29
net. The result will underline its performance as the best of the clearing
banks.

THE Securities and Investments Board (SIB) is now free to prosecute anyone
who breaks the Financial Services Act, including third parties concerned
knowingly in unauthorised investment business, following an Appeal Court
decision. This could be good news for victims of unsafe home income plans
who now rely on partial remedies from different regulators.
The case involves a Swiss firm called Pantell - unauthorised for investment
business - which sold apparently worthless shares in an American company,
Euramco, to UK investors. SIB sued Pantell's London solicitors and the
company itself for repayment of the money, alleging they knew about the
misconduct.
The solicitors challenged SIB's powers to seek a repayment order but the
court rejected their case. The result is that anyone involved knowingly can
be ordered to make full restitution of money invested even though they might
neither have received it nor encouraged the investment actively. SIB says it
is considering using these powers in a number of cases.
Independent solicitor Nigel Hodkinson of Locks Heath, Hampshire, who has
dealt with 1,000 home income plan cases, thinks the ruling might help
extricate investors damaged by inappropriate sales of home income plans from
the lengthy struggle for compensation.
Sold mainly to elderly people during the late 1980s, these plans involved
taking out a mortgage to buy an investment bond, which was supposed to
produce an income as well as paying off the loan interest. But many
investors were unaware they could lose their homes if - as happened -
interest rates rose, house prices fell and the bonds failed to perform as
forecast.
Thousands of complaints and claims for compensation began churning around in
the regulatory system. In March this year SIB announced a non-stop
complaints procedure, but it ran into opposition from some building
societies. They refused to allow the building societies' ombudsmen to extend
their jurisdiction to cover home income plans.
Redress for investors has varied. Insurance companies answerable to Lautro
(the life assurance regulator) have paid Pounds 5m to restore around 400
people to the position they were in before investing via tied agents. The
insurance ombudsman is dealing with another 120 claims against agents tied
to Lautro firms and has made clear that compensation may include amounts for
distress and legal fees.
No such extras will go to investors who make claims on the Investors'
Compensation Scheme following the default of four intermediaries licensed by
Fimbra - the independent brokers' regulator.
The Scheme said this week it expects 1,500 claims to arise from these firms,
and hopes to pay at least some compensation as quickly as possible, without
delaying to settle the more complex aspects. Investors will be compensated
only by reference to the value of their investment on the day the firm was
declared in default and cannot receive more than Pounds 48,000.
People claiming against Fimbra members still extant face even more
uncertainty. 'Unfortunately, it does not necessarily follow that (they) will
be entitled to the same restitution and compensation as those covered by
Lautro,' Anthony Nelson, treasury minister, told the House of Commons during
the debate on the Finance Bill. 'Each case is subject to an examination of
the package, the circumstances and the terms of the investment bond, and the
mortgage proposed.'
Hodkinson said, however, that many investment salesmen around the country
had operated without authorisation. He thinks investors who have dealt with
such people will be able to ask SIB directly to recover their money in full
from any institution involved knowingly. But he adds: 'The question is
whether the will is there to use the legislation.'

FT  25 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Mortgage rates threat remains -
Societies may have no option but to increase them eventually
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE possibility of a mortgage rate increase in two or three months has not
gone away, even though building society rates look set to stay around 10.75
per cent for the rest of the summer.
The government's decision on Monday to heed protests and reduce interest
paid on the National Savings First Option bond came just in time.
Alliance &amp; Leicester and Abbey National were within hours of announcing rate
increases in line with the proposed Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester increase from
10.75 per cent to 10.99. Had they moved, other societies certainly would
have followed.
C&amp;G responded by withdrawing its proposal. But trimming the interest paid on
the National Savings bond, introduced on July 7, does not solve the lenders'
problems.
If the squeeze on their funding goes on, the societies will have to offer
investors more attractive rates. They can do this only do if they put up
their mortgage rates. In June, a month before the new bond was launched,
Pounds 314m flowed out of the societies.
Meanwhile, disgruntled borrowers might bear two things in mind. The first is
that the 10.7 per cent rate prevailing in the market now is, effectively, a
discounted rate. It dates back to February when the larger lenders moved
their rates down, expecting the banks' base rate to drop soon afterwards.
Since then, they have kept their mortgage rate about 0.7 percentage points
above base rate. Yet, historically, mortgage lenders normally have pitched
their rates at around 1 or 1.25 percentage points above the base rate.
The second point will probably not have to be spelt out to anyone who has a
mortgage from one of the centralised lenders rather than a building society.
For the past four years, they have consistently charged their mortgage
customers more than the building societies, but the gap between their
interest rates and those of the societies is wider than ever just now.
Where centralised lenders are concerned, you can forget about your rate
being 10.7 or 10.99 per cent. With a few exceptions, most mortgage companies
charge rates well above 11 per cent to existing customers.
Bank of Ireland Home Mortgages, Bear Stearns and UCB Home Loans all charge
11.5 per cent or more. Household Mortgage Corporation, Citibank Mortgages,
BNP Mortgages, Legal &amp; General Mortgage Services and Mortgage Trust levy
rates between 11 and 11.45 per cent.
There are some exceptions to these high rates. Credit Agricole, the Mortgage
Corporation, the Mortgage Business and Britannia Central Lending charge
10.99 per cent. This is, of course, equivalent to the proposed C&amp;G rate.
C&amp;G Guardian, which was a building society in its own right until 2 1/2
years ago and is a centralised lender subsidiary of C&amp;G, charges 11 per cent
(although why anyone should go to a subsidiary and pay more than they would
do if they went to its parent is a mystery).
Centralised lenders offered several explanations this week for their high
rates. None seems entirely satisfactory. Their first excuse is that only
their existing customers pay them. New customers are wooed with discounts,
special offers, and other enticements which make the rates they pay in the
first year or two of a mortgage comparable with those of the building
societies.
The second line of defence is that the building societies are out of step
with the market and are charging too little for their mortgages. 'If the
societies choose not to charge a commercial rate for their business, that is
not our affair,' one centralised lender told me.
That begs the basic question. With the banks' base rate at 10 per cent, a
mortgage interest rate of 10.7 per cent might look a shade underpriced - but
a mortgage rate of 11.55 per cent is distinctly overpriced.
Over the past three years, the centralised lenders, as well as charging
higher interest, have been consistently tougher on customers who get into
payment difficulties than the building societies. These facts should be
borne in mind by anyone thinking of entering the housing market now.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: An option to share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SAVINGS product with the best risk/reward ratio of all will be losing a
little of its glitter on October 1. This nonpareil is the little-publicised
savings-related share option.
With Inland Revenue approval, employees are offered options to buy shares in
their company at a price fixed when the options are granted and which is
usually 80 per cent of the market price at that time. The options become
'exercisable' - convertible into shares - either five or seven years later.
As a condition of receiving this option, an employee must enter into a
savings contract, the ultimate proceeds of which will pay for the optioned
shares at the 80 per cent initial price. Under these SAYE contracts -
offered by a range of building societies and banks as well as the Department
of National Savings - monthly contributions are deducted from salary for
five years.
The saver must decide at the outset whether he wants to withdraw his money
at the end of that period or leave it in for a further two years to accrue
extra interest. Either way, the related share option can only be exercised
in the six months following the cash withdrawal date.
Interest on the SAYE contract is paid in the form of a tax-free terminal
bonus. This currently amounts to 15 monthly contributions after five years
and 30 if the money is left in for a further two years, working out at
compound annual rates of return of 8.86 per cent and 9.15 per cent
respectively.
The Government has now decided to pare back on this terminal bonus.
Employees who sign up after September 30 will find the bonus cut from 15 to
12 monthly payments after five years and from 30 to 25 after seven years.
This will equate to annual interest of 7.5 per cent and 7.38 per cent - much
more in line with prevailing market rates.
For a stand-alone investment these would be generous yields. Perhaps the
best comparison is with the National Savings Yearly Plan which pays out 8
per cent per annum at the end of a five-year period - but the overall
attraction is enormously enhanced by the added component of the linked share
option.
If the share price performs so dismally that by the time of exercise it has
fallen below the 80 per cent starting mark, then the holder will allow the
option to lapse and be content with his tax-free bonus. But, as the table
shows, even if the price has done no more than tread water during the option
period there will be a useful capital gain to add to the overall return. And
if the shares actually move ahead, the employee's pay-off goes into
overdrive.
Wellcome provides a topical example. Wellcome employees in 1986 were offered
options to buy shares five years hence at Pounds 1.29. Saving at Pounds 50
per month cost Pounds 3,000 in total, and rendered a fund of Pounds 3,700 -
and therefore a right to buy 2,868 shares. That means that Pounds 3,000
bought those lucky employees the right to buy shares currently worth around
Pounds 24,000.
Investors who hope to lock-in to the current rates of return before
September 30 are likely to find that the matter is out of their hands.
More than 1,000 companies operate savings-related share option schemes and,
in the past three years, 1.3m employees have been granted options over
shares worth Pounds 2.1bn. Far more could have taken advantage of this
gilt-edged opportunity. Participation is open to all full-time staff who
have completed a qualifying period of up to five years employment but in
practice, take-up rates tend to be well below 50 per cent and often as low
as 10 per cent.
Those who do seize the opportunity rarely make the most of it. The average
contribution is less than Pounds 50 per month whereas the statutory maximum
was raised last year from Pounds 150 to Pounds 250. So a top saver can pay
in Pounds 15,000 (60 x Pounds 250) which, if left for the full seven years,
will currently attract a bonus of Pounds 7,500 (30 x Pounds 250). Assuming
the usual 20 per cent price discount, this Pounds 22,500 cash fund will
allow for an option over Pounds 28,125 worth of shares. The new rates will
reduce this to Pounds 26,562.
The only section of the workforce which can almost always be relied on to
save to the hilt is the board of directors. Directors and other senior
managers will usually participate in their own exclusive executive option
scheme, but they can top up with savings-related options.
Although executives earning more than Pounds 25,000 pa cannot hold options
over shares worth more than four times salary, savings-related options fall
outside this limit.
Hence, there is nothing to stop a director on a Pounds 50,000 salary from
being granted a Pounds 200,000 executive option and, in addition, a Pounds
28,125 (reducing from October 1 to Pounds 26,562) SAYE option.
Companies contemplating an imminent issue under a savings-related scheme
would be well-advised to try to beat the October 1 deadline. By doing so
they will enhance staff benefits at no cost whatever to themselves. But
sadly many will be constrained by scheme rules.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The lowdown on low-cost share deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERAL months ago, a Weekend FT reader wrote in lauding the cheap dealing
service offered by a FT-SE 100 company to deal in the company's shares. 'It
is simple, cheap and efficient. I am now wondering whether there are any
other schemes of a similar nature available,' he wrote.
Most private investors spread their risk through a large number of holdings
in different companies and will hold a variety of stock in a general
Personal Equity Plan. But there will be times when the investor may want to
deal in one or a few blue chip companies, or to increase his Pep holdings
through a single company Pep.
Many quoted companies have arrangements with stockbrokers and personal
equity plan managers to provide investors with a reduced rate service for
sharedealing. Some have a similar arrangement with a Pep plan manager for
opening either a single company Pep with a maximum holding of Pounds 3,000
in any one tax year, or a Pounds 6,000 general Pep, or both.
Companies such as Hoare Govett, NatWest Stockbrokers and Cazenove have led
the way in offering a low cost share dealing service for selected quoted
companies.
The table below shows companies in the FT-SE 100 which responded to our
request for details of available schemes. Some companies, including British
Steel, Lasmo, Bass, Pearson and Midland Bank, do not have arrangements for a
cheap sharedealing scheme or corporate personal equity plan at the moment
and have not been included in the table.
The charges are very competitive compared with execution-only brokers, many
of which charge a minimum of Pounds 10 for dealing. Similarly, the Pep
charges also represent good value compared with the industry norm of 5 per
cent initial charges, annual charges of about 0.75 per cent to 1.5 per cent
and brokerage of around 1.65 per cent.
Many companies pay or subsidise the initial charge or the annual fee
themselves, which leads to a reduction in charges. However, these are
execution-only schemes with no investment advice available.
The structure of the service can vary between companies - there may be a
minimum value of shares that can be bought or sold. The brokerage for
General Accident, for example, requires deals to be a minimum of Pounds 500.
The same can be true for Peps - the minimum level of shareholding in the
General Accident Pep is Pounds 1,000, and it is Pounds 1,500 for Reuters.
VAT is payable on most charges apart from the broker's commission.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Women's pension woe - Why mothers need
a pension panacea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST WOMEN confront a basic difficulty whensaving for a pension If they are
unable to pay premiums constantly throughout a working career, the size of
the pension entitlements will be reduced.
For women who intend to be in full time work and remain childless throughout
their working life, this is not a problem. But for the majority who take
career breaks, the size of their final pension will be smaller than a
working man's, whether the pension is paid by the state, their employer, or
an insurance company.
The number of working women has been increasing. Last year 71 per cent of
women were economically active and although most of them were in full-time
employment, a large minority - 43 per cent - were in part-time work, where
the right to an occupational pension scheme if a company has one, became law
only in 1986.
When most pension schemes evolved, women were seen as dependent on their
husbands. However one in three marriages now ends in divorce in the UK. In
such cases, a woman's right to her husband's pension is usually relinquished
(see the accompanying article).
Yet, arguably, women need larger pension provisions than men since they live
on average four years longer.
State pension. Social security in the UK provides a pension equivalent to
only 18 per cent of average earnings, according to Noble Lowndes. For many
women, this is the pension on which they rely in old age.
The full state pension is Pounds 54.15 per week for the 1992/93 tax year.
The full basic state pension is dependent on the number of years over which
National Insurance Contributions are paid.
Serps, the state earnings-related pension scheme, which tops up the basic
pension, is available only to employees and, as its name suggests, is
related to the level of earnings.
Private plans. These have become more flexible. Insurance companies, keen to
find new markets for their products, have targeted women and highlighted
shortfalls in both occupational and state pensions to push their own
products.
But personal pensions, while more flexible than most occupational schemes,
are not the panacea to a woman's pension problems. This flexibility boils
down to the ability to stop contributions and restart them at a future date
without having to incur new start-up charges.
However these pensions, with high fixed charges, are not cheap. 'An
appropriate personal pension on its own will not give very different benefit
from SERPS, and so is unlikely to be adequate on its own to give a
comfortable retirement,' says the Equal Opportunities Commission.
Even with a 'flexible' pension, a woman cannot avoid the basic fact that
when she stops contributing to the plan, her final pension entitlements will
be reduced. The longer she takes off to bring up children, the worse the
effect on her pension.
London Life estimates that a 30-year-old woman starting a personal pension
with monthly payments of Pounds 100 gross would accumulate a fund at
retirement at 55 years of Pounds 167,100. This assumes a yield of 13.5 per
cent. If she takes a five-year break between 35 and 40 years, the size of
the fund is reduced by 29 per cent to Pounds 119,000.
The EOC found one of the most severe drawbacks of personal pensions to be
their inflexibility in terms of 'filling gaps in paid employment'.
'Contributions can only be paid for from earnings and although there is
scope for forms of insurance, the only real answer is to save even more
money while at work. For women who experience substantial gaps in
employment, whatever the reason, the shortfall becomes impossible to
bridge.'
Women should also beware of unsuitable policies. In the 1988/89 tax year,
the department of social security said that 63,000 women with no earnings
had been sold personal pensions while the EOC concluded that 250,000 women
were sold personal pensions when they would have been better off in Serps.
Occupational schemes
A good occupational scheme is arguably one of the best pension schemes
available. It can give the employee death and disability benefits with
contributions from both employer and employee attracting tax relief.
A scheme that gives two-thirds of final earnings after a working lifetime
can provide a comfortable pension but again, this will be affected by career
breaks. Not all employers operate pension schemes.
The 1989 General Household Survey of the Office of Population Censuses and
Surveys showed that 40 per cent of women part-time workers were with
employers who did not have a pension scheme and only 11 per cent of
part-time women were members of a scheme when their employers had one.
Women can supplement their occupational scheme with an additional voluntary
contribution. Rob Gaines, of NM Financial Management, advises checking the
contract allows for contribution holidays and that there is no double
charging or penalties for stopping and restarting.
One improvement is on the way. From January 1993, it will become compulsory
for employers operating a contributory pension scheme to make maternity
leave pensionable.
In spite of the flexibility hype, pensions for women are still inadequate.
The conclusion of the EOC report was that the best way of reducing poverty
for women in old age is to increase the level of state basic pension, since
it is not linked to an earnings record. Since there is little likelihood of
this happening, for the meantime, the best alternative for women is to lobby
for greater flexibility in occupational schemes.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Dilemmas of divorce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DIVISION of assets after a divorce is one of the most fiercely-contested
areas of family finance. For most married couples, the husband's pension
rights form the most valuable possession after the family home. Where the
house is still mortgaged, its net value often falls below that of the
pension.
More than one-third of UK marriages end in divorce. Yet, the law in England
and Wales means pension rights are dealt with at the discretion of the
courts. While discretion can provide a desirable degree of flexibility, it
can also lead to uncertainty and apparently idiosyncratic judgments.
By contrast the law in Scotland is clear on the division of the pension
spoils. Under the Family Law (Scotland) Act 1985 'matrimonial property'
specifically includes the proportion of pension and insurance rights
accumulated during the marriage and, in most cases, these must be divided
equally between the partners.
However, even in Scotland, there is seen to be a need to revise the law to
include a fairer method of splitting the pension rights other than through
cash or instalment payments awarded by the courts.
The UK government is under pressure to clarify the law on pensions and
divorce. In recent years, several eminent authorities have put forward
proposals but perhaps the most influential of these is the Pensions
Management Institute (PMI) working group on pension and divorce set up in
February. The group draws on the expertise of the legal profession, the
government, pensions experts and consumer organisations.
In April the group issued a consultation paper inviting evidence by the end
of June. The group will present its findings early next year and recommend
the most appropriate form of new legislation.
Sir Alec Atkinson, chairman of the working group, identified four options
for dividing pension rights:
A cash payment (or its equivalent) from the partner with the most valuable
pension rights;
A transfer payment from the scheme of the partner with the most valuable
pension rights, to create new rights in a separate pension scheme for the
other partner;
Achievement of this by reallocating benefit rights within the original
scheme; or
Earmarking a proportion of the benefits of the partner with the most
valuable pension rights so that this proportion will become payable to the
other partner on retirement. Whichever method is selected as the basis for
new legislation, the question remains how pension rights should be
calculated.
Occupational schemes in the UK are either on a 'money purchase' or a 'final
salary' basis. Under a money purchase scheme contributions are invested to
build up a fund which, at retirement, is used to buy an annuity. With this
arrangement it is relatively simple to split the accrued pension rights
since an individual pot of money can be identified.
However, most pension schemes in the UK are on a final salary basis where it
is more difficult to calculate accrued benefits at a given time. Typically,
under these schemes an employee builds up a pension at the rate of 1/60th of
final salary for each year of service up to an Inland Revenue maximum of
40/60ths, or two thirds final salary (in some cases subject to a final
salary limit of Pounds 75,000 for the current tax year.)
Sir Alec said: 'There are two methods by which actuaries arrive at figures
in this area - one to arrive at the transfer value or cash equivalent, and
the other to arrive at the past service reserve.'
The transfer value or cash equivalent is calculated when an employee changes
jobs and leaves the former pension scheme. Past service reserve is
calculated in bulk transfers when, for example, the company has changed
hands and the employees' pension rights are transferred into the new
employer's scheme.
While pension scheme members might feel more comfortable with the notion of
a cash equivalent, this is usually worth less than the past service reserve.
This is because the increases in the preserved pension for early leavers,
which are used to calculate the cash equivalent, are limited by law to a
maximum of 5 per cent per annum, whereas full salary inflation is assumed in
the calculation of the past service reserve.
While the PMI attempts to create equitable and practical legislation for
pension rights on divorce, you should understand your rights under the
current law. Anyone contemplating divorce should seek legal advice on
pensions aspects.
It is not only private or occupational pension rights that are affected by
divorce. Under the basic state pension system a divorced woman who does not
have a right to a pension in her own name can still claim a Category B
pension under her former husband's National Insurance Contribution (NIC)
record.
However, if she remarries she loses this right and must claim under her new
husband's NIC record. Moreover, the divorced woman has no claim to a state
widow's pension on the death of her former husband even if he was supporting
her financially at the time of his death.
The rules under the state earnings related pension scheme (Serps) are
equally harsh since all benefits, including a widow's pension, are lost on
divorce.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Markets: Gleeful BA faces risks with USAir deal - The Bottom
Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'ALBUQERQUE to Omaha? Certainly, madam. Here's your British Airways ticket.'
The year is 1997 and Lord Marshall of Hatton Cross runs the world's biggest
airline network. It is five years since BA invested Dollars 750m - at a
Mickey Mouse exchange rate - in USAir, a huge domestic US carrier.
Dollars 750m? The combined airline makes that much money every three months
now . . .
IT IS this kind of fantasy that on Tuesday drove Lord King of Wartnaby and
Sir Colin Marshall, the men who run BA in 1992, to make their biggest
corporate move since their company was privatised five years ago. The
Dollars 750m is buying 21 per cent of the voting rights and at least 32 per
cent of the equity rights of USAir, the heavily loss-making US domestic
airline.
For King, in particular, the deal is a dream come true. He has nursed his
vision of a global airline for 11 years. Twice, that dream was shattered: in
1989, when talks with United Airlines, the US number two, collapsed; and
earlier this year when a merger with KLM, the Dutch carrier with a stake in
Northwest Airlines of the US, fell through.
King, less than a year away from retirement as chairman to become BA's
honorary life president, has cause to be pleased. In some ways, USAir is an
even better partner than United or KLM would have been. BA gets almost
unparalleled access to the vast US domestic market with almost no overlap on
its international routes. USAir's strength is on the eastern seaboard where
two-thirds of Europe-bound transatlantic passengers live.
USAir's president should be even happier. His airline is flat on its back,
having lost Dollars 837m over the past two years. BA's cash will cut its
debt from a ghastly 367 per cent gearing to a soothing 50 per cent.
Even their aircraft look similar: spot a blue, red and silver Boeing and it
will probably belong to USAir or BA.
Already, the two companies have established an 'integration committee' to
determine what can be done to merge their marketing, finance and
maintenance. Linking frequent flyer programmes is a top priority to compete
with United and American, the big two US carriers.
The cost savings that could result bring with them the hope that BA's
profits and share price might maintain their extraordinary recession-bucking
trends. BA is now the only large airline in the western hemisphere that is
making serious money. But, despite King's protestations to the contrary, the
deal has risks.
BA is not buying ordinary shares in USAir, but convertibles. These pay BA
interest at 7 per cent a year until conversion, after which BA takes its cut
of USAir's profits or losses. That conversion is likely to happen in five
years' time, so BA's bet is that USAir's profits will have returned to rude
health by then. That, however, depends as much on the fortunes of the US
airline industry as on management skills. And it is an industry on which US
investors themselves have been unwilling to take a bet in recent months.
A share sale by GPA, the world's biggest aircraft leasing company, was
cancelled last month when US investors got cold feet. They were worried that
US airlines were losing so much money in their bitter price wars that they
would not be able to pay the lease fees.
Only this week, USAir itself revealed it had lost Dollars 85m in its second
quarter, and the larger Delta Air Lines lost Dollars 180m in the three
months to the end of June. Even King's crystal ball cannot see five years
ahead, and BA shares suffered on Wednesday as investor recognised the deal's
uncertainties.
At this month's annual meeting, BA's shareholders rushed to congratulate
King and Marshall on their profits record. They may have the great American
airline passenger to thank if they still feel good in 1997.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The FT portfolio
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A decimal point was misplaced in last week's article on the Weekend FT
Portfolio Race. The value of the Lep Group's portfolio should have read
Pounds 63.19, not Pounds 631.95. This has the effect of making the high
yield portfolio even more volatile, and drops it to fourth place. The dart
board portfolio is second, and the experts finish third.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: With-profits bonds sales boom
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sales of single-premium with-profits bonds continue at a phenomenal rate -
even though they cannot quite match the sales of National Savings' First
bond. The Prudential announced its results for the first six months of 1992
this week which were boosted by Pounds 350m taken in by its Prudence Bond.
The Pru says it is happy with the business it is writing and has no plans to
withdraw the bond.
Equity &amp; Law has confirmed that its with-profits bonds will be available
until August 17 - they have not, as might have been implied last week
already been withdrawn. Its bond has attracted more than Pounds 300m since
launch in February last year, and the company wishes to maintain a mix of
business. Equity &amp; Law may re-enter the market later.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Building societies suffer heavy
outflow of funds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
These graphs illustrate the story of the week. Building societies suffered a
heavy outflow of funds in June, while National Savings had a good month,
before the launch of the First Option bond increased their takings still
further.
The Building Societies Association pointed out that the outflow did not all
go to National Savings - the second call for British Telecom shares will
have had an effect, and there were also signs that many people were
withdrawing savings in order to pay off debts, including mortgages.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Markets: Saddam's ghost gives investors the shivers - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE GHOST of Saddam Hussein returned to haunt Wall Street this week
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
even though he is believed to be very much alive.
Saddam's refusal to allow United Nations monitors to do their arms-finding
job in Baghdad brought the possibility of a renewed US-led military attack
on Iraq closer than it has been in the 18 months since the Gulf war ended.
The thought that US forces in the Middle East might once again face combat
sent a chill through the stock markets, contributing to the 30-point decline
in the Dow Jones average on Wednesday and yesterday's early losses.
A renewed conflict with Iraq - with all the resulting political and economic
uncertainty for the world's financial markets - is the last thing US
investors need.
The domestic economic recovery continues to disappoint; second-quarter
corporate earnings have been decidedly mixed; international equities are in
a flux over higher German interest rates and concern about the global
economic outlook; and President Bush still looks as if he could lose
November's election.
The markets cannot even draw comfort from the thought that another shooting
match with Saddam might revive Bush's popularity at home. If anything, it
probably would emphasise how the Gulf war, although successful in military
terms, was an unfinished job.
Just like the week before, US investors had a hard time this week coping
with all the news swirling around them.
In the past few years, Wall Street has developed a resilience in the face of
big declines in foreign markets. The drawn-out crash in Japanese equities,
for example, created barely a ripple in US markets. But that resilience is
under severe stress and has shown its first sign of cracking.
This week, Tokyo stocks fell to their lowest levels in six years and
continental European bourses took consecutive tumbles, as did London.
By the time trading in New York opened each day, US investors were in no
mood to buy stocks.
While each market was responding partly to domestic influences, the
domino-like losses from Tokyo to New York were incurred against a background
of deepening concern about the global economy. Investors everywhere are
worried that the rise in German interest rates could stifle already-weak
economic growth in Europe and the US.
The fact that 11 of the world's central banks, led by the US Federal
Reserve, had to intervene in foreign exchange markets this week to prop up
an ailing dollar only added to the mood of crisis.
That is a word with which the bosses of US airlines must now be very
familiar.
After a vicious price war in late spring and early summer, all the major
operators now are reaping the unhappy consequences of trying to boost sales
with bargain basement offers.
It was no surprise, therefore, when Delta, supposedly one of the most secure
of the country's troubled carriers, unveiled a Dollars 265.4m second-quarter
operating loss on Thursday.
To compensate for low passenger-mile revenues, Delta is taking the knife to
its cost base. The airline plans to cut its workforce by 4,000 (5 per cent
of the total) and convert an unspecified number of full-time positions to
part-time status.
Another big carrier, USAir, also announced a sizeable second-quarter loss
(Dollars 84.9m) and also blamed the red ink on the domestic fare wars.
At least the struggling USAir, which is labouring with debts of more than
Dollars 2bn, was thrown a lifeline on Tuesday in the form of a Dollars 750m
investment by British Airways, which will take a 44 per cent stake.
There was brighter news on the corporate front elsewhere. Bank profits
continued to improve with Citicorp, Chase Manhattan, First Chicago and JP
Morgan all posting sharply higher income.
Salomon, meanwhile, proved that it has finally moved out from under the
shadow of last year's bond trading scandal. It reported the highest
three-monthly operating earnings ever recorded by a publicly-quoted US
securities house.
Salomon's stunning feat comes just three quarters after the company was laid
low (and almost laid out) by the discovery that it had rigged Treasury
auctions in 1990 and 1991 to bypass government rules.
It was achieved partly by piggy-backing the steep yield curve to a big
increase in interest income, and by recording a strong performance from its
bonds and derivatives trading businesses.
The outcome was a promising debut for the company's new chairman and former
chief legal adviser, Robert Denham.

FT  25 JUL 92 / The Long View: Autumn tea-leaves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SMALL island economy off the northwest coast of Europe is trying once
again to stabilise its currency. Few but the natives are very interested.
The big picture, meanwhile, is that the two global economic giants, the US
and Japan, are grappling with debt difficulties which will take years to
solve. By and large Europe does not have a debt problem (although Germany
seems intent on creating one). All the while, the growth focus of the global
economy is shifting to Asia and the world will look a very different place
in 20 or 30 years.
When Wall Street crashed in 1987, there was an obvious parallel with 1929.
In fact, this turned out to be seriously misleading. What has happened in
the US in the past five years has not been at all like what took place at
the beginning of the 1930s. Sticking with the stock market as an indicator,
the Dow Jones Average has actually headed upwards to new highs, albeit
rather erratically and unconvincingly. In stark contrast, between the
September 1929 high and the eventual low nearly three years later the Dow
lost 89 per cent.
You can argue that it is what has been happening in Tokyo that is more
directly comparable with events in the US some 60 years ago. During the
1920s the US had been the brash, fast-growing star of the world economy,
marked by soaring asset values and financial excesses. A classic stock
market bubble was created. In important respects Japan fulfilled the same
role during the 1980s. Perhaps the Tokyo stock market has collapsed in
slightly a more orderly way than Wall Street did all those years ago, but
the Nikkei Average has nevertheless managed to lose 60 per cent of its value
in 2 1/2 years and this week it hit another new low.
The theory of long economic cycles is sketchy to say the least, but there is
some basis for arguing that human attitudes are affected by whether unhappy
memories are fresh in the mind or only found in dusty history books. In some
circumstances debt spells disaster - as many recent homebuyers in the UK can
testify - but at other times optimism dominates and a wave of confidence can
lead to the build-up of excessive risk.
Corporate and personal debt is a familiar part of the problem. The newer
factor in this second 20th century supercycle has been the willingness of
governments to accumulate huge debts, reflecting attempts to stimulate
economic growth and also to meet social spending obligations. That is the
American problem, and suddenly it is becoming a British problem too, as the
ministers at Wednesday's cabinet meeting were made uncomfortably aware.
In the end governments become hemmed in. Last year the British government
took the decision to raise 1992-93 public sector borrowing from Pounds 14bn
to what now seems likely to be well over Pounds 30bn. But judging by the
reactions of the building societies, there is little more room for the
government to go further into deficit. Meanwhile the exchange rate is
supposedly untouchable, taxes cannot be raised, and the election manifesto
was full of expensive public spending pledges. Something will have to give.
Similarly, in the US a reckoning awaits after the presidential election.
Borrowing cannot go on at the current level. It is because forced changes
are on the way that there is a growing sense of crisis in the financial
markets. Things are brewing up nicely for September and October, when these
problems traditionally come to crisis point.
There was absolutely no alternative but that the UK should stay on the gold
standard in 1931. To devalue by a quarter, as eventually happened in
September that year, would be, they said, disastrously inflationary and
would forfeit Britain's economic and political leadership. But the Bank of
England ran out of gold. Indeed the UK had to eat humble pie and move down
the economic pecking order, but the inflation turned out not to be a
problem. As we find ourselves once again perhaps 25 per cent overvalued
against the dollar, the potential inflation problem looks much more serious:
imports these days satisfy a third of domestic demand, and most would rise
in price in terms of sterling by the full amount of the devaluation almost
immediately.
The flicker of life in the dollar price of gold during the past few weeks is
a reminder that potential currency depreciation is not just a British
problem. Only the Bundesbank appears to be determined to fight seriously
against currency debasement. The battle has only just begun, but already
many fainthearts in Britain have started to throw in the towel.
In the US in the early 1930s a bloated banking system was allowed to
collapse. Today banks in the US, Japan, the UK and elsewhere similarly
should shrink drastically, but it seems unlikely that the politicians would
tolerate the consequences. The British government, for instance, appears to
walk in awe of the building societies. The question therefore is whether the
inflationary solution is more likely to be adopted this time than the
deflationary one: it certainly looks that way in the US.
The upwave of a long cycle is reached when the debt burden has been reduced
to acceptable levels and people recover confidence to spend and invest.
After an unpleasant period of adjustment, people will once again sell their
labour at a price at which they can be profitably employed. However, the
vigour of the recovery depends on how human and natural resources, together
with technological innovation, can be harnessed within an encouraging
political framework. The US led the way early in the century, then Japan
took over. In future the biggest opportunities will be elsewhere, perhaps in
China.
The recovery could be surprisingly strong when it comes. The London stock
market doubled between 1932 and 1936. But there are hard decisions to be
taken, whether or not devaluation is chosen. The problems of a small country
can be fascinating if you live there.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Why we deserve the Games people play: They are big, brash,
and corporatist. And, for a fortnight, they will be inescapable. Nicholas
Woodworth ponders the Olympic omens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DECADE ago I felt a passing familiarity with a city of faded, alluring
charm. On returning this week to Barcelona for the 25th Olympic summer
games, I wandered about a city remade and felt like a stranger striking up a
new acquaintance. Gone is the ageing dancehall diva. Massaged and made up,
powdered and perfumed, Barcelona is rejuvenated and ready to strut the
boards in the greatest show on earth.
Catalan energy has worked wonders of transformation. In the past week I have
ambled past surging highways where no highways surged before. I have stood
by new ports where ships have yet to dock, trundled up hillside escalators
to vast virgin acres of glass and marble, and lost myself in entire planned
suburbs - now home to hordes of athletes, officials and journalists - that
have risen overnight. There is not a lamp standard from which a five-ringed
banner does not fly, not a hoarding from which Olympic sponsors do not hawk
their wares. Even today, as excited crowds swarm over 42 Olympic venues, the
last lick of paint is barely dry on a brash, brave and shiny new Barcelona.
But I have found a retreat from the growing clamour of Olympic triumphalism.
For centuries, the Barrio Chino has been a refuge to Barceloneses escaping
their own inbred virtues of industriousness and level-headed business sense.
Set in the grimy, malodorous alleys lying near the old harbour, it is the
traditional haunt of sailors, pickpockets, gourmands, late-night revellers
and a Barcelona demi-monde bent on the satisfaction of varied, sometimes
illicit, appetites.
In La Plata tapas bar, crowded with theatre-goers, I had tart white wine and
sardines fresh from the grill. In the modest Bar Cleo I shared magnificent
butifarra y judias - sausage and beans - with ham-fisted workers. In La
Pineda, I listened to a flush-faced tippler, a migrant like so many in this
bustling city, give passionate voice to the songs of his native Andalusia.
And in the Paloma ballroom, remnant of an earlier age, I watched elderly
ladies flutter their fans in the warm air and wait coquettishly for an
invitation to dance the paso doble.
* * * The world of Mediterranean sensuality may not have disappeared
entirely under the weight of the new Olympic Barcelona but, even in the
scurviest bar of the Barrio Chino, the influence is inescapable.
Take the simple relieving of summer thirst. Ask for a drink of water here
and you are likely to receive a bottle of Fontdor, the 'official' Olympic
water. Estrella van Damm is the beer which officially sponsors the Barcelona
Olympics. Freixinet is its official wine. Minute Maid is its official fruit
juice. And Coca-Cola, as no one can avoid knowing, is the official soft
drink of the Games. Anyone foolish enough to boycott official Olympic drinks
this scorching summer in Barcelona might find himself very thirsty indeed.
The commercial hijacking of every liquid imaginable is not a heavy charge to
lay against the Olympic movement. There are many heavier. While Barcelona
roars into first gear with today's opening ceremony, the International
Olympic Committee is as swamped by as many accusations concerning the
perversion of Olympic ideals as it has ever been. From the pettiness of
unprincipled gift-taking to the enormity of unleashing on the world a
bloated, over-commercialised Olympic organism whose size and growth is now
out of control, the IOC, it seems, can do nothing right.
The committee, runs the diatribe, is an all-powerful, secretive organisation
answerable neither to athletes nor to world sports enthusiasts but only to
Juan Antonio Samaranch, its high-handed, dictatorial president.
Under his rule, critics say, the IOC has been transformed from a selfless
endeavour of high moral aspiration into a full-time, cut-throat,
profit-making business corporation. Cities wishing to host the Games now pay
about Dollars 40m (Pounds 20.9m) apiece simply for the privilege of wooing
the IOC with their bids. Barcelona's spending for the Games and new
infrastructure amounts to Dollars 4.58bn. Worldwide commercial sponsorship
of the Games by Coca-Cola and 11 other multinationals stands at Dollars
180m.
Profits from television rights are enormous. The US network NBC alone has
paid Dollars 401m to broadcast the Games. Profits by athletes are even
further out of proportion, critics allege. This year Michael Jordan, who is
appearing in Barcelona with the US basketball team, will receive Dollars 21m
in product endorsements. So high have the stakes become that athletes are
willing to do anything to win: Britain's Sports Council cites a study
claiming that more than 50 per cent of international athletes would be
willing to take a drug that guaranteed them an Olympic gold medal even if it
killed them within a year.
* * * Good grief, what has become of the world? Have the Olympics become so
insidious an institution that they have caused us to lose our reason? Could
they, in the age we live in, be anything other than what they are? Sitting
in the sun in the Barrio Chino's palm-tree-studded Placa Real the other day,
an ice-cold, official drink at hand, I decided to take a step back from it
all and consult a higher authority.
A weighty and worthy tome by one Professor Richard D. Mandell never leaves
my side at these Games. Sport: A Cultural History might be couched in
over-academic language but it provides a suitably hefty counter-weight to
the Olympic razzmatazz that encroaches on every side.
'All societies, including our own,' I read, 'require self-discipline, the
suppression of aggression, and widely accepted justifications of the social
order. There have always been social or professional classes to interpret
the random happenings of the universe and otherwise to maintain by
propaganda and by force the existing political order.'
So far, so good. I read on. 'The prevailing interpretations of the cosmic
order or theology, in order to be made manifest or be given concrete visual
or otherwise perceivable form to the society as a whole, requires
symbolically presented, well-observed public performances or festivals.' The
good professor, I took it, was talking about sport. 'New technologies and
new political organisations regularly result in new varieties of
theatrically presented contests that symbolically affirm the correctness of
the social order that fosters them.'
In dazzling sunshine and 35`C heat, I found it a mouthful, but on further
perusal began to see what Mandell was getting at. Sport evolves as a product
of its own surrounding environment; it not only reflects the social and
economic values of its age, it also reinforces them. Every epoch and every
society has found a different purpose and meaning in sport.
Take the Mesopotamians, for example. One of the earliest military
dictatorships, Mesopotamia had no time for adolescent pixies waving coloured
ribbons on the gymnastics floor. The idea was to demonstrate the fierceness
and military skill of the regime in order to impress the populace and scare
off foreign enemies. Thus lion-slaying, boxing, and mean feats on the
two-wheeled chariot were the sports of the day.
Dynastic Egypt, on the other hand, had no use for such machismo - it lay
protected from aggression by the desert and developed a stultified ruling
class that evolved little over the millennia. Pharonic rule gave rise to
formal, stylised sports generating visually and aesthetically attractive
recreations - witness didactic frescos of slender youths illustrating 122
precise and elegant wrestling positions.
On the island of Crete, ancient sport was altogether different. The Minoans
were an aesthetic, pacific and theocratic people. They served their gods
with poetry, ecstatic dancing and acrobatics. Leaping through the horns of a
raging bull and then hand-springing from its back may sound like simple
showing-off. In fact, it was part of a complex, sacred ritual of a highly
religious society.
In China, a mandarin administration devoted to the protection of the
empire's long borders from marauding Mongol hordes gave birth to
sophisticated equestrian arts. In Japan, chronic internal disorder gave rise
to the samurai class and the evolution of swordsmanship, archery, gunnery
and martial arts such as jujitsu. Everywhere, in fact, even in ancient
Greece, sport reflected the economic and social ethos of its place and time.
Today, we like to hark back to a classical Olympian age when sport was pure,
idealistic and untrammelled by grubby considerations of power, money, and a
score of other modern Olympic bugbears. But things were not, it seems, quite
like that. Winning an event in the ancient Greek Olympics meant more than
earning a garland of olive leaves.
Winning was proof of the favour of the gods; such favour meant that the
city-state the athlete represented could proceed confidently in the various
political, commercial and military endeavours in which it competed with
other city-states of the Hellenic world - Olympia, in one sense, was the
Brussels of the ancient world. Idealism was never in it, not even for the
athlete himself who, for all but the early Games, was strictly professional
and performed for large financial inducements.
England's industrial revolution has given us other gods and other sports. It
produced the capitalist age and sporting events that suited the means and
ideals of urban mass production. Sport became rationalised, standardised,
measured and quantifiable.
Gone, for example, were the spontaneous ball games of the pre-industrial age
where, in chaotic melee, entire rural populations would run, throw or kick a
stuffed pig's bladder between one village and the next. In its place evolved
the highly supervised, theatrically presented entertainment that today
arouses the passions of millions of city dwellers around the world.
Whether it is association football or any other modern sport, the evolution
of complex rules, team hierarchies and precise calculations of times and
distances lends itself to our market-oriented obsession with verifiable
accomplishment. Such sport, concludes Mandell, 'not only eased, but actually
promoted, the mental adaption of the whole population to the demands of the
modern world.'
Long after the industrial revolution, we are more obsessed with acquisition
and verifiable accomplishment than ever. This is the age of the leveraged
buy-out, the corporate raider, the dramatic success and shameful failure of
junk-bond trader Michael Milken. Winning in this society is what counts. Why
our surprise and outrage, then, that sport is a mirror image of the world as
it actually exists? Could drug-pumped sprinter Ben Johnson have come into
being if Milken had not?
If we lived in a theocracy, our sports might be directed towards spiritual
salvation. If we lived in a militarist society, today's Olympic opening
ceremony might resemble Hitler's 1936 Berlin extravaganza. But we do not.
Most of us live in democracies shaped by consumerism and the trans-national
corporations that supply it. We like Coca-Cola; we like Nike running shoes;
we like Panasonic VCRs and Visa cards. We live in a corporate age, with all
its benefits and evils, and our sport is corporate sport. Complaining is no
use. If we want it otherwise, we will have to change the way we live.
I shall continue to enjoy my occasional retreats into the anachronistic
world of the Barrio Chino. But I shall also enjoy the spectacle of the
brash, modern, corporate Olympic Games. We have, after all, got what we
asked for.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Survey of Second Cars (9): A cleaner and cheaper option -
Diesel Cars / For second car buyers concerned about the environment as much
as their bank balances, a diesel is the obvious choice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS a myth that diesel-engined cars make sense only when bought by
owners who drive huge annual mileages. That, it is said, is the only way
their extra cost can be offset by the saving made from using lesser amounts
of generally cheaper fuel.
It might have been true years ago when diesel cars used to be at least 10
per cent dearer than their petrol-engined equivalents. They also needed more
frequent servicing and were pretty boring to drive - but neither is true
today, either.
As more and more Britons are buying diesel cars (nearly 12 per cent of new
registrations at the moment) the makers are fighting for market share. One
result has been a reduction of the price premium, in some cases almost to
disappearing point.
For example, the latest Citroen ZX 1.9 Turbo Diesel (from Pounds 11,370) is
cheaper than a comparable petrol-engined VW Golf 1.8 GL (Pounds 12,386) or
Vauxhall Astra 1.6i CD (Pounds 12,684) but outperforms both cars for speed,
acceleration and, of course, fuel economy. As most second cars are, by
definition, bought out of taxed income, running costs - and reliability -
are of crucial importance. Diesels shine on both counts.
Although not many second cars cover big annual mileages in total, they often
make a great number of short trips of two or three miles or even less. In a
typical day, the engine may be cold-started several times and, in winter,
may never reach its proper working temperature from one week's end to
another.
Under these conditions a diesel engine is vastly more economical than a
petrol engine.
Generally, a diesel car is reckoned to be about 20-25 per cent more
economical than a petrol car of similar size, weight and performance. This
appears to be confirmed by the official fuel consumption data put out by the
Department of Transport.
But the official figures in simulated urban, open road and motorway driving
conditions are recorded with the engine at working temperature. This
considerably understates a diesel's economy advantage.
While warming up and running on a rich fuel/air mixture, a petrol engine
uses far more fuel than it does at its correct operating temperature.
Volkswagen, which has no axe to grind because it makes more petrol than
diesel engines, says tests have shown that for the first mile, a petrol
engine uses three times as much fuel as a diesel.
Atmospheric pollution is directly linked to fuel consumption. Because a
diesel uses far less fuel than a petrol engine and burns it more
efficiently, it is more environmentally friendly. Overall, a diesel is
cleaner even than a petrol engine with the most sophisticated kind of
catalytic converter.
So for second car buyers concerned about the environment as much as their
bank balances, a diesel is the obvious choice.
As it does not have an electrical ignition system, which any AA or RAC man
will confirm is the main cause of starting problems and roadside breakdowns,
a diesel engine is inherently reliable.
Given the minimum of regular servicing - usually a six-monthly or 6,000
miles oil and filter change - a diesel engine will run trouble-free for
years.
Cold starting in winter is no problem. Nor do the latest winter-grade fuels
'freeze' or congeal in bitter weather. They flow freely at temperatures
rarely experienced in Britain and most modern diesel cars have fuel-line
heaters anyway.
If the battery is in good condition and the pre-heat warning light is
allowed to go out before the key is turned, a diesel fires up instantly. (In
13 years of running diesels as my personal cars, none has ever failed to
start on the first flip of the key).
The main disadvantage of a diesel car is noise after cold starting (and to a
lesser extent when idling) and particulates in the exhaust. If one drives
off straight away after start-up, the noise largely disappears and at normal
running speeds, it is hard to tell a modern diesel from a petrol car.
Particulate emissions (in other words, exhaust smoke) should not be a
problem with a sensibly driven diesel car in good condition.
Lorries, with large, direct injection engines are another matter, especially
if overloaded, ill-maintained and inconsiderately driven.
With over 150 different hatchbacks, saloons and estates listed in the
current issue of Diesel Car magazine, the choice for the second car buyer is
almost confusingly large. Most kinds of car, from runabouts to big executive
saloons, are available in diesel-power form.
New list prices start at under Pounds 7,000 for a Seat Ibiza three-door and
go up to Pounds 30,000-plus (Mercedes-Benz 300TD estate). If you expect a
diesel car to perform with a petrol car's vigour, go for one with a
turbocharged engine.
It will still be the more economical. But even a diesel cannot be
fuel-miserly if you insist on being first away from the lights every time
and on accelerating flat out up long gradients. Diesel cars give of their
best for drivers with a thought for the environment, not an urge to be
always at the head of the pack.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Survey of Second Cars (8): Still very much a curiosity -
Battery Cars / For many a household, a second car with a 13 amp power socket
instead of a petrol filler cap would be ideal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL

<TEXT>
A BATTERY CAR would be cheap to run, especially if its power cells were
recharged at night with low tariff electricity. It would also be virtually
silent, entirely non-polluting (at least it would be at the place where it
was being used) and exceptionally easy to drive.
Environmentalists keep on saying the battery-electric is the car of the
future. They may be right. And there is no doubt one would suit many second
car users right now; the kind who average a couple of thousand miles a year
and rarely go more than 10 or so miles from home.
With so much apparently going for it, why does the battery car, which is as
old as the motor industry, obstinately remain a curiosity?
First, it has to be said that an electric battery is not a source of energy
but merely a convenient means of packaging and storing electrical energy
generated elsewhere. That usually means in a thermal power station, spewing
hundreds of tons of sulphurous fumes and carbon dioxide gas from its
chimneys every day. And which actually turns into electricity only 30 per
cent of the energy contained in the mountain of coal burned in its boilers.
Once the electricity has been generated, it has to be carried around in the
car's storage batteries. They are its Achilles' heel. A kilogram of petrol
contains 300 times as much energy as a kilogram of lead/acid batteries.
There are other kinds. Alkaline batteries cost more and are just as heavy,
though they do have a longer service life.
Super-efficient batteries, two or three times as powerful for their weight
as today's lead/acid kind, have been under development for years. They are
costly and still far from commercial production. Some have to operate at
several hundred degrees Celsius. A pack of those would not be the happiest
companion in a small car.
Every major manufacturer has produced prototype battery electric cars. All
suffer to a greater or lesser extent from the same intractable problem. You
can give a battery car quite a long range, vigorous acceleration or a high
top speed - but not all together. They are mutually exclusive.
Britain leads the world in the use of battery-electrics. There are about
30,000 on the UK's roads: most of them are milk floats. They go well enough
when fully charged so they do not hold up the traffic when leaving the dairy
before dawn. But it's a different story a few hours later. Batteries half
discharged, they creep back to base, dragging tails of exasperated motorists
behind them.
However, something must be done to reduce city centre noise and air
pollution. Demand for non-polluting vehicles will grow and electric
propulsion will have a big part to play.
It is, though, a Catch-22 situation. Until there is a demand for large
numbers of battery electric cars, they will cost far more to make than much
more practical internal-combustion engined cars. And until they are as cheap
as - ideally cheaper than - motorcars, there will be no real demand for them
unless it can be artificially stimulated.
Electric cars are already exempted from the Pounds 110 annual tax and more
concessions might be offered to popularise them. Perhaps owners might be
allowed to park them on single yellow lines or use bus/taxi lanes at peak
times.
There needs to be some incentive. Knowing you are setting a good example is
not enough to persuade many people to buy a slow, limited range
battery-electric, costing twice as much as one running on petrol as a second
car.
Battery-powered cars already exist. Peugeot has been producing a limited
number of electric 205s, with a bonnet full of batteries instead of a petrol
or diesel engine. It is said to have a range of up to 100 km (62 miles) at
modest speed on level ground and a top speed of 100 kmh (62 mph), though not
for very long.
With all that weight up front, it cannot help being heavy to steer but it
hums along the flat, climbed hills well and goes down them even better. It
has no gears and its fuel costs are a fraction of a petrol car's - but the
massive battery pack will need replacing every four years or so at a cost of
perhaps Pounds 1,000.
More recently, Fiat has introduced a battery-electric Cinquecento baby car
at the same time as the two petrol-engined versions. The Cinquecento Elettra
is only a two-seater; the batteries take up the space of both rear seats and
boot. Quaintly, the electric motor drives the front wheels through the
petrol car's clutch and five-speed gearbox, though you can treat it as a
one-gear car if you wish.
Neither car is on sale in Britain.
Perhaps the battery-electric second car will only take off if (some think it
is when) petrol or diesel engined vehicles are prohibited from using urban
centres altogether. This is unlikely to happen until the 21st century (less
than eight years away, remember) but let no-one think it impossible.
Motor dealers in California, where the exhaust catalyser first became
mandatory, have been told that 2 per cent of the cars they sell must be
totally non-polluting, which means battery-electric, by 1998. By 2003, the
proportion will be 10 per cent.
Surely it couldn't happen here? But who could have forecast in 1985 that by
the end of this year every petrol-engined car sold in Britain and throughout
Europe would need to have a catalytic converter? For all their snags,
battery electric second cars could become a popular choice sooner than now
seems possible.
The shape of second cars to come? Honda's EP-X concept car is specifically
designed as ultra-compact, personal transportation for two. The tandem
seating allows the car to be narrow for slipping through traffic, while
allowing more side impact protection than is possible with two-abreast
seating. A one litre engine and lightweight aluminium body promote fuel
efficiency; a lift-up canopy allows driver and passenger to enter from
either side of the car.
As with most concept cars, the EP-X itself is unlikely ever to enter
production but some of its core design ideas are expected to appear on
future models.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Survey of Second Cars (6): All the feel with none of the
effort - Automatics / Power-assisted steering is so pleasant that many
motorists have vowed never to buy a car without it again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SECOND car is often as vital a part of the household equipment as the
washing machine, food processor and vacuum cleaner.
Women who drive them reckon they ought to be as simple and straightforward
to operate. Here is one man who is entirely on their side.
I am among a rapidly growing body of motorists who consider there are only
two kinds of car: those with power steering - and the others, which are a
struggle to park. Should one wish to go a stage further, then the power or
non-power steered cars can be divided into those with automatic or manual
transmission.
Power-assisted steering is so pleasant - and having to wrestle a car into a
meter bay so disagreeable and unnecessary - that many motorists have vowed
never to buy a car without it again.
The same goes for two-pedal control. A century ago the car gearbox was
invented by a Frenchman, Mr Gregoire. It was, he said, a brutal device but
it would have to do until something better came along. Some years ago, it
did. At first it was suitable only for large engined cars with power to
spare. But now the benefits of automatic transmission are being appreciated
at motoring's broad and modestly priced base; not least by wives and mothers
driving small cars on their shopping and school runs.
Enthusiasts once argued that power assistance smothered feedback through the
steering, so road grip could not be assessed. Automatic transmissions were
sneered at for allegedly blunting the edge of a car's performance and
ruining its fuel economy.
There was something in this once, but not any more. Today's power assistance
systems simply take all the effort out of the steering, none of the 'feel.'
Modern four-speed automatics no longer waste up to 10 per cent of every
litre of fuel put in the tank.
Performance blunting allegations do not hold water, either. Never mind what
the 0-60 mph acceleration figures in the magazines say. They are obtained by
brutal driving; by dropping the clutch at 5,000 rpm and leaping away in a
cloud of tyre smoke. In the real world, automatics are usually first away
from the lights.
Most two-pedal cars are still slightly thirstier than manuals. A sensibly
driven automatic will use perhaps 5 per cent more fuel than a manual, though
some of the latest ones with five speeds offer almost the same economy. It
is a small price to pay for the sheer convenience of two-pedal control.
Price remains a problem. Automatic transmissions cost more to make than
manual gearboxes. The smaller and cheaper the car, the greater the premium
one has to pay, though the amount varies widely.
Why automatic transmission adds Pounds 1,260 to the price of a Pounds 12,495
Rover 216 SLi 16v, but only Pounds 649 to a Pounds 11,731 Vauxhall Cavalier
1.6L, is hard to understand. The fact that the automatic package includes
optional power steering on the Rover is only a partial explanation; the
Cavalier has power steering as standard.
Rover's latest two-pedal Metro, the delightful 1.4S three-door, is listed at
Pounds 10,163, which is Pounds 1,365 more than it costs with a manual
gearbox.
Yet a Pounds 5,765 Fiat Panda 1000 Selecta with a similar kind of
continuously variable automatic transmission is only Pounds 490 dearer than
a manual Panda 1000 CLX. Neither, though, is offered with power steering.
No carmaking country has done more to bring two-pedal, power-steered
motoring within financial reach of the budget-conscious private buyer than
Japan. For example, a Daihatsu Charade CX 1.3 with both features is listed
at Pounds 8,410; a Mitsubishi Colt 1600 GLXi 16v is Pounds 10,720; a Toyota
Corolla 1.3 GL Pounds 9,990.
One of their few European rivals with a conventional automatic transmission
is the two-pedal, power steered Peugeot 205 XL three-door at Pounds 9,803.
None of these list prices, to which delivery charges of about Pounds
350-Pounds 400 must be added, should be taken at face value. Always
negotiate a discount.
Small, powered-steered automatics are ideal for people who use a car mainly
in town and spend as much time parking as driving. Mature motorists will
find that as the years roll by and middle age starts going the way youth
went long ago, their attraction grows greater.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Survey of Second Cars (7): Era of pint-sized wonder cars -
Microcars / Stuart Marshall wonders if, in 10 years' time, these
three-metre-long microcars may be the only ones allowed in city centres
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMAGINE cars which are just five inches longer than a Rover Mini but
accommodate four adults, sitting upright, with their heads clear of the
roof, and which also have adequate luggage space. Impossible? But such cars
do exist.
No-one would ever call them good-looking. But one might pat them on their
bonnets. Under them live engines of less than 660 cc capacity, with four or
even five valves per cylinder, fuel injection and often turbocharging and
intercooling. Driven sensibly, they burn about one gallon (4.5 litres) of
unleaded petrol every 60 miles (96 km).
Use them in town and they are as gentle and featherlight to drive and park
as the best of shopping cars.
But flick the five-speed gearshift around freely, let the engine howl up to
high revolutions (tachometers are red-lined at about 8,000 rpm) and the hot
ones go like the Mini Cooper 1275S of blessed memory.
At least, they do until you reach about 80 mph/130 kmh. Then a governor cuts
out the fuel injection.
Visibility is panoramic. You can hardly see their bonnets and the rear
screens are like picture windows. A driver more than 6ft (183 cm) can settle
comfortably behind the steering wheel.
In the back, providing the seat in front is not occupied by someone equally
long in the leg, his head will be nowhere near the roof.
You need space for two sets of golf clubs in their trolleys? Just fold the
rear seat flat and there is ample room to get them in without a struggle.
Typical of these pint-sized wonder cars are the Dangan ZZ, top model in the
Mitsubishi Minica range of microcars, and the Daihatsu Mira Turbo TRXX
Avanzato.
If you think they sound like perfect second cars - nimble and economical, as
entertaining as they are effortless to drive - you are right.
The Dangan (bullet in Japanese) ZZ and the Avanzato are just two top
performing models among scores of different microcars, of which about 1m are
sold in Japan each year.
By law, all have engines of under 660 cc. They cost from about Pounds 3,000
to Pounds 7,000, depending on specification and how much optional equipment
is fitted. The snag is you have to live in Japan to get one because -
officially - they are not sold anywhere else.
That situation could change. The gentlemen's agreement limiting Japanese car
imports into Britain to 11 per cent of total registrations will not survive
indefinitely.
British production of Japanese cars like the Nissan Primera (soon to be
joined by the Micra), Honda Concerto (soon also the Syncro) and, from
December, Toyota Carina must change the picture. And in any case, these
engaging microcars can already be brought in as personal imports through
Jersey, in the Channel Islands, though not at Japanese home-market prices.
Mr Clive de Carle of Rare Imports (0734 713244) has the details.
Traditionally, about 60 per cent of all microcars have been bought by women.
Recently, though, young Japanese males have begun to take an interest as
high-performers become available. It is easy to see why. Their tiny
catalyser equipped, three-cylinder turbocharged and intercooled engine puts
out a lusty 63 or so horsepower. They are mechanical jewels; the kind of
things top Swiss watchmakers might produce if asked to diversify into cars.
Whether one is making them pull quite hard in fifth gear, or urging them up
to a joyous 7,000-plus rpm, one would never suspect they had only three
cylinders. They run with the smoothness of an electric motor.
Microcars may form a sub-class in Japan but it is 'sub' only in size, not
sophistication. Standard options include manual or automatic transmission,
both with four-wheel drive if required.
Power steering, central locking, cabriolet bodies, air conditioning and
remotely controlled CD players are all available. Some even have lights and
screenwipers that are turned on automatically when it gets dark or starts to
rain.
At Tokyo Motor Show last year, many were on display. Honda, for example, had
a sweet little three-door, three-cylinder hatchback called the Today,
looking like a shrunken, but still nicely proportioned, Honda Civic. More
spectacular is the two-seat Honda Beat, mid-engined and rear-wheel driven,
with a lift-off roof.
Like the front-wheel drive Daihatsu Leeza soft top, the Beat will not go
much faster than 80 mph (130 kmh). But who cares? They give you the fun of a
Ferrari at a fraction of the price. Mazda's baby is called Carol and can be
front or four-wheel driven. Its bigger brother, the 121, has been available
in Britain for some time.
This Rover Metro-sized four-door saloon is almost 5ft (150 cm) high which
means there is more headroom, especially in the back, than you would find in
a much larger European car. With automatic transmission only, its UK price
is Pounds 8,350.
Subaru's Rex microcar can be had with four doors, four-wheel drive, manual
or automatic transmission and a turbocharged four-cylinder engine. And one
of the most ingenious town cars of all is the Suzuki Alto, with sliding
doors on each side and a seat that swivels 90 degrees so the driver can step
straight out on the pavement.
At the moment, the European motor industry has nothing to compare with the
Japanese microcars for size (except the 30-year-old Mini and the new Fiat
Cinquecento) and nothing that comes within light years of matching their
sheer sophistication.
But in 10 years' time these three-metre-long microcars may be the only ones
allowed in city centres. So one hopes someone is paying attention.
Otherwise, the Japanese carmakers will clean up - once again.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Survey of Second Cars (4): Tempting offers - at a price -
Ways to Finance / 'Free credit' is genuinely available but it usually has a
price-tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BORROWING money to buy an asset which depreciates as fast as a car is
inadvisable. Adding to your personal debt burden, even minimally, to acquire
a second car seems ludicrous.
Gone are the go-go 1980s. These are the caring 1990s when experts are
advising us to pay off our debts as quickly as possible - even the mortgages
on our houses - because we are unlikely to receive a return on savings
higher than the rate we have to pay on money we borrow.
So obviously the best way to finance the purchase of a second car is either
to pay cash from savings or to save until the cash is available.
For those people who for some reason cannot follow this advice, a loan
arranged by the dealer selling the car might well be the cheapest form of
finance. Most car companies have their own finance subsidiaries and these
may offer very attractive terms.
Dealer finance rates are often negotiable. If you don't like the sound of
the first offer, find out elsewhere if better terms are available.
Personal loans from banks or building societies - organisations also geared
up to deal with individuals seeking money - are also likely to offer
competitive terms.
But shop around by checking the APR (annual percentage rate) on loans,
remembering that APR often varies according to the length of loan. Don't
forget to see if you qualify for some special deal because you work for a
particular company or belong to a particular trade union or other
organisation. Gold credit card holders are offered special, low rates on
loans.
Hire purchase arrangements tend to be more expensive than bank and building
society loans and in some circumstances you can lose the car if you fail to
keep up with the payments. On the other hand, with hire purchase you are
better protected if something goes wrong with the car because the hire
purchase provider has joint liability. For instance, if the dealer went
bankrupt and could not fulfil his obligations you would still be legally
protected by the finance company.
On this question of protection, some lenders sell their own insurance
policies to ensure the loan is repaid should something go terribly wrong
with your health or job. However, these can be very expensive - some even
add about 30 per cent to the cost of the loan.
It is sometimes possible to link a loan for a car to an existing property
mortgage. The interest is likely to be favourable but many people would not
think it worth repaying a car loan for the rest of the mortgage term. This
cash-raising option probably would suit only those with mortgages with
relatively little time still to run.
At the other extreme, if you need to raise a short-term loan for a car
(perhaps while waiting for some savings which are taking time to release) an
overdraft from your friendly bank manager will almost certainly be the
cheapest form of finance.
As there is no conclusive indication yet that the car market is moving out
of recession, there is a proliferation of tempting offers by manufacturers
and dealers.
Free credit is genuinely available but it usually has its price.
Interest-free credit is generally offered only if you pay the full retail
price for a car, whereas a cash buyer can often get a reasonable discount.
Interest-free credit is frequently on offer only if the loan is paid back
quickly. For example, there is a zero interest rate with Vauxhall's current
deal on Novas and Cavaliers - but only if you put down a 50 per cent deposit
and pay the remainder back in one year.
If you decide to try to negotiate a discount for cash (with perhaps the
intention of raising a personal loan to cover the outlay) it is best to
remember that the average dealer's profit margin on high-volume, small cars
is about 18 per cent. However, manufacturers frequently set dealers agreed
sales targets which, when reached, can earn the dealer an additional credit
of 3 or 4 per cent off every car sold during the offer period - which might
be over several months.
Consequently, if you are lucky enough to catch a dealer who is only a few
units short of the sales target with just a few days to go, you might strike
a very good bargain indeed.
One sign that these are difficult times for car producers is an unusual
scheme that Ford, the market leader in the UK, has introduced. Ford has come
up with what is virtually a car leasing scheme for private individuals and
it must be assumed that its rivals will follow suit if it shows any sign of
success.
With Ford's 'Options' scheme, a customer chooses a new car and the
manufacturer guarantees the value at the end of the finance agreement by
advising, in writing, the car's minimum guaranteed future value - Ford's
estimate of the amount the car might be worth at the end of the agreement.
This sum is then deducted from the price of the car so that the customer
makes payments only on the balance, plus interest on the full price.
At the end of the agreement customers have three options:
Choose a new car, selling the old car themselves or through the dealers'
resale club. The guaranteed future value amount is only paid to Ford Credit.
In this situation the customer benefits from any profit above the guaranteed
future value.
Keep the car by paying the guaranteed future value amount.
Return the car to the dealer.
Mr Ian McAllister, chairman of Ford of Britain, suggests that Options will
make a new car 'affordable' for many people who, because of the recession,
have been unable to buy one. He says Options aims 'to encourage customer
loyalty and to enable customers to change their cars more frequently with
minimal change to their monthly budget'.
Anyone who has tried to sell a used car recently will tell you that Options
looks like a good deal. However, there are some drawbacks. For example, you
might not actually receive the guaranteed future value payment you expected
if the car has suffered excess wear and tear. Ford dealers will apply the
same scale used for measuring damage to leased cars to assess the reduction
in value and the buyer will have to make up any shortfall.
Also, where the car is sold through a dealer for more than the guaranteed
value, the dealer may insist on a share of the profit.
But whatever method you choose to finance that second car, remember the
golden rule: never borrow more money than you can raise if you have to sell
the car in a hurry.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Survey of Second Cars (5): Chance to indulge a little
fantasy - Individual Choice / Second cars do not have to be sensible little
hatchbacks, saloons or estates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUYING your second car can be an opportunity to indulge a fantasy, gratify a
whim or project one's personality.
For example, driving to a part-time office job or taking the children to
school can be much more fun in a four-wheel drive.
The high seating position lets you see over hedge-rows and the tops of cars
in front. You may never need the 10 forward and two reverse gears. The high
ground clearance designed to cope with rutted trails may never be put to a
sterner test than mounting a high kerb when sneaking into a parking space.
But at the wheel of a Suzuki Vitara or Daihatsu Sportrak you can imagine
yourself driving across the Sahara, not down to Sainsbury's. They are the
kind of cars that fit a lifestyle in which Barbours, jodhpurs and green
wellies figure, whether you shoot or ride or not.
They cost no more to buy and insure than normal cars of similar price and
power though they are thirstier because of the extra weight and friction of
their four-wheel drive transmission.
A sporting two-seater or two-plus-two (the latter a two-seater with
impractical but conscience-saving back seats) is another option. Such cars,
including the Mazda MX-5, Toyota MR-2 or the new Honda CRX are enormously
entertaining, though in no way difficult or demanding, to drive.
They capture the spirit of the traditional British two-seat sports car
exemplified by the MGs of early postwar years but have all the 'mod cons'
that the MG conspicuously lacked. With tops folded or stowed away in the
boot, they offer the joys of open-air motoring with very few of the
inconveniences.
If you need more than two seats but still like the idea of driving topless
in summer weather, there are plenty of proper four-seat convertibles to
choose from. With hoods up, such cars as the Ford Escort, Peugeot 205, Rover
214, Vauxhall Astra and VW Golf cabriolets offer close to saloon car
comfort. Hoods down, they provide all the fresh air one could possibly need
without blowing your head off.
Insurance, it has to be said, is a potential problem for owners of a
sporting two-seater or a four-seat convertible. The insurance companies
suspect, probably correctly, that a sports car will be driven harder than a
saloon and they know that a soft-top convertible is a bigger security risk.
A sneak thief with a Stanley knife can ruin a hood in seconds even if he
decides not to pinch the stereo after all.
Nostalgia and a desire for individuality being what they are, many young
second car buyers fancy the idea of driving a collectable classic instead of
a modern hatchback.
The main thing to bear in mind about old cars is that they are like old
houses. They look picturesque, even romantic, but they use more fuel, are
less environmentally friendly and much more troublesome to maintain.
If you live in a 200-year-old farmhouse, you need to know how to rehang
tiles. Equally, if you choose to run a 30-year-old MGB or even a Morris
Minor instead of a modern car, you need to know one end of a spanner from
the other if you are not to be faced with (a) unreliability and (b) ruinous
garage bills. Having said that, collectable cars are now trading at more
sensible prices than they were a few years ago. One may appreciate rather
than lose value as it grows older, but only if it receives the tender,
loving care that modern cars were designed to do without.
Never be carried away by a car's good looks and one's own imagination when
contemplating buying a collectable as a second car. Tread carefully; to do
otherwise can lead to financial disaster.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Survey of Second Cars (3): How to reduce the risks - Why Buy
New? / Used cars may be worth buying, but you need to protect yourself
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
EVEN BEFORE the door of your new car has shut for the first time and you
drive away from the showroom, its value has almost certainly dropped by
Pounds 2,000 to Pounds 3,000. That happens as soon as the first name is
written on the registration document. The value of an average new car
plummets by about 30 per cent in the first year, so many buyers prefer to
let somebody else take that financial blow.
Of course, the vast majority of cars continue to depreciate throughout their
useful lives but the pace of decline slows markedly after the first two or
three years.
Those who regularly buy 'nearly new' cars usually do so to trade up to
something bigger or more luxurious than the new vehicle they could afford.
And a modern used car with 10,000 to 15,000 miles on the clock still has a
long life ahead of it.
'Cars today do last well and tolerate high mileages - 60,000 and 100,000
miles are not the frightening milestones they used to be,' says Mr Steve
Cropley, editor of Car Choice magazine. Neither is rusty bodywork the
problem it once was. 'Rust warranties are mainly horse manure but
manufacturers are doing a great deal - particularly using galvanised steel -
to make sure cars are much better in this respect,' he says.
Many cars have transferable warranties - some Japanese makes are offering
warranties for three years or 60,000 miles and Mitsubishi is offering one
for three years with unlimited mileage. There are 'extended' warranties
offered at a price on new cars, such as Ford's Extracover, and it is
possible for a used car buyer to purchase a warranty for up to seven years
or 70,000 miles (but don't expect too much from that one).
Some warranties are better than others. If a dealer offers one which does
not cover electronics and other expensive items, you could probably do
better buying a warranty direct from an insurance company.
However, there are always some risks associated with buying used cars.
For example: does the person selling the car really own it? Establishing
this fact is incredibly difficult.
'Astonishingly, there is no totally reliable way of proving who owns a car.
You can't rely on the registration documents, they show only the 'registered
keeper' who may not be the owner. It may, for example, be a leased company
car,' says Mr Simon Hinde, senior editor of Which? the Consumers'
Association's magazine.
He points out that, if you buy a car that turns out to be stolen, in nearly
every case you have no right to keep it. That is also the case if the seller
has leased or hired the car. However, if you buy from someone who has an
unpaid loan or a hire purchase arrangement outstanding for it, you do become
the owner. He or she has to continue paying off the loan.
The Consumers' Association, with the Office of Fair Trading and various
motoring organisations, is trying to persuade the government that the name
of the person or organisation who legally owns a car should be on the
registration document along with its full ownership history and the mileage
each time it changed hands.
While waiting for this legislation, buyers would do well to check with HP
(Hire Purchase) Information which has data on millions of cars provided by
insurance companies and finance houses throughout the country. The HPI
register can be checked via Citizens Advice Bureaux or, if you are in the
north-east of England, you can ring HPI's hot line on 0722 422422. For
Pounds 15 it will check a car out for you. This hot line scheme may be
extended to other parts of the UK if the test in the north-east works well.
Unfortunately, the HPI register is not infallible. For example, privately
leased cars - which pose a big threat to innocent buyers - are unlikely to
be listed.
Another way a buyer can protect him or herself, Mr Cropley suggests, is to
ask for the invoice that the seller received in buying the car. (In this
connection, it is also a good idea to keep safely the paperwork you obtain,
if you decide to buy.) Other documents might help, such as MOT test
certificates, for example, and servicing documents.
In any case, a would-be buyer should ask for documents giving the full
service history of any used car.
This helps to combat another big risk used car buying involves: 'clocking',
or turning the car's odometer back. Trading standard officers estimate that
one in five used cars has been clocked. A used car's price falls steadily as
the mileage rises and it is estimated that UK buyers pay about Pounds 200m a
year more than they should because of clocking.
Villains in the used car business are also getting better at repairing cars
written off by insurance companies. They can weld the bodies from two or
even three damaged cars together so expertly that only a very experienced
engineer is likely to detect the deception.
If you find out after you have acquired a car that it is a previous
'write-off', the law insists you inform any future buyer of this fact and
you will be lucky to get half the price of an equivalent, unrepaired
vehicle.
The best protection against this fraud is to ask for an inspection of the
car by an engineer from the AA or RAC. Many people believe this to be a
necessity when buying a high-priced used car.
The AA charges between Pounds 90 and Pounds 226 for each inspection and a
written report, depending on the size and complexity of the car; there is a
special telephone number on which inspections can be booked: 0345 500 610.
The RAC charges between Pounds 75 and Pounds 190 an inspection, plus a
Pounds 14 surcharge if the inspection takes place within the M25 London ring
road. The RAC has a Freephone number to book inspections: 0800 333 660 in
office hours.
Both motoring organisations say it might take two or three days before an
inspection can be made but they try hard to cut the time for people who are
in a hurry - perhaps because another potential buyer is lurking ready to
pounce.
While it remains important to follow the 'buyer beware' rules when buying a
used car from a private individual, such private sales are covered by the
Sale of Goods Act. This says the car must correspond with any description
applied to it, so it is a good idea to keep any advertisements about it and
take someone along with you as a witness to what is said during discussions
with the seller.
Of course, the safest way to buy a used car is from a reputable dealer.
Despite the Arthur Daley image, most dealers in the UK are honest, so ask
around and you will quickly establish which are those in your area with
decent reputations.
It would also be useful to arm yourself with information about prices. There
are several publications available which give guides to used car values.
The Consumers' Association also offers a 'Buying a Used Car Action Pack,'
available for Pounds 4.45 by mail order from PO Box 44, Hertford X, SG14 1SH
or by calling in at the Which? bookshop at 361 Euston Road in London.
Some final words of advice from the experts. Mr Cropley suggests you should
'avoid orphans' by which he means cars with unusual specifications (such as
three-door Sierras). This not only can cause difficulties if you want to
resell later, but also might give problems when spares are needed. 'Buy
popular specifications in popular colours,' he says.
Mr Hinde says: 'If you have any doubts (about a used car), question the
seller directly. If you are on your own, try to get answers in writing. Make
sure the condition of the car is consistent with the mileage shown. But
don't be put off by a few minor defects - it may pay to be suspicious of an
outwardly-perfect used car.'

FT  25 JUL 92 / Survey of Second Cars (2): A time to watch the pounds not
the clock - Value for Money / Buying new on a limited budget may mean
settling for old technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By  MATTHEW CARTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SELECTING a new company car is one of life's more pleasant tasks. A generous
budget means you can pick and choose to your heart's content. Air
conditioning, a CD player, leather trim - all appear within reach.
But choosing a second car, from taxed income, is altogether different: the
all-important factor is the price. Never mind how long it takes to
accelerate from 0-60 mph; never mind that you have to wind up your own
windows. When you're paying the bill, the bottom line is, well, the bottom
line.
If you need proof, just ask Volkswagen's marketing men. The company's entry
level Polo Fox enjoyed all the benefits of being a member of the VW family,
with reliability, quality, design integrity, style and panache all taken for
granted. Dealers should have been turning buyers away.
The fact that they weren't is partly due to the recession, but mainly down
to the price tag, a hefty Pounds 6,661 - considerably more than the rivals.
After discounting, of course, the prices moved far closer together, but the
private buyer tended to forget that and did not consider the Polo in the
first place. So, instead of having a car that cost a mint, VW cut dealer
margins, lowering the price to just under Pounds 6,000. As the
advertisements proclaim: 'For once, a Volkswagen falls below your
expectations.'
Whether or not the price cut has the desired effect remains to be seen, but
there is little doubt that, at the cheaper end of the market, keen pricing
is significantly more important than the ultimate in modern technology.
Indeed, at under Pounds 7,000, a 'new' car's average age is around 10 years
old. Some are older still: the newly introduced Pounds 5,895 Indian-built
Hindustan Ambassador (which will shortly be available in the UK) is
basically a 1950s Morris Oxford. It makes an elderly Lada or Yugo look
positively youthful.
And that's the problem when buying new on a limited budget: from a
technological point of view, it's a case of 'all our yesterdays'. The two
cheapest new cars on the market, the Yugo Tempo and Lada Riva, are designs
that Fiat abandoned decades ago.
So if all you want is a new K-plate to upstage the neighbours, then maybe
less than Pounds 3,900 is not such a high price to pay. But if you're
planning to drive the car, maybe you ought to budget a little more, for the
Tempo and Riva are crude in the extreme. They offer a great deal of metal
for the money but are heavy to drive and poorly made - and let's be honest,
they weren't particularly good cars when they were new all those years ago.
Stretching the budget to Pounds 5,000 brings a better news. There are still
variations on the Riva and Tempo theme available, but from the viewpoint of
living with the car it would be better to look elsewhere.
Fiat's entry level model is the Pounds 4,500 Panda 750L. Boxy, but not
without a certain style, the baby Panda has a delightful engine, reasonable
comfortable and minimalist appeal. It's a far better car than the similar
looking but cheaper Seat Marbella, which draws on older Panda underpinnings
for its power and chassis.
Alongside the Russian Riva, Lada sells the Samara (from Pounds 4,695), a
front-wheel-drive hatchback that is as modern as the Riva is antiquated. The
Samara is a good effort, but not as good as the Skoda Favorit (from Pounds
4,615). While the stand-up comics were having a go, Skoda, helped by new
parent VW, quietly got on with the job in hand. The front-drive Favorit is
smart, roomy and, whisper it, a good car.
With Pounds 6,000 things get better still. The Kia Pride (from Pounds 5,575)
may be warmed-up old technology - it's basically an old-style Mazda 121
built in Korea - but there was precious little wrong with the original. Also
worth a look are Citroen's AX - the facelifted range starts, fittingly, with
the Debut at Pounds 5,760 - and the VW Polo.
Deals should be possible on both the Vauxhall Nova (from Pounds 5,650) and
the Nissan Micra (Pounds 5,995), as both are due for replacement soon; but
unless you are a real masochist, forget the three-wheeler Reliant Rialto
estate, massaged back to life by Del Trotter from television's Only Fools
and Horses.
With a Pounds 7,000 budget, however, one genuinely new car comes into reach.
The best in the sector is the Peugeot 106 (from Pounds 6,140), a
good-looking and fun-to-drive supermini that has external dimensions almost
identical to its big sister, the 205, but is roomier inside.
Rivals include the Fiesta, a faithful Ford that does most things well but
nothing brilliantly; the Fiat Uno, brimful of Italian brio; and the ancient
Renault 5, still on sale despite the arrival of the Clio.
Then there's the born-again Rover Metro. The baby Rover may look much the
same as it always has, but with the award-winning K-series engine, a
five-speed gearbox on most models and new build quality, the Metro is a
strong challenger.
Value for money is the key to the Proton Aeroback (from Pounds 6,799), the
Hyundai X2 (Pounds 6,920) and Sao Penza (Pounds 6,633). Made in Malaysia,
Korea and South Africa respectively, they use second-generation Japanese
technology with their own interpretation of style - the exception being the
Sao, which is a rebadged Mazda 323. Diesel fans can also buy new for under
Pounds 7,000 - at Pounds 6,778, the Seat Ibiza, the Spanish version of the
Fiat Strada, 1.7D is the UK's cheapest diesel.
With Pounds 8,000 to spend, the selection includes: the new Renault Clio
(from Pounds 7,350), a roomy, chic and modern hatchback; from Japan, the
Daihatsu Charade, Suzuki Swift and Subaru Justy; from Italy, the odd Lancia
Y10; and the base hatchbacks in the next size up (cars such as the Peugeot
309 and Rover Maestro). There is also the chance to go off at a tangent with
an off-roader. The Spanish-built Suzuki Samurai is fun, if basic, but forget
the Lada Niva and Rumanian-built Dacia Duster.
And for under Pounds 8,000 you can also buy a slice of history - the Mini
Cooper (Pounds 7,688) is back, now with fuel injection and a catalytic
converter. It may not be as fast as its more modern rivals, but they can't
turn a trip to the shops into the Monte Carlo Rally.
Between Pounds 8,000 and Pounds 10,000 the choice is wide, but is evenly
split between the top specification superminis and 'cooking' versions of
family cars such as the Vauxhall Astra, Ford Escort, Fiat Tipo, Volkswagen
Golf, Peugeot 405, Nissan Sunny, Mitsubishi Colt, Mazda 323, Honda Civic,
Toyota Corolla (a new version is due soon) and VW-based Seat Toledo.
Worth considering, however, are the acclaimed Citroen ZX (from Pounds
8,529), which is smart, comfortable and easy to drive (unlike many Citroens
of the past), and the Hyundai Lantra, a conventional looking saloon that
packs in a remarkable number of goodies considering its Pounds 9,998 price
tag.
It's the same story with the heavily advertised Ford Sierra Azura. At Pounds
9580, it is Pounds 1,000 cheaper than the previous entry level Sierra and is
loaded with special equipment. Why so cheap? Simply that the 1.6-litre
engine is not catalysed and the Sierra itself will be replaced early next
year - it's an end-of-season sale bargain.
But even with Pounds 10,000 to spend, you'll look in vain for CD players,
air conditioning and all the other luxuries found in a typical company car,
unless you consider personally importing one of the new breed of micro cars
from Japan. But that, as they say, is another story.
Free credit? It may be genuinely available, but it, too, is liable to have a
price tag: see page 10

FT  25 JUL 92 / Survey of Second Cars (1): Expectations are rising - Two-car
households are already commonplace in Britain. Furthermore, a growing number
expect to acquire a second - or a third - car by the end of next year,
indicating a willingness to look beyond the recession to more prosperous
times

JUDGING by the statistical evidence, there is a dispiriting task ahead for
environmentalists and traffic planners seeking to persuade motorists out of
their cars and on to public transport.
The upgrading of public transport networks for commuters and city centre
bans on cars to ease congestion and pollution are expected to provide some
partial victories.
But net growth of the car population for the forseeable future seems
inevitable as the result of increasing prosperity (current recession
notwithstanding), the decline of bus and rail services in rural areas, more
women at work and other social factors - not least the advent of the 'school
run' as parents grow increasingly unwilling to allow their children to cycle
or otherwise travel alone.
Already, in the UK, there are just under 400 cars per 1,000 population,
according to statistics from government departments and the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders. Over the past 11 years, the UK's population has
risen by two per cent to reach 57.6m last year, the number of households has
grown by 11 per cent - and the number of cars by 28 per cent, to 22.6m.
As this year's Lex Report on Motoring* found, in a survey conducted with the
MORI polling organisation, the two-car household is already a commonplace.
Thirty-four per cent of the 1,277 households surveyed for the report had two
cars, six per cent had three, and two per cent four or more.
For car makers and dealers, however, it was the attitudes and expectations
of the households surveyed that made the most interesting - and from their
viewpoint, encouraging - reading:
Of households with at least one car, 15 per cent expected to have acquired a
second, third or fourth car by the end of next year. Only 7 per cent
expected to give one up. Intriguingly, the proportion expecting to acquire
an additional car was higher than in the previous year's survey, indicating
a willingness to look beyond the recession towards more prosperous times.
The Lex/MORI research indicated that of the additional 1.6m cars expected to
take to the UK's roads between the beginning of this year and the end of
next - after allowing for scrappage of existing ones - around one-half will
be 'second' cars.
Just over 80 per cent of these are expected to be used vehicles. But that
still leaves some 100,000 purchases of new 'second' cars a year - a valuable
market for the trade and industry, particularly at a time when the overall
new car market remains severely depressed.
Not suprisingly, however, second (or third, or fourth) car sales are
concentrated at the lower end of the price spectrum, reflecting the use of
most of them as runabouts.
The Volkswagen group's own regular new car buyers survey illustrates the
point. Last year, 45.5 per cent of its Polo small hatchback sales were
identified as being not the main car in a household (the small hatchback
average is just under 40 per cent). The percentage slipped to 23.8 per cent
in the case of the Golf, and to just under 4 per cent for larger and more
expensive cars like the Passat and Audi 80.
A much smaller proportion is of more specialised vehicles, such as 'leisure'
four-wheel-drive vehicles bought for their 'image' - many of which will
never stray from the highway - or sports cars, now a rapidly reviving
sector.
The reason usually identified by surveys as the most common one for
acquiring an extra car is of least immediate concern to manufacturers: a
younger member of the family passing his or her driving test. Even among
more affluent families, that usually means the purchase of a used car.
Of those planning to buy new secondary cars, the Lex/MORI report found most
people, 32 per cent, listing increased income making it possible to buy a
car that had long been wanted. Other key reasons included the increased
needs of a growing family (20 per cent), starting a job where a car is
needed (20), moving home to where an additional car is needed more urgently
(20) and even lower car prices (8).
Unlike the 'first' car of more than 3m drivers in the UK - those running
company vehicles - secondary cars are ovewhelmingly a private purchase made
out of individuals' after-tax income.
That, at least, is the evidence provided by the Monks Partnership's annual
survey of UK company car policy**, even though in many larger companies
envy-provoking speculation tends to be commonplace that senior executives
and directors' run spouse's cars 'on the firm' as a matter of course.
The findings of Mr Tony Vernon-Harcourt and his colleagues at Monks are that
such cars remain extremely uncommon even at chief executive and director
level, only three per cent of companies making them available.
With the UK motor industry harbouring growing fears that total new car sales
this year could fail to match even 1991's 1.59m units, nearly one-third down
on the 1989 record of 2.3m, wooing the second car buyer has become a
significant concern for car makers and dealers.
The bad news - for the industry - is that, since government statistics show
four out of ten drivers now to be women, the battle for sales will depend
heavily not on styling, chic or other emotional factors - but on price.
For it is by women that the majority of second cars are driven, and the
industry's market research shows up consistently that three-quarters of them
care little about what car they drive, provided it is relatively small and
gets them from point A to B.
Looking beyond the immediate problems of the recession, however, the
long-term indicators for the growth of the second car market remain
positive.
The hope of the environmental lobby, for example, that increasing congestion
will act as a disincentive to car purchase appears ill-founded, with various
surveys indicating that little more than one in ten drivers would consider
using public transport more. And congested though the UK's roads may appear
to be, the vehicle population per head still has a very long way to go
before it reaches US levels - 602 per 1,000 population - or even German, 492
per 1,000.
Nor does the argument that other countries have many more miles of roads to
drive on. Italy has considerably more cars per head than the UK - 476 per
1,000 - despite a congested 91 cars per kilometre of road compared with only
61 for both the UK and Germany.

FT  25 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Albert Fisher
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The initial 15 per cent jump in Albert Fisher's share price yesterday might
seem a graceless farewell to the man who built the company's value from
almost zero to nearly Pounds 800m in less than a decade. The snag was, of
course, that Mr Tony Millar then presided over the collapse in its value to
some Pounds 230m in the space of 15 months. Plainly, there is scope for new
management to sort out what lies behind the company's recent history of
spectacular accidents.
But it may not work like that. The new chairman Mr Stephen Walls, recently
deposed from Arjo Wiggins Appleton, evidently has larger ambitions than
running a greengrocer. The day-to-day management of the company is to
devolve to the two divisional chiefs of Europe and North America. There is
talk of a strategic review, involving reshaping the company through
acquisition or disposal. There is no talk at all on the more pressing
question of the final dividend. The company is now drifting in a period of
transition. Given that the previous problem for investors was precisely the
lack of clarity on what was going on, that scarcely seems a recommendation
for the shares.

The market must have perceived a certain industrial logic behind Greene
King's abortive bid for Morland, judging by yesterday's 8 per cent fall in
the combined value of the two companies. The fact that the bid still failed
after such an apparently auspicious start must be faintly unnerving for the
Whitbread Investment Company (WIC). Despite the outcome, WIC has divested
itself of a big enough portion of its stake in Morland to comply with the
restrictions on the brewing tie which come into force in November. But it
may now find it rather harder to scale down its 32 per cent stake - worth
around Pounds 65m - in Marston Thompson &amp; Evershed.
After the successive failure of the assaults on Devenish, Invergordon and
now Morland, it is difficult to escape the impression that companies in the
brewing and drinks sector seem immune from takeover. It may be that large
blocks of their shares are closely held by loyal institutions. In the case
of Morland, it may also be that WIC was seen as a forced seller and
therefore that the bid price was inevitably pitched too low. Whatever the
reason, a climate has been created in which WIC seems unlikely to find a
plausible predator for Marston who will take its holding off its hands.
An alternative approach will almost certainly be needed. The Marston stake
is the largest holding that remains to be tackled before the November
deadline. It does not lend itself to the technical resolution found for
Brakspear, whereby part of the holding was re-allocated between WIC and
Whitbread and part sold back to Brakspear itself. On the other hand,
conditions do not seem all that propitious for an offering in the market.

FT  25 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Japan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tokyo investors had steeled themselves for disappointment over yesterday
evening's high-level government meeting on how to halt the slide in the
equity market. Hence the 3.4 per cent drop in the Nikkei to a new six-year
low before the outcome was even known. The meeting convened by the Prime
Minister, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, may have been an empty political gesture of
concern ahead of tomorrow's upper house elections. Or the authorities may be
genuinely concerned but still unable to reach the required Japanese
consensus on the appropriate course of action.
Either way round, the likelihood of further falls has increased as a result
of the meeting's lack of result. The poor outlook for corporate profits and
the low yield on Japanese equities provide little natural incentive for
share purchases. It looks increasingly as if some form of official action
will be needed to lift the all-pervasive gloom, but such action will have to
be pretty determined if investors are to be persuaded about the appeal of
equities.
Another government spending programme would not suffice. If and when the
authorities do decide to act, they may have to consider some direct help for
the struggling financial sector. At the very least, there would have to be a
further cut in short term interest rates, a point on which the Bank of Japan
still evidently needs some persuading.

FT  25 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: The yield conundrum
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK equity market has had a lot to cope with this week: the upward creep
in European interest rates, the further collapse of the Tokyo market and the
unnerving hints of renewed hostilities between the US and Iraq. Perhaps the
most significant development, however, was purely domestic. The ratio
between gilt and equity yields - the traditional measure of equity value -
fell to its lowest level since the great bear market of 1974.
The comparison has its ironic aspects. In 1974, equity yields soared because
corporate earnings were being mauled by inflation. They are now being mauled
by the lack of it. In the recent past, a yield ratio as low as two - meaning
that equity yields were half the level of long gilt yields - was a fair
signal that equities were cheap. The ratio is now 1.73. But it is not clear
that the old relationship holds good any more.
The reason is straightforward. The rationale of ERM membership is that
inflation should fall to German levels. Part of the process of achieving
this involves punishing companies which allow their costs to rise. Gilts are
thus worth more than before, because they need no longer offer an
inflationary risk premium. Equities, at least in the punitive transitional
phase, are worth less because of the damage to their earnings.
The classic danger here is of mistaking a mere cyclical phenomenon for a
fundamental shift. In 1974, there was much talk about the cult of the equity
being dead. In the first six months of 1975, the All-Share duly rose 130 per
cent. But the determining factor this time may lie at a deeper level. The
other commonplace assertion at the bottom of a recession is that inflation
has finally been licked. If that really is true this time, the valuation
shift may be fundamental. The issue can be simply posed. If the UK sticks to
its ERM parity, equities may or may not be expensive. If the UK were to
leave the ERM, they would be a raging buy.

FT  25 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets: Warsaw retraces Q2 losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLISH equities have retraced most of the losses incurred in the second
quarter and some analysts believe that the outlook for Europe's fledgling
stock exchange has improved.
After a generally stable first quarter, the Warsaw WIG indicator dropped
around 25 per cent from April to June on selling by individuals,
disillusioned by a decision by Wedel, the food company controlled by
Pepsico, to omit the 1991 dividend.
Political uncertainty, high interest rates and a big flotation of Treasury
bonds at the start of June also weighed on the index.
Mr Wieslaw Rozlucki, the president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, told fund
managers in London yesterday that the recovery in the index since the end of
June had been triggered by the formation of a new government and the
National Bank of Poland's decision to reduce interest rates.
The appointment this week of Citibank as a custodian of the stock exchange's
central depository system has solved a fiduciary problem for international
institutions and should lead to more foreign participation in a
domestically-driven market, Mr Rozlucki said.
Another positive factor is the expected launch next week of the Boston-based
Pioneer Group's open-ended mutual fund in Polish securities which aims to
attract Dollars 50m in its first year.
Mr Reginald Duquesnoy of Cresvale Securities, the hosts of the seminar,
believes that the Polish stock market capitalisation will grow from Dollars
148m to at least Dollars 500m in the next year.
The market's average price/earnings ratio has fallen to 2.3 from around 3
late last year.

FT  25 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls 6.3% in a
difficult week

THE Nikkei average fell to a new low for the year as investors sold ahead of
the government's emergency meeting to discuss support measures for the
market, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index fell 542.15 to 15,497.79, down 6.3 per cent on the week,
on arbitrage unwinding and index-linked selling. The index opened at the
day's high of 16,014.55 and fell to the day's low of 15,490.57 by
mid-morning.
Volume fell from 237m shares to 200m. Declines led advances by 737 to 219,
with 152 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section
stocks retreated 23.27 to 1,204.55 and in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
fell 6.68 to 933.49.
Speculation that the government will decide on a Y6,000bn supplementary
budget to boost the economy disappointed market participants, as this had
already been suggested by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Share prices
fell as discouraged dealers and investment trusts sold out.
Market participants remained sceptical about the success of the emergency
measures in supporting the market. 'The possibility of the government's plan
attracting new buyers into the market is very low,' said Mr Kaoru Shimura,
head of pension fund management at Sumitomo Life.
However, Mr Yasuo Ueki, head of equity trading at Nikko Securities, said
that yesterday's decline indicated that the disappointment had now been
discounted. 'An unexpected proposal will be a positive factor, while there
will be no negative effects on the markets even if the proposals are not
new,' he said.
Persistent worries about the troubled real estate business depressed banks,
realtors and contractors. Mitsubishi Bank lost Y50 to Y1,610 and Sumitomo
Bank fell Y60 to Y1,260.
Nippon Housing Loan, the troubled housing loan company, fell for the seventh
consecutive day, losing Y13 to a record low of Y172. Mitsui Fudosan, the
leading real estate company, fell Y25 to Y720, while Daikyo, the condominium
developer, declined Y60 to Y621.
Electricals were weak on fears of downward revisions. Investors now reckon
that since the economy is unlikely to rebound, originally expected this
autumn, earnings forecasts at the electronics companies are too bullish.
Hitachi lost Y5 to Y745 and Sony fell Y140 to Y3,850.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 250.91 to 17,940.03 in volume of 24m shares.
Roundup
PACIFIC Rim markets were mixed. Brokers in Bombay boycotted trading on fears
that more brokers' assets might be seized by the government.
HONG KONG fell in afternoon trade, the Hang Seng index slidding 144.40 or
2.44 per cent to 5,772.76 in turnover of HKDollars 3.35bn. The index has
lost 5.7 per cent on the week.
Banks lost ground with HSBC Holdings down HKDollars 2 at HKDollars 54.
SEOUL gained ground in low turnover. The composite index put on 3.46 to
521.99 for a week's rise of 1.5 per cent. Turnover fell to Won153.65bn from
Won170.52bn. Gainers outpaced losers 435 to 250 with 157 unchanged.
TAIWAN finished higher in spite of a weak opening. The weighted index closed
up 43.29 at 4,022.16 but was down 6 per cent on the week. Turnover fell to
TDollars 26bn from TDollars 30.35bn.
MANILA slipped as profits were taken in oil stocks. The composite index shed
7.37 to 1,463.39 but was 1 per cent higher over the week.
Gainers outnumbered losers 21 to 14 in combined turnover of 252m pesos.
SINGAPORE fell sharply with the Straits Times index down 23.34 to 1,401.31,
a fall of 3.4 per cent on the week. Shipyard stocks continued to be weak
with Jurong Shipyard down 45 cents at SDollars 8.05.
KUALA LUMPUR's composite index shed 8.71 to 593.53, a 2 per cent drop on the
week.

FT  25 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets: Brussels stages some summer attractions
 -Why investors in Belgian stocks should not go on holiday just yet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Belgian government is about to thrash out the 1993 budget, a court
ruling on minority shareholders' rights is expected shortly, and powerful
institutions are vying for control of one of the country's biggest banks.
It is probably unwise, therefore, for investors in Belgian equities to pack
up for their summer holidays just yet.
A drop of 6.7 per cent in the Brussels Bel-20 index to 1,134.06 this week
reflected the fall on global markets, the index having come off its 1992
peak of 1,235.40 reached on June 2 on fears of higher interest rates. This
was accompanied by an improvement in volume, whereas it was depressed
elsewhere in Europe.
Although Belgium is suffering from the same interest rate malaise as the
rest of Europe, analysts believe that the bourse could outperform its
continental counterparts in the coming months. Dillon Read's half-year
analysis cites 'Belgium's de facto integration into the economies of the
D-mark bloc and the country's rock solid commitment to the EC' as factors
underpinning the Belgian franc and, the bond and stock markets.
Tugging against this tentative optimism is the prospect of another season of
gloomy results from Belgium's cyclical industrial companies. Most interim
results are due at the end of August and in early September, but investors
will benefit from some pre-season training next Thursday, when Solvay,
Belgium's largest chemicals company, releases its figures.
Caution ahead of the results season is understandable. The market's bouts of
enthusiasm for cyclical stocks over the last 18 months - often fuelled by
over-optimistic company statements - have mostly been disappointed.
'We're looking at a very gradual economic recovery,' says Mr Guy Lerminiaux,
an analyst with Dewaay. 'Industrial companies have profited from
restructuring, and they've all cut back on expenditure. But the feeling is
that after some optimism in the first quarter we could now see some
underperformance in cyclical stocks.'
Analysts are therefore focusing on defensive stocks, such as banks and
retailers.
The retail sector - namely Gib, Delhaize and Colruyt - was the market's
success story in the first quarter. Gib has sustained the rally, taking
further steps towards realising the value of its Quick hamburger restaurant
chain, and continuing to improve its domestic retailing operation. By
contrast, enthusiasm for Delhaize has waned in recent months, as the weak
dollar and difficult trading conditions have taken their toll on the group's
extensive US operations.
Over the next few weeks, however, investors will be more interested in
developments in the following three areas which could have a longer-lasting
influence on the stock market: The 1993 budget. Last April the new
government stitched together a stringent 'emergency' budget for 1992. The
austerity package drew criticism at home, but although his government is
under some political pressure, Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the prime minister, is
expected to take an equally hard line on cutting expenditure for 1993. The
Wagons-Lits court ruling. The Brussels court is expected to decide early
next month whether Accor, the French hotels group, and Societe Generale de
Belgique, the holding company, gained effective control of the
Franco-Belgian tourism group when they bought a stake in the summer of 1990.
The two companies have since mounted a successful bid for Wagons-Lits at a
lower price.
If the court rules that control did change hands, then the companies will
probably have to buy out disgruntled minority shareholders at the original,
higher price. Some of the evidence in the hearing was so convoluted that it
seems unlikely the decision will be that simple. Nonetheless, brokers are
hoping the ruling will inject much-needed legal certainty into the
vaguely-worded Belgian takeover rules.
The wooing of Banque Bruxelles Lambert (BBL). Internationale Nederlanden
(ING), the Dutch banking and insurance group, wants a commercial partnership
with the Belgian bank and has built a 10 per cent stake in the group.
The outcome hinges on the attitude of Groupe Bruxelles Lambert (GBL), which
controls nearly 25 per cent of BBL and also heads a long-standing syndicate
of BBL's main shareholders. Mr Albert Frere, the head of GBL, is said to
favour a partnership with a domestic bank, but some analysts believe he is
holding out for a higher price. He appears to want BFr4,000 a share but
analysts reckon the bank is worth BFr3,000 a share. The market is hedging
its bets: BBL is trading at around BFr3,500.
A solution may not emerge until the end of the year when GBL's right to
first refusal of other syndicate members' stakes in BBL is due to expire.
However, vacationing shareholders should still keep one eye on the bourse
since Mr Frere's holiday plans are unknown.

FT  25 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses fail to rebuild
confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES failed to regain any confidence at the end of a troubled week,
writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT took comfort from lower July inflation figures before being led
down by the futures and options market.
The DAX, which briefly advanced to 1,625, closed down 12.95 at 1,610.42, the
lowest level since January and down 5.4 per cent on the week. At midsession
the FAZ was 8.82 lower at 639.94 while turnover fell to DM4.9bn from
DM6.1bn.
BASF fell to DM211 before to closing down DM3.8 at DM216.9, following an
analysts meeting at which the company gave a disappointing forecast for 1992
earnings. Other chemical stocks were also weaker with Hoechst losing DM3.9
to DM225.5. Elsewhere, Daimler shed DM5 to DM698 and Deutsche Bank lost DM7
to DM642.50.
PARIS endured another volatile day before closing practically unchanged at
the end of the July trading account. The CAC-40 index ended 0.06 higher at
1,734.62 in turnover of just under FFr2.4bn.
The insurer Axa rose FFr28 or 3.7 per cent to FFr782 after saying that the
provisions that its US subsidiary Equitable Life Assurance Society had made
against its investment portfolio were adequate.
Dealers detected some switching out of Total, down FFr2.70 to FFr227.60,
into Elf, up FFr6.70 to FFr338.80. BSN eased fell FFr2 to FFr1,043 as first
half sales came in line with expectations. Among smaller stocks, Hachette
gained FFr6.8 or 6.5 per cent to FFr111.8 in light volume.
MILAN closed lower as a half-hearted attempt to stage a recovery was
overwhelmed by continued selling pressure. The Comit index fell 1.71 to
406.36, down 7.2 per cent on the week, in turnover estimated at near
Thursday's L99.2bn.
Fiat closed L25 higher at L4,555 but news that the managing director of Fiat
Ferroviaria Savigliano, its rolling stock subsidiary, had been arrested in
connection with the Milan bribery scandal later knocked L100 off the share.
Ifi, the Agnelli family's holding company, rose L270 to L9,930 in response
to Thursday's earnings report, but then fell back to L9,650.
AMSTERDAM awaited news of talks between the Dutch government and Dasa on the
German group's purchase of a majority stake in Fokker. After the close the
government announced that the takeover would go ahead. Fokker ended down 90
cents at Fl 28.60. The CBS Tendency index was off 0.9 at 115.3, for a 3.1
per cent fall on the week.
One of the day's biggest losers was retailer KBB which declined Fl 6.80, or
8.9 per cent to Fl 64.20 after forecasting weaker first half earnings.
VIENNA continued its downward trend with the 18-share ATX index falling 23.3
to 771.06, down 9 per cent on the week.
Wienerberger remained active after Thursday's disappointing first half
results. Its shares fell Sch330 to Sch3,770 in high volume. OMV, the oil
group, which said that the state wanted to sell off part of its 70 per cent
stake, lost Sch16 to Sch657.
ZURICH eased in line with other markets. The SMI index fell 6 to 1,756.8 for
a loss of 2.7 per cent on the week.
In Scandinavia, STOCKHOLM closed at a year's low for second day in the last
four, the Affarsvarlden general index falling 4.7 to 834.7, down 4.9 per
cent on on the week. HELSINKI fell further in thin trading, as the HEX index
dropped 9.4 to 696.7, down 4.2 per cent on the week. OSLO was kept from
falling further as selling pressure eased. The all-share index rose 1.54 to
378.04.
MADRID's general index closed down 0.79 at 213.24 for a fall of 4.2 per cent
on the week.

FT  25 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Gulf worries depress share prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONCERN over mounting tensions in the Middle East dealt a further blow to
fragile confidence on the London stock market yesterday. Share prices
reacted more severely in the UK than in other European bourses to reports at
mid-session that US warships in the Gulf had been placed on alert after the
UN inspection team had left Iraq. The FT-SE Index rallied before the close
but the day's fall of 22.3 made a total loss over the two week equity
trading account of 4.6 per cent.
The session opened nervously as the 542.15 fall in the Nikkei Average turned
attention back towards the problems of the Japanese markets. But UK equities
suffered only minor losses until lunchtime, when a combination of a sell
programme from a leading UK house and the unsettling news from the Gulf sent
the market into a nosedive.
With the September stock index future contract leading the way, the market
fell 37.8 to 2,361.7 at the day's low, breaking through the 2,376 support
line. A slow rally set in later and the final reading put the FT-SE Index at
2,377.2.
Government bonds traded quietly, closing just below the best with gains of
nearly  1/4 at the long end of the range as traders continued to assess the
implications of the government's plans for restraining public spending in
the future.
In the equity market, poor trading volume remained the principal feature.
The day's Seaq total of 495m shares compared with 512.9m on Thursday when
the retail or customer component was worth only Pounds 976m, still on the
low side for a profitable market.
The institutions, which provide the bulk of the customer business in
equities, have kept out of the market this week. However, Sharelink,
Europe's largest execution only stockbroker, which deals extensively for
private investors, said that 60 per cent of these clients had traded on the
buy side last week.
Traders sounded disappointed by the lack of interest in trading for the new
trading account which opened last night, and a further check to confidence
came when the finance director of Amstrad, the computer manufacturing group,
resigned. But fund managers were pre-occupied yesterday with the close of
the Wellcome share flotation.
Investment sentiment remained clouded in London, with the developments in
Iraq providing further cause for concern in a market unsettled by economic
uncertainties.
Retail, or customer, business in equities has remained below last year's
daily average levels as recession worries depress confidence.

FT  25 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INCREASED tension in the Middle East and continued nervousness in the London
market as the trading account drew to a close, provided the background for a
retreat in stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo.
Having opened at 2,415, the September contract on the FT-SE Index saw early
selling with dealers focusing on the heavy fall in the Tokyo market
overnight. A spate of bear closing inspired a brief recovery before the
worries over the Middle East brought out sellers again. The contract had
fallen to 2,368 by lunchtime, and had pulled the cash market lower.
Then, a firm opening on Wall Street and belief that earlier falls had been
overdone helped the contract rally. September ended at 2,384, down 38 on
Thursday's close and around 10 points below its estimated fair value premium
to cash of about 18. Turnover reached 8,908 lots.
Traded options remained dull. Turnover of 20,894 contracts was well below
the 30,000 break even level. Some 8,303 contracts were dealt in the FT-SE
100 option. BTR was the most active option with total of 1,639 lots
transacted.

FT  25 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome success claimed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, COLIN MILLHAM, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS book-building for the Wellcome share offer closed last night, lead
managers for the global tender process were confident of success.
Nevertheless, the shares slipped dangerously closer to the 800p minimum set
for the issue price by managers Robert Fleming. The shares closed 4 lower at
826p with a hefty 1.6m traded.
Wellcome Trust, the governing charity which holds 73.5 per cent of the
pharmaceutical company's equity, has planned to release 330m shares, or 38.5
per cent. To create a healthy interest in the aftermarket, and prevent the
share price slipping after the sale has been completed, initial orders for
some 380m to 400m shares are considered necessary.
As trading finished, Fleming indicated that it had received orders for
around 350m shares with yesterday's interest from the US still awaited. Mr
Ian Hannam, who is heading the global co-ordination for Fleming said; 'We
have to wait for final indications but, as at 4.30pm, the target amount has
been exceeded. Considering the state of the market it has been a phenomenal
achievement.'
Sceptics maintained their doubts over the full flotation of the 330m shares
and some small selling in London on behalf of a US client who wanted to buy
American Depositary Receipts knocked the market price. However, early
positive comment by the head of investment at Legal &amp; General helped
sentiment, and it appeared that UK institutions were finally showing their
hands.
Amstrad surprise
News of another resignation from the board of Amstrad came just a few
minutes ahead of the official close, giving traders little time to react.
Dealers said they expect the shares to open sharply lower on Monday,
possibly around 23p to 24p, after the market has had time to assess the
latest developments. 'Amstrad is seen as an unmitigated disaster,' said one
electronics specialist who added that no more news would be forthcoming from
the company ahead of its results in October.
What little activity took place after the news was on a small scale and left
the shares  1/2 off at 28 1/2 p. Turnover reached 3.2m shares, with traders
talking of some large deals booked after the close.
Analysts were dismayed at the resignation of Mr Peter Thoms, group financial
director. The news came only a day after Amstrad revealed that its losses
for the year end-June will be around Pounds 25m more than previously
expected, or in the region of Pounds 65m.
Earlier this week it was revealed that corporate finance director, Mr Ken
Ashcroft, was leaving to head up Betcom, Amstrad's 71 per cent owned
telephone manufacturing subsidiary.
Shell downgraded
Shell suffered heavy selling after UK analysts dissected second-quarter
results from US oil giant Exxon, focusing on the poor performance of non-US
refining and marketing earnings, which fell by around two thirds compared
with the first quarter.
County NatWest lowered its forecast for Shell's second quarter current cost
net income from Pounds 520m to Pounds 470m compared with the Pounds 952m it
recorded in the first quarter.
Shell closed 9 weaker at 458p, having touched 454p earlier in the session.
There were also stories that one of the big Japanese broking houses had been
recommending a switch out of Shell and into British Gas.
ICI easier
Anyone who had spent just over a year on a desert island and was ignorant of
Hanson's Pounds 240m investment in ICI would have been none the wiser
yesterday. On the morning of Smith New Court's initial market raid in May
1991, for Hanson, the stock stood at 1100p. This stake was sold in May this
year for a reputed 1400p a share. Yesterday, the shares dipped below 1100p
for the first time since just before the deal, losing 18 to 1098p.
Smiths' chemical team, which has had its teeth into ICI for many months,
refuses to let go. The house has steadily reduced its 1992 forecast from
around Pounds 1.1bn to Pounds 750m and believes the interims next Thursday
will produce only Pounds 430m. The house recently suggested the shares would
be worth picking up at the current price but, because of the poor state of
the London market, it is now believed to be content for them to drift off
another 50p.
A Kleinwort Benson sell note hit General Accident, down 5 1/2 at 363p, while
worries about Guardian Royal Exchange's life assurance book saw the shares,
badly hit at one point on Thursday, dip 7 to 114p on heavy turnover of 6.8m.
Lasmo closed a busy week on a thoroughly depressed note. A series of selling
raids, only partly arrested by highly encouraging exploration reports, kept
the shares on the retreat all week; yesterday they fell again, closing a
further 8 lower at 117p, after a low of 113 1/2 p.
The shares have slumped amid worries that the group may pass its interim
dividend, when the figures are revealed next Wednesday. They were also
damaged by fears that the company may be dropped from the prestigious
Footsie list of top shares.
Yesterday Kleinwort Benson, the influential London broking firm, lowered its
net asset value for Lasmo to 207p. Other London analysts are thought to have
chopped their asset values in recent days, with some said be much lower than
the Kleinwort figure.
BP held at 206p against a very weak equity market, with the shares propped
up by some determined buying interest, said to have originated in the US.
Big overseas buying, especially from Switzerland and the US has been a
feature of trading in BP in recent sessions.
Greene King lost 30 to 467p, as its bid for Morland (down 41 at 420p),
failed, resulting in acceptances of only 45.95 per cent.
Bass slipped 17 to 522p on good turnover of 2.1m, following a report that
broker Cazenove had cut forecasts.
Food services and distribution group Albert Fisher closed unchanged at 39p,
but turnover was a hefty 4.4m in reaction to news that Mr Tony Millar, the
executive chairman, had resigned. The company said overall trading remains
in line with expectations.
Northern Foods fell 9 to 580p after the chairman told the annual meeting
that the group had seen no improvement.
Mirror Group continued to attract support, adding 3 at 72p on heavy turnover
of 11m. However, suggestions that a stakeholder would be revealed shortly
after the close of trading proved unfounded.
Middle East worries prompted a decline in some transport stocks. British
Airways fell 10 to 248p, while BAA eased 12 to 630p. Inchcape fell 19 to
392p. after Hoare Govett cut forecasts.
News of an order worth about Pounds 500m from Canada for 50 EH101 advanced
technology helicopters boosted Westland by 4 to 108p. British Aerospace
continued in the doldrums, the shares losing another 7 to 192p. The clutch
of downgrades in Lucas Industries continued to dog the shares which shed 3
to 99p, though traders reported buying at the lower levels. Turnover reached
4.2m

FT  25 JUL 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar again testing DM1.50
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR rose over a pfennig against the D-Mark yesterday, buoyed by
stronger than expected US durable goods figures and signs that German
inflation is falling, writes James Blitz.
The US currency was boosted by data showing that new durable goods orders
had risen 2.3 per cent in June after a revised fall of 2.2 per cent in May.
Some analysts said that this underscored suggestions that the economy was no
longer in danger of a double dip recession, while others remain sceptical
about whether this alters the depressing outlook for the US economy at all.
However, the bulls clearly had the better of the argument yesterday as the
dollar closed over 1 1/2 pfennigs higher at DM1.4995.
The dollar is looking much more comfortable this weekend than it was five
days ago. Monday's central bank intervention was highly successful, turning
the market around at a moment when many dealers were short of the US
currency. There are also signs that German inflation data for July, due out
next week, will be lower than expected. Several German states reported low
inflation figures yesterday and the market believes that the July number
will be down 1 per cent to an annualised rate of 3.3 per cent.
Nobody is too hopeful that these factors will scotch another Lombard rate
rise. Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, said yesterday that there
was a possibility that the Bundesbank would 'relax policy in the foreseeable
future,' but the remark was later withdrawn by German Finance Ministry
officials who doubtless found it a little exuberant. However, Mr Paul
Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS Phillips and Drew, was
reasonably optimistic about the upside for dollar/D-Mark. He said that while
the US currency may dip in the immediate short term, it could soon test
DM1.55 on the upside.
That will also alleviate tensions in the European Monetary system.
Yesterday's dollar rise weakened the D-Mark on the crosses, and sterling had
its strongest day of the week, closing up 1 1/4 pfennigs at 2.8500. But
dealers say that the pound is still intrinsically weak and very much at the
mercy of dollar trading. If the US currency falls back to DM1.47 or DM1.46
in the short term, this will put pressure on sterling. The Italian lira
would also suffer. Like sterling, it closed stronger against the D-mark
yesterday at L757.70 compared to a previous close of L758.6
The dollar defied apparent intervention from the Bank of Japan to move
higher against the yen after another sharp drop on the Nikkei stock market
and more talk of a Japanese interest rate cut. The dollar rose to Y127.65
from a previous close of Y126.60.

FT  25 JUL 92 / International Company News: Royal Trust quarterly dividend
cut to 10 cents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL Trust, the financial services group controlled by Toronto's Bronfman
family, has cut its quarterly dividend and is putting up for sale the US
banking subsidiary which it acquired less than three years ago.
The measures are a response to the unexpectedly severe slump in North
American and UK property markets which has sharply increased the losses
which Royal Trust is likely to suffer on its loan portfolio.
Companies in the Bronfman empire are closely linked through investments in
each other's common and preferred shares. Problems at Royal Trust and at
Bramalea, a property developer, have recently eroded investor confidence in
the group.
The company said that RT's dividend cut, from 18.5 cents to 10 cents a
share, would not be material to the group's most senior companies, such as
Brascan, Hees International and Edper. Brascan has a 23 per cent indirect
interest in RT.
RT's share price fell 25 cents in early trading on the Toronto stock
exchange yesterday to CDollars 5.75. The shares reached a peak of almost
CDollars 36 in 1986. Shares of other Bronfman-controlled companies were
little changed.
RT suffered a second-quarter loss of CDollars 8m or 14 cents a share,
compared to a CDollars 43m profit or 17 cents a share a year earlier. Loan
loss provisions jumped to CDollars 70m (USDollars 58.3m) from CDollars 27m.
The weakness of the UK property market led London-based Royal Trust Bank to
set aside CDollars 27m in loan-loss provisions. The British operation
suffered a CDollars 34m loss.
Non-performing loans in RT's Canadian corporate and commercial loan
portfolio have jumped from 1.2 per cent to 5.1 per cent in the past year.
The company disclosed that 43 per cent of 'discontinued' loans in the US,
totalling CDollars 583m, were non-performing.
RT's decision to sell its US subsidiary, Pacific First Bank of Seattle,
marks a further humiliating retreat from efforts during the 1980s to expand
outside Canada. The company has either sold or closed most of the assets
acquired with the purchase in 1986 of Dow Financial Services, the
international banking arm of Dow Chemical.
Pacific First has 136 branches, most of which were part of former savings
and loan institutions.

FT  25 JUL 92 / International Company News: Coup puts bank on top down under
 -NAB's acquisitive streak may not have been satisfied by its takeover of
the troubled Bank of New Zealand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Don Argus, managing director of National Australia Bank (NAB), is doing
his best not to look smug this week after pulling off a coup which makes NAB
the biggest bank in Australia and New Zealand.
Mr Argus has good reason to be pleased.
NAB was roundly criticised during the 1980s for failing to take part in the
scramble for domestic asset growth which accompanied the disastrous
antipodean entrepreneurial boom.
Instead, Mr Argus and his Melbourne-based colleagues concentrated on
reducing costs and expanding overseas, principally through careful
acquisitions in the UK and Ireland.
NAB's latest overseas move, the NZDollars 1.48bn (USDollars 800m) purchase
of the troubled Bank of New Zealand (BNZ), announced on Tuesday, has been
widely hailed as a deal which offers multiple benefits to all parties.
New Zealand's conservative government has disposed of an embarrassing
liability inherited from the previous Labour government, which was forced to
rescue the BNZ in 1988 after it faced collapse under a mountain of
entrepreneurial debt.
Fay, Richwhite, the New Zealand merchant bank which oiled the wheels of the
rescue by taking a 27 per cent stake in BNZ, will emerge from what looked
like an embarrassing mistake by breaking even on the deal. But the real
winner is NAB, which becomes the largest player in an important regional
market at a cost of some NZDollars 200m less than it was prepared to pay
five years ago, when it emerged that a rescue of some kind was inevitable.
Characteristically, the ultra-cautious NAB management has insisted on an
eight-week delay in completion of the deal while it conducts a detailed
examination of the BNZ books.
The purpose of the delay is to ensure that there are no unexpected holes in
the accounts, particularly in the area of non-performing loans and the
valuation of the property portfolio.
However, the accounting checks are unlikely to turn up much that has escaped
NAB's accountants in the five years since the bank began stalking BNZ.
In addition, the deal limits NAB's exposure to potential taxation,
litigation and property revaluation losses to 15.7 per cent of any liability
beyond BNZ's existing provisions.
The real significance of the deal is that it confirms NAB's position as the
biggest and best of Australia's four leading banks, in terms of both assets
and management quality.
The addition of BNZ's assets of NZDollars 19.8bn (ADollars 14.5bn) will
increase NAB's global assets to ADollars 109.6bn (USDollars 81.7bn), putting
it ahead of Westpac Banking Corporation with ADollars 107.5bn and Australia
and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) with ADollars 99.2bn. Commonwealth Bank,
the government-controlled bank which was part-privatised last year, has
assets of just under ADollars 90bn.
Moreover, NAB has weathered recession and the shake-out from the 1980s
better than its rivals, mainly because of tighter control of costs and
margins, and its pursuit of the home loans market rather than riskier
commercial lending.
As a result, NAB has been able to get on top of its bad debt problems more
quickly than its competitors, enabling it to eliminate losses in domestic
commercial and finance lending.
NAB recently reported net profits of ADollars 405.6m for the six months to
March, which compared with ADollars 135.5m at ANZ and a loss of ADollars
1.67bn at Westpac, after bad debt write-offs of ADollars 2.65bn.
NAB has been helped by the contribution to earnings from its subsidiaries in
the UK and Ireland - Clydesdale Bank, Yorkshire Bank, Northern Bank and
National Irish Bank - all of which were acquired in the last five years.
The contribution has declined in line with recession in the UK and Ireland
from 45 per cent of net profits in the first half of 1990-91 to 31 per cent
in the first half of the current year. However, analysts say the decline in
European earnings should be reversed when the economy recovers.
Overseas earnings are likely to be be lifted by efficiency gains as NAB
brings the expenses of its European subsidiaries into line with the lower
levels achieved in Australia.
The acquisition of BNZ increases NAB's overseas assets from 43 per cent of
total assets to 51 per cent, giving it a significantly larger overseas
investment than either ANZ, at 34 per cent, or Westpac, at 36 per cent.
NAB confirmed after the announcement of the BNZ deal that it remains
interested in further overseas acquisitions, particularly in the US or the
south of the UK, where it is unrepresented.
The bank's capital adequacy ratio will fall from 11.7 per cent to 10.1 per
cent following the BNZ acquisition, but remains well above the 8 per cent
level required by the Reserve Bank of Australia.
This would allow Mr Argus to make one or more small acquisitions without
returning to the markets for fresh capital. But analysts suggest NAB may
have something more exciting in mind in the medium term.
The most unexpected development of the last few years has been the
relegation of Westpac, once Australia's undisputed leading bank, to the
bottom of the Australasian banking league.
The decline, mainly caused by Westpac's rapid accumulation of poor quality
assets in the 1980s, has caused the group's market capitalisation to fall
from more than ADollars 7bn to just over ADollars 4bn.
By contrast, NAB's strong performance has lifted its market valuation to
more than ADollars 9bn, making it Australia's second largest company after
Broken Hill Propriety (BHP).
NAB is known to have considered bidding for both Westpac and ANZ, valued at
just over ADollars 4m, but has been prevented by the ruling Labor
government's policy of preventing mergers between Australia's six leading
financial institutions.
That policy will disappear if, as seems increasingly likely, the opposition
conservatives win the next federal election, due by mid-1993.
If that happens, NAB may need to raise fresh capital, but there seems little
to prevent a bid for one of its rivals. That would nearly double its asset
base and create an Australian banking group of global importance.

FT  25 JUL 92 / International Company News: Chicago insurer to pay Dollars
475m for Frank B. Hall
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AON Corporation, the acquisitive Chicago-based insurance group, yesterday
emerged as the buyer of Frank B. Hall, the troubled insurance broking
subsidiary of Mr Saul Steinberg's Reliance Group.
Hall, which ranks as seventh biggest broker in the world with revenues of
Dollars 462m in 1991, takes in Leslie &amp; Godwin, the leading Lloyd's broker.
Aon will pay Dollars 475m for most of Hall's assets, with the consideration
comprising Dollars 125m in cash, Dollars 225m in 8 per cent cumulative
preferred stock and Dollars 125m in 6.25 per cent cumulative convertible
exchangeable preferred stock. The deal makes Aon, which owns the Rollins
Burdick Hunter insurance broking operations, the third-largest US brokerage.
It is the latest in a series of realignments in the highly-competitive
insurance broking industry. Rollins Burdick Hunter has been expanding
operations in Europe, where it acquired the Dutch broker, Hudig Langeveldt,
last year.
Aon's presence in the London insurance market, where the group owns a 40 per
cent stake in Nicholson Chamberlain Colls, is increased.
Leslie &amp; Godwin, has, like NCC, been a strong player in the aviation
insurance market and has a significant retail network in the UK.
Hall, which has made losses in the four of the last five years, has had a
troubled history. It was embroiled in a series of lawsuits during the 1980s
centred mainly on discontinued or formerly-owned direct underwriting
subsidiaries, including Union Indemnity which was eventually declared
insolvent.
Under yesterday's deal, Aon will take on only some of Hall's liabilities.
Those related to Union Indemnity, and any 'errors and omissions' claims
against Hall will be excluded. The buyer will not assume Hall's Dollars 75m
of bank debt nor indebtedness to Reliance.
Reliance will provide Dollars 18m a year of reinsurance brokerage
commissions to Aon, for 15 years.
Reliance, a New York-based financial services group controlled by Mr
Steinberg, owns about 70 per cent of Hall. It said that it expected to show
a gain of about Dollars 50m after tax when the sale is completed.
The remaining shares in Hall are quoted, and once the asset sale is
completed, what remains of Hall will be merged into another Reliance
subsidiary and Hall shareholders will receive 0.625 shares in Reliance for
each Hall share owned.

<TEXT>
ISTITUTO Finanziario Industriale (IFI), the financial holding company of
Italy's Agnelli family, lifted net profits to L218.4bn (Dollars 190.24m) in
the 12 months to March 31 from L206.6bn a year earlier.
Consolidated net earnings - reported for the first time - amounted to
L285bn, while shareholders' funds came to L3,954bn.
A large part of IFI's earnings stemmed from extraordinary gains, amounting
to L71.5bn, on the continuing reduction in its holding in the Fabbri
publishing group, which is being sold to Rizzoli-Corriere della Sera.
Dividend receipts from companies in which IFI has a stake, notably Fiat,
rose to L174bn from L170.9bn. IFI is paying an unchanged dividend of L315
per ordinary share and L365 for savings stock. The entire ordinary share
capital is held by the Agnelli family.
Sprind and Finanza &amp; Futuro, the two Italian investment funds controlled by
Mr Carlo De Benedetti's Cofide group, are to merge. The deal will create the
country's third-biggest fund management group. The joint concern will have
about L4,500bn under management, giving it a combined share of about 7.5 per
cent of the Italian fund management market.
Mr Antonio Corti, managing director of Finanza &amp; Futuro, said the merger was
designed to allow the two companies to meet the Bank of Italy's recently
announced new capital adequacy rules for investment funds without the need
to pump in extra cash.
Under the central bank's new requirement, Italian fund management groups
will have to have shareholders' funds equivalent to at least 0.5 per cent of
their total funds under management, up to ceiling of L20bn. One of the
Cofide companies meets the new level, the other does not. The combined
operation will have a capital base of over L20bn.

LEIF HOEGH, one of Norway's top three bourse-listed shipowners, disclosed a
near 50 per cent fall in first-half net profits to NKr120m (Dollars 20.6m)
from NKr224m a year earlier.
This followed a plunge to second-quarter net losses of NKr15m from profits
of NKr128m in the same period last year.
The deterioration was mainly due to difficult market conditions for the
combination carriers, as well as higher operating expenses and a lower
average exchange rate between the dollar and the krone, the company said.
Group operating profits in the first half fell to NKr161m from NKr229m. The
company said that it considered the operating result to be a good one in
view of the prevailing conditions of the shipping markets and the weakened
dollar.
First-half freight revenue slipped to NKr1.084bn from NKr1.142bn as
operating expenses rose to NKr239m from NKr172m.
The group took a charge of NKr41m for financial losses against a NKr6m gain
last time. In the second quarter financial losses hit NKr86m - including
foreign exchange losses of NKr79m - compared with losses of NKr4m a year
before.
Vard, the Norwegian cruise and ferry operator, has reported a fall in
first-half pre-tax losses to NKr128.5m from NKr190.3m a year earlier.
In the second quarter, Vard cut pre-tax losses to NKr86.8m from NKr138.6m
for the same period in 1991.
The group turned round to half-year operating profits of NKr210.21m from
losses of NK38.05m. Vard said the outlook in 1992 and 1993 for its cruise
operations appeared promising.
Larvik Line, one of Vard's ferry operations, returned to half-year operating
profits of NKr11.2m from losses of NKr2.9m.

stake-building

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BSN, the French group which is one of the most powerful players in the
European food industry, plans to take a defensive step against hostile
stake-building by banning any investor from exercising voting rights over
more than 6 per cent of its equity.
The proposal, suggested by Mr Antoine Riboud, BSN's veteran chairman, and
endorsed by a board meeting yesterday, will be submitted to shareholders at
an extraordinary meeting in late September.
BSN has come under the spotlight because of its role in the controversial
battle for Perrier mineral water. During the bid BSN broke ranks with its
old allies, the Agnelli family of Italy which owns 5.8 per cent of the
French food group, to side with Nestle, its chief competitor, in return for
an agreement to buy Volvic, one of the Perrier mineral waters.
The Volvic deal went through earlier this week after the European
Commission, initially critical of the tactical liaison between the two
rivals, gave the green light to Nestle's FFr15.46bn (Dollars 3.03bn) bid.
However, the Perrier drama raised questions about the long-term relationship
between BSN and the Agnellis.
BSN's proposals involve limiting the voting rights of any shareholder to a
maximum of 6 per cent - the amount held by Lazard, BSN's biggest investor -
or 12 per cent if they have double voting rights. This restriction would be
waived if any investor acquired more than 90 per cent, thereby facilitating
a full bid.
BSN said the voting restriction was necessary because its equity was so
widely dispersed that it was anxious to avoid the threat of an investor
exercising disproportionate influence over the company by buying a minority
stake.

THE underwriters of Hafnia's DKr1.9bn (Dollars 333.5m) rights issue were
forced to take up about half the troubled Danish insurance group's shares on
offer.
Most of the 7.08m A shares were taken up by shareholders, but 77.4 per cent
of the 9.30m B shares, valued at DKr977m, had to be accepted by the
institutional investors who underwrote the issue, of which Denmark's LD Fund
was the main one.
The issue was priced at DKr105 a share, but the B shares traded at about
DKr95 during the period of the issue.
Before the issue, now fully subscribed, Hafnia's equity capital was a
negative DKr450m.
It is expected that substantial cuts in staff and the sale of some
subsidiaries will be announced in the autumn.

FT  25 JUL 92 / UK Company News: New look Arlen tumbles Pounds 884,000 into
the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARLEN, the electronics group, showed a turnaround from profits of Pounds
120,000 to pre-tax losses of Pounds 884,000 in the year to March 31.
Mr Paul Cohen, chief executive, said that emphasis would now be on stability
after a period of change.
In the last two years there was the merger with Highland Electronics, the
acquisition of Norbain Electronics, the Pounds 780,000 cash and Pounds
400,000 preference share sale to a management buy-out of Centrepiece
Engineering, the closure of Haywood Engineering and the departure of Mr
Maurice Dwek as chairman.
Indeed the Pounds 350,000 costs of terminating the service contract of Mr
Dwek - who has retained 750,000 shares in the company - were taken as an
exceptional charge, thereby impacting the pre-tax line. There was also a
sharply increased interest charge of Pounds 659,000 (Pounds 255,000) derived
largely from the Highland and Norbain deals.
Operating profits fell to Pounds 125,000 (Pounds 719,000) on turnover of
Pounds 34.1m (Pounds 30.2m). Mr Cohen said the fall in margins was because
the company had previously carried heavy stocks which had to be
'dissipated'.
However, Sir Campbell Fraser, non-executive chairman, pointed out that of
the post-interest loss of Pounds 534,000 only Pounds 7,000 related to the
second half, as a result of the disposals, management reorganisation and
overhead savings.
Losses per share emerged at 3.8p (0.6p). Like the interim, the final
dividend is being passed - last time a total of 0.5p was paid.
Over the year borrowings were reduced from Pounds 6m to Pounds 4m.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TURNOVER at Sidney C Banks, the agricultural merchants and cereal
processors, advanced 23 per cent in the year ended April 30 1992, but the
growth in pre-tax profit was limited to 4 per cent.
Sales came to Pounds 239.8m (Pounds 195.2m) and the profit to Pounds 2.29m
(Pounds 2.21m).
Earnings per share were trimmed to 19.9p (20.2p) while a maintained final
dividend of 5.5p increases the total to 8.25p (8p).
The directors said that another harvest of excellent quality meant the
company was again unable to make full use of its skills in grain marketing.
The volume of sales of farm supplies had been maintained.
Non-agricultural activities continued to make satisfactory contributions.
Recent investments in Banks Odam Dennick and Doltons helped to increase
profits.

FT  25 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Clock stopped over Kalon bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CLOCK on Kalon's hostile Pounds 89.5m bid for Manders (Holdings) has
temporarily been stopped.
The Takeover Panel yesterday issued a statement saying that the decision
whether or not the paint maker's 8-for-3 share offer for the paint, ink and
property company would be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission
had yet to be made, and that it was unlikely that the outcome would be
announced by Wednesday July 29, day 39 of the progress of the bid. The panel
has therefore ruled that day 39 will now be deemed the second day after the
announcement of the decision.
Kalon has argued that a successful takeover would only boost its market
share from 16 to 23 per cent of the whole decorative paints market, while
Manders has contended that the merged group would command some 75 per cent
of the own-label paints market.
The bid has attracted attention beyond strict financial and competition
limits - a Commons motion has been signed by 64 MPs urging that the bid be
referred on the grounds that both bidder and target are healthy, profitable
companies and that there will be inevitable social damage in terms of job
losses.
The Office of Fair Trading, which recommends referral or non-referral to the
trade and industry secretary, said yesterday that it was looking at the
whole paints market, including the own-label sector, and that it was
sounding opinions from interested third parties.
Mr Roger Akers, Manders chief executive, said: 'It implies that it is not an
obvious not-a-referral situation. We must see that as good news.'
Mr Mike Hennessy, Kalon group managing director, said he was not surprised
by the delay. 'The bid has created considerable interest and it's taking
time to evaluate all the issues.'

FT  25 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Morland wins bitter battle of independence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORLAND, the Thames Valley brewer, yesterday decisively repelled the Pounds
104m hostile bid from Greene King to retain its 280-year-old independence.
The Suffolk-based brewer's bid lapsed after it ended a nine-week takeover
campaign with control of 45.95 per cent of Morland's shares.
Greene King launched its bid in May after buying a 28.5 per cent stake in
Morland from the Whitbread Investment Company, which also pledged a further
14.9 per cent.
Despite this strong base, Greene King gained less than 4 per cent
acceptances from other shareholders at the peak of its assault; and it lost
ground in the final days as some Morland shareholders who had accepted the
offer withdrew.
The outcome hit the shares of both companies - Greene King's closed 40p
lower at 467p while Morland's fell 41p to close at 420p.
Morland's Abingdon brewery - which Greene King would have closed -
celebrated the victory yesterday with a barrel of its Old Speckled Hen ale.
Mr Jasper Clutterbuck, chief executive, said: 'We are delighted that
shareholders have shown their confidence in us. Now it will be back to
business. We intend to put into operation the plans we announced during the
campaign which will benefit the company enormously.'
The Pounds 16.9m purchase of 72 pubs from Inntrepreneur Estates is expected
to be completed next week. The pubs will increase Morland's estate by 25 per
cent. A deal will also be clinched with Courage under which the
Australian-owned brewer will buy 5,000 barrels of Old Speckled Hen a year
and brew 20,000 barrels of its own beers at Abingdon. The move could
generate initial pre-tax profits of Pounds 800,000 a year, Mr Clutterbuck
said.
Greene King, which has been left with a 29.3 per cent stake in Morland,
would take time to assess all its options, said Mr Simon Redman, chairman.
'The least attractive option at the moment would be to come back in a year's
time with a revised offer.'
Greene King intended to continue the expansion of its 800-pub estate and
would consider buying a depot in Morland's trading area to push its IPA and
Abbot ale brands in the free trade, Mr Redman said.
The company will publish its 1991-92 results, which were held up by the
Takeover Panel.
Whitbread Investment Company will retain its 14.9 per cent shareholding in
Morland - the maximum level allowed to enable it to comply with the
government's beer orders.
It has yet to reduce its stakes in Marston, the Burton-based brewer, and
Devenish and Boddington, the pub operators.

FT  25 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Amstrad's finance director resigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMSTRAD, the consumer electronics group founded by Mr Alan Sugar, yesterday
announced the sudden departure of the group's finance director - the second
senior finance executive to leave the company within 48 hours.
News of Mr Peter Thoms' resignation was announced 10 minutes before the
market closed yesterday afternoon, giving traders little time to react.
Amstrad's shares closed  1/2 p lower on the day at 28 1/2 p.
Amstrad declined to comment on the reasons for Mr Thoms' resignation. He
said: 'I feel hamstrung, but I've been asked to say nothing.'
On Wednesday Mr Ken Ashcroft, Amstrad's corporate finance director, left the
board as part of the company's restructuring. Mr Ashcroft has become
non-executive chairman of Betacom, the telephone equipment distributor which
is 71.3 per cent owned by Amstrad.
On Thursday, Amstrad warned that a sharp deterioration in the personal
computer market meant it was likely to lose Pounds 65m in the year to June
30, on turnover of about Pounds 350m. These losses were about Pounds 25m
higher than market expectations.
Amstrad said Mr Thoms would be succeeded as group finance director by Mr
Tony Dean, who joined the group in 1985 and had been designate director,
group financial controller since October 1991 and, prior to that, held the
position of UK finance director.
No-one was available to comment at Amstrad's brokers, James Capel, financial
adviser Kleinwort Benson, or auditors Touche Ross. Herbert Smith, Amstrad's
solicitors, declined to comment.

Sir, The building societies feel aggrieved and hold National Savings
responsible for savers withdrawing funds from them. Strange that some
societies seem to have ignored the fact that for some time they have
persuaded savers to deposit funds with them, initially at competitive rates,
only for savers to find shortly after that interest rates have been
unilaterally reduced without them being informed.
Could we be getting our own back?

FT  25 JUL 92 / Letter: In spite of problems, partnerships can spearhead
regeneration of the inner cities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID TAGG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article 'Decay eats away at inner cities' (July 14), which
analysed the Policy Studies Institute report on urban trends, addresses some
of the major issues facing inner cities today.
The letter from Peter Hughes (July 21), leader of the Tower Hamlets council,
identifies that in spite of its problems Tower Hamlets still has enormous
potential and is greatly improving.
As chairman of the East London Partnership covering the three boroughs of
Tower Hamlets, Newham and Hackney, I totally support Peter Hughes' comments.
The East London Partnership was set up two years ago, sponsored by the
private sector, to develop a strong working partnership with the local
community. We all had a common aim: to improve the quality of life in an
inner city area by fostering economic regeneration.
Today that partnership incorporates large and small private sector
organisations, the local authorities, the voluntary sector and
representatives from the local community. Progress hasn't been easy, but it
has been constant. We have built a track record in helping to tackle issues
affecting the long-term prospects for East London; issues such as transport,
tourism, healthcare, training, employment, education and housing.
A major example of this partnership has been the achievement of all three
boroughs in winning City Challenge bids - Tower Hamlets in 1991 and now
Hackney and Newham in 1992. The unique blend of private and public sector
skills and expertise, local knowledge and the joint will to win made this
happen.
Clearly government has recognised the problems of the East End and has
responded by heavy investment in London Docklands over the past decade, but
problems still do exist.
I am convinced that the mood is changing, even since the report was written.
I believe a combination of productive local partnerships together with
government funding can continue to spearhead the regeneration of inner
cities.
True partnership is not merely about working together on the ground but also
about vision and the management of long-term strategic change.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALAN G BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Every manager knows that unclear or divided responsibility is a recipe
for poor results.
The government stressed with regard to rail privatisation that would-be
franchisees for future railway services will have to make commitments to
quality, and even suggests that contracts may be withdrawn for failure in
this area.
But if Railtrack runs the infrastructure the operator will clearly blame it
for delays caused by signal or point failure. Equally if the delay is due to
problems on a train run by another operator, the buck will again be passed.
At least at present one can lay responsibility for delays with a single
person (the chairman of British Rail) - even if in recent years he has
largely failed to improve things.

Sir, In your article on the Citizen's Charter ('Mixed blessings for the

British Rail's passenger charter and says 'vouchers and petty discounts . .

On a recent journey from Wales to Russia my train was 45 minutes late
arriving at Reading, so I missed my coach connection and took a taxi to
Heathrow airport. I wrote immediately to InterCity and in reply received a
charming letter enclosing a cheque for Pounds 33 to cover the taxi fare, a
Pounds 10 voucher and the information that my fishing rod, which I had left
on the train, was awaiting collection at Paddington lost property office.
I think that British Rail went as far as could be expected on this occasion
and look forward to using my free voucher.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr HUGH SADDINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, At long last somebody is writing about the excessive profits that
companies somewhere in the value chain are making at the UK's consumers
expense ('The price is wrong', July 21). Having spent three weeks last
Christmas in the US, I have been trying to understand what causes the
difference and can only agree with your conclusions.
Goods sourced from the far east as well as traditional English manufactured
products such as Churches Shoes are dollar for pound in the US. The issue
becomes more insulting when one compares goods in global chains such as Toys
R Us where the same dollar to pound parity exists irrespective of where the
goods were sourced; in particular, I am thinking of Lego (Denmark), Fisher
Price (components manufactured in Mexico - self assembly) and Little Tykes
(US).
Product ranges that include baby equipment, clothes electronics, food,
compact discs, jeans and Japanese cars all follow the dollar/pound parity.
To me this suggests price fixing, as I can not believe that the structural
characteristics of such diverse industries are identical. A good example
that illustrates how companies push price parity is the Lands End direct
mail operation that has recently opened up in the UK. Comparing its US
catalogue prices with the equivalent catalogue UK prices, parity holds on
most lines.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Letter: UK/US prices comparison suggests poor competition
and excessive profits (1)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ERNEST A HILTON

<TEXT>
Sir, I do not understand your defensive leader, 'The price is wrong', when
the answer, for consumers on both sides of the Atlantic, is such a clear-cut
case. Instead of beating around the bush you should and could have pointed
your finger at the astonishing lack of competition in the UK and probably
elsewhere in the EC. Where your 'soul searching' might pay off is to figure
out why there is such a tremendous difference.
My hunch is that cartels function more efficiently in Europe than the
competitive idea. What other possible reason can there be for the dramatic
earnings differential between UK and US supermarkets? Another example: it is
outrageous that the price of a ream of plain copier paper in the US is about
one-third of that in London. Your proposal of a searching investigation will
result, say in two years, in an overwhelming report with which nothing can
be done to create a competitive environment. Unless you can come up with a
better idea we shall all continue to, as you say, 'pay through the nose'.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Dream ticket to ride: Richard Tomkins on a train journey
into the future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS

<TEXT>
East Grinstead. The year: 2002. Greg Appleby sets out one morning from his
home in the West Sussex commuter belt for a business meeting in Edinburgh.
Arriving at East Grinstead station, he drives his electrically powered Rover
into the multi-storey car park, takes the keys to the Star Wash kiosk, and
leaves instructions for the car to be valeted.
As the moving walkway transfers him from the car park to the station
concourse, Greg recalls how, just 10 years ago, the station was a grim and
unappealing place. A dreary pre-fab, it boasted nothing but a ticket office,
a news stand, a men's and women's lavatory, and five doors on the platform
marked 'PRIVATE'.
Rail privatisation changed all that. A few years ago a local property
developer bought the station, built a concourse above track level and
created something akin to a mini-airport terminal.
These days, the station hums with activity. A 7-Eleven convenience store
sells sandwiches to passengers on their way to work and ready-to-cook meals
to those on their way home. People take their clothes to the dry cleaner,
swap films at the video library, leave their shoe repairs at the heel bar
and pick up their holiday snaps from the photo-processor.
The Brasserie de la Gare, meanwhile, has established itself as one of the
better eateries in East Grinstead, and Greg has skipped breakfast at home in
favour of coffee and croissants at a table on the air-conditioned concourse.
Three minutes before his train is due to leave, Greg settles his bill and
walks past the ticket desks to the departure gates. One leads to the
steam-operated Bluebell Railway, which two years earlier extended its tracks
to East Grinstead and now runs diesel trains into West Sussex during peak
hours. The other leads to the platforms operated by SeaConRail, a subsidiary
of Mr James Sherwood's Sea Containers shipping group, which holds the
franchise for the main-line commuter services into central London.
Greg, a regular customer at East Grinstead, shows his season ticket to the
smartly dressed attendant at SeaConRail's departure gate. 'Everything
running smoothly?' he asks as she swipes it through the validating machine.
The platform door swishes open. 'Have we ever let you down, Mr Appleby?' she
replies with a smile as he steps on to the waiting train.
The peak-hour service into London is heavily used, but not uncomfortably so.
British Rail's decrepit slam-door trains have been replaced with spacious
SeaConRail double-deckers, guaranteeing everyone a comfortable seat. There
are announcements about the journey's progress from the train captain,
telephones and drinks vending machines at the end of each carriage, and
complimentary copies of the Financial Times for all who want them.
On the other hand, fares are 60 per cent higher in real terms than they were
under British Rail. But because the Treasury is no longer required to
subsidise the service, it allows commuters to claim the cost of their season
tickets against tax: and passenger numbers have soared as a result of the
increased frequency, reliability and comfort that privatisation has brought.
Change is less evident at the London end. Most of the London terminals are
listed buildings and the private sector has been chary about the prospects
of doing much with them. But one difference is that they now provide a
choice of train operators. At King's Cross, two companies run to Edinburgh:
Stagecoach, with its frequent, no-frills economy trains, and Virgin, which
offers a less-frequent but more comfortable, airline-style service.
In fact Greg has made his choice already: he booked his seat on the Virgin
Flyer by telephone from the SeaConRail train. He walks over to the Virgin
check-in, picks up his ticket, and takes a complimentary coffee in the
departure lounge while waiting for boarding to begin.
Once on the train, Greg remarks on the changes privatisation has wrought.
Even economy-class seats on the Virgin train have seat-back video with six
channels to choose from. Meals, included in the ticket price, are served at
seat by friendly cabin crew. Some carriages have been set aside for
families, complete with play areas and baby-changing facilities; others have
conference areas and meeting rooms for business people, complete with
telephones, fax machines and computer terminals.
Greg watches a business programme on the video, then switches channels for
the news. After a pleasant lunch served with a glass of red wine, he finds
himself gazing out of the window at the passing countryside, and falls into
a slumber.
Suddenly, he is awakened by a jolt. The train has come to an abrupt halt
somewhere in northern England. The public address system is buzzing and
crackling, but no meaningful sound is coming out of it. Greg is about to
reach for the hostess call button when he realises it has disappeared -
along with the friendly cabin crew, the airline-style seat, the six-channel
video, the remains of his lunch . . .
With a groan, he realises that it has all been a dream. Yes, it is 2002;
yes, he is on his way to Edinburgh; but no, he is not on the Virgin Flyer.
He is stuck on an ageing British Rail InterCity train in the wilds of
Northumberland, there is no explanation for the breakdown, and the buffet
car has just sold the last bacon and tomato roll.
As he and his fellow passengers await a rescue, Greg has plenty of time to
reflect on the realities of privatisation. Virgin, he recalls, did start up
a pilot passenger train service in 1993, closely followed by Stagecoach; but
they only lasted a few months. British Rail's track charges were too high to
allow them to make any money. Besides, the private sector trains were
constantly getting stuck behind British Rail's, so they gained nothing in
speed or reliability.
As for SeaConRail, its ambitions to become a franchisee foundered on the
Treasury's refusal to make commuter fares allowable against tax. And
would-be railway station operators soon realised that stations would never
be as profitable as airports, where most passengers are ABC1s with an hour
or more to kill while they wait for their planes.
Ah well, at least the Bluebell Railway reached East Grinstead. But
elsewhere, it is still the same old British Rail running the same old - very
old - trains. Greg looks at his watch, stares gloomily out of the window,
and groans again. His business meeting has already ended. It is going to be
a long journey home.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Letter: Failings, and their relevance to what we do
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PAUL WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, So the prime minister considers that a minister's keeping or breaking
of marriage vows has 'nothing to do' with his conduct of departmental duties
('PM backs Mellor's media review role', July 21), nor presumably with the
likelihood of his breaking political and electoral promises.
Likewise, Joe Rogaly ('Fat chance of privacy', July 21) agrees, and suggests
that Mr Mellor made a mistake in issuing a statement. The experience of
Governor Bill Clinton in the US would suggest, however, that public
confession and restitution wins support from voters because of its honesty
and stops sensationalist reporting in its tracks.
Contrary to Mr Rogaly, we do not need a climate of opinion that 'responds to
news about (politicians') private lives with a definitive Gallic shrug', but
one which recognises that while we all have failings, these are not always
irrelevant to what we do.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Leading Article: The Treasury fights back
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST WEEK, the UK Treasury was under attack. But help from its allies - the
prime minister over control on public spending and the principal central
banks over the exchange rate - has given it room for manoeuvre. It is not
very much room; and it may not last for very long. But the Treasury does at
least remain in charge of the principal levers of power, other than monetary
policy.
It may be prepared to bow the knee before the Bundesbank. But it is not
prepared to accept upstarts at home. An independent Bank of England, free to
follow domestic monetary targets, was never to be tolerated. The Treasury's
permanent enemies are, however, neither the Bundesbank, nor even the Bank of
England, but the spending ministries of Whitehall. At a time when recovery
seems to be 'jam tomorrow' and never 'jam today', the battle for spending
control has to be fought more vigorously than for many years.
Blessed with the prime minister's strong support - the sine qua non of
effective control over public expenditure - the Treasury gained a notable
victory this week, both in the changes in procedure agreed by the cabinet
and in the actual figures.
The beauty - from the Treasury's point of view - of the new procedure is
that it will place the spending ministers, like scorpions, in a bottle of
predetermined size. At the beginning of each spending round a figure will be
agreed. In this year's round, which will focus upon expenditure allocations
for 1993-94, the relevant figure is to be the old-style 'planning total'.
This is now reconfirmed at the Pounds 244.5bn agreed during last year's
autumn spending round.
From next year - when decisions on revenue, hitherto announced in the spring
Budget, are to be combined with autumn's spending decisions - the
operational ceiling is to be renamed the 'control total'. This will be the
planning total, less cyclical social security spending.
Larger bottle
In 1994-95 and 1995-96, the control total is to grow by no more than 3 and 3
1/4 per cent, respectively, in cash terms. After real growth of well over 4
per cent in the planning total between 1992-93 and 1993-94 (though, says the
Treasury, of only 2.8 per cent in a notional control total), the real
increase in the control total is to be 0.75 per cent in 1994-95 and 1 per
cent in 1995-96. Over the long term, the Treasury hopes that public spending
will grow more slowly than the economy. The ratio of public spending to
gross domestic product will then fall steadily, along with the deficit.
The new procedure should work, provided the scorpions do fight each other
rather than collude to seek a larger bottle. Their battles will not be with
the Treasury, even if negotiations still take the form of bilateral
discussions with the chief secretary, but with one another over shares of
the total. What will no longer happen, therefore, is a series of bilateral
discussions whose outcome will determine the size of public spending. And if
the chief secretary cannot keep the scorpions in order, the chancellor's new
cabinet committee stands behind him.
Too generous
Yet even if the procedure itself works, it may still not be enough.
Last autumn's planning total for 1993-94 was far too generous, involving an
increase of Pounds 13bn over the target agreed in autumn 1990. The
government simply had to meet this target, especially when inflation is
expected to be significantly lower both this year and next than earlier
forecast. But it still implies growth of general government expenditure of 4
per cent in real terms. When the public sector borrowing requirement is
already some 5 per cent of GDP and economic growth is, to say the least,
uncertain, that initial increase is excessive.
All the stringency has been left to 1994-95 and 1995-96, by which time the
public sector's finances could look very shaky. If there is no recovery, the
public sector borrowing requirement might well be over 6 per cent of GDP by
1993-94. Again, with no strong recovery, it would take forever for mild
stringency to bring that down to more reasonable levels. In the meantime,
tighter budgets and perhaps even higher real long-term interest rates, may
make the recovery less likely.
Public sector stringency is required in the medium term. But what is needed
still more is recovery. Some see 'green shoots' once again. This week's
retail sales figures do little to support that hope, even though the British
Chambers of Commerce argues that the economy is slowly improving, if
fragile. Import growth also suggests recovery in demand, but export
performance is too poor to add much to output. The economy is, in short,
still bumping along that celebrated bottom.
This is where the central bankers come in. By their intervention this week
they saved the Treasury from having to follow last week's tightening by the
Bundesbank. But with neglect still the US attitude to the dollar and Italy
in severe difficulties, further exchange rate shocks cannot be ruled out.
The British Treasury has reconfirmed domestic primacy, but it holds sway
over a battered kingdom.

FT  25 JUL 92 / A testing dilemma
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REX WINSBURY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The citizens of Illinois have recently ended a well-meaning but ultimately
vain attempt to combat Aids. For nearly two years, all couples planning to
marry had to be tested for HIV. In theory, it was a good idea - but the
people of Illinois did not agree. Loving couples either postponed marriage,
or got married in another state.
In the first 12 months, only 159,000 people were tested, at a cost of
Dollars 5.6m (Pounds 2.9m). Of those tested, a mere 23 were HIV positive.
Faced with this great cost, the state caved in: the world's most ambitious
experiment in compulsory mass HIV testing collapsed.
In Cuba, people found to be HIV positive are forcibly quarantined.
Quarantining is also legal in Norway, but has not been put into practice for
political reasons.
Nevertheless, experts at this week's Amsterdam conference warned that
'criminalisation' of HIV not only does not work; it is also ethically
objectionable.
In Sweden, however, 98 per cent of pregnant women are tested for HIV
voluntarily. Norway also tests pregnant women. So mass testing, on a
voluntary basis, can work.
But with ever more gloomy forecasts about the global spread of HIV, the
issue of compulsory HIV testing remains.
Ericsson, the Swedish electrical multinational, tests managers about to go
abroad to high risk areas, simply because HIV infection impairs resistance
to other diseases. In the UK, companies such as Unilever test managers
recruited in high risk areas, on the grounds that they may travel to
countries which require a negative HIV test before a work permit is granted.
The US Army screens recruits and rejects those who are HIV-positive, and
tests all servicemen and women about every 18 months. The policy seems to
have worked. The rate of HIV infection has been dropping; in fact, the US
Air Force is making tests less frequent, because its rate has dropped so
low.
So mass screening can work, at least in certain circumstances. The fear is
the stigmatisation and ostracism that often follows revelation of HIV
positive status. Whether or not there is also a new rare undetectable strain
of immune deficiency virus, we will soon have to think hard about where and
when to test our citizens for HIV.
We shall need to learn the lessons from Illinois, confront the issues of
civil liberties and stigma, but be sturdily aware that, in a matter of such
consequence, the ultimate justification may lie not in the private
indulgence of the individual but in the public health of the nation.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Grim statistics mask advances: Aids has already claimed a
million lives, but drug companies are making progress towards a vaccine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The thousand journalists covering the international Aids conference in
Amsterdam this week found it far easier to write scare stories than to
report scientific breakthroughs.
One obsession was a mysterious new microbe, possibly responsible for several
dozen cases in which patients had symptoms of Aids but no trace of HIV, the
virus that normally causes the disease.
On the global level, there were statistics galore to show how 'small
discrete epidemics have coalesced into a worldwide pandemic sparing no
region and virtually no country', as Dr Michael Merson, director of the
World Health Organisation's Aids programme, put it. Between 10m and 12m
adults and 1m children are infected, 80 per cent of them in developing
countries; 2m people have developed Aids and more than 1m have died.
Projections for the year 2000 range from 30m to 120m people with HIV.
African delegates described how Aids - spread mainly through heterosexual
intercourse - was starting to destroy the social fabric of their countries.
Aids patients take up more than half the beds of urban hospitals in
countries such as Zaire and Zambia.
The global cost of Aids care, research and prevention was about Dollars 10bn
(Pounds 5.24bn) last year, the Harvard School of Public Health estimates.
The US alone has already spent Dollars 10bn looking after people with HIV in
the 10 years since Aids was first recognised as a disease.
The good news in Amsterdam was too subtle to make headlines. None of the
several thousand doctors and scientists at the conference reported anything
that even the most excitable journalist could call a big breakthrough. Even
so, the pharmaceutical industry is making progress in developing drugs and
vaccines. Scientists are uncovering the bizarre biological processes
underlying HIV infection and disease.
Within the next year or so, new drugs such as Glaxo's 3TC and Bristol-Myers
Squibb's d4T are likely to begin large-scale clinical trials. Although they
work in a similar way to Wellcome's AZT, which has had a virtual monopoly of
the anti-HIV market since it was rushed into production in 1987, they may
have fewer side effects and/or stronger anti-viral activity than AZT.
The latest evidence shows that a 'cocktail' of two or more anti-HIV drugs
works better than any single medicine on its own. Combination therapy will
multiply the benefits of new drugs, but unfortunately not to the extent of
curing patients.
A dozen candidate vaccines are in the first phase of clinical trials. None
of the uninfected volunteers has suffered any adverse reaction - and their
immune systems have developed some of the antibodies required to fight HIV.
Vaccine manufacturers and government health bodies in developing and
developed countries are now confident enough to be preparing for large-scale
trials, each involving several thousand people, which could start in
1994-95.
There will be formidable ethical problems: how, for example, to obtain
informed consent from a partly illiterate group to take part in a trial in
which half receive a 'placebo' dummy jab and the other half a potentially
risky experimental vaccine. Dr Stephen Lwanga, director-general of the
Uganda Aids Commission, said his country would a large-scale trial, on
certain conditions. 'I'm sure we will come to an amicable understanding on
who bears the liability if things go wrong  - and who derives the profits if
they go right,' he commented.
Looking further ahead, scientists at the conference reported remarkable
progress in understanding how the human immune system first defends itself
against HIV and then, after a few years, begins to succumb to the virus.
This has been balanced by new evidence of how HIV itself changes character
in a patient over time by genetic mutation. Together these two avenues of
research will lead eventually to new ideas for treating HIV.
Now that Aids is in its second decade, scientists are paying attention to
the minority of people with HIV who are still healthy more than 10 years
after infection. Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco,
have discovered that a type of white blood cell called CD8 keeps HIV under
control by suppressing the virus in infected cells.
In most people the CD8 cells lose their activity after a few years. Then the
CD4 cells - the immune cells normally studied to define the progress of Aids
 -disappear and symptoms appear. The UCSF researchers are working to develop
treatments based on CD8 cells.
The virus itself mutates more rapidly than any other microbe. Not only are
there countless different strains, but within each individual person HIV
changes character as the disease progresses. In the early years of infection
the rate of mutation is relatively low. Later, after the patient's immune
defences have collapsed, HIV can quickly change into more virulent forms.
These observations explain why patients become resistant to anti-HIV drugs
more quickly in the final stages of the disease. Several experimental drugs
have recently been abandoned because the virus quickly became resistant to
them.
Researchers are now identifying the precise genetic changes responsible for
drug resistance. They will then be able to predict which drug combinations
are best able to outwit HIV's genetic variability. This could be used to
delay the onset of resistance or even deliberately create resistance in
order to weaken the virus. (New evidence suggests that some mutations which
make HIV resistant to drugs also make it less virulent.)
The pharmaceutical industry remains committed to converting the advances in
basic science into better HIV drugs and vaccines. Drug companies were very
visible at the conference, with marketing staff in the vast exhibition hall
and researchers in the scientific sessions. The industry spends several
hundred million dollars a year on Aids R&amp;D. Compared to the likely
commercial return from the products, HIV probably gets a disproportionate
share of pharmaceutical research funds, because the companies' scientific
credibility would be at stake if they pulled out of such a fast-moving and
medically important field.
They got no thanks from the hundreds of Aids activists who were officially
accredited to the conference. Act-Up, the most vocal group, targeted several
companies for noisy 'die-in' demonstrations, accusing them of making
excessive profits from overpriced Aids drugs.
Professor Anthony Pinching of St Bartholomew's Hospital in London voiced the
concern of many specialists that the activists would go too far. 'The
industry makes a classic pantomime villain but what they fail to understand
is that its commitment and goodwill is jeopardised by their ridiculous
abuse,' he said. 'The executives will eventually decide that Aids is too hot
politically and they'll pull the plug.'
If the drug companies cut back on research it would be a scare story for the
millions of people who are dependent upon them to come up with a cure.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Man in the News: Tabloid terror turned hero - Kelvin
MacKenzie
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There has rarely been such a tabloid villain as Kelvin MacKenzie, editor of
The Sun, Britain's top-selling daily newspaper. His previous convictions are
legendary. MacKenzie and his team have been guilty of:
Lies - such as allegations about the private life of pop singer Elton John
which led to a Pounds 1m out-of-court settlement, and the headline 'The
truth' over a story about the behaviour of Liverpool fans before the
Hillsborough football stadium disaster, which was no such thing;
Jingoism - with headlines such as 'Gotcha' (one edition) after a British
submarine sank the General Belgrano during the Falklands war, and 'Up yours
Delors' in honour of the president of the European Commission; Prejudice -
for announcing: 'Straight sex cannot give you Aids - official' and
suggesting that Aids is nothing for normal folk to worry about;
Bias - for election coverage that could have come straight from Conservative
Central Office - culminating in the election morning front-page picture of
Neil Kinnock inside a light bulb and the white-on-blue headline: 'If Kinnock
wins today, will the last person to leave Britain please turnout the
lights.'
To his detractors, MacKenzie is the man who has debauched British press
standards and is, more than any other, responsible for political threats to
introduce statutory controls on press freedom or privacy legislation.
He is keen to protect his own privacy. His Who's Who entry is almost
certainly the shortest in the volume: 'MacKenzie, Kelvin Calder; Editor of
The Sun, since 1981; b 22 Oct. 1946; m 1969, Jacqueline Mary Holland; two s
one d. Educ: Alleyn's Sch., Dulwich. Address: The Sun, Virginia Street, E1
9BH. T: 071-782 4000.'
Admirers, who include Rupert Murdoch, his proprietor, see him as one of
Britain's most talented editors, whose loudmouthed tirades sum up what the
average person is thinking or is about to think.
Yet on Monday evening, MacKenzie the tabloid terrorist turned into cunningly
effective defender of press freedom. As broadsheet editors refined their
hand-wringing editorials on the revelations in The People newspaper about
heritage secretary David Mellor's affair with an actress, Mr MacKenzie
struck out in the only way he knows - by going on the attack.
The Conservative-supporting editor of a Conservative-supporting newspaper
pulled his own revelation out of a hat - that during the general election
campaign a senior cabinet minister had tried to interest him in a sexual
smear of Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown. The names and addresses of
women who, it was claimed, had had affairs with Ashdown, had been supplied
by the unnamed minister. The Sun says it checked the allegations and found
them to be untrue.
MacKenzie decided it was time to hit back at hypocritical politicians trying
to blame newspapers for society's ills. He decided it was time, in his
favourite phrase for causing mayhem, to put 'a ferret up the trouser leg'.
Surprisingly, he chose to drop his bombshell on the Radio 4's rather sedate
programme, The World Tonight. It is MacKenzie's favourite radio programme.
He listens on the car radio as he travels home with the first edition of The
Sun safely to bed. 'It's taught me all I know about Bosnia,' he says
admiringly.
That day, The World Tonight and everyone else were chasing MacKenzie for an
interview on the Mellor affair. The television stations were being ignored,
but MacKenzie's office was talking to a producer from The World Tonight. No,
he would not come into the studio to debate the issue with Labour MP Clare
Short. No, he would not come down six floors into a radio car. But he would
do a telephone interview from his office.
Presenter Richard Kershaw scrambled to a studio and went straight into an
interview with a few scribbled notes. The notion of a privacy bill was
simply a cloak to stop newspapers revealing the real intentions of the rich
and famous, MacKenzie argued.
'If you don't want to appear in the papers, then don't drop your trousers.
It is as simple as that,' was his blunt advice to politicians.
And then he took a huge bite out of the hand that he had been kissing as
recently as April by telling the story of the senior Tory minister. Kershaw
recognised immediately he had an important story and one of far greater
significance than that of the minister and the actress.
MacKenzie came out of his office and told staff he might have dropped a
clanger. They replied that what he had dropped was a story, and would he
please get it into the paper. It missed the first edition, but a trenchant
page-one opinion piece was soon produced.
Even The Sun's bitter rival, the Daily Mirror, said that in spite of
MacKenzie's fondness for fiction, 'even he, we would have thought, would not
actually INVENT the story that a Cabinet minister telephoned him with the
names of three (or five) women allegedly having an affair with Mr Ashdown'.
MacKenzie insists that he had the conversation directly with the senior
minister, whom he has refused to name, though government officials have
denied the story.
The incident marks an important turning point in relations between
government and the press. Two weeks ago, Mr John Major, the prime minister,
was indicating to journalists that privacy legislation was becoming more
likely. Now, after MacKenzie's counter-attack and this week's declaration
from the Press Complaints Commission that the public has the right to know
about the private behaviour of politicians if it could affect their official
duties, Mr Major is letting it be known that privacy legislation is
unlikely.
It is doubtful whether this will be enough to persuade MacKenzie to put the
genie back in the bottle.
'The heat will be turned down on the tabloids and turned up on the
politicians when parliament returns in the autumn,' promises MacKenzie.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Court action over Harrods blocked
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ACTION for damages in the High Court by Lonrho, the international trading
group, and Mr Tiny Rowland, its chief executive, alleging a dirty tricks
campaign by the Fayed brothers during the row over the ownership of Harrods,
the London department store, was yesterday ordered to be struck out.
Mr Justice Macpherson said the action, launched last year, was another round
in the 'prolonged public warfare with no holds barred' over the Fayeds'
acquisition of the House of Fraser stores group.
If the action were allowed to go ahead it would inevitably involve raking
over the whole dispute with 'mud slung in all directions', Mr Justice
Macpherson said.
Lonrho and Mr Rowland were ordered to pay the costs of House of Fraser's
application to have the action struck out.
Lonrho was refused leave to appeal but its lawyers said later there were
good grounds for appeal and further moves would be considered.
The action sought damages and an injunction in respect of an alleged
conspiracy by brothers Mohammed and Ali Al Fayed to injure Lonrho and Mr
Rowland.
The main figure in the conspiracy allegations, Miss Francesca Pollard, was
said to have been used as a 'tool' by the Fayeds in a 'long-running campaign
of vilification', with her main target being Mr Rowland personally.
The judge said that, 'in a an unpleasant twist', Miss Pollard had gone over
to the Lonrho camp in the summer of 1991.
He said that, over the past six years, Lonrho and Mr Rowland had been intent
on discrediting the Fayeds and had spared no expense.
But the Fayeds themselves were not 'lily-white' and were prepared to
'descend to the depths of vulgarity'.
The judge said he was 'sceptical' of Lonrho's claim for damages and 'even
more sceptical' of its claim for an injunction. Neither remedy was likely to
be available to them.
Mr Justice Macpherson said: 'I fail to see why such a public, unpleasant and
vitriolic vendetta should be allowed to be aired in court'.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Damages awarded against Nissan UK: Ex-executive wins Pounds
804,860 for unfair dismissal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAMAGES of Pounds 804,860 were yesterday awarded against Nissan UK, the car
distributor, after a High Court judge ruled that a former assistant managing
director had been unfairly dismissed. The award is believed to be the
largest in an employment action.
Mr Stan Cholaj, now managing director of the importer-distributor company
for Seat cars in the UK, won the damages after the judge had ruled that
Nissan UK had breached his employment contract by reducing his
responsibilities to cover only the sales of fleet cars.
Mr Cholaj, who worked previously for Ford UK and Thorn EMI, left Nissan UK
in June 1989 after clashing with Mr Octav Botnar, chairman and managing
director of Nissan UK. Shortly before, Mr Botnar had failed to sell his
Nissan UK company to Nissan Japan, the car manufacturer, and was trying to
boost sales of the outdated Bluebird model to fleet operators.
Mr Botnar relieved Mr Cholaj of most of his responsibilities and instructed
him to concentrate on building fleet car sales - an area in which he had
little previous experience.
Mr Cholaj, who had been on a salary of Pounds 150,000 a year with a 10-year
notice period, had said his appointment to fleet sales had undermined his
authority and must have been intended to do so.
He had rightly felt humiliated by Mr Botnar altering his job
responsibilities, Judge Laurie said. Before taking the job, Mr Cholaj had
known of Mr Botnar's autocratic management style - and having gone into the
kitchen had to put up with the heat.
However, his contract had been breached because the job of supervising fleet
car sales was not in line with his status as assistant managing director,
the judge continued.
Mr Botnar had adopted a 'take-it or leave-it attitude' and made the issue a
resigning matter.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Companies House review is ordered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Department of Trade and Industry yesterday announced a review of
Companies House that could lead to the full or partial privatisation of the
Cardiff-based agency.
The move signals a further step in the government's programme to put
services into the private sector where appropriate.
'The government's job is to govern, not to administer,' Mr Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said yesterday. 'This is the basis
on which I intend my department to carry out its review of agencies,
starting with Companies House.'
Supporters of Civil Service privatisation have long argued that Companies
House is an ideal candidate for privatisation, but any decision to sell it
would be considered controversial because of potential implications for jobs
and because of worries over impartiality under private control.
The department is soon to appoint consultants to help with the Companies
House review, which will examine its operation and role and advise on how
its work can best be carried out in the future.
Among options to be studied will be full or partial privatisation,
contracting out of some activities or continuing as present. The department
promised full consultation with staff and unions.
Companies House employs the equivalent of 1,150 full-time staff and
incorporates companies, makes company information available to the public,
and takes action against companies which file their reports late.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Rivals mourn loss of Beaver: It was the company that did all
the right things but in the end it was beaten by the recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LITTLE more than 11 weeks ago, Mr Tony Balding was greeting visitors to the
Beaver Engineering stand at Birmingham's Mach'92 machine-tool show with a
smile, a cup of coffee, and an enthusiasm for his products that is typical
of the devoted family businessman.
This week the devotion was still there but it was a little harder to smile.
On Wednesday Mr Balding signed on at Norwich Jobcentre, a week after being
declared redundant by administrative receivers who had moved in at Beaver.
Mr Balding is now the ex-managing director of Beaver, one of the most
innovative of Britain's machine-tool companies, and is wondering what to do
with himself. 'Like every family businessman I can never separate myself
from my work,' he says. 'Even when we go on holiday I am dreaming up new
designs for vertical machining centres.'
It has been a grim fortnight for the machine-tool industry. The Beaver
receivership was followed on Thursday by news that Matrix Churchill, the
Midlands based producer, had called in the receivers.
The fears expressed by industry leaders - that some companies are being kept
afloat only by the goodwill of their banks - are proving correct. The
problem is that the support is now being withdrawn.
Something about the Beaver receivership seems to have touched a chord in an
industry that is becoming exasperated by its failure to get the message
about its strategic importance across to the government. 'It's terrible
news,' says one machine-tool builder. 'Beaver has done all the right things,
but the orders weren't there.'
Those outside the industry might wonder about the fuss over the receivership
of a company whose workforce never reached 300, and whose peak annual sales
were just Pounds 11.5m.
The simple answer is that in the 41 years since it was founded by Mr
Balding's father Victor - now 76 and, until last week, non-executive
chairman - Beaver has become a beacon of excellence that even its rivals say
deserves to stay alight.
But there is a more complex answer. Beaver may be small but its collapse
raises some big issues - the future of small-scale entrepreneurialism in
competitive global markets, the attitude of banks and the government to
industry, the decline of Britain's manufacturing base - and, ultimately, the
UK's future as a serous participant in the world machine-tool industry.
Beaver produced its first machine tool in 1954 and is no stranger to
challenges. In 1978 when Mr Balding visited a Chicago show with his father,
they discovered the Japanese were selling 'bed-type' machines - heavier,
more rigid and more accurate than Beaver's 'knee-type' range - and for the
same price. 'We recognised the implications,' Mr Balding recalls. 'We either
had to accept the challenge or get out.' Beaver took the plunge, introducing
models just as the UK went into the 1980-81 recession. The initiative saved
the company as other UK machine-tool makers - notably the former world
leader Alfred Herbert - went under.
In the 1980s, Beaver did all that the Thatcher government was forcing
industry to do, raising quality, boosting exports and developing new
products. But, says Mr Balding: 'We did all this because it was the obvious
thing to do, not because they told us to.'
In the boom of the mid-1980s the company expanded, opening factories in
Peterborough and Halesworth, Suffolk. By mid-1989 it had 289 employees, and
a respected range of computer numerically controlled lathes and machining
centres.
Then everything went wrong. Orders dried up, the new factories had to be
closed and Beaver battened down the hatches. But it has been a very
different recession this time, says Mr Balding. The UK customer base has
contracted by a third in 15 years, yet foreign competition in the UK market
has intensified, mainly from Japan, but also from Taiwan and Germany.
For Mr Balding, the support that foreign competitors have received to carry
them through the recession has given them a crucial advantage. 'One way or
another, funds are being made available. Many large Japanese companies have
more than 1,000 machines in stock and one questions whether they are all
funded from their own resources.
'When we went into receivership we had 10 machines in stock. If the funds
had been made available to produce 60 machines for stock, we would have been
able to run that business at break-even for at least the next 12 months.'
However, Beaver's bank facility expired on July 3, and National Westminster
Bank refused to renew it. Beaver did not have enough cash to carry it
through the lean summer months, and after a last frantic search to find a
partner, Mr Balding had no option but to ask for administrative receivers to
be appointed.
With the benefit of hindsight, he says he might have done things
differently. The company probably stayed too long in family ownership and
probably spent too much time and money developing its range when it should
have been looking for an additional business leg or finding a new owner.
Ideally, he says, Beaver should have become part of a larger group while
simultaneously preserving its entrepreneurialism. 'It is an industry where
scale is important.' Failing that, only a big boost to UK demand could have
preserved Beaver in Balding family ownership.
Looking back over the past few weeks, Mr Balding says: 'I have no reason to
feel bitter, but I feel terribly empty, and a great sense of loss.'
He does not blame NatWest - the banks have a job to do, he says, which is to
make sure their money is safe - but believes neither the banks nor the
government understand the industry. 'Between them, someone has to take more
of a medium or long-term view - they can't both assume that people are going
to come back into the industry when business comes back to something like a
normal level of activity.'
But he criticises the government both for cutting back on the support for
research and development that helped Beaver fend off the Japanese 10 years
ago, and for the high interest-rate policy of 1989 and 1990 which sucked the
working capital out of the company, leaving it unable to afford a
restructuring plan.
Ironically, the plan that was vetoed by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the bank's
supervising accountant, is being used by its Cork Gully insolvency arm. It
is a painful strategy, involving ending parts and components manufacturing,
and concentrating on design, development and service and assembly.
A total of 80 jobs have already gone, but the plan might be the only chance
to preserve something from the debacle. Yesterday, Mr Mark Shires, a
principal at Cork Gully in Norwich, said an advertisement in Tuesday's FT
had prompted a number of inquiries, and Beaver had also secured new
machine-tool orders in the past week.
Mr Balding naturally hopes the company will survive - and not simply because
the family are the main creditors. 'It would be nice to see the business
continue in some form, with a new owner to carry it forward.'

A MEETING in Dublin next week between the British and Irish governments will
mark the start of a new phase in the talks on the political future of
Northern Ireland.
It represents the beginning of 'strand three' of the talks under the highly
complex structure for negotiations.
Yesterday it was agreed in Belfast that 'strand two', consisting of talks
between the British and Irish governments and four Ulster political parties,
would resume on September 1 after a five-week summer recess.
This decision was facilitated by an agreement to make the week beginning
September 28 the earliest date for the next meeting of the Anglo-Irish
Conference.

FT  25 JUL 92 / PM gives public support to Mellor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRIME minister yes-terday reaffirmed his support for his embattled
national heritage secretary, Mr David Mellor, insisting that he would remain
at his post.
In his Huntingdon constituency, Mr Major said: 'We are absolutely committed
to making sure we improve the profile and commitment to the arts, heritage
and sport.
'David Mellor is very well qualified to deal with that job. He is doing it
extremely well. He is going to go on doing it.'
It was the first endorsement in public by Mr Major of the heritage secretary
since newspaper revelations last Sunday of Mr Mellor's alleged relationship
with a 31-year-old actress. It came as the pressure on Mr Mellor appeared to
be easing.
Yesterday, the minister made a well-publicised visit to his parents in-law,
clearly aimed at projecting a conciliatory impression after press reports of
rows within the family. Mr Mellor, asked by reporters whether he would
resign, replied: 'Absolutely not'.
Ministers now believe Mr Major's backing of Mr Mellor should ensure the
political survival of the national heritage secretary, provided there are no
further embarrassing disclosures.
Mr Mellor also appears to have the backing of most MPs, who are growing
increasingly angry at the press criticism. Only one Tory MP, Mrs Ann
Winterton, has so far publicly called for his resignation.
Mr Mellor's wife Judith has written to The Sun, the Daily Mirror and Today,
protesting at some of their reports.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Land Travel failure leaves customers and staff stranded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM LAWRENCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE spectacular collapse of Land Travel has stranded employees and
holidaymakers alike.
Inside the company's smart Churchill House offices in Dorchester Street,
Bath, 130 staff - some dressed in black ties after being warned of the
impending doom - were told they no longer had jobs.
Outside the offices a crowd of holidaymakers were left to consider that they
not only had no holidays but also little chance of getting their money back.
Meanwhile the collapse of Land Travel prompted a flood of horror stories
from disgruntled customers, while abroad others were coming to terms with
finding themselves stranded, or at the mercy of coach and ferry operators.
Among the luckier ones were seven coach loads of Land Travel customers who
arrived at the Euro Disney resort outside Paris yesterday morning. They were
allowed in, despite the fact that they did not all have valid entry tickets,
and Euro Disney reported that the coaches were still waiting patiently at
the gates for them late yesterday evening.
About 80 Land Travel customers had arrived at the park two weeks ago without
valid tickets, according to Euro Disney. On that occasion Euro Disney gave
complimentary entry tickets to about 20 of the customers.
Mrs Phyllis Pratt, of Corsham, Wilts, was another customer enticed by the
cut price holidays. She booked a four-day coach trip to Holland costing
Pounds 100, including travel and hotel accommodation.
She was let down on two separate occasions at short notice. Land Travel
cited coach problems as the cause for the cancellations, she said.
'They treated me extremely shabbily. I always got the impression they were
holding something back,' Mrs Pratt said. 'It was such a disappointment
because I was looking forward to a holiday to help me get over losing my
husband.'
Among the anxious customers waiting the company's offices after doors were
locked at 9.45 am yesterday was Mr Alex Fleming, a social club organiser
from Tewkesbury, near Cheltenham, who had booked a Pounds 4,960 seven day
trip to Spain for himself and 21 family and friends, which was cancelled on
Thursday.
'We are absolutely sick. I was hoping that by coming down here this morning
I could get some sort of reimbursement, so that I could arrange another
holiday but I've been told we've lost everything.'
Mr Judah Duiker and Mrs Meikie Duiker travelled 250 miles from York to claim
money for a holiday to Rome which was cancelled at the last minute on
Thursday. The couple left empty handed.
Mr Duiker said: 'We have been in Britain for two years and we wanted to see
as much of Europe as possible. We have lost money in terms of paying almost
Pounds 100 for visas to enter France and Italy and Pounds 176 on the
holiday.'
Before the police and liquidators moved in Land Travel offered a range of
cut-price European holidays, including three nights in Paris or Brussels at
Pounds 49, ten days in Poland at Pounds 159 and tours to the Austrian lakes,
Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, Prague and the Black Forest for less than
Pounds 150. A week in Costa Brava at Christmas cost Pounds 150 and a week in
Rome over the new year was priced at Pounds 104.
Avon and Somerset police said they had received a number of complaints over
a period of time regarding Land Travel.
Company records reveal that Land Travel has been in financial trouble for
some time.
Mr Don Foster, MP for Bath, demanded an inquiry into Land Travel and called
for new laws to make tour operators produce evidence of confirmed bookings.
'There ought to be government health warnings on package holidays that are
not covered by the Association of British Travel Agents,' he said.
Mr Foster added: 'In spite of everything the message has not been getting
through. Of course you are free to make your own choice, but if you do not
go with an ABTA company, you must beware of the consequences.' He said he
would investigate claims that Land Travel holiday packages were insured. 'It
is unclear who was covering them and what the back up was.'

FT  25 JUL 92 / Working hours blow in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE government moves to shorten working hours suffered a setback
yesterday when a court ruled that an employer abolishing Saturday shifts
could load at least some of the lost hours on to the rest of the week.
A call for working hours to be reduced was made earlier this year by Mr
Kiichi Miyazawa, prime minister. His proclaimed aim was to turn Japan into a
'lifestyle superpower' - although the issue also addressed US and European
criticism that long hours for labour in Japan represented a competitive
advantage which helped fuel its growing trade surplus.
His appeal was echoed in the private sector by Sony's Mr Akio Morita and
apparently taken seriously by organisations such as the Nikkeiren employers'
federation.
However, Mr Hiroshi Yamamoto, presiding judge at the Akita district court in
northern Japan, though acknowledging that the aim of a five-day week was to
cut total hours worked, gave conditional approval yesterday to longer
weekday working.
He was dismissing a suit brought by 30 employees of the local Ugo Bank who
were claiming compensation from their employer.
Along with the rest of the Japanese financial sector, in 1989 Ugo had
introduced a five-day week for the 1,000 staff at its 71 branches, trimming
the annual official length of time worked by each to 1,849 hours from 1,891.
In so doing, though, the bank had lengthened each weekday by at least 10
minutes, and by as much as an hour - to make a nine-hour day finishing at
5.50pm - on busy days in the banking calendar. No extra pay was forthcoming.
The ruling set only informal precedent but was widely seen as a test case
and was given front-page prominence in Japanese evening newspapers.
The judge said the cut of 42 hours a year was enough to permit an extension
of weekday working as a transitional measure. Ugo, when asked last night
asked what plans it had to reduce hours further, said merely that 'for the
industry as a whole, this is a subject for study."
The government's target is for a reduction in the working year to 1,800
hours by the end of the 1996 fiscal year. According to official statistics,
Japanese workers put in an average 2,006 hours last year. Figures such as
this are viewed in the west as a substantial underestimate, taking no
account of obligatory overtime.
So-called service overtime, which goes unrecorded, as well as unpaid, is
endemic in the banking sector, where annual hours have been put unofficially
at 2,600.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is likely to tighten its hold
on power in tomorrow's upper house election. The main point of interest is
whether there will be a record low turnout of voters.
Barring an unlikely last minute swing away from the LDP, the opposition
Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ) will be humiliated after an
uninspiring campaign.
The perception that the SDPJ, formerly the Socialist Party, does not provide
a real alternative to the LDP has been highlighted by opinion polls showing
40 per cent 'don't know' responses. This reflects general discontent with
the state of politics.
Mr Shin Kanemaru, the LDP vice-president and 'godfather', suggested
newspaper polls showing a large LDP lead were part of a 'conspiracy' to
encourage voters to turn against the ruling party or to shun the election
and spend the day at the beach.
Half the nation's 252 upper house seats are at stake, and the LDP is likely
to win 70 or more, leaving it in a strong position to regain a majority lost
in 1989, when the Socialist Party appeared capable of challenging LDP
leadership in the more powerful lower house.
The contrast between the opposition party's enthusiastic 1989 campaign and
the lacklustre effort this year could not be more striking. With a campaign
targeted almost solely against legislation allowing Japanese servicemen to
join UN peacekeeping operations, the SDPJ has been unable to capitalise on
concerns about a flagging economy.
Mr Makoto Tanabe, the SDPJ leader, has conceded that the campaign was poorly
handled, much to the delight of the LDP, which is tainted by bribery
scandals and its failure to deliver promised political reforms.

NEGOTIATIONS between the European Community and the Association of South
East Asian Nations (Asean) over a new co-operation agreement have been
halted by Portuguese objections to Indonesia's human rights record in East
Timor.
The dispute is embarrassing for the EC, whose 12 members cannot agree on how
to proceed, and frustrating for Asean, which was hoping to continue the
talks on upgrading relations at a meeting of foreign ministers yesterday in
Manila.
'It's a very unfortunate development,' said Mr Abdullah Badawi, the
Malaysian foreign minister. 'We will not want to abandon EC-Asean
co-operation simply because of Portugal.' Asean groups Brunei, Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.
One senior EC diplomat said he feared the disagreement would have an
insidious effect on relations between the two blocs. 'Effectively we can't
start (negotiations) until we've cleared the roadblock,' he said.
Whereas the existing accord is a bland statement of good intentions, the
proposed new agreement would include provisions on resolving trade disputes
and on European Investment Bank lending to Asean states. EC-Asean trade has
risen to Pounds 27bn in 1990 from Pounds 8bn in 1980, and has been rising by
25 per cent annually for the last three years.
Even before the Portuguese blocked further talks, EC and Asean officials
were unable to agree on the inclusion of clauses on human rights and the
environment in the new agreement. Asean ministers explicitly rejected any
linkage between economic co-operation and environmental or human rights
concerns at the end of an Asean meeting in Manila on Wednesday.
Portugal maintains that it is contrary to EC policy to upgrade relations
with countries which have poor human rights records. Indonesia annexed East
Timor, a former Portuguese colony, in 1975, and Indonesian troops shot dead
at least 50 civilian protestors there in one incident in November last year.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, said yesterday the human
rights issue 'will not go away', but he sought to mollify his Asean
counterparts by emphasising universal rather than western principles of
human rights.
'We are not talking of the imposition of the values of one section of the
world on another section with different values,' he said. 'We are talking
about an understanding of shared values and agreement on how they can be
applied.'

FRANCE slipped into a trading deficit of FFr951m (Pounds 97m) last month
after five months of trade surpluses.
News of the June deficit comes at a sensitive time for France's socialist
government which has previously countered criticism of rising unemployment
by pointing to French industry's success in its export markets. The
socialists are anxious to avoid further criticism in the approach to
September's referendum on the Maastricht treaty and the National Assembly
elections next spring.
So far this year French companies have benefited from buoyant exports which
have helped to shelter them from the sluggish state of the domestic market,
where high interest rates and concern about unemployment have dampened
consumer demand.
The value of French exports rose to FFr106.4bn last month from FFr103.4bn in
May. However imports rose at a faster rate to FFr107.4bn in June from
FFr99.3bn in the preceding month thereby pushing the trade account into the
red.
Despite last month's deficit, France recorded a healthy trading surplus of
FFr16.6bn in the first half of this year, representing a healthy recovery
from the deficit of FFr23.2bn for the same period of 1991.

GERMAN publisher Mr Hubert Burda said yesterday the brash Super] tabloid
sold in eastern Germany had been forced to close yesterday after Mr Rupert
Murdoch, the Australian-born publisher, decided to pull out of the
one-year-old venture, Reuter reports from Berlin.
Mr Burda said that high unemployment in eastern Germany, a harshly
competitive newspaper market and a lack of advertising revenue made it
impossible to make the tabloid profitable in the near term.
Mr Murdoch's German subsidiary decided on Wednesday to pull out of Super].
'We're all standing here in tears,' a senior manager of the paper's 180
staff said.
The newspaper, whose sex and crime formula competed directly against the
Bild tabloid owned Axel Springer, had been making heavy losses, she said.
Super] sold 375,000 in eastern Germany, well below the 490,000 achieved by
Bild. Mr Burda said he did not want to run the loss-making business by
himself.

LEADERS from Spain, Portugal and Latin America closed the working sessions
of their summit in Madrid yesterday, expressing concern that failure of the
Uruguay round of trade negotiations would jeopardise economic reforms of
recent years.
The second day of the summit - the second held by the leaders of the Spanish
and Portuguese speaking countries of Latin America and the Iberian Peninsula
 -was taken up by economic issues. The leaders were expected to reaffirm the
importance of their economic reforms, but also expressed a preoccupation
with protectionist trends. Many countries in Latin America have unilaterally
lowered trade barriers, but meet frustration in selling products to
industrialised countries, including the EC.
Seventeen Latin leaders including Cuba's Fidel Castro attended the summit,
which was expected to back a declaration underlining the importance of
'representative democracy' and respect for human rights. Despite openly
expressed pressure on Mr Castro to reform his political system, the Cuban
leader was apparently unrepentant.
He used his speech to the opening session for an attack on the US, accusing
it of trying to govern the planet and through its 'blockade' of Cuba of
'genocide'.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Inflation slows in key German states
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EXPECTED sharp fall in west German inflation this month has been
confirmed, with latest figures showing a one percentage point drop in the
rate of price increases in three important states.
Figures released yesterday showed year-on-year inflation was only 2.7 per
cent in Hesse and 3.2 per cent in Baden-Wurttemberg. North Rhine-Westphalia,
the most populous state, reported a 3.2 per cent rise on Thursday.
The news, while received calmly in the markets, prompted an extraordinary
double-take in the finance ministry. A press release quoting Mr Theo Waigel,
finance minister, as saying that the fall below 4 per cent 'supports the
possibility that the Bundesbank will relax monetary policy in the
foreseeable future' was later withdrawn.
The finance ministry blamed a 'technical mistake'; the statement had not
been cleared by Mr Waigel, it said. 'The Bundesbank had nothing at all to do
with it,' a spokesman claimed.
Although welcome, the slowdown was almost wholly attributable to a technical
adjustment as increases in petrol duties and telephone charges introduced in
June last year dropped out of the year-on-year calculations.
While aggregate inflation for west Germany will not be officially published
for a week or more, the latest figures confirm the widely forecast cut. But
underlying influences are still not easing. The federal statistics office
said the rate of increase in producer prices was 2 per cent in July,
compared with the same figure in June and 1.9 per cent in May.
Above-average rises for heavy heating oil, up 5.7 per cent, and butter, up
6.9 per cent, cancelled out reduced costs for steel and plastics.
The Bundesbank, which allows no interference from Bonn in its monetary
policy-making, last week raised its discount rate from 8 per cent to 8.75
per cent in pursuit of its twin aims of lower inflation and tighter money
supply.
The move, unpopular with government ministers who are under pressure from
their international colleagues because of high German interest rates, was
made in the knowledge that inflation would fall this month.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's annual report
on Germany had earlier said the Bundesbank should keep rates high for as
long as necessary to squeeze inflation out of the economy. It suggested a
target of 2 per cent a year or less.
Although inflationary pressure is expected to remain muted for the rest of
this year, there is some concern that a burst of consumer spending, prompted
by cancellation of a 7.5 per cent income tax surcharge at the end of June,
may tempt manufacturers and retailers to pass on pent-up cost increases.
The results of this year's average 5.8 per cent wage awards are already
showing through in above average inflation in service industries. The
housing shortage is pushing up rents rapidly.
A 0.5 per cent increase in inflation is already programmed for January as a
result of an increase in value added tax from 14 per cent to 15 per cent.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Russians offer deep nuclear arms cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER cuts in strategic nuclear missiles are possible beyond those already
agreed between the US and Russia, but future negotiations must include the
UK, France and China, General Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence minister,
said yesterday.
Gen Grachev was speaking at the Royal United Services Institute at the end
of a four-day visit to London. He said Russian scientists had estimated that
further reductions below the 3,000-3,500 on each side agreed between the US
and Russia this year were possible, on condition that the anti-ballistic
missile treaty of 1972, which laid down strict guidelines on the deployment
of defences against offensive nuclear missiles, was observed.
If such cuts were to become a reality, however, Gen Grachev said weapons
outside the US and Russia, would have to be considered.
'In our view, subsequent reduction of strategic offensive weapons should be
considered as a multilateral process, and should consider the
inter-relationship between cuts already made by the US and Russia, and
weapons in Great Britain, France and China,' he said.
Without the participation of these countries, Gen Grachev suggested,
'further reduction of nuclear weapons will become a destabilising factor not
only for Russia, but for the whole world.'
Gen Grachev said that Russia, which decided in May to set up its own
national armed forces, no longer regarded any state in the world as its
enemy. It believed that world peace should be preserved on the basis of a
balance of mutual interest, rather than a balance of force, and was
'definitely against war as a means of reaching political and economic
agreements.'
Russia, however, was still committed to defending its independence and
integrity, and would maintain its military strength at a level that ensured
deterrence against any potential aggressor.
He said that while the cold war was over, the threat of small, local
conflicts had increased, especially in eastern Europe.
Gen Grachev warned of leaders in other former Soviet republics who were
'playing the nationalist card, sometimes counter to the interests of their
people.'
Russia has agreed to become a founding member of a consortium to build a
pipeline to transport oil from the Caspian sea region to world markets,
joining Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, and the Sultanate of Oman. Oman will arrange
financing for the project, expected to cost between Dollars 700m and Pounds
1.5bn depending on choice of routes, with Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, and Russia
contributing labour, materials, equipment, and rights of way. The pipeline
will be an important link between western markets and Kazakhstan, which
recently signed a deal with Chevron, the US oil company, to develop the
giant Tengiz oilfield.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Thousands turn out for funeral of anti-Mafia judge in
Palermo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some 8,000 Sicilians who turned out to mourn leading anti-Mafia judge Paolo
Borsellino in Palermo yesterday clapped the cortege and hurled insults at
Italy's police chief, Reuter reports. Judge Borsellino was killed by a car
bomb with five bodyguards last Sunday. Police said they had charged a
private security guard with aiding crime. He was alleged to have refused to
testify although he was present when the bomb went off.
The Italian government yesterday used a confidence vote to push a tough
anti-Mafia package through the Senate, parliament's upper house.
The Senate approved stiff new laws against organised crime by 163 votes to
106. The legislation now goes to the Chamber of Deputies.
A new anti-Mafia chief prosecutor and other investigators will have wider,
streamlined powers to fight gangsters, including the use of undercover
'sting' operations, wiretaps and infiltrators. The package also gives police
the power to carry out searches without warrants, a measure previously
adopted in the fight against terrorism of the 1970s and 1980s.
Security was strict at yesterday's funeral. Several hundred police and
paramilitary police lined crash barriers outside the church, and
sharpshooters manned the tops of nearby blocks of flats.
Police had warned that both Mr Borsellino and a judge investigating the
corruption scandal in Milan were on the Mafia's death-list, newspapers
reported yesterday. A report by paramilitary police, dated three days before
Mr Borsellino's murder, warned that organised crime was preparing to kill
both him and Milan judge Antonio Di Pietro.

FT  25 JUL 92 / US orders for durable goods rise in June
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US DURABLE goods orders rose by 2.3 per cent in June, reversing the 2.2 per
cent decline of the previous month and underlining the bumpy course on which
the economy is now set.
The monthly increase exceeded market expectations and suggests that the July
industrial production figures will improve on last month's 0.3 per cent
drop.
Most industrial sectors shared in the increase, though transportation
orders, which had fallen steeply in May, went up by less than most.
Yesterday's report adds some substance to the more optimistic mid-year White
House economic forecasts published on Thursday afternoon. These project real
annual growth of 2.7 per cent this year, up from the 2.2 per cent estimate
of January, with unemployment dropping to an average 6.9 per cent in the
fourth quarter from the 7.8 per cent recorded in June.
While these figures are pretty much in the range of many private analysts'
projections, accompanying comments by administration officials were
criticised for their overtly political content.
Both Mr Nicholas Brady, treasury secretary, and Mr Richard Darman, budget
director, claimed that if Congress had passed the president's economic
proposals the economy would not be in its present problematic state. Senator
James Sasser, the Democrat from Tennessee, promptly recalled the
presidential veto of an economic recovery bill which contained tax
increases.
Some more doctrinaire Republican conservatives, led by Mr Jack Kemp, housing
secretary, are urging President George Bush to 'reinvigorate' his economic
proposals by calling for even steeper tax cuts, including a 50 per cent
reduction in capital gains taxes. They want their blueprint included in the
Republican party election platform, to be decided next month.
Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, told Congress this week the
economy should gain momentum soon, but that unemployment was likely to
remain above 7 per cent for the rest of this year.

FT  25 JUL 92 / Japanese group may sue over County Hall delay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE JAPANESE company bidding to develop London's County Hall is considering
suing the government over what it claims are losses it has incurred while
waiting for confirmation of its plans for the landmark site.
The Osaka-based Shirayama Corporation is furious at the government's
continued failure to rule out a rival bid from the London School of
Economics.
Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, decided earlier this week to
allow the London School of Economics to submit a formal bid to move to
County Hall, opposite the Houses of Parliament on the south bank of the
river Thames, in spite of the government's agreement with Shirayama for a
hotel complex on the site.
The LSE, which is based in cramped premises off Aldwych, has been given
until the end of the month to submit a fully-costed scheme, after which Mr
Howard will take a final decision. The existing sale contract, agreed by Mr
Michael Heseltine, environment secretary until the election, gives the
government until the end of the year to withdraw from the scheme.
Mr John Ashworth, director of the LSE, said a formal bid 'would be
forthcoming'. Since it is unlikely to match the Shirayama bid - believed to
be between Pounds 50m and Pounds 60m net - much will depend on the balance
of ministerial forces in its support.
Earlier this month Mr Makoto Toyota, Shirayama's London agent, said he was
'sick to death' at the continued uncertainty and 'desperate' for an early
decision.
Matters came to a head when Mr Takisha Shirayama met Mr Howard this week, to
be told the government had still not made a definite decision on the sale of
the building, which is owned by the London Residuary Body on behalf of the
London boroughs.
According to the Environment Department, Mr Howard has since written to Mr
Shirayama saying that he 'understood the concerns that were expressed and
recognised the need to settle the uncertainty as soon as possible'.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Germany 'should consider effects of interest rate rise': The
warning highlights French sensitivities in the run-up to the Maastricht
referendum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY should consider its neighbours' monetary problems when setting
interest rates, Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, said
yesterday. However, he thought the markets had overreacted to last week's
rise in the Bundesbank's discount rate.
His warning, which highlights French sensitivities in the run-up to the
September 20 referendum on the Maastricht treaty, came during a regular
meeting with Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, which was also
attended by the presidents of the two countries' central banks.
France must 'understand what is at stake in German unification and its
economic consequences and it is absolutely necessary that the German
authorities also keep in mind the external consequences of of their
decisions on internal matters,' said Mr Sapin.
'We must understand the problems of German and Germany must understand the
problems of France,' he said.
The French government fully understood that the Bundesbank had done its best
to restrict the impact of its monetary tightening to Germany, by choosing to
raise the discount rate - which only affects a limited amount of commercial
bank borrowings from the central bank - rather than a more important
official rate.
'I would have liked things to be understood this way by all the markets,
which have shown a disproportionate anxiety over the sense of the decision,'
said Mr Sapin. The German rate rise was followed by a renewed fall in the
dollar's value and in equity prices across Europe. However, Mr Sapin
believed that Monday's intervention by the leading central banks to support
the dollar was well timed and co-ordinated.
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank's president, accepted that France
already had high real interest rates, but stressed that German monetary
stability was important to the world economy. The Bundesbank would watch the
progress of German money supply and 'draw the conclusions at the appropriate
moment,' said Mr Schlesinger.

GERMAN border police said yesterday that crime was soaring on the country's

exploited the lack of border controls, Reuter reports from Dresden.
German border police caught 17,800 people trying to cross from Poland and
Czechoslovakia in the first six months of this year compared with 16,319 for
the whole of 1991. 'The number coming across has risen dramatically. It's
doubled or even trebled,' said Mr Fredi Hitz, a senior officer in Germany's
paramilitary border police.
Gangs smuggling in east Europeans were asking for up to Dollars 1,000 to
take Romanians across the border. Car thieves have stolen some 80,000
vehicles from Germany and taken them into Poland and Czechoslovakia.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CZECH and Slovak leaders will begin drafting a law on the break-up of
Czechoslovakia, after agreeing the formal abolition of the 74-year-old state
early yesterday.
Meeting for the fifth time since June's elections, Mr Vaclav Klaus, the
Czech prime minister, and Mr Vladimir Meciar, his Slovak counterpart, agreed
to propose to the federal parliament by September 30 'a law on the
federation's abolition and on settling the property and other related
issues.'
The draft law will offer several alternatives for deciding the country's
break-up. These would include an agreement between the two republics'
parliaments, a declaration by the federal assembly or a referendum.
It will offer more flexibility than the current federal constitution, which
allows a divorce between the two republics to be decided only by a
referendum.
Yesterday's agreement emphasised the intention of both sides to ensure a
constitutional and orderly break-up of the country. But unilateral steps,
such as the adoption of a Slovak constitution planned for late August, could
bring a de facto end to the federation sooner than expected.
Czech and Slovak leaders will remain faced with the difficult task of
dividing the assets and liabilities of the federation. Speaking to bankers
in London this week, Mr Vladimir Dlouhy, the Czech Industry Minister, said
the Czech republic would be ready to assume the federation's entire Dollars
9.3bn foreign debt.
According to Mr Klaus, yesterday's negotiations also focused on the
possibility of creating a customs union between the two republics based on
free flow of capital, labour and goods. But no agreement was reached on the
controversial issue of whether a common currency should be maintained.
'We were not able to come to any final solution .. It will be subject to
further study and discussion,' Mr Klaus said.
According to an earlier post-electoral agreement, the two republics will
have separate budgets from next January.
Slovakia hopes to pass a full constitution in August. The Czech republic
will follow suit and prepare its own, Mr Klaus said on Wednesday.

<TEXT>
THE French government yesterday unveiled a FFr25m (Pounds 2.56m) advertising
campaign to persuade the French people to vote in favour of the Maastrict
treaty on European union in the forthcoming national referendum.
The campaign, which kicks off on Monday under the slogan 'L'Europe est
adulte. Donnons-lui sa majorite' ('Europe has grown up. Give it a majority')
is by far the most ambitious promotional programme undertaken by any
government so far in the Maastricht debate.
It will include five television commercials, each featuring a series of
commentators speaking in favour of European union, radio advertising and
posters placed on 6,814 billboards across France. Full page advertisements
will be placed in 75 French daily papers next Wednesay.
The campaign has been co-ordinated by Mr Jacques Seguela, director of the
Roux-Seguela-Cayzac et Goudard advertising agency in Paris and a close
associate of President Francois Mitterrand.
Mr Seguela has orchestrated marketing campaigns for both the Socialist party
and the president in recent elections.
A 'yes' vote in the Maastricht referendum, which takes place on September
20, is seen as critical to the credibility of the socialists in the approach
to next year's National Assembly elections.

FT  24 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: BAe hit by share placing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, COLIN MILLHAM, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PLACING of a large line of stock in British Aerospace sent the shares
tumbling to a five-year low, making BAe one of the day's worst performing
stocks in the FT-SE list in percentage terms.
At the day's low, the shares were down 21 at 188p as dealers reacted to a
placing by securities house SG Warburg of a block of 5.5m early in the
session at 185p a share. Later, bargain hunters helped the stock to end a
net 10 down at 199p, on hefty turnover of 15m.
The sale of the block of BAe shares at well below the market price inspired
a renewed spate of negative stories regarding the woes of one of the UK's
leading manufacturing companies, and in particular over the company's cash
position.
Reuters crumbles
Dealers were surprised by the speed of a fresh fall in Reuters shares. The
stock was under no pressure at the outset yesterday but plunged in
mid-morning when a block of 400,000 shares was said to have been offered
around the market by one leading securities house, with no takers. Other
marketmakers responded by chopping their quotations.
By the close the shares had weakened 60 to 1030p after relatively keen
turnover of 1.8m. So far this week the stock has fallen by 134p.
The shares have been under sustained selling pressure all week following the
interim profits statement which was accompanied by a cautious comment on
revenue outlook. A presentation to analysts in New York on Wednesday evening
was believed to have gone well, however.
Boots optimism
An optimistic trading statement from Boots took the market by surprise, the
shares jumping 19 to 447p in heavy turnover of 4.4m. Chairman Sir
Christopher Benson told the annual meeting 'we are bucking the trend', and
disclosed that group sales were up 10.8 per cent in the first quarter.
Analysts suggested that sales growth of 7 or 8 per cent would have been more
than acceptable and that these figures are exceptionally good. Mr Ian
Macdougall, at Nomura Research, said this shows that in spite of a depressed
retail background it is still possible to do well, but he warned against
using Boots as a guide for the whole sector.
Nomura, which admits to being towards the bottom of market forecasts on
Boots, lifted its profits forecast for 1992/93 to Pounds 410m from Pounds
395m.
Amstrad shock
Recent worries about trading at Amstrad proved well-founded as the group
disclosed that losses in the year to end-June will be approximately Pounds
25m higher than it had previously expected.
The news saw Amstrad shares drop to 24p before late support left them only a
net penny down at 29p. The rally came when the market decided that the group
was likely to maintain the dividend in view of its Pounds 100m cash holding.
Turnover was a heavy 26m, with one leading agency broker said to have been
offering a sizeable block of shares during the afternoon. Two blocks of 5m
and another of 1.5m were traded at 26 1/2 p late in the day.
The stakebuilding story in Mirror Group Newspapers continued, with the
shares pushed 3 3/4 higher to 69p on turnover of 6.2m. Since the MGN
relisting last Friday some 54.8m of the shares have changed hands.
Dealers said it was entirely feasible that a stakebuilder could have
acquired a near 3 per cent holding, or around 14m shares, but that any stake
in excess of 3 per cent would have to be revealed by today.
Dealers in Lucas Industries quickly moved to sell the shares after what
appeared to be a severe downgrade from Midlands-based broker Albert E.
Sharp, making the stock the day's worst market performer in percentage
terms.
The shares fell 7 to 102p, after traders at first failed to take note of a
Pounds 90m pension fund refund, thus mistaking a Pounds 10m current-year
profits downgrade to Pounds 15m from the broker as a much bigger cut.
Sentiment was further weakened by a lowering of estimates from UBS Phillips
&amp; Drew, which is predicting that the company will make no profits this year,
and from Strauss Turnbull, which is forecasting an underlying loss.
Spring Ram dropped to 122p before stabilising and closing 7 down at 126p
after an agency cross of some 3.9m shares at 122p, thought to have been
carried out by the group's own broker, Panmure Gordon.
A big agency cross of some 5m shares at 330p was partly responsible for
turnover of 17m in HSBC, which ended 2 1/2 off at 335p.
The banks sector provided two exceptionally strong performers in Barclays
and Lloyds, both of which were given a strong push by the banks team at
Robert Fleming Securities. The broker issued buy notes on both stocks. On
Barclays, Fleming said the shares were 'oversold', that the bank's
underlying profits growth before bad debts this year 'would be the best of
the major UK banks', and that a dividend cut at the interim and final stages
is 'unlikely and unnecessary'. Barclays closed 14 higher at 314p and Lloyds
12 better at 421p.
BP delivered the outstanding performance in a mixed oil sector, advancing 5
to 207p on notably high turnover of 16m. Specialists said the stock was
boosted by a mixture of switching from Shell and straight buying from
overseas.
The closure of the tender offer in Wellcome shares today was enlivened by a
statement from the company that it would not sell any shares below Pounds 8
and that it was willing to reduce the amount of shares on offer - initially
330m - in order to create a healthy after-market. Wellcome firmed a penny to
830p.
Lloyds Chemists surged ahead 36 to 235p on turnover of 2.4m shares, helped
by good news from Boots and by a reassuring statement from Mr Allen Lloyd,
the chairman and chief executive.
New shares in Taunton Cider closed 13 above the offer price, at 153p.
In spite of pleading strong attendances, Euro Disney said high costs would
push it into the red for the first quarter to September 1992. The news left
the shares 8 off at 1015p, their lowest since January last year.

FT  24 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Cautious rally helped by retail
sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GLOOM lifted a little on the UK stock market yesterday as faint glimmers
of economic recovery at home were accompanied by a steadier tone in sterling
and in the other European stock markets. However, a gain of 11.6 still left
the FT-SE Index just short of the 2,400 mark and strategists were wary of
identifying any change in the generally negative trend of the market.
The Footsie closed at 2,399.5, the best of the day, and Seaq trading volume
increased to 512.9m shares from the 428.1m of the previous session. The
stock market was relieved that the changes in UK government spending
policies, hinted at in the City of London on the previous day, proved less
immediately threatening to public investment than feared.
Building and construction shares, most at risk from cuts in public spending,
had a calmer session.
More positive for investors was the view expressed by the British Chambers
of Commerce that the domestic economy was staging a fragile recovery.
Equities were slow to respond, however, until shareholders at the annual
meeting of Boots, the high street retailer and drugs group, were told that
sales were 10.8 per cent up in the first quarter of the year. 'Bucking the
trend,' was the view from the boardroom but equity traders took the
statement more favourably.
Nevertheless, in spite of a modest improvement in sterling, the
international scene continued to provide uncertainties for London, which was
unsettled by an increase in a key Spanish interest rate.
Confidence was also restrained by a sharp fall in British Aerospace as a
large block of stock was placed in the market. The Footsie also suffered the
effects of a heavy setback in Reuters as the weight of analysts' opinion
came down increasingly on a negative view of this week's trading statement.
But the bears - traders who sold stock last week when the Footsie was around
3.4 per cent higher than at present and must meet commitments before the
equity account closes tonight - were buyers yesterday. With the September
future contract on the Footsie edging above 2,400, the underlying equity
market staged a technical rally in the second half of the session.
Dealers doubted if yesterday's retail business would be worth much more than
the Pounds 715.9m of the previous session; retail business has for some
weeks now remained below the Pounds 1bn mark regarded as the indication of a
seriously traded equity market. For UK securities houses, the problems of
low turnover are now compounded by serious losses in several leading Footsie
stocks.
The good news from Boots brought a general improvement in store and retail
issues. Banking stocks also looked very firm but this largely reflected a
recommendation from a UK brokerage house.
Heavyweight manufacturing shares remained uninspired. Wellcome edged forward
to 830p as the market awaited the outcome today of the share tender
operation. The rest of the pharmaceutical sector, which has attracted
investors over the past fortnight, gave ground and closed quietly.

FT  24 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG squeeze towards the close of yesterday's session helped the
September FT-SE contract regain some of its recent losses in an otherwise
uneventful day in stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo.
The first trade in the contract was struck at 2,405, which led some dealers
to hope for a firm session. However, with both independent traders and large
institutions choosing to remain on the sidelines, the September contract
soon drifted lower.
Sporadic mid-morning buying led to a brief rally, but this petered out after
the few orders were filled and the contract returned to its downward
direction, reaching the day's low of 2,382 just after lunch.
Bargain hunting, together with a good initial performance on Wall Street,
saw a reversal in the fortunes of the contract which gathered momentum in
the last hour of trading, leading to a squeeze and a strong final burst.
September closed at 2,422, up 21 from its previous close and around 6 points
ahead of its fair value premium to cash of about 18. Turnover returned to a
modest 7,588 lots.
Dealers reported a dull session in traded options. Turnover totalled 29,118
contracts, of which the FT-SE option accounted for 10,581 lots. BP was the
most actively dealt stock option with a day's total of 2,108 contracts.

FT  24 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Domestic woes offset by fall
in bond yields
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices ended slightly higher yesterday after a sharp fall in
long-term bond yields helped to offset an unexpectedly large rise in weekly
unemployment insurance claims and worries about the political outlook,
writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 12.43 firmer at 3,290.04. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 1.15 to 412.08, while the Nasdaq composite
improved 1.36 to 565.24. Turnover on the New York SE amounted to 181m
shares.
The announcement from the Labor department of a 19,000 rise in state
unemployment insurance claims during the week ending July 11 was an early
blow to sentiment as the market had been anticipating only a small increase
in claims.
Rumours that Mr Dan Quayle, the vice-president, may be replaced to boost
President George Bush's re-election chances heightened political
uncertainties and added to the market's gloom. However, a fall in long-term
bond yields, prompted by the jobless claims data and talk of the Treasury
reducing the size of its bond issues, provided support for stocks later in
the day.
Salomon climbed more than Dollars 1 in early trading before finishing a net
Dollars  3/4 up at Dollars 36 3/8 , after the securities group reported
strong second quarter profits in spite of a Dollars 185m charge taken to
cover some of the costs relating to the settlement of last year's bond
trading scandal and any subsequent lawsuits.
Delta fell Dollars 1 1/4 in the morning after the airline reported a Dollars
180.2m loss for the second quarter, compared to the modest profit earned in
the year-ago period. But buyers soon flocked to the stock, which ended down
just Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 53 1/4 .
Airline earnings this past quarter have been hit hard by the recent price
war among domestic carriers. Other big airline stocks were also easier.
Walt Disney eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 35 1/2 in spite of a solid rise in
fiscal third quarter earnings to 41 cents a share. The company warned,
however, that its recently opened Euro Disney unit in France would post a
loss for this year.
On the Nasdaq market, Au Bon Pain fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 14 1/2 after
Morgan Stanley dropped the franchise bakery and cafe group's stock from its
emerging growth focus list.
Canada
TORONTO shares closed steady in moderate trading. The TSE 300 index rose
only 0.14 to 3,412.2, while declines led advances by 268 to 251.
Volume of 34.1m was bloated by 9.2m Torstar 'B' shares, sold by an
underwriting group which had purchased them from Southam Inc.

FT  24 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets: Analysts despair as Milan falls further
 -Recent events have dented the Italian market's fragile credibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian equity analyst, one of the more exotic species prowling in the
world's financial jungle, is threatened with extinction following the recent
collapse in share prices on the Milan stock exchange.
Observers had already spotted the danger signs late last year as trading
volumes dwindled in spite of the implementation of long-awaited market
reforms. However, the predicament of the well-groomed, Bocconi-educated
analysts has become acute following the killing of a leading anti-Mafia
judge last weekend and the government's inept handling of the liquidation of
Efim, one of the country's three state holding companies.
Both events severely dented Italy's fragile international credibility and
prompted long-suffering domestic and foreign investors to dump what was left
of their Italian equity holdings. The reasoning behind their decision is
compelling, and not even the most bullish broker can find something positive
to say about the Milan stock market. Indeed, most analysts believe that the
outlook will get worse before it improves.
Political uncertainty hangs over the bourse in spite of the determination of
the new government, led by Mr Giuliano Amato, to tackle structural ills,
such as the public sector deficit, and its decision to speed up the
privatisation of state companies. But, with around 500 parliamentary
amendments to its mini-budget plan alone ahead of this week's parliamentary
debates, the coalition, based on a slim majority, has yet to prove that it
can deliver.
While many of Mr Amato's ideas are laudable, dealers fear that putting them
into practice could expose his government's Achilles heel. That would be
particularly damaging in the case of privatisation. Mr Amato's concept of
forming two 'super-holdings' under the Treasury to take charge of many
public sector assets had been criticised as woolly and bureaucratic, which
explains the revision yesterday in favour of a simpler structure.
Uncertainty about the fate of the Iri and Eni holding companies could cast a
shadow over existing privatisation plans. The flotation of Iri's
Finmeccanica subsidiary and Eni's Agip and Snam operations are still on
course but their success could well be soured by investors' hostility
towards Italian equities.
The impact of the Bank of Italy's decision to raise the discount rate twice
this month, to 13.75 per cent, was imm-ediately felt on equities. Meanwhile,
rates for secur-ities repurchase agreements reached a record 17.56 per cent
on Wednesday, against 16.02 per cent at Friday's previous tender. With the
Bundesbank showing no sign of relaxing its monetary rigour, Italian rates
look set to rise further.
Intervention by the central bank and rate rises have relaxed the pressure on
the lira and rumours of an imminent lira devaluation have eased. However,
the chances remain of a depreciation from a position of greater stability,
perhaps once the 1993 budget has been passed by end-September, limiting the
appeal of equities to non-lira investors.
The prospects for corporate profits are poor. The recent collapse of share
prices could be seen as an opportunity to pick up bargains, but the general
outlook for earnings in 1992 and 1993 is bleak.
Mr Roberto Condulmari of Gemina-Credit Lyonnais Sim predicts an average 8
per cent fall in quoted companies' net profits this year. That could be a
conservative estimate if the government stamps on consumer demand in its
attempt to cut the deficit. So the flickering signs of economic recovery may
die out. Virtually the only good piece of economic news came yesterday with
the report that inflation remained steady last month at 5.5 per cent.
Corporate profits will also be eroded by rising interest rates. The higher
cost of credit has weighed on the corporate sector, and penalised highly
geared groups, Ferruzzi-Montedison in particular.
Banking and construction shares have also been savaged. Concerns about
credit quality have been heightened by the likely economic slowdown, while
problems in the bond market could lead to write-downs and lower securities
trading profits for the banks. The construction and cement sectors are in
the doldrums in view of the likely slump in orders from a public sector
chastened by recent corruption scandals.
Meanwhile, Italian equity analysts in Milan and London are desperately
trying to justify their existence. 'We are developing a series of worst-case
scenarios to examine the possible effects of a variety of government
decisions, like tariff freezes, on company profits,' says one. 'Are you free
for lunch?'

FT  24 JUL 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar down on policy unease
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR drifted lower on the foreign exchanges yesterday as dealers
started to think that central banks in the US and Europe might not be ready
to intervene again to keep the currency above its all-time low, writes James
Blitz.
Monday's concerted central bank intervention took the dollar up to a high of
DM1.5020 the following day. But, since then, its effects have started to
wear off and the US currency was yesterday testing a low on the day of
DM1.4810.
There is still no clear indication as to whether the central banks have a
policy on the dollar. Yesterday, Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance
minister, said Monday's intervention had been well-timed and highly
successful. But dealers may have been affected by a comment from Mr Alan
Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, at a biannual testimonial on
Wednesday that the Fed has no firm target for the dollar's exchange rate.
This underlines suggestions made by some analysts that the intervention was
prompted by the British, French and Italian central banks, rather than the
US. 'The Europeans had so much more to gain from the move than the US,' said
one analyst yesterday.
Another indicator suggesting that the US economy is in sluggish shape did
not help sentiment: the latest weekly survey of US jobless claims rose by
19,000. The dollar ended the day  1/2 pfennig down from its previous close,
at DM1.4830. In New York the US unit ended a shade lower at DM1.4820.
Sterling closed firmer against the D-Mark for the first time this week,
finishing  1/2 pfennig up at DM2.8375. However, sentiment towards the pound
was still bearish.
The most serious factor affecting the currency yesterday was the Bank of
Spain's decision to raise interest rates by 60 basis points to 13 per cent.
The move puts more pressure on the UK to tighten monetary policy in order to
remain within its permitted limits against the D-Mark in the European
Monetary System.
The decision by Mr John Major's government to tighten controls on public
spending did not seem a factor in the pound's rise. 'It may have helped a
little,' said one dealer. 'But the view in the market is that this
government has talked tough on monetary policy before without doing
anything, and this may be more of the same.'
Nevertheless, sterling's performance was not matched by other currencies.
The Italian lira softened to L758.6 per D-Mark from a previous close in
London of L758.2. The French franc firmed slightly against the German unit
to FFr3.377 from Wednesday's FFr3.378 finish. Only the Spanish peseta showed
a notable rise, finishing at Pta63.78 to the D-Mark, after a previous
Pta64.10.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Money Markets: No joy in sterling
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POUND may have firmed slightly on the foreign exchanges yesterday, but
sentiment in the sterling money markets remained decidedly bearish.
In the morning, dealers had been nervously expecting sterling to dip below
DM2.83, increasing the chances of another base rate rise to halt the
currency's fall. There was relief to see it peak at DM2.8413 in the
mid-morning, but one dealer put this down to technical factors. 'The Forex
market was caught short of sterling and there was a technical move to get
back into the currency,' he said.
The underlying trend is still gloomy, and many believe that a drop down to
DM2.82 is on the cards. Yesterday's decision by the Bank of Spain to lift
its key interest rate by 60 basis points added to the pressure on the Bank
of England to tighten policy. Dealers did not feel that the UK's decision to
tighten controls on government spending had much impact. 'It is a bit of
good housekeeping and little more,' said one dealer. 'They are not cutting
expenditure, just ensuring that they stay within this year's targets.'
Period rates therefore ended the day a little firmer. One-month money closed
unchanged at 10 3/16 per cent offered. But everything from 3-month money to
1-year rose to 10 3/8 from 10 5/16 per cent.
Trading in sterling futures was a little more bullish than in the cash. But
this was because futures traders took sterling's rise at face value, without
looking at the underlying factors. In the morning the September short
sterling contract dipped six basis points to 89.63 because of currency
fears. But as these evaporated for the day, it shot up to finish at 89.72.
The December contract fell before closing 4 basis points down on the day at
89.96.
The Bank of England forecast another surprisingly low shortage of Pounds
500m in the morning but the market was slow to take it out. The shortages
this week have so far amounted to only Pounds 2.8bn. At the start of the
week, it had looked as though they might amount to Pounds 4.5bn, so a tough
finish may be in store today.
The Bank did not operate in the morning. In the afternoon it purchased
Pounds 144m of Band 1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent and gave late assistance
of Pounds 70m.

FT  24 JUL 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries surge as unemployment figures
surprise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury prices jumped sharply at the long end of the market in the wake
of a bigger-than-expected rise in weekly jobless claims and comments from
the Treasury hinting that it may cut back on long bond issues.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  31/32 at 105
7/8 , yielding 7.531 per cent. The two-year note was also firmer, up  3/32
at 101 1/2 , yielding 4.166 per cent.
The early buying was sparked by the Labor Department's announcement that
weekly claims for state unemployment insurance had risen by 19,000 in the
week ending July 11, more than double what analysts had been expecting.
Continued weakness in the labour market, allied to later comments from Mr
Nicholas Brady, the Treasury secretary, suggesting that the Treasury is
looking at curtailing its sales of 30-year bonds in an attempt to bring
long-term rates lower, prompted a rush of demand for longer-dated securities
from retail and speculative players in the market.
SPANISH government bond yields climbed yesterday after the Bank of Spain
raised its key intervention rate from 12.4 per cent to 13 per cent.
The financial markets had been expecting a rise in rates after the
government announced a tough package of fiscal restrictions on Tuesday, but
the increase in the intervention rate was bigger than expected.
Bond yields rose during the day, with the 10-year benchmark bond yielding
12.39 per cent gross, against Wednesday's close of 12.3 per cent.
THE announcement of lower-than-expected inflation in North Rhine-Westfalia
boosted German government bond prices and sparked fresh buying of bunds by
investors.
Consumer prices were unchanged in the month to mid-July, and were 3.3 per
cent higher year-on-year. By comparison, the year-on-year inflation rate in
June was 4.3 per cent.
The Liffe bund futures contract rose from its opening of 87.25 to 87.36 by
late afternoon.
UK government bonds ended slightly weaker, shrugging off yesterday's rise in
Spanish interest rates.
Dealers said the gilt market remained well-supported, with investors
concentrating on the weakness in the UK economy and the fall in inflation.
'News that the government plans to tighten control of public spending helped
to reassure gilts early in the day,' said one dealer, although gilts later
slipped back following some of the European bond markets.
The Liffe gilt futures contract opened at 98.28 and traded at 98.20 by late
afternoon. In the cash market, the 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 slipped
from 116 15/16 to 116 27/32 . The recent auction stock, the 9 per cent gilt
due 2012, slipped from 101 13/32 to 101 3/8 .
JAPANESE government bonds closed higher on expectations of an imminent cut
in the official discount rate, and helped by a fall in short-term interest
rates.
News that top government officials will meet today to discuss measures to
support the weak stock market fuelled speculation that the Bank of Japan may
soon cut the official discount rate (ODR), currently at 3.75 per cent.
The plummeting Nikkei stock index recently reached its lowest level in six
years, touching the 15,333 mark. Bond analysts expect the central bank to
lower the ODR by up to three-quarters of a percentage point in order to help
shore up the troubled equity market.
The yield on the benchmark No 129 JGB opened at 5.055 per cent and moved to
4.99 per cent, corresponding to the highest price for the bond since
February 1989. The bond's yield closed at 5.0 per cent.
Dealers said the fall in the rate on three-month certificates of deposit,
from 4.36 per cent to 4.32 per cent, encouraged domestic buying interest.

DELTA Air Lines, one of the three big US carriers, yesterday underlined the
damage done to the industry's profitability by recent domestic 'fare wars',
when it reported a net loss of Dollars 180.2m for the three months to
end-June.
The deficit compares with a small Dollars 19.2m profit in the same period a
year earlier. At the operating level, the loss was even more pronounced -
Dollars 265.4m, against a Dollars 50.6m surplus in 1991. The quarter is the
last in Delta's financial year, and yesterday's results mean the airline is
now posting an after-tax deficit of Dollars 506.3m for the full year,
against a Dollars 324.4m loss in 1990/91.
To help redress the situation, Delta plans to cut staffing by 5 per cent -
it currently employs around 80,000 - in 1992, and convert an unspecified
number of full-time positions to part-time status. The airline hoped to
achieve the job cuts by attrition and the loss of temporary staff.
It has already announced a Dollars 5bn cutback in planned capital
expenditures over the next nine years, and other operational changes,
including more use of seasonal flights, contract services, and new software
systems, are also likely.
In total, the airline estimates its financial results should benefit by
around Dollars 375m in the new financial year, started on July 1. This
annual benefit should increase to Dollars 700m by 1995, it said.
Delta shares lost  3/4 at Dollars 52 3/4 .
Like USAir, which also reported yesterday, Delta blamed the fourth-quarter
loss on the US industry's 'competitive struggle, largely characterised by
numerous deep-discount fare promotions'.
'While costs are rising, the average revenue per passenger mile in both
domestic and international markets continues to be held down by uneconomic
fare programmes,' said Mr Thomas Roeck, Delta's finance director.
The fourth-quarter operating loss was scored on revenues of Dollars 2.83bn
against Dollars 2.52bn last time. Operating expenses rose from Dollars
2.47bn to Dollars 3.09bn. Delta's load factor, year-on-year, slipped from
62.47 per cent to 60.2 per cent, while the passenger mile yield fell from
13.75 cents to 13.2 cents.

FT  24 JUL 92 / International Company News: Buffett buys 15% of US group

GENERAL Dynamics, the US defence group which is slimming, received a
powerful endorsement of its strategy when Berkshire Hathaway, the investment
group led by Mr Warren Buffett, announced the acquisition of a 15 per cent
stake in the business, writes Martin Dickson.
Mr Buffett is one of the most highly-regarded investors in the US and tends
to take large stakes in companies for the long term.
His acquisition of 4.35m shares in General Dynamics will have cost about
Dollars 300m.
General Dynamics recently carried out a Dutch auction tender offer to buy
back 13.2m of its shares at a price of Dollars 72.25 a share. It is
committed to return to investors much of the excess cash the business is
throwing off.
Members and trusts of Chicago's Crown and Goodman families reduced their
stake is from 22 per cent to about 14.4 per cent under the Dutch auction.

CAROLCO, the embattled Hollywood studio whose hit films, including
Terminator 2, have not been enough to keep it from the brink of bankruptcy,
said it had severe liquidity problems because of its continuing inability to
draw under its bank credit facilities, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The company's wholly-owned television subsidiary also confirmed it was
discussing the sale of some US television rights to its film library with
Spelling Entertainment for about Dollars 69m.
The terms of the deal with Spelling would be similar to an earlier
agreement, which expired this summer without completion. Spelling would buy
some US distribution rights to more than 150 films, including the
recently-released Basic Instinct and Terminator 2.

MCI Communications, the second-largest long-distance telephone carrier in
the US, reported second-quarter net earnings of Dollars 141m, or 53 cents a
share, up from Dollars 134m, or 51 cents, in the same period last year,
writes Martin Dickson.
Revenues rose 10.7 per cent, from Dollars 2.35bn to Dollars 2.61n, while the
company said traffic had grown by 14.6 per cent, nearly double the industry
average.
MCI, locked in a battle for market share with American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
and Sprint, said the figures reflected 'major wins in large accounts,
continued success in residential services and strong international growth
across all markets'.
